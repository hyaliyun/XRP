Dedicated to basketball, the network features exhibition, regular season and playoff game broadcasts from the NBA and related professional basketball leagues, as well as NBA-related content including analysis programs, specials and documentaries. The network is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. The network also serves as the national broadcaster of the NBA G League and WNBA games. NBA TV is the oldest subscription network in North America to be owned or controlled by a professional sports league, having launched on March 17, 1999. As of January 2016, NBA TV is available to approximately 53.8 million pay television households in America. The highest measured audience was a Golden State Warriors vs San Antonio Spurs regular season game on April 10, 2016 with an average 2.6 million viewers. Warriors‚Äô 72nd win sets records for NBA TV, CSN Bay Area ‚Äì Sports Media Watch, April 11, 2016 History The network launched on March 17, 1999 as nba.com TV; the channel, which was renamed NBA TV on February 11, 2003, originally operated from studio facilities housed at NBA Entertainment in Secaucus, New Jersey. The network signed a multi-year carriage agreement with three of the U.S.'s five largest cable providers, Cox Communications, Cablevision and Time Warner Cable, on June 28, 2003; this expanded the network's reach to 45 million pay television households in the U.S., in addition to distribution in 30 countries worldwide. After Time Warner shut down the sports news network CNN/SI in 2002, many cable providers replaced that network with NBA TV. The network mainly launched with two purposes; to serve as a barker channel for the league's out-of-market sports package NBA League Pass, along with featuring statistical and scoring information which was more easily accessible in the pre-broadband age, and it featured mainly archival content from the NBA Entertainment archives in its upper pane to fill programming time. As time went on, the network added more programming, including international basketball leagues and programming from FIBA usually unseen in the American market. The programming mix and channel format changed around the same time of the CNN/SI shutdown. On October 8, 2007, it was reported that the National Basketball Association would transfer the channel's operations to Time Warner's Turner Sports division (operated by the company's Turner Broadcasting System subsidiary). Turner took over the channel's operations on October 28, 2008, and began using the same announcers and analysts used on TNT's NBA telecasts. Analysis and news programming also received an upgrade, with production of the programs being relocated to Studio B at Turner Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, located adjacent to Studio J, where TNT's post-game program Inside the NBA is broadcast. Carriage agreements On April 16, 2009, DirecTV announced that it had reached a carriage agreement with the NBA to continue carrying NBA TV, moving it (and out-of-market sports package NBA League Pass) from the satellite provider's Sports Pack add-on tier to its lower-priced Choice Xtra base package on October 1, 2009. DirecTV believed the move will make the channel available to an additional eight million subscribers.NBA TV scores multiyear distribution deal with DirecTV ‚Äì Pact gives network berth on DBS leader's choice xtra package Multichannel News April 16, 2009 On June 4, 2009, Comcast announced that it had reached an agreement with the NBA to move the channel from the cable provider's Sports Entertainment Package to its basic level Digital Classic package, by the start of the 2009‚Äì10 NBA season.

NBA TV is available to Charter households where available as of February 2017, if a customer switches to the new 'Spectrum' billing plan which united Charter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks under the Spectrum branding (this is all likely unrelated to Charter's inherited naming rights of the Charlotte Hornets' home arena, the Spectrum Center). Programming NBA TV offers news programs devoted to basketball daily, in addition to programs showcasing the lives of individual basketball players, documentaries focusing on a particular NBA team during the season and archived broadcasts of well- known games. NBA TV carries at least 90 regular season games per season, which typically air four days a week during the NBA season (mainly on Mondays, Tuesdays and Saturdays, although occasional Wednesday, Friday and Sunday games may air in the event that ESPN does not hold rights to coverage on those nights), as well as some first-round playoff games. It also carries its own coverage of the NBA Draft. Live games on NBA TV are subject to local blackout restrictions, since NBA TV (despite being owned by the league) does not hold the exclusive broadcast rights to any of its games. Games carried by NBA TV are also carried by each team's local rights holder, either a regional sports network or a broadcast television station. Beginning with the 2012‚Äì13 season, the score box displayed during NBA TV's game coverage (which was seen on the lower-left hand corner of the screen) changed to a banner format oriented horizontally across the screen. However, the network does not use timeout or bonus indicators like that seen on the score graphics used on ESPN and TNT. The network also shows international games, typically on Saturday evenings, with special emphasis on the Euroleague and the Maccabi Tel Aviv team from Israel. In April 2005, NBA TV televised the Chinese Basketball Association finals for the first time. The channel's flagship program is NBA Gametime Live, a program focusing on news headlines within the NBA and related leagues (including the WNBA and G League), highlights and look-ins at games currently in progress presented by a host and studio analysts. The show airs live six days a week, deferring any TNT game nights outside the playoffs to repeating that evening's edition of Inside the NBA. An edited 90-minute version of the broadcast is repeated during the overnight and early morning hours. On October 11, 2017, it was announced that the Players Only franchise, which made its debut last season on TNT, will show live games on NBA TV, starting October 24, 2017 and every Tuesday after that, for the first half of the 2017‚Äì18 season before transitioning to TNT for the remainder of the regular season starting January 23, 2018. After the cancellation of Players Only in 2019, Tuesday (first half) and Monday (second half) night games on NBA TV were rebranded as NBA TV Center Court, with Brian Anderson handling the Tuesday night games and Spero Dedes the Monday night games. They are joined alongside Greg Anthony and Dennis Scott. =List of programs broadcast by NBA TV= * 10 Before Tip * 3DTV * Beyond The Paint * Courtside Cinema * Game Of The Day * Hardwood Classics * High Tops: Plays of the Month * Inside the NBA (encore telecasts within 12 hours of original airing on TNT) * NBA Action * NBA CrunchTime ‚Äì focuses on live NBA games till the buzzer, includes CrunchTime Alert, similar to NBA Scores * NBA Gametime Live * NBA Gametime Live Specials (e.g. mock draft, free agent updates, season previews, trade deadline updates, playoff previews) * NBA Inside Stuff * NBA TV Marquee Matchup * NBA TV Originals * Open Court * Playoff Playback * Shaqtin' a Fool * The Starters High definition NBA TV HD is a 1080i high definition simulcast feed of NBA TV that is available on most providers.

NBA TV International shows one or two live regular season games per day, with the delayed coverage of selected playoffs that not broadcast live by NBATV, all conference semis, finals and the Finals, as well as All-Star live games and contests and most nationally televised U.S. games (such as those seen on ABC, TNT, ESPN and US feed of NBA TV); the rights to those games are instead sold to domestic television networks in each territory. As of 2018, NBA TV International can be seen in 40 countries via the following partners: * Sky Italia * DirecTV (South America) * Canalsat (France) * TV8 until 2017; Saran Holding since 2017 (Turkey) * NTV Plus (Russia) * OTE TV (Greece) * Cablevisi√≥n (Argentina) * NOS until 2015; MEO since February 2017 (Portugal) * First Media and Big TV until 2018; Nexmedia February 2017 until 2019; Vidio, and Indihome (UseeTV) since 2017 (Indonesia) * TrueVisions (Thailand) * StarTimes (2013-2016); Kwes√© Sports (2017-2019) (Sub-Saharan Africa) * Mts TV (Serbia) * BT 2009‚Äì2018; Sky UK and Ireland 2019-2022 NBA TV Canada, a Canadian version of the channel, carries some of the same game broadcasts as the flagship U.S. service, ESPN, and TNT instead of the secondary game package found on NBA TV International. In October 2010, NBA Premium TV was launched in the Philippines. It is a redirect broadcast of NBA TV and airs locally televised and nationally televised games in the United States. It went defunct in October 2019. In February 2012, NBA TV International was made available on NBA.TV as an internet subscription channel outside the United States. On beIN Channels Network in the Arab World, NBA TV itself is not available. However, beIN Sports NBA is a separate channel in HD which airs several of the same games broadcast on NBA TV. On July 31, 2020, the Philippine version of the channel, NBA TV Philippines was launched. Past playoff broadcast criticism NBA TV was criticized in the past for its first-round playoff coverage merely passing down the broadcast of a game from a regional sports network for national broadcast, amplifying the chosen team's broadcast and bias for said team to a national level. Beginning with the 2011‚Äì12 playoffs, NBA TV began to produce a full and neutral national broadcast for those games.

Her tomb, according to this teaching, was found empty on the third day. Roman Catholic teaching holds that Mary was \\"assumed\\" into heaven in bodily form, the Assumption; the question of whether or not Mary actually underwent physical death remains open in the Catholic view. On 25 June 1997 Pope John Paul II said that Mary experienced natural death prior to her assumption into Heaven.Pope John Paul II General audience, Wednesday, 25 June 1997 A narrative known as the Euthymiaca Historia (written probably by Cyril of Scythopolis in the 5th century) relates how the Emperor Marcian and his wife, Pulcheria, requested the relics of the Virgin Mary from Juvenal, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, while he was attending the Council of Chalcedon (451). According to the account, Juvenal replied that, on the third day after her burial, Mary's tomb was discovered to be empty, only her shroud being preserved in the church of Gethsemane. In 452 the shroud was sent to Constantinople, where it was kept in the Church of Our Lady of Blachernae (Panagia Blacherniotissa).Catholic Encyclopedia, Tomb of the Blessed Virgin Mary According to other traditions, it was the Cincture of the Virgin Mary which was left behind in the tomb, or dropped by her during Assumption. Archaeology In 1972, Bellarmino Bagatti, a Franciscan friar and archaeologist, excavated the site and found evidence of an ancient cemetery dating to the 1st century; his findings have not yet been subject to peer review by the wider archaeological community, and the validity of his dating has not been fully assessed. Bagatti interpreted the remains to indicate that the cemetery's initial structure consisted of three chambers (the actual tomb being the inner chamber of the whole complex), was adjudged in accordance with the customs of that period. Later, the tomb interpreted by the local Christians to be that of Mary's was isolated from the rest of the necropolis, by cutting the surrounding rock face away from it. An edicule was built on the tomb.Alviero Niccacci, \\"Archaeology, New Testament, and Early Christianity\\" , Studium Biblicum Franciscanum, Faculty of Biblical Sciences and Archaeology of the Pontifical University Antonianum in Rome A small upper church on an octagonal footing was built by Patriarch Juvenal (during Marcian's rule) over the location in the 5th century; this was destroyed in the Persian invasion of 614. During the following centuries the church was destroyed and rebuilt many times, but the crypt was left untouched, as for Muslims it is the burial place of the mother of prophet Isa (Jesus). It was rebuilt then in 1130 by the Crusaders, who installed a walled Benedictine monastery, the Abbey of St. Mary of the Valley of Jehoshaphat; the church is sometimes mentioned as the Shrine of Our Lady of Josaphat. The monastic complex included early Gothic columns, red-on-green frescoes, and three towers for protection. The staircase and entrance were also part of the Crusaders' church. This church was destroyed by Saladin in 1187, but the crypt was still respected; all that was left was the south entrance and staircase, the masonry of the upper church being used to build the walls of Jerusalem. In the second half of the 14th century Franciscan friars rebuilt the church once more. The Greek Orthodox clergy launched a Palm Sunday takeover of various Holy Land sites, including this one, in 1757 and expelled the Franciscans. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre:A Work in Progress The Ottomans supported this \\"status quo\\" in the courts. Tomb of Mary Since then, the tomb has been owned by the Greek Orthodox Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church of Jerusalem, while the grotto of Gethsemane remained in the possession of the Franciscans.

On the right side of the staircase (towards the east) there is the chapel of Mary's parents, Joachim and Anne, initially built to hold the tomb of Queen Melisende of Jerusalem, the daughter of Baldwin II, whose sarcophagus has been removed from there by the Greek Orthodox. On the left (towards the west) there is the chapel of Saint Joseph, Mary's husband, initially built as the tomb of two other female relatives of Baldwin II.Murphy-O'Connor, 2008, p. 149 On the eastern side of the church there is the chapel of Mary's tomb. Altars of the Greeks and Armenians also own the east apse. A niche south of the tomb is a mihrab indicating the direction of Mecca, installed when Muslims had joint rights to the church. Currently the Muslims have no more ownership rights to this site. On the western side there is a Syriac altar. The Armenian Patriarchate Armenian Apostolic Church of Jerusalem and Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem are in possession of the shrine. The Syriacs, the Copts, and the Ethiopians have minor rights. Authenticity A legend, which was first mentioned by Epiphanius of Salamis in the 4th century AD, purported that Mary may have spent the last years of her life in Ephesus, Turkey. The Ephesians derived it from John's presence in the city, and Jesus‚Äô instructions to John to take care of Mary after his death. Epiphanius, however, pointed out that although the Bible mentions John leaving for Asia, it makes no mention of Mary going with him.Vasiliki Limberis, 'The Council of Ephesos: The Demise of the See of Ephesos and the Rise of the Cult of the Theotokos' in Helmut Koester, Ephesos: Metropolis of Asia (2004), 327. The Eastern Orthodox Church tradition believes that Virgin Mary lived in the vicinity of Ephesus, at Sel√ßuk, where there is a place currently known as the House of the Virgin Mary and venerated by Catholics and Muslims, but argues that she only stayed there for a few years, even though there are accounts of her spending nine years until her death. Although no information about the end of Mary's life or her burial are provided in the New Testament accounts, and many Christians believe that none exist in early apocrypha, some apocryphon are offered as supporting Mary's death (or other final fate). The Book of John about the Dormition of Mary, written in either the 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 7th century,Roberts, 1886, p. 587: \\"In two MMS. the author is said to be James the Lord's brother; in one, John Archbishop of Thessalonica, who lived in the seventh century.\\"Herbermann, 1901, p. 774: \\"the 'Joannis liber de Dormitione Marie' (third to fourth century), and the treatise 'De transitu B.M. Virginis' (fourth century) place her tomb at Gethsemane\\" places her tomb in Gethsemene, as does the 4th century Treatise about the passing of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The pilgrim Antoninus of Piacenza, writing of travels in 560-570 CE, mentions in that valley was \\"the basilica of the Blessed Mary, which they say was her house; in which is shown a sepulchre, from which they say that the Blessed Mary was taken up into heaven.\\"Antoninus of Piacenza, 1890, p. 14 Later, Saints Epiphanius of Salamis, Gregory of Tours, Isidore of Seville, Modest, Sophronius of Jerusalem, German of Constantinople, Andrew of Crete, and John of Damascus talk about the tomb being in Jerusalem, and bear witness that this tradition was accepted by all the Churches of East and West. Other claims Turkmen Keraites believe, according to a Nestorian tradition that another tomb of the Virgin Mary is located in Mary, Turkmenistan a town originally named Mari. Other claims are that Jesus, after surviving the crucifixion, travelled to India along with the Virgin Mary where they remained until the end of their lives.Jesus in Kashmir, The Lost Tomb-pp 163-182-Suzanne Olsson (2019) The Ahmadiyya movement believe that Mary was buried in the town of Murree, Pakistan and her tomb is presently located in the shrine Mai Mari da Ashtan. The authenticity of these claims is not yet academically established and has not undergone any scholastic or academic research, nor canonical endorsement from the Holy See, nor anyone else. Another tradition exists among the Christians of Nineveh in northern Iraq, that the tomb of Mary is located near Erbil, linking the site to the direction of tilt of the former Great Mosque of al-Nuri minaret in Mosul.Geary, 1878, p. 88 File:Tomb of the Virgin Mary.

It is situated a short distance from Ouston and Beamish, near the border with Tyne and Wear. The parish population taken at the 2011 census was 3,630. Urpeth started its life as a coal mining area with multiple seams of coal being mined from various locations around the current housing estate. Urpeth Colliery was owned by the Birtley Iron Company and during its heyday employed 300 men and boys. The on site coke ovens produced up to 470 tons of coke each day. Geographically Urpeth is situated to the west of Ouston and is surrounded by fields and rolling hills. Standing in Urpeth's only play park, one cannot see Ouston as there is a hill which blocks the view. This hill was formed from the coal spoils from both the Ouston and Urpeth collieries. The hill provides local children with an area for sledging during winter and dog walkers throughout the year. There are currently two main businesses run within Urpeth which is the \\"Spar\\" Newsagents and The Cherry Tree pub. Urpeth was once host to a controversial landfill site to the south west of its main location. The site was used for the disposal of low level radioactive waste along with three other sites at Kibblesworth, Ryton and Cowpen Bewley. However, since the late 1990s the site was closed and a methane burner sits on the site.

Moore, Robert E. Gerner, and H. Addison Franklin in 1966 at Roswell Park Memorial Institute, from where it derives its name. A modification of McCoy‚Ä≤s 5A medium (or RPMI 1630), it was originally formulated to support lymphoblastoid cells in suspension cultures, but can also support a wide variety of adherent cells. It has traditionally been used for growth of human lymphocytes. This medium contains a great deal of phosphate and is formulated for use in a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere. RPMI 1640 has traditionally been used for the serum-free expansion of human lymphoid cells. RPMI 1640 uses a bicarbonate buffering system and differs from most mammalian cell culture media in its typical pH 8 formulation. Properly supplemented with serum or an adequate serum replacement, RPMI 1640 allows the cultivation of many cell types, especially human T/B-lymphocytes, bone marrow cells, and hybridoma cells. Composition One liter of RPMI 1640 contains: *Glucose (2 g) *pH indicator (phenol red, 5 mg) *Salts (6 g sodium chloride, 2 g sodium bicarbonate, 1.512 g disodium phosphate, 400 mg potassium chloride, 100 mg magnesium sulfate, and 100 mg calcium nitrate) *Amino acids (300 mg glutamine; 200 mg arginine; 50 mg each asparagine, cystine, leucine, and isoleucine; 40 mg lysine hydrochloride; 30 mg serine; 20 mg each aspartic acid, glutamic acid, hydroxyproline, proline, threonine, tyrosine, and valine; 15 mg each histidine, methionine, and phenylalanine; 10 mg glycine; 5 mg tryptophan; and 1 mg reduced glutathione) *Vitamins (35 mg i-inositol; 3 mg choline chloride; 1 mg each para-aminobenzoic acid, folic acid, nicotinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride, and thiamine hydrochloride; 0.25 mg calcium pantothenate; 0.2 mg each biotin and riboflavin; and 0.005 mg cyanocobalamin) References External links * http://www.bioind.com/RPMI1640 * http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/Area_of_Interest/Life_Science/Cell_Culture/Product_Lines/Classic_Media___Salts/RPMI_Media.html * http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/Products-and- Services/Applications/Cell-Culture/Mammalian-Cell- Culture/Classical_Media/RPMI.html Cell culture media ","title":"RPMI 1640"},{"id":"1385834","text":"The Rockefeller Drug Laws are the statutes dealing with the sale and possession of \\"narcotic\\" drugs in the New York State Penal Law. The laws are named after Nelson Rockefeller, who was the state's governor at the time the laws were adopted. Rockefeller had previously backed drug rehabilitation, job training and housing as strategies, having seen drugs as a social problem rather than a criminal one, but did an about-face during a period of mounting national anxiety about drug use and crime. Rockefeller, who pushed hard for the laws, was seen by some contemporary commentators as trying to build a \\"tough on crime\\" image in anticipation of a bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976. The bill was signed into law on May 8, 1973. Under the Rockefeller drug laws, the penalty for selling or more of heroin, morphine, \\"raw or prepared opium\\", cocaine, or cannabis or possessing or more of the same substances, was a minimum of 15 years to life in prison, and a maximum of 25 years to life in prison. The original legislation also mandated the same penalty for committing a violent crime while under the influence of the same drugs, but this provision was subsequently omitted from the bill and was not part of the legislation Rockefeller ultimately signed. The section of the laws applying to marijuana was repealed in 1977, under the Democratic Governor Hugh Carey. The adoption of the Rockefeller drug laws gave New York State the distinction of having the most severe laws of this kind in the entire United States‚Äîan approach soon imitated by the state of Michigan, which, in 1978, enacted a \\"650-Lifer Law\\", which called for life imprisonment, without the possibility of parole for the sale, manufacture, or possession of at least of cocaine or any Schedule I or Schedule II opiate.  Background  The laws were enacted at a time of mounting anxiety regarding drug addiction and crime, and arguments from some politicians that a draconian approach was needed. In 1971, President Richard Nixon declared in a White House briefing speech:Richard Nixon: \\"Remarks About an Intensified Program for Drug Abuse Prevention and Control\\", June 17, 1971. Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project. > America's public enemy No. 1 in the United States is drug abuse. In order to > fight and defeat this enemy, it is necessary to wage a new, all-out > offensive. However, according to a 2016 article in Harper's Magazine article, John Ehrlichman, who had been Nixon's domestic-policy adviser, told reporter Dan Baum in a 1994 interview: > The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two > enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? > We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, > but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks > with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those > communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their > meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know > we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did. (Predictably, the late Ehrlichman's children however, disputed the account.)  Criticism  Both the New York and Michigan statutes came under harsh criticism from both the political left and the political right. William F. Buckley, one of the most conservative public figures in America, was staunchly against it, as well as many in law enforcement, who saw inherent unfairness in placing the non-violent crime of drug trafficking on a par with murder. Economist Murray Rothbard called the laws \\"draconian: long jail sentences for heroin pushers and addicts. The Rockefeller program, which proved finally to be a fiasco, was the epitome of the belief in treating a social or medical problem with jail and the billy club.\\"Rothbard, Murray (1979-03-05) Nelson Rockefeller, R.I.P., LewRockwell.com The laws also drew intense opposition from civil rights advocates, who claimed that they were racist, as they were applied inordinately to African-Americans and, to a lesser extent, Latinos. In 2002, at age 46, Meile Rockefeller was arrested for protesting the Rockefeller drug laws. She was accompanied by her brother, Stuart Rockefeller, and was supported by other members of the family on the issue, including her grandfather's brother, Laurance Rockefeller.  Incarceration rates  Due to the implementation of the Rockefeller drug laws, incarceration rates were said to have risen since their inception in 1973, 150,000 New Yorkers being imprisoned for non-violent drug offenses. Part of the reason for the rising incarceration rates was due to how the Rockefeller drug laws may have imposed harsher penalties for non-violent drug offenses, but crimes related to drug use did not decrease. Throughout the 1980s this was only made worse with the imposing drug laws on dawning the newly highly popularized drug of crack- cocaine, which is said to have \\"caused the New York State prison population to triple.\\" As of 1973, the state's prison population was approximately at ten thousand, but with the help of the Rockefeller drug laws, by the year 2002 out of the approximately seventy thousand state inmates, \\"19,164 were incarcerated for drug offenses\\" which upon drug offenses alone had nearly doubled the state population of 1973. Even despite the steady drop in crime rates that took place in the 1990s, the effects of the Rockefeller Drug Laws were the most transparent where \\"high arrest rates and prison commitments for drug offenses continued to fill prison cells.\\" Another criticism of the Rockefeller drug laws has also been its distinct targeting of young minority males for as of the year 2000, black and Hispanic males made up over 90% of the population incarcerated by the Rockefeller Drug Laws.  Michigan moderation  Michigan's statute was reformed somewhat in 1998, with the mandatory life sentence being reduced to a 20-year minimum.  New York moderation in 2004 and 2009  On December 14, 2004, New York Governor George Pataki signed into law the Drug Law Reform Act (DLRA) (2004 N.Y. Laws Ch. 738 (effective January 13, 2005)), which replaced the indeterminate sentencing scheme of the Rockefeller Drug Laws with a determinate system. The DLRA also reduced the minimum penalty for conviction on the most serious (A-I felony) drug charge in New York from 15 years to life, to 8 years in prison, for an offender with no prior felonies. In addition, the weight thresholds for the two most serious possession offenses (A-I and A-II) were doubled (thus making them apply to fewer defendants), and those serving life sentences were permitted to apply for re-sentencing. Since 2004, the number of prisoners serving sentences for A-I narcotics felonies has been cut by more than half. In his first State of the State address in January 2009, New York Governor David Paterson was critical of the Rockefeller drug laws, stating, \\"I can't think of a criminal justice strategy that has been more unsuccessful than the Rockefeller drug laws.\\" In April 2009, the New York Penal Law and the New York Criminal Procedure Law were revised to remove the mandatory minimum sentences. Under the new law, judges now had the authority to sentence defendants convicted of drug offences on guilty plea to shorter sentences, probation or drug treatment - the last known as \\"Judicial Diversion\\". Prior to 2009, drug treatment was available at the discretion of prosecutors. The sentencing was made retroactive, which allowed over 1000 incarcerated defendants to apply for resentencing and possible release. New York City has been called the cannabis- arrest capital of the world,, with over 40,000 arrests in 2008. Despite New York's decriminalization of simple possession, New York City police arrest suspects for possession in public view, which remains a misdemeanor. During a Terry stop, officers may falsely suggest that a suspect should voluntarily reveal contraband to avoid arrest, then arrest the suspect if he reveals cannabis to public view. In 2008, the New York Civil Liberties Union criticized the crackdown for its cost and scope, its reliance on stop-and- frisks and police coercion to escalate simple possession into an arrestable offense, and the disproportionate number of young, black and Latino males arrested. Impoverished neighborhoods One main criticism of these drug laws were that they put young minority males and females behind bars for carrying small amounts of drugs on them. These laws were a part of the \\"war on drugs\\" era and were meant to go after drug king pins, however it started to target lower level people as a means of keeping the streets clean. Elaine Bartlett and her story told in the book Life on the Outside critically depicts the effects of the Rockefeller Drug Laws and its policy on drug dealers.

Inside the house, the rooms remain much as Shaw left them, and the garden and Shaw's writing hut can also be visited. The house is an Edwardian Arts and Crafts-influenced structure situated in the small village of Ayot St Lawrence, in Hertfordshire, England. It is 6 miles from Welwyn Garden City and 5 miles from Harpenden. Built as the new rectory for the village during 1902, the house was the home of playwright George Bernard Shaw from 1906 until his death in 1950. It was designed by local architects and local materials were used in its construction.Ayot St Lawrence, Hertfordshire - Shaw's Corner House of George Bernard Shaw The Astoft Collection of Buildings of England, 2006.

The sequel to Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now, it was developed by Torus Games and released in the United Kingdom on September 1, 2000, and on December 14 in North America.  Description  Driving around the first level, The Boulevard The title is a homage to the inspiration for the Carmageddon series, Death Race 2000. As with the other games in the series, one of the most controversial aspects was that pedestrians could be killed by immolation (being set on fire) or graphic collisions that could include dismemberment. In some countries, the human pedestrians were replaced with zombies - actually only changing the red blood to green slime - but patches were circulated on the internet that reverted the game to its original state. While still part of the game series' canon, the gameplay was not a significant advancement on the original, which resulted in poor sales for the game and blurred the chances of a 4th installment of the series. However, almost 12 years later, a long-awaited 4th installment of the series was announced on the official site, called Carmageddon: Reincarnation. During development of TDR 2000, SCi hired Tozzer.com to create an online comic based on the Carmageddon video game.Tozzer - the kid, the comic, the movies, the mayhem A Game Boy Color version of the game was also slated to be released however it was cancelled for unknown reasons. Expansion pack The Nosebleed Pack was the official expansion pack for TDR2000 adding new vehicles, environments, powerups and improved multiplayer modes with extra maps.

The term is often in contrast to abstract art: > Since the arrival of abstract art the term figurative has been used to refer > to any form of modern art that retains strong references to the real world. Painting and sculpture can therefore be divided into the categories of figurative, representational and abstract, although, strictly speaking, abstract art is derived (or abstracted) from a figurative or other natural source. However, \\"abstract\\" is sometimes used as a synonym for non- representational art and non-objective art, i.e. art which has no derivation from figures or objects. Figurative art is not synonymous with figure painting (art that represents the human figure), although human and animal figures are frequent subjects. Formal elements The formal elements, those aesthetic effects created by design, upon which figurative art is dependent, include line, shape, color, light and dark, mass, volume, texture, and perspective,Adams, Laurie Schneider, The Methodologies of Art, pages 17-19. Westview Press, 1996, although these elements of design could also play a role in creating other types of imagery‚Äîfor instance abstract, or non- representational or non-objective two-dimensional artwork. The difference is that in figurative art these elements are deployed to create an impression or illusion of form and space, and, usually, to create emphasis in the narrative portrayed. Evolution Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Le Bain Turc (The Turkish bath), 1862, oil on canvas, 108 √ó 110 cm, Louvre, Paris Figurative art is itself based upon a tacit understanding of abstracted shapes: the figure sculpture of Greek antiquity was not naturalistic, for its forms were idealized and geometric.Clark, Kenneth, The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form, pages 31-2. Princeton University Press, 1990. Ernst Gombrich referred to the strictures of this schematic imagery, the adherence to that which was already known, rather than that which is seen, as the \\"Egyptian method\\", an allusion to the memory-based clarity of imagery in Egyptian art.The Gombrich Archive: Press statement on The Story of Art Eventually idealization gave way to observation, and a figurative art which balanced ideal geometry with greater realism was seen in Classical sculpture by 480 B.C. The Greeks referred to the reliance on visual observation as mimesis. Until the time of the Impressionists, figurative art was characterized by attempts to reconcile these opposing principles. From the early Renaissance, Mannerism and the Baroque through 18th-, 19th- and 20th-century painting Figurative art has steadily broadened its parameters. An important landmark in the evolution of figurative art is the first known reclining nude in Western painting in Sleeping Venus (1510) by Giorgione. It introduced the female nude as subject and started a long line of famous paintings. Nicolas Poussin (1594‚Äì1665), a French painter in the classical style whose work predominantly features clarity, logic, and order, and favors line over color, served as an alternative to the more narrative Baroque style of the 17th century. He was a major inspiration for such classically oriented artists as Jacques-Louis David, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Paul C√©zanne. The rise of the Neoclassical art of Jacques-Louis David ultimately engendered the realistic reactions of Gustave Courbet and √âdouard Manet leading to the multi-faceted figurative art of the 20th century. In November, 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the oldest known figurative art painting, over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Sal√©h on the Indonesian island of Borneo.

It runs east of Regent Street past Carnaby Street towards Noel Street. Originally part of the Millfield estate south of Tyburn Road (now Oxford Street), the street was named after John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and was laid out around 1704. It was a fashionable address in the 18th century, but its character changed to commercial and retail use by the end of the 19th. Most of the street's original buildings have since been demolished. Great Marlborough Street has had an association with the law since the late-18th century; Marlborough Street Magistrates Court subsequently became one of the most important magistrates courts in London. The department store Liberty is on the corner of Great Marlborough Street with Regent Street and sports a Mock Tudor facade. Geography The road is about long. At its western end it joins Regent Street and runs east, crossing Kingly Street, Argyll Street, Carnaby Street, and Poland Street. At its eastern end, it becomes Noel Street. The nearest tube station is Oxford Circus to the northwest. No buses run along Great Marlborough Street but there are numerous services on Regent Street. History =16th ‚Äì 18th century = The Coach and Horses pub has been on Great Marlborough Street since the mid-18th century. In the 16th century, what is now Great Marlborough Street was land belonging to the Mercer's Company. It was surrendered to Henry VIII in 1536. The land was subsequently owned by local brewer Thomas Wilson. His son, Richard, inherited this in 1622 who sold it to William Maddox, who called the estate Millfield. In 1670, Maddox's son, Benjamin, let the land to James Kendrick for 72 years, who in turn sub-let what is now Great Marlborough Street to John Steele. The land remained undeveloped, with building focusing on Tyburn Road (now Oxford Street) to the north. The street began to be developed in the early 18th century, when Steele let five acres of land to Joseph Collens for property development. It was named after John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, commander of the English Army who won the Battle of Blenheim in 1704, shortly before construction started. Initially the street was a fashionable address; in 1714, John Macky said it \\"surpasses anything that is called a street\\" and praised its architecture. A 1734 report agreed it was popular but added \\"the buildings on each side being trifling and inconsiderable, and the vista ended neither way with any thing great or extraordinary\\". Out of one hundred peers summoned before the King in 1716, five lived in Great Marlborough Street. For a time, Thomas Onslow, 2nd Baron Onslow owned No. 11 while Richard Lumley, 1st Earl of Scarbrough at No. 12\\\\. For a time in the 18th century, the street was the main London residence of Lord Nelson. No. 13 was formed of two separate houses, both leased by John Richmond in 1710 and subsequently joined as a single property. It was bought by Lord Charles Cavendish in 1740 and later occupied by his son, the scientist Henry Cavendish. Sir John Cust, 3rd Baronet lived at No. 14 from 1754‚Äì62. The Byron family were listed as ratepayers of No. 15 during the early 18th century. William Byron, 4th Baron Byron lived here from 1727 until his death in 1736; his widow remained there until 1740. The Baron's son, William Byron, 5th Baron Byron lived here from 1745‚Äì74. The Scottish sculptor Thomas Campbell worked here from 1833‚Äì1843, also taking over the neighbouring No. 16. Sir Lambert Blackwell, 1st Baronet bought No. 16 in September 1709 and stayed there until his death in 1727. His son, Sir Charles Blackwell, 2nd Baronet subsequently lived in the house until he died in 1741. Mary Lepell, maid of honour to Caroline, Princess of Wales (and future wife of John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey) lived in part of a house which is now part of No. 34 from around 1716‚Äì1724. Sir John Cust, 3rd Baronet, Speaker of the House of Commons lives in No. 41 (now No. 46) from 1747‚Äì52. The first floor of the property was later occupied by the painter Benjamin Haydon from 1808‚Äì17; Gilbert Stuart Newton is believed to have taken over his lodgings. The French instrument builder S√©bastien √ârard moved into No. 18 in 1794. He stayed there until his death in 1831, after which his nephew, Pierre Erard took ownership of it and the adjoining No. 18, and rebuilt the two properties to have a uniform facade. The Pantheon was based at the far eastern end of Great Marlborough Street. It was built on what had previously been gardens in 1772, becoming a popular place of entertainment during the late 18th century. The building burned down in 1792 and was rebuilt; it ceased to be an entertainment venue in 1818. It was later used as a bazaar in the mid-19th century before being demolished in 1937. The site is now the main Oxford Street branch of Marks and Spencer which has a side entrance onto Great Marlborough Street. A number of pubs have been based on Great Marlborough Street for centuries. The Coach and Horses at No. 1 and the Marlborough Head at Nos. 37‚Äì38 were both established in the 1730s. However, most of the 18th century buildings on Great Marlborough Street were later demolished, which led to the decline of its reputation as a fashionable street. =19th century= During the 19th century, various professionals such as architects and scientists were living in Great Marlborough Street. Thomas Hardwick lived here between 1815‚Äì25, as did Charles Darwin between 1837‚Äì8. A police station was established at No. 21 Great Marlborough Street in 1793. This led to the establishment of Marlborough Street Magistrates Court at No. 20‚Äì21 in the early 19th century, which had become one of the most important magistrates courts in England by the end of the century. William Ewart Gladstone gave evidence in the court against a blackmailer who claimed Gladstone had frequented prostitutes in Leicester Square, while the Marquess of Queensbury's libel trial against Oscar Wilde took place here in 1895. The Church of St John the Baptist was built on the site of the former Nos. 49‚Äì50 in 1885, and was consecrated on 23 November. The building cost ¬£5,100 (now ¬£) and catered for services in the local parish that had previously been held in rooms or temporary buildings. The church covered a district between Oxford Street, Poland Street, Brewer Street, Bridle Lane, Carnaby Market and Argyll Street. The London College of Music were based at No. 47 Great Marlborough Street from 1896 to 1990. Although it is one of the few 18th century buildings to survive, significant alterations have taken place, including being extended to cover four storeys. Since the college relocated, the building has been occupied by the London College of Beauty Therapy, the largest publicly funded college of its kind. The street inspired the name of Philip Morris's Marlboro cigarettes. The original factory opened on the street in 1881. =20th ‚Äì 21st century= Arthur Lasenby Liberty built his eponymous department store in a Mock Tudor style. In the early 20th century, a number of prominent automobile companies had showrooms on Great Marlborough Street. De Dion-Bouton, the largest automobile manufacturer in the world at the time, opened a London showroom at No. 10 in 1919. Charles Jarrott & Letts, Ltd (concessionaires for de Dietrich; Oldsmobile and Napier cars) was based at No. 45. The department store Liberty is on the corner of Great Marlborough Street and Regent Street. The founder, Arthur Lasenby Liberty, was unable to expand or modernise the existing shop front due to Crown planning restrictions, so he bought numerous properties on Great Marlborough Street in 1925, and rebuilt them in a Mock Tudor design as an extension of the store. It was Grade II* listed in 1972. Palladium House was built on the corner of Great Marlborough Street and Argyll Street in 1928 by Raymond Hood and Gordon Jeeves. It featured an Art Deco design inspired by the Paris Exhibition of 1925 and was extended in 1935. It is now a Grade II listed building. Palladium House, now Ideal House, London The magistrates court continued to cover significant trials that were widely reported by the media. In 1963, Christine Keeler was tried here for attempting to obstruct the course of justice. In the late 1960s, a number of rock stars, including The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Brian Jones, stood trial on drugs offences at the magistrates court. Richards was tried here again in 1973 for possession of heroin and owning unlicensed firearms, but was only fined ¬£205 (now ¬£). John Lennon and Yoko Ono were tried for obscenity here in 1970. The building became Grade II listed in 1970. The courts closed in 1998, and are now the Courthouse Hotel. The European Headquarters of Sony Interactive Entertainment (PlayStation) is at No. 10 Great Marlborough Street. London Studios and Guerrilla Games also have London offices at this address. Creative consultants Collective UK, now a subdivision of Time Inc., have offices on Great Marlborough Street.

From 1795 it was considered a part of the Russian Empire, as part of the Volhynian Governorate. It later became part of the estate of General Felix Dzerzhinsky. The railway reached Sarny in 1885, which was the same year that Sarny was formally constituted as a city.

Sarny was one of a series of towns and cities designated as railway station locations at key area boundaries. These municipalities were distinguished by the extent to which they were associated with manufacturing and markets, including being points for the concentration of agricultural produce for export. Lumber manufacturing also became an important and growing industry in Sarny, given that it was surrounded by forests. Sarny became a focal point of the settlement of Russian Jews, commencing as of 1903, following the pogroms at Kishinev, when Sarny was under Russian rule. Russian Interior Minister Vyacheslav von Plehve published a list of villages in which Jews were given \\"permission\\" to live, one of which was Sarny. General Dzerzhinsky travelled to St. Petersburg and obtained a permit to constitute Sarny as a \\"permitted town\\" for Jewish residents. By royal decree, every 100 villages were entitled to build a town in which Jews were permitted to live. Once he had obtained the permit, General Dzerzhinsky commenced to lease his land to Jewish residents, who were only permitted to lease, rather than to buy his land. In 1912, the first bank was established in Sarny‚Äîthe Sarny Mutual Credit & Loan‚Äîin response to the financing requirements of forest products and textile merchants. Prior to 1914, there was one private school and no public schools in Sarny. The private school was a Russian school with four grades, owned by management of the railroad and primarily for the benefit of the children of railroad employees. During this same period, there were no medical facilities in Sarny, and only one physician in the city. Sarny became a focal point for a large number of orphans fleeing the Petlura pogroms in Ukraine between 1918 and 1920. The city was annexed to Poland, following the Polish-Soviet War of 1919‚Äì1921. Due to the city's proximity to the Russian border, it became a Polish military centre following the Polish-Soviet War.

Sarny also developed close economic ties with the metropolitan centres of Poland, such as Warsaw and Lodz. In Poland, it was the seat of a Sarny county (powiat), firstly in Polesie Voivodeship, then, since 1930 - in Wo≈Çy≈Ñ Voivodeship. During this period, four hotels were constructed around the railway station, serving the needs of lumber merchants, in particular. In addition, Sarny had a ten-person police force, a functioning courthouse with permanent judge and secretary, a post office and, what was particularly important for the time, a government store selling hard liquor.

Despite Sarny being a county seat in Poland and under Polish legislative rule, the dominant social influence at the time was Ukrainian, including Ukrainian nationalist sentiments. In the 1930s, Polish military authorities constructed a number of fortifications in the area of Sarny, known as the Sarny Fortified Area (Sarnenski Rejon Umocniony), along the Sluch river. =1939‚Äì1944; Sarny Massacre I (1939), Sarny Massacre II (1942), Volhynian Genocide (1943)= In 1939, Sarny was occupied by Russian forces following the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact and the Soviet invasion of Poland.

At the time, Sarny had a Jewish population of approximately 5,000 persons. While Russian troops retreated, Ukrainian nationalists did not retreat with the Russian forces, but instead saw an opportunity to support the independence of Ukraine through alliances with the Nazis. Subsequent to the German occupation, the Nazis commandeered Jews of Sarny as forced labour.

This image shows the dangerous and rugged conditions the miners face, including toxic smoke and high drops, as well as their lack of protective equipment. The pipes over which they are standing serve to guide sulfur vapors and condense them, thereby facilitating production. The Ijen volcano complex is a group of composite volcanoes located on the border between Banyuwangi Regency and Bondowoso Regency of East Java, Indonesia. It is inside an eponymous larger caldera Ijen, which is about wide. The Gunung Merapi stratovolcano is the highest point of that complex. The name \\"Gunung Merapi\\" means 'mountain of fire' in the Indonesian language; Mount Merapi in central Java and Marapi in Sumatra have the same etymology. West of Gunung Merapi is the Ijen volcano, which has a turquoise-coloured acidic crater lake. The lake is the site of a labour-intensive sulfur mining operation, in which sulfur-laden baskets are carried by hand from the crater floor. The work is paid well considering the cost of living in the area, but is very onerous. Workers earn around Rp 50,000‚Äì75,000 ($5.50‚Äì$8.30) per day and once out of the crater, still need to carry their loads of sulfur chunks about three kilometers to the nearby Paltuding Valley to get paid. Many other post-caldera cones and craters are located within the caldera or along its rim. The largest concentration of post-caldera cones run east‚Äìwest across the southern side of the caldera. The active crater at Kawah Ijen has a diameter of and a surface area of . It is deep and has a volume of . The lake is recognised as the largest highly acidic crater lake in the world. It is also a source for the river Banyupahit, resulting in highly acidic and metal-enriched river water which has a significant detrimental effect on the downstream river ecosystem. On July 14‚Äì15, 2008, explorer George Kourounis took a small rubber boat out onto the acid lake to measure its acidity. The pH of the water in the lake's edges was measured to be 0.5 and in the middle of the lake 0.13 due to a high concentration of sulfuric acid.Boating on acid Blue fire crater Since National Geographic mentioned the electric-blue flame of Ijen, tourist numbers have increased. The phenomenon has occurred for a long time, but beforehand there was no midnight hiking. A two-hour hike is required to reach the rim of the crater, followed by a 45-minute hike down to the bank of the crater. The blue fire is ignited sulfuric gas, which emerges from cracks at temperatures up to . The flames can be up to high; some of the gas condenses to liquid and is still ignited. It is the largest blue flame area in the world and local people refer to it as Api Biru (Blue Fire). The other location at which the blue fire can be seen is in Dallol mountain, Ethiopia.  Sulfur mining at Ijen  An active vent at the edge of the lake is a source of elemental sulfur, and supports a mining operation. Escaping volcanic gases are channeled through a network of ceramic pipes, resulting in condensation of molten sulfur. The sulfur, which is deep red in colour when molten, pours slowly from the ends of these pipes and pools on the ground, turning bright yellow as it cools. The miners break the cooled material into large pieces and carry it away in baskets. Miners carry loads ranging from , up to the crater rim, with a gradient of 45 to 60 degrees and then down the mountain for weighing. Most miners make this journey twice a day. A nearby sulfur refinery pays the miners by the weight of sulfur transported; as of September 2010, the typical daily earnings were equivalent to approximately $13 US. The miners often receive insufficient protection while working around the volcano and complain of numerous respiratory afflictions. There are 200 miners, who extract 14 tons per day ‚Äì about 20% of the continuous daily deposit. Media Ijen and its sulfur mining was featured in the 1991 IMAX film Ring of Fire, and as a topic on the 5th episode of the BBC television documentary Human Planet.

He is known for his 1591 publication of balletti for five voices. Career Gastoldi was born at Caravaggio, Lombardy. In 1592 he succeeded Giaches de Wert as choirmaster at Santa Barbara's, Mantua, and served until 1605 under the Dukes Guglielmo and Vincenzo Gonzaga. According to Filippo Lomazzo, Gastoldi became choirmaster at the Duomo, Milan, afterwards, but other considerations seem to make this point doubtful. Works Gastoldi composed several books of madrigals, a variety of sacred vocal music, and a few instrumental works. Particularly noteworthy among his secular vocal works is his Quarto libro de' madrigali a cinque voci (1602), which consists almost entirely of settings of texts from Battista Guarini's hugely popular \\"pastoral tragicomedy\\" Il pastor fido (The Faithful Shepherd). According to Gastoldi himself, at least one of the pieces from this collection was included in a Mantuan court performance of the play in November 1598, which was staged as part of the festivities accompanying a visit of the queen of Spain. =Balletti= His two sets of balletti, a strophic vocal dance, however, are the most prominent and influential. These were written for five voices, and contained passages of nonsense syllables (e.g. \\"fa la la\\") which seemed to personify a type of lover and love-making. As a whole, Gastoldi's balletti were a musical commedia dell'arte, and included the following compositions: Contento (The Lucky One), Premiato (The Winner), L'Inamorato (The Suitor), Piacere (Pleasure), La Bellezza (Beauty), Gloria d'Amore (Praise of Love), L'Acceso (The Ardent), Caccia d'Amore (Love-Chase), Il Martellato (The Disdained), Il Bell‚Äôhumore (The Good Fellow), Amor Vittorioso (Love Victorious), and Speme Amorosa (Amorous Hope). His balleti music basically had a simple chordal texture, fast declamation and rhythmic accents at the expense of contrapuntal display, as is to be expected from their close relationship to dance music. Gastoldi's Balleti a Cinque Voci was published in Venice in 1591, and immediately became a \\"best seller.\\" Within a short time, the collection was reprinted ten times, not only by their original publisher but also in other countries as well. Composers like Vecchi, Banchieri, Hassler, and Morley were greatly captivated by this musical creation (compare Morley's ballett Now is the Month of Maying for a clear example of Gastoldi's influence). It is certain that many frottole, villancicos, and chansons francaises were intimately related to dance, but it seems true that Gastoldi was the first scholarly author, presumably since the thirteenth century, to compose songs for dancing which were modeled on instrumental patterns, and were perfectly apt for instrumental performance alone. The title page of the balletti bestows the title \\"Maestro di Cappella del Serenissimo Signor Duca di Mantova\\" to Gastoldi. However, this has no slightest intention of masking sophistication behind the spontaneous naivete of Gastoldi's works, because the entire content is a collection of simplicity, healthy playfulness, communicative carefreeness, and gaiety. The common trait is, of course, the Fa-la refrain, (which incidentally became \\"lirum-lirum \\"in Gloria d‚Äôamore) with skipping rhythms, clear lines, and frank tonality. Gastoldi sought to vary his compositions from ballet to ballet by sometimes writing in triple time, in double or by the alternate use of major and minor. Otherwise, it cannot be said that he at all attempted a psychological differentiation between the several \\"characters\\" depicted. =Works in translation= Gastoldi's Italian works were enormously popular in the Netherlands in Dutch contrafacta.The\\" Balletti\\" of Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi and the Musical History of the Netherlands R Rasch - Tijdschrift van de Vereniging voor Nederlandse ‚Ä¶, 1974 \\"...

Career Shawcross was educated at St Aubyns Preparatory School, Rottingdean, Eton College and University College, Oxford. He attended St Martin's Art School to study sculpture after leaving Oxford, and worked as a journalist for The Sunday Times. In 1973, as a Congressional Fellow of the American Political Science Association, Shawcross served in Washington, D.C. on the staffs of Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Representative Les Aspin. Shawcross writes and lectures on issues of international policy, geopolitics, Southeast Asia and refugees, as well as the British royal family. He has written for a number of publications, including Time, Newsweek, International Herald Tribune, The Spectator, The Washington Post and Rolling Stone, in addition to writing numerous books. His books include highly regarded and ground-breaking studies of important and recent international topics: the Prague Spring, the Vietnam War, the Iranian Revolution, the Iraq War, foreign assistance, humanitarian intervention, and the United Nations. Two of them, Sideshow and The Quality of Mercy, were included on The New York Times Book Reviews annual lists of the roughly 15 top books of the year for 1979 and 1984, respectively. Since 2002, he has also written several books about the British royal family, including the official biography of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, published in 2009. He writes glowingly about the royal family, for example in an April 2020 piece about Queen Elizabeth II captioned \\"Thank God for the Queen\\": \\"One happy result of the horrible virus is that it has prompted the Queen to give us not one but two statements of her faith in this country and in God. Together they demonstrate vividly the exquisite, strong but light touch of our almost timeless monarch.\\" Shawcross was Chairman of ARTICLE 19, the international centre on censorship, from 1986 to 1996. He was a Member of the Council of the Disasters Emergency Committee from 1997 to 2002, and a board member of the International Crisis Group from 1995 to 2005. Shawcross was a member of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees's Informal Advisory Group from 1995 to 2000. From 1997 to 2003, he was a member of the BBC World Service Advisory Council. In 2008, he became a Patron of the Wiener Library, and in 2011 he joined the board of the Anglo-Israel Association and was appointed to the board of the Henry Jackson Society. Shawcross took up the Chairmanship of the Charity Commission for England and Wales on 1 October 2012, and served as chair until February 2018. His appointment to a second three-year term in 2015 was called \\"controversial\\" at the time, with some Labour Party members raising concerns about how it was handled. A January 2018 assessment of his tenure concluded that he \\"won praise from government but heavy criticism from within the charity sector.\\" In March 2019, he was named by the UK Foreign Secretary as Special Representative on UK victims of Qadhafi-sponsored IRA terrorism. In March 2020, he delivered his report to the Foreign Secretary but, controversially, it was not made public. Political views Shawcross's politics have been described as having moved to the right over the course of his life. His 1979 book on Cambodia, Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia, resulted in Shawcross's being \\"lauded by liberal intellectuals and America's East Coast elite.\\" The U.S. left continues to praise Shawcross's earlier work; for example, in September 2019, Sideshow was cited at length in an opinion piece in The Intercept defending Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. As an initial indicator of how his views were shifting, in his 1990 introduction to the revised edition of his 1970 biography of Alexander Dubƒçek, Shawcross wrote, \\"My own principal criticism [of his 1970 book] is that I did not realize adequately that the experiment of humane Communism, or Socialism with a Human Face, was impossible, perhaps even a contradiction in terms. . . . The last twenty years have shown nothing so much as the catastrophic nature of Communism everywhere. Wherever Communism has triumphed‚ÄîI think particularly of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos‚Äîits consequences have been utterly disastrous.\\" In 1992, he wrote an \\"admiring\\" biography of Rupert Murdoch. In 1994, about his 1970s journalism from Vietnam, in light of subsequent abuses by the governments of Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos, Shawcross wrote, \\"I think I concentrated too easily on the corruption and incompetence of the South Vietnamese and their American allies, was too ignorant of the inhuman Hanoi regime, and far too willing to believe that a victory by the Communists would provide a better future.\\" Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, he supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq. His 2003 selection by Buckingham Palace to write the authorized biography of the Queen Mother was described as drawing \\"Shawcross into the bosom of the monarchy in a way rarely enjoyed by any layman\\", and the resulting book led to him being described as a \\"royalist writer.\\" In November 2018 he appeared to walk back his 1979 criticism of Henry Kissinger in Sideshow; in an argument that Kissinger should be allowed to speak at New York University, Shawcross noted \\"regret\\" for the \\"tone\\" of his prior criticism of Kissinger, which he minimized as \\"a policy disagreement over Cambodia\\", as opposed to \\"a moral crusade\\", and he concluded that Kissinger \\"is an extraordinary man who deserves respect.\\" In November 2019 he took a position in support of Britain's exit from the European Union, on the basis of the E.U.'s problematic nature and approach, summarizing his position as \\"There are risks in proceeding with Brexit. But there are far greater risks in abandoning it.\\" The change over time in Shawcross's politics has been compared to the political shifts of his father Sir Hartley Shawcross, Paul Johnson, and Christopher Hitchens. While noting other speculative possible reasons for the shift, William Traub posited, \\"it's more instructive to consider the possibility that Shawcross has remained true to his principles, but that a morally driven foreign policy looks very different after 9/11 than it did before.\\" Selected Books =Dubcek (1970, revised 1990)= Shawcross's first published book was a biography of Alexander Dubƒçek, the leader of Czechoslovakia during the 1968 Prague Spring whose \\"socialism with a human face\\" briefly brought freedom into the Soviet Bloc. According to the introduction to the 1990 edition, the book's genesis was in Shawcross's travels to Czechoslovakia as a 22-year-old recent college graduate in 1968‚Äì69, when he witnessed the Prague Spring and its aftermath. In April 1969, as his first assignment, The Times sent Shawcross to Prague to report on Dubcek's deposition from power, which led him to decide \\"I would like to write a book about Dubcek\\", and to spend several months in Czechoslovakia researching it. The book concluded (grandiosely) that Dubcek \\"was quite convinced that he had discovered in 1968 that for which philosophers and philanthropists have for centuries searched‚Äîthe just society. He may have been right.\\" The New York Times Book Review, in December 1971, named Dubcek among the year's \\"noteworthy titles\\", describing it in a June 1971 capsule review as: \\"Written less than a year after Alexander Dubcek's resignation, this biography of the Czech leader by a London journalist is an authoritative, first‚Äêrate job.\\" Shawcross revised and reissued Dubcek in 1990 upon its subject's return to prominence and power during the Velvet Revolution, following two decades of rustication. =Crime and Compromise: Janos Kadar and the Politics of Hungary Since Revolution (1974)= Shawcross next wrote \\"a political study of Hungarian politician Janos Kadar\\" who, like Dubcek, \\"tried to negotiate with Communist dogmas to create more humane regimes.\\" In it, Shawcross argued that, following Kadar's 1956 betrayal of Hungarian President Imre Nagy, \\"Kadar worked to reunite Hungary and succeeded in making it one of the most advanced countries in the Warsaw Pact in both economic and democratic terms.\\" In his mostly-favorable review in The Washington Post, Robert Dean, a CIA analyst, wrote that \\"Shawcross has succeeded admirably in conveying a sense of the atmosphere which has come to prevail in the wake of the reform, and how a cautious reformist ethos and economic success have in turn shaped cultural life, social policies, and the attitudes of youth.\\" Dean thought that the book portrayed Kadar less well than it did Hungary: \\"One senses that Shawcross would have liked to have produced a biography of Kadar but was stymied by the incompleteness of information.\\" =Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia (1979)= Sideshow is, at least in the United States, Shawcross's best known and most controversial book. To write it, Shawcross interviewed over 300 people and reviewed thousands of U.S Government documents, some classified Top Secret, obtained using the Freedom of Information Act. Sideshow exposed the secret bombing of Cambodia conducted by U.S. President Nixon and his advisor Henry Kissinger, and argued that Nixon's and Kissinger's policy \\"led to the rise of the Khmer Rouge and the subsequent massacre of a third of Cambodia's population,\\" According to one summary, Sideshow \\"denounces the systematic destruction of Cambodia by the Nixon Administration as a consequence of the Vietnam War and for the sake of a mere strategic design. The study stresses how the decision to attack a neutral country was a patent violation of the American Constitution. As in his previous two books, Shawcross combines an interest in international policies with a private focus on the personal relationship between Nixon and Kissinger. The study argues that the President and his Secretary of State reproduced in their international relations the same pattern of falsehood that characterized their own personal association.\\" The book's penultimate, conclusory sentence‚Äî\\"Cambodia was not a mistake; it was a crime\\"‚Äîis frequently quoted; whenever Shawcross's lifetime of writing is reduced to one sentence, that's it. Sideshow received high praise and awards. The Pulitzer Prize jury recommended a special citation for it in the 1980 awards based on its \\"extraordinary qualities\\", although it was ineligible for the prize because its author was not American; the Pulitzer board declined that recommendation, however. The New York Times Book Review selected Sideshow among its top 17 \\"Editor's Choice\\" books of 1979, describing it as an \\"indictment\\" of Kissinger and Nixon. It won the George Polk Award in Journalism's Book Award for 1979. Columnist Anthony Lewis wrote in The New York Times, \\"I think it is the most interesting and the most important book on American foreign policy in many years. On more than foreign policy, really: on the American constitutional system. For it is a textbook ‚Äî a gripping, factual textbook ‚Äî on what can happen when the system is violated.\\" John Leonard of The New York Times wrote that in addition to being \\"meticulous[ly]\\" documented, \\"it has the sweep and the shadow of a spy novel as it portrays the surreal world of power, severed from morality, paranoid, feeding on itself.\\" Kissinger, who declined Shawcross's interview requests when the book was being written, vociferously denounced Sideshow, as did American conservatives. In an angry letter to The Economist, Kissinger described the book as \\"obscene\\" and \\"absurd.\\" Observing that both Sideshow and Kissinger's memoir, White House Years, were included among The New York Times Book Reviews best books of 1979, Herbert Mitgang asked each author about the other's volume. Kissinger called Sideshow \\"a shoddy, outrageous work that is filled with inaccuracies,\\" adding, \\"And you can quote me.\\" Following the publication of Sideshow, Peter Rodman, an aide to Kissinger, concluded that Shawcross's work was \\"a fraud\\" and \\"a compendium of errors, sleight of hand, and egregious selectivity\\", according to R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., who published Rodman's criticism in his conservative magazine, The American Spectator. Shawcross, in turn, described Rodman's critique as \\"a rotten piece of work\\" and wrote a response (\\"demonstrating the fallacies, if not the fraud, of almost all of Mr. Rodman's points\\"), which the American Spectator published, with Rodman's further reply. Shawcross included the entire exchange in later editions of Sideshow. Tyrrell proclaimed Sideshow the \\"worst book of the year\\" in the Washington Post, as did his magazine. Shawcross later became friends with Tyrrell and Rodman. In 2007, Shawcross and Rodman co-wrote a New York Times op-ed, referring to their past differences over Cambodia but jointly arguing against U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. When Rodman died in 2008, Shawcross was \\"much saddened\\", as he later wrote, and sent Tyrrell a note expressing his grief. And in 2011, The American Spectator ceremonially revoked its 1979 \\"worst book of the year\\" award, on grounds that subsequently \\"Shawcross has become increasingly sound\\" in his views, at a London lunch among Shawcross and Tyrrell. =The Quality of Mercy: Cambodia, Holocaust and Modern Conscience (1984)= The Quality of Mercy again addresses Cambodia, but as a critical assessment of the aid and relief efforts of governments, UN bodies, and international relief agencies following the suffering inflicted on that country by its Khmer Rouge government and by its neighbor, Vietnam. Shawcross's book portrays, in the words of Colin Campbell's New York Times review, \\"a humanitarian outpouring that was shot through with misrepresentations, incompetence, callousness and shirking of principle.\\" The book points out positives and negatives of each player, but overall, the United States, in particular the U.S. Embassy in Thailand and its Ambassador, Morton Abramowitz, \\"comes out looking pretty good. Vietnam appears to have been the main obstacle to the Cambodians' relief.\\" Though it has received less attention than others, The Quality of Mercy is, by some, the most highly regarded of Shawcross's books. To be sure, it has critics. The historian and Cambodia expert Ben Kiernan, who \\"was Shawcross's interpreter for several weeks\\" when he was researching the book, wrote a long, critical essay. The Australian journalist John Pilger‚Äîwho is criticized in The Quality of Mercy, and the two men have a continuing history of public disagreements‚Äîreportedly attacked Shawcross in a New Statesman review as a \\"born-again cold warrior.\\" But Ed Vulliamy, in The Guardian, called it \\"Shawcross's bravest, most complicated and astute work\\", commenting that \\"the little-known Quality of Mercy examined and challenged deficiencies in the international aid programme to Cambodia, which lavished assistance on the remnants of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, perpetuating the violence.\\" The editors of The New York Times Book Review included it among their fifteen \\"Editor's Choice\\" books, as the best books of 1984. Colin Campbell, in the New York Times, concluded, \\"This is a startling book and most of it is very persuasive.\\" He stated that on most counts, \\"Mr. Shawcross's subtlety and lack of sanctimony are remarkable.\\" He also considers it \\"noteworthy that a journalist who in the past attacked American policy so fiercely has, in this book, portrayed at least the United States Embassy in Bangkok as one of the best informed and most decently efficient actors in the refugee drama.\\" Human rights activist Aryeh Neier, reviewing The Quality of Mercy in the New York Times Book Review, similarly stated that \\"a reader cannot help but be impressed by his apparent fairness\\" and called it \\"a splendid book that will have a profound impact.\\" He concluded that The Quality of Mercy \\"may well be the best account we have of the politics of international charity.\\" The Quality of Mercy was republished in 1985 with an additional final chapter, \\"Report from Ethiopia‚ÄîMay 1985\\", describing the then-ongoing relief effort in response to the Ethiopian famine in light of the Cambodian experience. Shawcross drew a number of lamentable parallels, for example that \\"in Ethiopia as well as Cambodia, humanitarian aid was being used by a Communist regime to underwrite war.\\" The essay concluded, \\"In neither Cambodia nor Ethiopia did the ordinary people for whom the aid was delivered benefit from it to the extent which had been intended and which they deserved. Instead aid was being used to prolong rather than to end the disaster.\\" =The Shah's Last Ride (1988)= This book's US subtitle was \\"The Fate of an Ally;\\" its 1989 UK subtitle was \\"The Story of the Exile, Misadventures and Death of the Emperor.\\" The Shah's Last Ride is, in the words of its prologue, \\"the story of a journey, the Shah's forlorn journey into exile and death, and of various elements of his rule‚Äîhis relations with the British and Americans, his secret police, SAVAK, the CIA, oil, the arms trade. The tale of the fall and exile of the Shah is one which illustrates the nature of relationship between states and leaders. It is a story of loyalty and convenience.\\" It retraces the odyssey of the last Shah of Iran after being driven into exile by the Iranian Revolution, first to Egypt, and then in succession to Morocco, the Bahamas, Mexico, the United States, Panama, and finally back to Egypt, where he died. Shawcross traces his own interest in Iran to the 1960s: \\"Ardeshir Zahedi, the Shah's Ambassador to London, became a firm friend of my family then, and has remained so since.\\" As a further family connection, Shawcross's father \\"was once President of the Iran Society in Britain.\\" Many reviewers praised The Shah's Last Ride for the high quality of its narrative and storytelling, with praise such as \\"a compelling, evenhanded, artful book, more like a novel than a history;\\" Much of what criticism the book received arose from its narrow focus. One Middle East expert, Daniel Pipes, wrote that Shawcross \\"has done his best to eke out the details of this sad, small tale. But this reader concludes that he has pretty much wasted his time, and Shawcross himself seems to know it.\\" Another, Zalmay Khalilzad (later Republican-appointed U.S. Ambassador to, successively, Afghanistan, Iraq, and the United Nations), criticized the book for not highlighting the Carter administration's failures in its dealings with the Shah. A third Middle East expert, Fouad Ajami, criticized Shawcross for telling the Shah's story as a sympathetic (or at least pathetic) tale of \\"the woes of an ailing, old man, dying of cancer\\" rather than one of an oppressive dictator and his long, brutal reign. Ajami further criticized Shawcross's choice of sources from the Shah's circle, and his credulous attitude toward them. In a critique that may have foreshadowed Shawcross's later writing about another royal family, Ajami posited that Shawcross's sources, including the Shah's twin sister, Princess Ashraf, were able to work their royal charms to disarm his reportorial skepticism. =Murdoch (1992)= In a change from international affairs, Shawcross next wrote a biography of Rupert Murdoch. Its 1992 UK title was Rupert Murdoch: Ringmaster of the Information Circus; it was published in the US in 1993 as Murdoch: The Making of a Media Empire. New York Times reviewer Herbert Mitgang commented there was a \\"red flag\\" present: Shawcross had let Murdoch read a draft before publication, violating \\"an unwritten rule for the most esteemed American biographers.\\" The pundit Andrew Sullivan, in The New York Times Book Review, described Murdoch as \\"what a Murdoch paper would surely call a suck-up.\\" Despite the issues raised, Mitgang's review was generally positive, while Sullivan wrote that Shawcross, albeit \\"unwittingly\\", \\"achieved something very valuable\\", in \\"expos[ing] the banality of a highly sophisticated and successful businessman\\", and \\"plac[ing] the real issue behind the story of Mr. Murdoch's career‚Äîthe nature of a democratic culture‚Äîaway from the petty demonization of an entrepreneur and on the larger forces that have determined his fate.\\" The Economist made a similar point in a more straightforward way: \\"Although this is a fine, superbly-researched and vivid book on the Murdoch enigma, the enigma remains.\\" The 1992 publication of Murdoch raised a brief flurry in the literary world. The New Yorker, then edited by Tina Brown, published a short Talk of the Town piece by Francis Wheen, wondering how \\"could Willie Shawcross, who made his name in the seventies with Sideshow, an indignant expose of Henry Kissinger's destruction of Cambodia, become Murdoch's hagiographer?\\" David Cornwall, better known by his nom de plume John le Carr√©, wrote a responsive letter in defense of Shawcross, calling Wheen's essay \\"one of the ugliest pieces of partisan journalism that I have witnessed in a long life of writing.\\" Brown said she would only publish Cornwall's letter if he cut it to one paragraph, he released it to the press instead, and the contretemps drew much media attention. =Deliver Us From Evil: Peacekeepers, Warlords, and a World of Endless Conflict (2000)= Deliver Us From Evil overviews the work of the United Nations during the 1990s to ameliorate situations in many of the world's trouble spots of that decade, largely as seen through the eyes of Kofi Annan, whom Shawcross accompanied on his travels. Reviews were mixed to negative. Some meted out limited praise: \\"highly readable, if at times repetitive and scattershot,\\" \\"admirably fair in his judgments,\\" and \\"thoughtful but inconclusive\\" as well as \\"a useful reality check for all those well-meaning people who clamor for the United Nations to do something.\\" At the most negative end of the spectrum, a capsule review in The New Yorker concluded: \\"Shawcross's reporting here is often secondhand; his prose is dreary; and his thinking (which frequently takes refuge in anti-Americanism) is lazy. The result is an insult to the gravity of the issues he purports to address, and‚Äîworse‚Äîto the anguish of the world's politically endangered peoples.\\" Shawcross's optimistic attitude \\"as a booster for the UN\\" was criticized as unwarranted by reviewers from left and right, with all arguing the UN has a long record of failures. His identifying Cambodia as a UN success story drew particular quibbles, while several found fault with the book's analytical conclusions (or, more precisely, its lack thereof). Robert Kagan, reviewing it for Commentary, labelled Deliver Us From Evil \\"little more than an exercise in liberal handwringing.\\" The more balanced reviewers, witness New Zealand diplomat Terence O'Brien who was on the ground at UN Headquarters for large parts of Shawcross' tale during the ascendancy of Bill Clinton, paint it as excellent first-hand history and feel that it \\"is unlikely soon to be bettered\\", terming his book sharp and comprehensive. \\"Shawcross enjoys a reputation as a chronicler of the blemishes in modern international behaviour... The response of the so-called international community to the continuing rash of internal conflict is subjected to clinical appraisal\\" might have triggered some reviewers' esprit de corps so readers are well-advised to read and judge for themselves. =Allies (2003)= Like other Shawcross books, Allies was published under two different subtitles, in a 2003 hardback as \\"The U.S., Britain, and Europe in the Aftermath of the Iraq War\\", and in a 2005 paperback as \\"Why the West Had to Remove Saddam.\\" The book has been described as a polemic, rather than a work of journalism, with some commentators observing that, unlike other books by Shawcross, it has no footnotes. One critic wrote of Shawcross as \\"a vocal supporter of President George W. Bush's War on Terror and praises Tony Blair's interventionist policies in Iraq and Afghanistan, writing off criticism of the two leaders as hysterical.\\" Regarding Shawcross's position in Allies compared to his prior positions, especially in Sideshow, the reviewer in The New York Times asked \\"What's going on here?\\" while the conservative U.S. journals The National Review and The American Spectator were surprised and laudatory. The National Review wrote, \\"Shawcross has written an outstanding justification of the Anglo-American effort to drive Saddam Hussein from power. It is an exemplary piece of moral clarity and fine writing.\\" =Justice and the Enemy: Nuremberg, 9/11, and the Trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (2011)= Justice and the Enemy considered the George W. Bush administration's post-9/11 military commissions in light of the Nuremberg trials. In it, according to the law professor and former U.S. Justice Department official Jack Goldsmith, Shawcross \\"provides a deeply sympathetic account of how\\" the Bush administration resolved \\"difficult choices and trade-offs in deciding how to bring justice to the perpetrators of 9/11.\\" The Economists reviewer of Justice and the Enemy found the book lacking \\"original research on al-Qaeda\\", its Nuremberg comparisons unhelpful, and its author \\"keener to score points against all those who roundly condemn President George Bush's strategy\\" than to draw useful conclusions. Private life and honours Shawcross's father was the politician, lawyer, Chief British Prosecutor at Nuremberg and life peer Hartley Shawcross. His mother was Joan Winifred Mather, who died in a riding accident on the Sussex Downs in 1974. In 1970 he married the writer and art critic Marina Warner, and their son, Conrad, is an artist. The marriage ended in divorce in 1980. Shawcross married Michal Levin in 1981. Their daughter, Eleanor, was a member of the Council of Economic Advisers to George Osborne from 2008. She had previously worked on Boris Johnson's mayoral campaign. Eleanor is married to Simon Wolfson, Baron Wolfson, who is the son of David Wolfson, Baron Wolfson of Sunningdale, both of whom are Conservative life peers and who are the current and former Next chairmen. Shawcross and his third wife, Olga Polizzi, married in 1993. His stepdaughter is the hotelier and television presenter Alex Polizzi. He has lifelong ties to Cornwall where he is a keen campaigner in the preservation and protection of local Conservation Areas. His campaign succeeded in obtaining Grade II listing for St Mawes's historic and endangered sea wall. He was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 2011 New Year Honours.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 8, 1998. In the episode, a cult takes over Springfield, and the Simpson family become members. David Mirkin conceived the initial idea for the episode, Steve O'Donnell was the lead writer, and Steven Dean Moore directed. The writers drew on many groups to develop the Movementarians, but were principally influenced by Scientology, Heaven's Gate, the Unification Church (\\"Moonies\\"), the Rajneesh movement, and Peoples Temple. The show contains many references to popular culture, including the title reference to The Joy of Sex and a gag involving Rover from the television program The Prisoner. \\"The Joy of Sect\\" was later analyzed from religious, philosophical, and psychological perspectives; books on The Simpsons compared the Movementarians to many of the same groups from which the writers had drawn influence. Both USA Today and The A.V. Club featured \\"The Joy of Sect\\" in lists of important episodes of The Simpsons. Plot At the airport, Bart and Homer meet recruiters for the new religious movement, Movementarianism. They invite Homer and many Springfield residents to watch an orientation film. The film explains that a mysterious man known as \\"The Leader\\" will guide Movementarians aboard a spaceship to the planet Blisstonia. The lengthy film brainwashes the attendees into worshipping The Leader. After Homer joins the cult, he moves his family to the Movementarian compound. Though defiant at first, all the Simpson children are converted to Movementarianism. Marge is the only family member to resist, and escapes from the heavily guarded compound. Outside, she finds Reverend Lovejoy, Ned Flanders, and Groundskeeper Willie, who have all resisted the Movementarians, and with their help, she tricks her family into leaving the compound with her. At the Flanders' home, Marge deprograms her kids by baiting them with fake hoverbikes and then works on Homer with a glass of beer. However, as a drop of beer lands on his tongue, he is recaptured by the Movementarians' lawyers. Back at the compound, Homer reveals to a crowd of Movementarians that he is no longer brainwashed and opens the doors of the Forbidden Barn to expose the cult as a fraud, but he and the crowd are surprised to find an actual spaceship. However, the crude spaceship disintegrates as it takes flight, revealing The Leader on a pedal-powered aircraft fleeing with everyone's money. He then crashes into Cletus Spuckler's front yard, where Cletus forces him to give over the money at gunpoint. The Simpsons return home, where Lisa remarks how great it is to be thinking for themselves again. The episode ends with the family watching Fox television and mechanically repeating after the announcer that they \\"are watching Fox\\". Production alt=A seated man wearing a cap smiles as he looks into the distance. His hands are crossed. The episode was the second and last episode written by Steve O'Donnell and was based on an idea from David Mirkin. Mirkin had been the show runner during seasons five and six, but had been brought back to run two episodes during the ninth season. He said he was attracted to the notion of parodying cults because they are \\"comical, interesting and twisted\\". He conceived the episode after hearing a radio show about the history of cults whilst driving home one night. The main group of writers that worked on the episode were Mirkin, O'Donnell, Jace Richdale, and Kevin Curran. The episode's title \\"The Joy of Sect\\" was pitched by Richdale. Steven Dean Moore directed the episode. Aspects of the Movementarians were inspired by different cults and religions, including Scientology, Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple, the Heaven's Gate group, the Unification Church, the Oneida Society, and Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.Mirkin, David. (2006). Commentary for \\"The Joy of Sect\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In particular, the leader driving through the fields in a Rolls Royce was partly inspired by the Bhagwans, and the notion of holding people inside the camp against their will was a reference to Jim Jones. The name \\"Movementarians\\" itself was simply chosen for its awkward sound. The scene during the six-hour orientation video where those who get up to leave are induced to stay through peer pressure and groupthink was a reference to the Unification Church and EST Training. The show's producers acknowledged that the ending scene of the episode was a poke at Fox as \\"being the evil mind controlling network\\". The episode's script was written in 1997, at roughly the same time that the members of the Heaven's Gate cult committed mass suicide. The writers noticed strange parallels between Mirkin's first draft and Heaven's Gate, including the belief in the arrival of a spaceship and the group's members wearing matching clothes and odd sneakers. Because of these coincidences, several elements of the episode were changed so that it would be more sensitive in the wake of the suicides.O'Donnell, Steve. (2006). Commentary for \\"The Joy of Sect\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Themes Chris Turner's book Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Defined a Generation describes the Movementarians as a cross between the Church of Scientology and Ra√´lism, with lesser influences from Sun Myung Moon and Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. Planet Simpson also notes the Simpsons' chant at the conclusion of the episode as evidence of a \\"true high- growth quasi-religious cult of our time\\", referring to television. The book refers to a \\"Cult of Pop\\", which it describes as \\"a fast growing mutation ersatz religion that has filled the gaping hole in the West's social fabric where organized religion used to be\\". Martin Hunt of FACTnet notes several similarities between the Movementarians and the Church of Scientology. \\"The Leader\\" physically resembles L. Ron Hubbard; the Movementarians' \\"trillion- year labor contract\\" alludes to the (Scientology) Sea Org's billion-year contract; and both groups make extensive use of litigation. The A.V. Club analyzes the episode in a piece called \\"Springfield joins a cult\\", comparing the Movementarians' plans to travel to \\"Blisstonia\\" to Heaven's Gate's promises of bliss after traveling to the comet Hale‚ÄìBopp. However, it also notes that \\"The Joy of Sect\\" is a commentary on organized religion in general, quoting Bart as saying, \\"Church, cult, cult, church. So we get bored someplace else every Sunday.\\" Planet Simpson discusses The Simpsons' approach to deprogramming in the episode, noting groundskeeper Willie's conversion to the philosophy of the Movementarians after learning about it while attempting to deprogram Homer. Author Chris Turner suggests that Marge should have instead gone with the \\"Conformco Brain Deprogrammers\\" used in the episode \\"Burns' Heir\\" to convince Bart to leave Mr. Burns and come back home. In The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer, the authors cite \\"escaping from a cult commune in 'The Joy of Sect'\\" as evidence of \\"Aristotle's virtuous personality traits in Marge.\\" As the title suggests, the book The Psychology of the Simpsons: D'oh! examines \\"The Joy of Sect\\" from a psychological point of view. It discusses the psychology of decision-making in the episode, noting, \\"Homer is becoming a full-blown member of the Movementarians not by a rational choice, ... but through the process of escalating behavioral commitments.\\" The Psychology of the Simpsons explains the key recruitment techniques used by the Movementarians, including the charismatic leader, established authority based on a religious entity or alien being (in this case \\"Blisstonia\\"), and the method of taking away free choice through acceptance of the Leader's greatness. The book also analyzes the techniques used during the six-hour Movementarian recruitment film. In that scene, those who rise to leave are reminded that they are allowed to leave whenever they wish. They are, however, questioned in front of the group as to specifically why they wish to leave, and these individuals end up staying to finish watching the film. The book describes this technique as \\"subtle pressure\\", in contrast to the \\"razor wire, landmines, angry dogs, crocodiles and evil mystery bubble Marge confronts to escape, while being reminded again that she is certainly free to leave\\". The Psychology of the Simpsons writes that \\"the Leader\\" is seen as an authority figure, because \\"he has knowledge or abilities that others do not, but want\\". Instead of traditional mathematics textbooks, the children on the compound learn from Arithmetic the Leader's Way and Science for Leader Lovers. In Pinsky's The Gospel According to the Simpsons, one of the show's writers recounted to the author that the producers of The Simpsons had vetoed a planned episode on Scientology in fear of the Church's \\"reputation for suing and harassing opponents\\". Pinsky found it ironic that Matt Groening spoofed Scientology in spite of the fact that the voice of Bart Simpson, Nancy Cartwright, is a Scientologist, having joined in 1996. Pinsky notes that Groening later \\"took a shot at Scientology\\" in Futurama with the fictional religion \\"Church of Robotology\\". Groening said he received a call from the Church of Scientology concerned about the use of a similar name.Groening, Matt. (2003). Commentary for \\"Hell Is Other Robots\\", in Futurama: Volume One [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. \\"I did get a call from a Scientologist who had somehow gotten hold of the script.\\" Cultural references * When Marge attempts to leave the compound, she is chased by the Rover guard \\"balloon\\" from the 1967 television program The Prisoner. * Neal Hefti and Nelson Riddle's theme music to the 1960s Batman series is used in the episode to indoctrinate Homer * \\"I Love You, You Love Me\\" sung by Barney the Dinosaur on the Barney and Friends/Barney and the Backyard Gang series is used to brainwash babies. * When Mr. Burns introduces his new religion, most of the sequence is a parody of the promotional video of Michael Jackson's 1995 album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. * Willie scratching his nails along the church window to get Marge and Reverend Lovejoy's attention is a reference to the 1975 film Jaws, in which the character Quint performs a similar action. * The Springfield Airport contains the \\"Just Crichton and King Bookstore\\", referencing Michael Crichton and Stephen King, authors famous for their airport novels, carrying only their works. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"The Joy of Sect\\" finished 27th in ratings for the week of February 2‚Äì8, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 9.6, equivalent to approximately 9.4 million viewing households. It was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files, King of the Hill, and Ally McBeal. In a 2006 article in USA Today, \\"The Joy of Sect\\" was highlighted among six other episodes of The Simpsons season 9, along with \\"Trash of the Titans\\", \\"The Last Temptation of Krust\\", \\"The Cartridge Family\\", \\"Dumbbell Indemnity\\", and \\"Das Bus\\". The A.V. Club featured the episode in its analysis of \\"15 Simpsons Moments That Perfectly Captured Their Eras\\". The Daily Mirror gave the episode positive mention in its review of the Season 9 DVD release, calling it \\"hilarious\\". Isaac Mitchell-Frey of the Herald Sun cited the episode as the highlight of the season. The Sunday Mail highlighted the episode for their \\"Family Choice\\" segment, commenting: \\"Normally, a show about religious cults would spell doom and gloom. Only Bart, of The Simpsons, could make a comedy out of it but then, he and his cartoon family are a cult in their own right anyway!\\" Jeff Shalda of The Simpsons Archive used the episode as an example of one of the \\"good qualities present in The Simpsons\\", while analyzing why some other aspects of The Simpsons make Christians upset. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide commented that the episode was \\"an odd one\\" with \\"a lot of good moments\\", and went on to state that it was \\"a nice twist to see Burns determined to be loved\\". However, the book also noted that \\"The Joy of Sect\\" is \\"another one where the central joke isn't strong enough to last the whole episode\\". In a lesson plan developed at St Mary's College, Durham titled An Introduction to Philosophy: The Wit and Wisdom of Lisa Simpson, the episode is described in a section on \\"False Prophets\\" as applicable for \\"...studying the more outrageous manifestations of 'religion' or those simply alert to the teachings of Christ on the subject\\".

It is located north of Dunoon on the coastal A815 (low road) or the inland A885 (high road) and sits on the southern shore of the Holy Loch, branching off the Firth of Clyde. History =Robertsons Yachtbuilders= Alexander Robertson started repairing boats in a small workshop at Sandbank in 1876, and Alexander Robertson and Sons Ltd (Yachtbuilders) went on to become one of the foremost wooden boat builders on Scotland's River Clyde. The 'golden years' of Robertson's yard were in the early 1900s when they started building classic 12- and 15-metre racing yachts. Robertsons was well known for the quality of its workmanship and was chosen to build the first 15-metre yacht designed by William Fife (Shimna, 1907). More than 55 boats were built by Robertsons in preparation for the First World War and the yard remained busy even during the Great Depression in the 1930s, as many wealthy businessmen developed a passion for yacht racing on the Clyde. During World War II the yard was devoted to Admiralty work, producing a wide range of large high-speed Fairmile Marine Motor Boats. After the war the yard built the successful one-class Loch Longs and two David Boyd designed 12-metre challengers for the America's Cup: Sceptre (1958) and Sovereign (1964). Due to difficult business conditions the Robertson family sold the yard in 1965, and it was turned over to GRP production work until it closed in 1980. During its 104-year history, Robertson's Yard built 500 boats, many of which are still sailing today. The yard ceased trading in the early 1980s and the site was levelled soon after. The site has since been consumed by residential building and the new Holy Loch Marina development. =U.S. Navy years= U.S. submarine base Sandbank was the site of the shore facilities of the U.S. Navy submarine base in the Holy Loch from 1961 to 1992, part of the US Atlantic Fleet. It was, for 30 years, until the end of the Cold War, the home port of the U.S. Navy's Submarine Squadron 14 (SUBRON 14, short name). Nowadays, part of the old navy complex that was the former location of Morris & Lorimer's boat building yard, is a timber loading berth and marina. Holy Loch Marina Sandbank is the location of the Holy Loch Marina, a development with over 200 berths. Cemetery Cowal Cemetery is located on the high road (A885) between Sandbank and Dunoon.

As in most of County Durham, the chief trade here was coal mining and Cassop Colliery was where the miners worked. The inhabitants of Quarrington Hill also shared the church of St. Pauls (built in 1868), with Cassop. The stones that were used in its construction were allegedly transported by William Smith, Innkeeper of the Half Moon Inn, Quarrington Hill, as he was the only villager to own such a cart to make this possible.

History  The origin of the name \\"Innellan\\" is obscure. The village was developed as a holiday destination in Victorian times on the site of a smaller and older farming settlement, and the first steamboat pier was built in 1851. With a resident population of around 1,000, growing to many more in summer, Innellan found prosperity as one of many seaside resorts along the shores of the Firth of Clyde serving tourist traffic primarily coming from the city of Glasgow further upriver, travelling on Clyde steamers. =Notable people= * George Paton, recipient of the Victoria Cross * John Thomas Rochead lived here briefly in 1871 Decline This prosperity started to fade in the 1960s with the increasing availability of foreign holidays to the general public. Competing against resorts in Europe that enjoyed Mediterranean climates, the popularity of all the Clyde seaside resorts fell. It was around this time that an American naval base in the nearby Holy Loch was established, providing some aid to the local economy, although being controversial. The base was withdrawn in the 1990s. The village's most striking landmark from its heyday as a seaside resort - the large Royal Hotel that overlooked the pier - was destroyed by fire in 1981 and the site has yet to be redeveloped. The entrance gates to its former site on Pier Road still show the sign for the hotel. Innellan's pier, which passenger steamers regularly called at whilst the area was booming, was extended in 1901 but finally closed in 1972 in response to reduced usage. After falling into increasing disrepair, it was fully dismantled in the mid-1990s. Primary school Innellan Primary School, established in 1868, has a distinguished history. Its headmaster from 1938 to 1972 was the notable Latin scholar Thomas Muir, who was also an accomplished amateur geologist. He revelled in the fact that Innellan was the southwestern extremity of the Highland Boundary Fault, and would regularly send his pupils on field excursions along the shore ‚Äì but not in the school's time. The headmaster's name was Thomas B Muir. Taking his initials T B his pupils affectionately called him Teddy Bear Muir. On learning this he glared at his class (his spectacles had that effect) and then gave a great big grin thus establishing his nickname for evermore. Churches Innellan Church Innellan once had four churches; two Church of Scotland, one Free Church and one Episcopal. Two of them still stand; the former West Church is now converted to a house, and the remaining (and still functioning) church was the charge of the Reverend Dr George Matheson, the blind minister who wrote the hymn \\"Oh Love that wilt not let me go.\\" Although it is commonly believed that he wrote this hymn after he had been jilted by his fianc√©e, the truth is that he composed the hymn after experiencing a personal crisis. The only history of Innellan ever printed was written by the Rev John Hill, minister of the West Church, in 1950. It is now out of print, and was somewhat preoccupied with religious affairs.  Innellan today  Clyde sunset Innellan, along with nearby Dunoon, has in recent years attempted to reclaim its role as a tourist destination. Nowadays its appeal lies more in its being a pleasant and tranquil place of retreat, and as a potential location from which to commute to Glasgow or Dunoon. Innellan boasts very impressive views across the Firth of Clyde, stretching from Kilcreggan and Loch Long (looking north) to Cumbrae Head and Ailsa Craig (looking south). There is a local golf club, with a 9-hole course on the hill. The village's strip of shops (which once numbered fourteen) has now been reduced to just the Post Office. There are two pubs in the Village, The Osborne Bar/Restaurant/B&B; and The Villagers Royal but other services are provided by the nearby town of Dunoon, which is linked by a bus service.

Its export version name is Romb. Development Design work on an entirely new, self- propelled air defense guided missile system began in 1960 and was assigned to the Moscow-based NII-20 () research and design institute under lead designer M.M. Kosichkin. The program initially suffered numerous delays and setbacks due to poorly formulated performance and tactical requirements, as this was a pioneering battlefield air defense system with no equivalents in existence at the time, and no doctrinal experience with such a weapon. P.M. Chukadov was assigned project leader in 1965 after a thorough review of the stalled program, and the Osa would ultimately see service acceptance in 1972 after a period of trials. Description The Polish OSA-AKM Osa was the first mobile air defense missile system incorporating its own engagement radars on a single vehicle. All versions of the 9K33 feature all-in-one 9A33 transporter-launcher and radar vehicles which can detect, track and engage aircraft independently or with the aid of regimental surveillance radars. The six-wheeled transport vehicles BAZ-5937 are fully amphibious and air transportable. The road range is about 500 km. The 1S51M3-2 radar system on the 9K33 Osa TELAR received the NATO codename Land Roll. It was derived from the naval 'Pop Group' radar system but is smaller since it does not require the elaborate stabilisation system. An improved system, the Osa-AKM (NATO reporting name SA-8B 'Gecko' Mod 1) was first seen in Germany in 1980. It had improvements added to the launcher configuration, carrying six missiles in ribbed containers. The system is reported to be of the frequency-agile monopulse type. It consists of an elliptical rotating surveillance antenna mounted on top of the array, operates in H band (6 to 8 GHz) and has a 30 km acquisition range against most targets. The large pulsed J band (14.5 GHz) engagement antenna is mounted below it in the centre of the array and has a maximum tracking range of about 20 km. Mounted on either side of the tracking radar antenna is a small J band parabolic dish antenna to track the missile. Below that is a small circular antenna which emits an I band uplink capture beam to gather the missile shortly after launch. The final antennas in the array are two small white rectangular ones, one on either side of the array mounted alongside the I band. These are used for command uplink to the missile. This twin antenna system permits the 'Land Roll' radar to control up to two missiles simultaneously against a single target. Furthermore, the two missiles can be guided on different frequencies to further complicate ECM. There is also a tubular device fitted to and above the tracking radar; this is a 9Sh33 electro-optical tracker. It can be used to track the target when the main tracking radar is jammed by ECM. A 9K33 battery comprises four 9A33B TELAR vehicles and two 9T217 transloader vehicles on BAZ-5939 chassis with reload missiles and a crane. A reload time of five minutes has been reported per TELAR. In addition to the TELARs, each regiment is also assigned a single radar collimation vehicle 9V914 (initially on the BAZ-5938 chassis but more often found on the ZiL-131 truck). This vehicle assists in the alignment of the TELAR's radar systems, ensuring accurate target tracking and engagement. Variants SA-N-4 launcher covered by a circular plate on the Slava class cruiser Marshal Ustinov. * 9K33 \\"Osa\\" (US DoD designation SA-8A \\"Gecko\\") began development in 1960 and was introduced in 1971‚Äì1972 with four exposed 9M33 missiles per TELAR 9A33B and a maximum range of . * 4K33 \\"OSA-M\\" (NATO reporting name SA-N-4 \\"Gecko\\") was introduced in 1972 and is the naval version of the system with two 9M33M missiles on a Zif-122 retractable rotating launcher and improved performance. It has been installed on Gepard class frigate, Kara class guided missile cruisers, Kiev class VTOL cruisers and also the Kirov, Slava and Krivak classes. * 9K33M2 \\"Osa-AK\\" (US DoD designation SA-8B \\"Gecko Mod-0\\") with TELAR 9A33BM2 was introduced in 1975 with the new six-missile box launcher, each 9M33M2 missile being a sealed round. * 9K33M3 \\"Osa-AKM\\" (US DoD designation SA-8B \\"Gecko Mod-1\\") with TELAR 9A33BM3 and missiles 9M33M3 was introduced in 1980 with the maximum range extended to and maximum altitude to 12 km (40,000 ft) as explained above. Most OSA-AKM systems also feature an IFF antenna. * Saman and Saman-M (Russian –°–∞–º–∞–Ω ‚Äì adobe) is a development of the Osa\\\\Osa-M system into target drones, used for testing and training with air defense systems, including SAMs. The 9K33M3 is also able to use the 9A33BM3 missiles which are wire-guided, presumably for use in an ECM- heavy environment where the radio command guidance may not operate properly. Missiles Engagement range for the early versions is approximately 2‚Äì9 km (1.3‚Äì5.6 miles) and engagement altitudes of between 50‚Äì5,000 m (164‚Äì16,400 ft). The 9M33M2 \\"Osa-A\\" missile extends the ranges out to 1,500‚Äì10,000m (1‚Äì6.2 miles) and engagement altitudes to 25‚Äì5,000 m (82‚Äì16,400 ft). The 9M33M3 missile greatly enhances the altitude engagement envelope to 10‚Äì12,000 m (33‚Äì42,500 ft), and as such are also able to fly further (about 15 km/9 miles) but the system is not able to engage targets at longer ranges, due to other factors such as the radar tracking of the missiles. The system is designed for use primarily against jet aircraft and helicopters in any kind of weather. The 9M33 missiles are 3.158 m (10.3 ft) long, weigh 126 kg (278 lb) and use command guidance. There is also a backup low-light optical tracking system for heavy ECM environments. The latest 9M33M3 missiles have an increased total weight of 170 kg (375 lb) in order to provide the extended range coverage and larger warhead. Propulsion is provided by a dual-thrust solid fuel rocket motor. Both versions feature a missile speed of around Mach 2.4 (peaking at around Mach 3) for a maximum target engagement speed of around Mach 1.4 for the original missile and Mach 1.6 for the M2\\\\M3 missiles. The warhead for the initial and M2 versions weighs 19 kg (42 pounds), increased to 40 kg (88 lb) in the M3 version to improve performance against helicopters. All versions have impact and proximity fuzes. There have been unconfirmed reports of other possible versions of the missile with both infra-red and semi-active radar terminal homing seekers. Each TELAR is able to launch and guide two missiles against one target simultaneously. Kill probability is quoted as being 0.35‚Äì0.85 for the Osa and 0.55‚Äì0.85 for the Osa-AK and Osa-AKM (presumably depending upon target aspect, speed, maneuverability and radar cross section). Reaction time (from target detection to launch) is around 26 seconds. Time to prepare for engagements from being in transit is around 4 minutes and missile reloading takes around 5 minutes. Each battery of four TELARs is usually accompanied by two reload vehicles carrying 18 missiles in sets of three, with a crane mounted on the reload vehicles to assist in moving the missiles. When launched the booster motor burns for two seconds, this permits the radar to gather and control it at very short ranges (about 1.6 km). The sustainer motor has a 15-second burn, bringing the missile to a top speed of about Mach 2. Once launched the missile is command-guided for the whole flight, and the warhead is detonated by its proximity fuze or possible command. The warhead is said to have a lethal radius of 5 m at low altitude against an F-4 Phantom size target.

Deployment and history Produced by the USSR/Russia, there are many export customers for this system, including Cuba, Greece (from the former East Germany), Poland, Syria, Ecuador and Iraq. After the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, in which Syrian air defenses were oblitarated by a massive air campaign against Syrian SAM sites in the Beqaa valley, the Syrians managed to deploy SA-8s. At least one F-4 Phantom in a SEAD mission was shot down on July 24, 1982 by an SA-8 system. The WSO (back seater), Aharon Katz was killed, while the pilot, Gil Fogel, survived and was held captive by the Syrians for two years. In late 1980s, Cuba deployed several 9K33 Osa units in southern Angola which posed a significant threat to South African air superiority at shorter ranges.George, Edward in: The Cuban Intervention in Angola, 1965‚Äì1991, Frank Cass, London, New York, 2005, , p. 236-237 The South African 61 Mechanised Battalion Group captured an intact 9K33 Osa anti-aircraft missile system on 3 October 1987 during the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale. This was the first time that such a system had ever fallen into the hands of non-Warsaw Pact forces, giving Western intelligence agencies an opportunity to examine an important Soviet-bloc weapon system.Turton, A.R. 2010. Shaking Hands with Billy. Durban: Just Done Publications. Iraq used Osa systems during the 1991 Gulf War. The system also saw use in the 2008 Russo- Georgian War by both the Georgian and Russian militaries. Libyan 9K33 Osa were used, and some destroyed during the 2011 Libyan Civil War by NATO airstrikes. =Syrian Civil War= During the Syrian civil war in December 2012, rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad's forces managed to capture at least one Osa system after a raid on an air defense base near Damascus. Later, on different occasions, videos showing rebels using the system appeared. On 31 July 2013, a video surfaced showing the successful missile launch for a rebel operated Osa system with a possible hit on a Syrian helicopter. On 16 January 2014, a video of the shooting down of a Syrian Mi-8 or Mi-17 helicopter was uploaded. The heavy damage on the plunging helicopter appeared to confirm the use of a bigger missile to hit the helicopter compared to the damage caused by MANPADS. Also, a video filming the TV screen inside the Osa vehicle matches another video taken outside. Another video surfaced on 18 January 2014, this time missing the intended target. On 15 October 2015, the Russian military reported that a 9K33 Osa system captured by rebel forces was destroyed in an airstrike by a Russian Su-34 bomber near Damascus. On 26 June 2016, Jaish al-Islam insurgents reported a new attempt to shoot down a helicopter with an Osa anti- aircraft system and released a video of the event. =War in Donbass= The Ukrainian Joint Forces reported destruction of the Osa-AKM surface-to-air missile system of the DNR forces along with Zhitel R-330Zh automatic jamming system in Donbass on 30 March 2019. = Yemeni Civil War = On 29 November 2019, Russian sources speculated that a Soviet made 9K33 Osa fired by Houthi forces shot down a Saudi Arabian Army Aviation AH-64 Apache.https://sputniknews.com/military/201911301077442099-watch-soviet-made- missile-system-allegedly-down-apache-helicopter/Apache helicopter reportedly shot down by Soviet missileAn Apache attack helicopter and a MALE (Medium- Range Long-Endurance) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle have been reportedly downed over Yemen.

It is the only member of the tribe having a touch organ with more than 25,000 minute sensory receptors, known as Eimer's organs, with which this hamster-sized mole feels its way around. With the help of its Eimer's organs, it may be perfectly poised to detect seismic wave vibrations. sensitive star-like structure is covered with minute touch receptors known as Eimer's organs. The nose is about 1 cm in diameter with roughly 25,000 Eimer's organs distributed on 22 appendages. Eimer's organs were first described in the European mole in 1871 by German zoologist Theodor Eimer. Other mole species also possess Eimer's organs, though they are not as specialized or numerous as in the star-nosed mole. Because the star-nosed mole is functionally blind, the snout was long suspected to be used to detect electrical activity in prey animals, though little, if any, empirical support has been found for this hypothesis. The nasal star and dentition of this species appear to be primarily adapted to exploit extremely small prey. A report in the journal Nature gives this animal the title of fastest-eating mammal, taking as short as 120 milliseconds (average: 227 ms) to identify and consume individual food items. Its brain decides in approximately 8 ms if a prey is edible or not. This speed is at the limit of the speed of neurons. These moles are also able to smell underwater, accomplished by exhaling air bubbles onto objects or scent trails and then inhaling the bubbles to carry scents back through the nose. Ecology and behavior The star-nosed mole lives in wet lowland areas and eats small invertebrates such as aquatic insects, worms and mollusks, as well as small amphibians and small fish.State University of New York, College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Adirondack Ecological Center: Star-nosed Mole. Retrieved 2012-07-20. Condylura cristata has also been found in dry meadows farther away from water. They have also been found in the Great Smoky Mountains as high as 1,676 meters. However, the star-nose mole does prefer wet, poorly drained areas and marshes. It is a good swimmer and can forage along the bottoms of streams and ponds. Like other moles, this animal digs shallow surface tunnels for foraging; often, these tunnels exit underwater. It is active day and night and remains active in winter, when it has been observed tunneling through the snow and swimming in ice-covered streams. C. cristata is particularly adept at thermoregulation, maintaining a high body temperature in a wide range of external conditions relative to other Talpid moles. This explains its ability to thrive in cold aquatic environments. Campbell, K. L., Mcintyre, I. W., & Macarthur, R. A. (1999). Fasting metabolism and thermoregulatory competence of the star-nosed mole, Condylura cristata (Talpidae: Condylurinae). Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology, 123(3), 293‚Äì298 Little is known about the social behavior of the species, but it is suspected to be colonial. The star-nosed mole mates in late winter or early spring, and the female has one litter of typically four or five young in late spring or early summer. However, females are known to have a second litter if their first is unsuccessful. At birth, each offspring is about long, hairless, and weighs about 1.5 g. Their eyes, ears, and star are all sealed, only opening and becoming useful about 14 days after birth. They become independent after about 30 days, and are fully mature after 10 months. Predators include the red-tailed hawk, great horned owl, barn owl, screech owl, foxes, weasels, minks, various skunks and mustelids, and large fish such as the northern pike, as well as domestic cats. Snout comparison to visual organ Vanderbilt University neuroscientist Kenneth Catania, who has studied star-nosed moles for 20 years, recently turned his research to the study of star-moles as a route to understanding general principles about how human brains process and represent sensory information. He called star-moles \\"a gold mine for discoveries about brains and behavior in general‚Äîand an unending source of surprises\\". Comparing the mole's snout to vision, his research showed that whenever the mole touched potential food, it made a sudden movement to position the smallest rays, the twin rays number 11, over the object for repeated rapid touches. He reports: \\"The similarities with vision were striking. The star movements resembled saccadic eye movements‚Äîquick movements of the eyes from one focus point to another‚Äîin their speed and time-course. The two 11th rays are over-represented in primary somatosensory cortex relative to their size, just as the small visual fovea in primates‚Äîa small region in the center of the eye that yields the sharpest vision‚Äîis over- represented in primary visual cortex.\\" He notes that some bats also have an auditory fovea for processing important echolocation frequencies, suggesting that \\"evolution has repeatedly come to the same solution for constructing a high-acuity sensory system: subdivide the sensory surface into a large, lower- resolution periphery for scanning a wide range of stimuli, and a small, high- resolution area that can be focused on objects of importance\\". The star-shaped nose is a unique organ only found on the star-nosed mole. Living as it does, in complete darkness, the star-nosed mole relies heavily on the mechanical information of its remarkable specialized nose to find and identify their invertebrate prey without using sight (since moles have small eyes and a tiny optic nerve). This organ is often recognized by its high sensitivity and reaction speed. In only 8 milliseconds it can decide whether something is edible‚Äîin fact, this is one of the fastest responses to a stimulus in the animal kingdom and is the reason why the star-nosed mole was lately recognized in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world‚Äôs fastest forager.Album Jet (2013) =Anatomy and physiology= The star-nose is a highly specialized sensory-motor organ shaped by 22 fleshy finger-like appendages, or tendrils, that ring their nostrils and are in constant motion as the mole explores its environment. The star itself is a centimeter across and thus has a diameter slightly smaller than a typical human fingertip. Nevertheless, it is much larger than the nose of other mole species, covering per touch compared to covered by the noses of other mole species. This structure is divided into a high resolution central fovea region (the central 11th pair of rays) and less sensitive peripheral areas. In this way, the star works as a \\"tactile eye\\" where the peripheral rays (1‚Äì10 on each side) study the surroundings with erratic saccade-like movements and direct the 11th ray to objects of interest, just like the primate‚Äôs foveating eye. Regardless of the anatomical position of the star as a distal (protruding or extending) portion of the nose, this is neither an olfactory structure nor an extra hand. The appendages do not contain muscles or bones and are not used to manipulate objects or capture prey. They are controlled by tendons by a complex series of muscles that are attached to the skull in order to perform a role that seems to be purely mechanical. For this purpose, the star also contains a remarkably specialized epidermis covered entirely by 25,000 small raised domes or papillae of approximately in diameter. These domes, known as Eimer‚Äôs organs, are the only type of receptor organs found in the star of the star-nosed mole which proves that the star-like structure has clearly a mechanical functioning. Eimer‚Äôs organ is a sensory structure also found in nearly all of the approximately 30 species of mole, however none contains as many as in Condylura. This large amount of specialized receptors makes the star ultrasensitive ‚Äì about 6 times more sensitive than the human hand, which contains about 17,000 receptors. Each Eimer‚Äôs organ is supplied by a number of primary afferents, thus the star is densely innervated. It is associated with a Merkel cell-neurite complex at the base of the cell column, a lamellated corpuscle in the dermis just below the column and a series of free nerve endings that originate from myelinated fibers in the dermis, run through the central column and end in a ring of terminal swellings just below the outer keratinized skin surface. All 25,000 Eimer‚Äôs organs distributed along the surface of the star have this basic structure in all 22 appendages. Nevertheless, the fovea region (11th pair of rays), which is shorter in area, has a lower density of these organs ‚Äì 900 Eimer's organs on its surface while some of the lateral rays have over 1500. This may sound contradictory with the fact that this region has higher resolution and an important role in foraging behavior. However, instead of having more sensory organs this fovea region uses a different approach in which a skin surface may be more sensitive to mechanoreceptic input; it has more innervation density. Rays 1 through 9 each has about 4 fibers per Eimer's organ, while rays 10 and 11 have significantly higher innervation densities of 5.6 and 7.1 fibers per organ, respectively, revealing how the sensory periphery is differentially specialized across the star. The myelinated fibers innervating the 11 rays were photographed and counted from an enlarged photomontage by Catania and colleagues. The total number of myelinated fibers for half of the star ranged from 53,050 to 93‚Äì94; hence the total fibers for the entire star vary from roughly 106,000 to 117,000. This means that tactile information from the environment is transmitted to the SNC rapidly. This would be insufficient without an adequate processing system, but in the star-nosed mole, the processing also occurs at a very high speed almost approaching the upper limit at which nervous systems are capable of functioning. The threshold at which the mole can decide whether or not something is edible is of 25 milliseconds: 12 milliseconds to the neurons in the mole‚Äôs somatosensory cortex to respond to touch and other 5 milliseconds for motor commands to be conducted back to the star. In comparison, this whole process takes 600 milliseconds in humans. The importance of the star-like nose in the mole‚Äôs lifestyle is evidenced in the somatosensory representation of the nose. Electrophysiological experiments using electrodes placed on the cortex during stimulation of the body demonstrated that roughly 52% of the cortex is devoted to the nose. This means that more than half of the brain is dedicated to processing sensory information acquired by this organ, even when the nose itself is only roughly the 10% of the mole‚Äôs actual size. Thus, it may be concluded that the nose substitutes for the eyes, with the information from it being processed so as to produce a tactile map of the environment under the mole‚Äôs nose. As other mammals, the somatosensory cortex of the star-nosed mole is somatotopically organized such that sensory information from adjacent parts of the nose is processed in adjacent regions of the somatosensory cortex. Therefore, the rays are also represented in the brain. The inferior most sensitive pair of rays (11th) had a larger representation on the somatosensory cortex, even when these are the shortest pair of appendages in the nose of the star-nosed mole. Other important fact of the representation of the star in the cerebral cortex is that each hemisphere had clearly visible set of 11 stripes representing the contralateral star. In some favorable cases, a smaller third set of stripes was also apparent; opposite to other body structures that have a unique representation, with each half of the body represented in the opposite cerebral hemisphere. Thus, opposite to other species, the somatosensory representation of the tactile fovea is not correlated with anatomical parameters but rather is highly correlated with patterns of behavior. Recordings from active neurons in the somatosensory cortex show that most cells (97%) responded to light tactile stimulation with a mean latency of 11.6 milliseconds. Besides a fairly large proportion of these neurons (41%) were inhibited by stimulation of proximate Eimer‚Äôs organs outside their excitatory receptive field. Consequently, the ability of the star to rapidly determine location and identity of objects is enhanced by small receptive fields and its associated collateral inhibition system that constrains cortical neurons with short latency responses. Sensitivity to mechanical stimuli In 1996, Vanderbilt PhD candidate Paul Marasco determined that the threshold by which the star-like structure senses the mechanical stimuli depends on which type of the Eimer‚Äôs organ was excited. He characterized three main classes of Eimer‚Äôs receptors, including one of slow adaptation (Tonic receptor) and two of rapid adaptation (Phasic receptor). The tonic receptor has a response similar to that of a Merkel cell-neurite complex. It has free terminals and is therefore able to detect pressure and texture with a high sensitivity and at a Random Sustained Discharge. The rapid adapting responses include a Paccinian-like response based on an (on-off) response caused by pressure and mechanical vibrations with maximum sensitivity to stimuli at a frequency of 250 Hz. The differences between both rapid responses rely on the fact that one of them only has a response during the compression phase.Marasco, Paul D. (2006). The structure and Function of Eimer‚Äôs Organ in the Mole. Dissertation Submitted to the faculty of the Graduate School of Vanderbilt University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Frequency sensitivity Among the receptors described, Marasco identified that there were receptors relatively unresponsive to compressive stimuli but were acutely responsive to any kind of stimulus that brushed or slid across the surface of the nose (Stimuli applied with large displacements and high velocity). In contrast, there were other receptors that responded robustly to small magnitude compression of any kind but were not responsive to sweeping stimuli. The receptors that were sensitive to sweeping were maximally activated across a broad range of frequencies from 5‚Äì150 Hz at large displacements ranging from 85‚Äì485 Œºm. Conversely, the receptors that respond to compressive stimuli showed a narrow peak of maximal activity at 250‚Äì300 Hz with displacements from 10‚Äì28 Œºm. Directional sensitivity Based on the circular organization of the nerve endings and its innervation pattern in Eimer‚Äôs organs, Marasco proposed by mapping experiments that nearly all receptors in the star-nosed mole have a preference for a particular direction of applied stimuli. Thus, while one receptor elicits a strong response if compressed in one direction, it may stay \\"silent\\" when compressed in another one. Velocity sensitivity Examination of the threshold of velocity at which the receptors responded identified that the minimum velocity of cell response was 46 mm/s, corresponding to the approximate speed of the nose during foraging behavior.  Transduction of the mechanical signal  Taking into account that Eimer‚Äôs organ senses mechanical deformation, its mechanism of transduction can be explained in a few steps: # Stimuli cause depolarization of the receptor membrane, resulting in a receptor potential and therefore a current towards the node of Ranvier. # If the receptor potential is maintained and the generated current is enough to reach the node of Ranvier, then the threshold is reached to produce an action potential. # When the action potential is produced, ionic channels are activated so that the mechanical impulse is transduced into electrical. # This signal is carried along the axon until it reaches the SNC where the information is processed. Although these summarized steps of mechanical transduction give a hint of how the star-nosed mole converts mechanical information into potential actions, the entire mechanism of transduction behind this intricate mechanoreceptor is still unknown and further studies are required. =Behavior= Despite the poorly developed eyes, star-nosed moles have an intricate system to detect prey and understand their environment.Zimmer, Carl (1993). The Electric Mole. Available online: http://discovermagazine.com/1993/aug/theelectricmole261#.Up-E3tIz2Fk During exploration, the mole's star-like appendage produces brief touches which compress Eimer‚Äôs organ against objects or substrate. When foraging, moles search in random patterns of touches lasting 20‚Äì30 . Catania and colleagues demonstrated that the tactile organ of the star-nosed mole is preferentially innervated by putative light touch fibers. When the outer appendages of the star come into slight contact with a potential food source, the nose is quickly shifted so that one or more touches are made with the fovea (the two lower appendages; 11th pair) to explore objects of interest in more detail ‚Äì especially potential prey.Catania Kenneth, C. Remple Fiona, E. (2005). \\"Asymptotic prey profitability drives star-nosed moles to the foraging speed limit.\\" Nature Publishing Group. Letters to Nature. 519‚Äì522, This foraging behavior is exceptionally fast, such that the mole may touch between 10 and 15 separate areas of the ground every second. It can locate and consume 8 separate prey items in less than 2 seconds and begin searching again for more prey in as little as 120 ms, although the average time is 227 ms. The sequence described constitutes handling time. In studies made by high-speed video, the mole always foveated to the 11th appendage to explore a food item. The use of the 11th appendage of the tactile fovea is surprisingly similar to the manner in which human eyes explore details of a visual scene. This star-like nose also enables the mole to smell underwater, something which was previously thought impossible in mammals, which requires the inspiration of air during olfaction to convey odorants to the olfactory epithelium.Howell, A. B. (1930). Aquatic Mammals: Their Adaptations to Life in the Water. Springfield, Illinois. Although the star-like structure is not a chemoreceptor itself, it helps the star-nosed mole blow between 8 and 12 small air bubbles per second, each 0.06 to 0.1 mm in size, onto objects or scent trails. These bubbles are then drawn back into the nostrils, so that odorant molecules in the air bubbles are wafted over the olfactory receptors.Catania Kenneth, C. (2006). \\"Underwater 'sniffing' by semi-aquatic mammals.\\" Nature Publishing Group. Brief communications. 1024‚Äì1250. The speed of the bubbles is compared to other mole's speed of sniffing. Scientists found that the bubbles are being blown towards targets such as food. Before the star-nosed mole, scientists did not believe that mammals could smell underwater, let alone smell by blowing bubbles. In 1993, Edwin Gould and colleagues proposed that the star-like proboscis had electroreceptors and that the mole was therefore able to sense the electrical field of its prey prior to mechanical inspection by its appendages. Through behavioral experiments, they demonstrated that moles preferred an artificial worm with the simulated electrical field of a live earthworm to an identical arrangement without the electrical field. They suggested, therefore, that the nerve endings in the star‚Äôs tentacles are indeed electroreceptors and that the moles move them around constantly to sample the strength of the electromagnetic field at different locations as they search for prey. However, the hypothesis remains unexplained physiologically and has not yet been accepted by the scientific community. Instead, the hypothesis proposed by Catania, in which the function of the appendage is purely tactile, seems to be more feasible and is the one currently accepted. =Evolution= The development of the star-like appendages suggests precursors with proto-appendages on an ancestor's snout, which became elevated over successive generations. Although this theory lacks fossil evidence or supporting comparative data, nearly all extant moles have sheets of the Eimer‚Äôs organ making up the epidermis of their snout around the nares. Also, recent studies of Catania and colleagues identified one North American species (Scapanus townsendii) with a set of proto-appendages extending caudally on the snout which exhibit a striking resemblance to the embryonic stages of the star-nosed mole, although Scapanus townsendii has only eight subdivisions on its face, rather than the 22 appendages found on the star-nosed mole. Such change is of common occurrence in evolution and is explained by the advantage of efficiently adding modules to the body plan without need to reinvent the regulatory elements which produce each module. Thus, although the star is unique in its shape and size, it seems feasible that the structure is based on a more ancestral bauplan as it comprises similarities found in a wide range of other moles and also in the molecular structure of other mammals. The picture which emerges suggests that the star- nosed mole is an extreme in mammalian evolution, having perhaps the most sensitive mechano-sensory system to be found among mammals. There are two evolutionary theories concerning the star-like nose. One proposes the development of the structure of the star as a consequence of the selective pressure of the star-nosed mole's wetland habitat. Wetlands have a dense population of small insects, so exploiting this resource requires a higher resolution sensory surface than that of other moles. Thus, a shift to the wetland environment may have provided a selective advantage for a more elaborate sensory structure. Furthermore, in wild caught moles of many species, the Eimer‚Äôs organs show obvious signs of wear and abrasion. It appears that constant and repeated contact with the soil damages the sensory organs, which have a thin keratinized epidermis. Star-nosed moles are the only species which live in the moist, muddy soil of wetlands where the less abrasive environment has allowed the delicate star-shaped structure to evolve. The second theory, that of prey profitability, explains the foraging speed of the star-nosed mole. Prey profitability (i.e. energy gained divided by prey handling time) is an essential variable for estimating the optimal diet. When handling time approaches zero, profitability increases dramatically. Due to the small invertebrate prey available in the wetlands, the star-nosed mole has developed handling times as short as 120 ms. The dazzling speed with which it forages therefore counterbalances the low nutritional value of each individual piece of food and maximizes the time available for finding more. Further, the proximity of the star-shaped nose to the mouth greatly reduces the handling time required before food can be ingested and is a major factor in how the star-nosed mole can find and eat food so quickly. =Current applications in engineering= The study of highly specialized systems often allows better insight into more generalized ones. The mole's striking, star-like structure may reflect a general trend in its \\"less remarkable\\" relatives, including humans. Little is known today about the molecular mechanisms of tactile transduction in mammals. As the drosophila fly is to genetics, or the squid giant axon is to neurobiology, the star-nosed mole may be the model organism for tactile transduction. The proper understanding of its saccade-like system and associated transduction may lead in future to the development of new types of neural prostheses. Furthermore, the outstanding speed and precision at which the mole performs may provide insights into the structural design of intelligent machines as an artificial response to the remarkable sensory ability of the star-nosed mole. Snout as related to optimal foraging theory According to optimal foraging theory, organisms forage in such a way as to maximize their net energy intake per unit time. In other words, they behave in such a way as to find, capture and consume food containing the most calories while expending the least amount of time possible in doing so. With extremely short handling times for eating very small prey, star-nosed moles can profitably consume foods that are not worth the time or effort of slower animals, and having a food category to themselves is a big advantage. Furthermore, just behind the 11th ray of the star, the star-nosed mole has modified front teeth that form the equivalent of a pair of tweezers. High- speed video shows these specialized teeth are used to pluck tiny prey from the ground. As Catania reports, \\"It is also clear from the behavior that the teeth and the star act as an integrated unit ‚Äì the 11th rays, located directly in front on the teeth, spread apart as the teeth move forward to grasp small food. Thus, tweezer-like teeth and the exquisitely sensitive star likely evolved together as a means to better find and handle small prey quickly...it appears that the ability to rapidly detect and consume small prey was the major selective advantage that drove the evolution of the star.\\" References Further reading * External links The Star-Nosed Mole Takes Adaptation To The Extreme - Science Friday, 28 April 2017 (Ira Flatow interview with Ken Catania) * Star Nosed Mole - YouTube, SuperSportsman01, 7 October 2012 Mammals described in 1758 Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Mammals of Canada Mammals of the United States Talpidae ","title":"Star-nosed mole"},{"id":"1385915","text":"Ardlui () is a hamlet in Argyll and Bute, Scottish Highlands.

Te Atairangikaahu had adopted siblings including Sir Robert Mahuta, whose daughter Nanaia Mahuta is a member of Parliament. She was a descendant of the first MƒÅori king, P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero, and succeeded, King Korokƒ´, becoming queen the day Korokƒ´ was buried. She attended Rakaumanga Primary School and Waikato Diocesan School for Girls. In 1952, she married Whatumoana Paki, whose father was from Waikato tribe Ngati Whawhakia and mother from the northern tribe of Te Aup≈çuri. They had seven children: Tuheitia Paki, Heeni Katipa (n√©e Paki), Tomairangi Paki, Kiki Solomon (n√©e Paki), Mihi Gabrielle Paki, Maharaia Paki, and Te Manawanui Clarkson (n√©e Paki). In the 1970 New Year Honours, Te Atairangikaahu was the first MƒÅori to be appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, \\"for outstanding services to the MƒÅori people\\".\\"New Year Honours List\\" (15 January 1970) 1 New Zealand Gazette 1 at 15. On 6 February 1987, Te Atairangikaahu was the first appointee to the Order of New Zealand.\\"The Order of New Zealand\\" (12 February 1987) 20 New Zealand Gazette 705 at 709. and her badge of the order bears the number 1. She was awarded an honorary doctorate from Waikato University in 1973, and an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Victoria University in 1999. In 1986 she was appointed an Officer of the Order of St John. She was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal, and in 1993, she was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal. In December 2005, she started dialysis treatment when her kidneys began to fail. On 11 July 2006, she suffered what appeared to be a heart attack, and was admitted to intensive care in Waikato Hospital, Hamilton. She was discharged from hospital later in the month, in time to celebrate her 75th birthday. Death Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu died on 15 August 2006, aged 75, at her official residence, Turangawaewae Marae in NgƒÅruawƒÅhia. Six of her seven children were present, with one daughter en route from Australia. Her death sparked a week of mourning for MƒÅoridom leading to her funeral on 21 August 2006. She is buried on Taupiri mountain in an unmarked grave, as are her ancestors, as a sign of equality with their people. Queen Elizabeth II sent her condolences. Her widower, Whatumoana Paki, had wanted a tombstone for his wife, but members of the royal family do not have grave markings. Instead, Paki paid tribute to his wife by planting a breed of purple roses, named specifically for Te Atairangikaahu, around a memorial stone outside their home. Reign Queen Te ƒÄtairangikaahu in New Delhi, 1975 Although the office of the MƒÅori monarch holds no constitutional function, it is the paramount head of the Waikato federation of tribes with its parliament. In addition to this Te Atairangikaahu was an avid supporter of Maori cultural and sporting events and played an active role in local and global political events involving indigenous issues. Her official residence was Turongo House in the Turangawaewae Marae complex coupled with Mahinarangi (official reception room for receiving dignitaries) and Raukawa iti (official guest house). She and her husband also resided at Waahi Pa in Huntly during her reign. He continued to live at their residence with his son until his death in 2011. Succession Tuheitia Paki, her eldest son, was chosen during the mourning period as her successor with the help of a \\"kingmaker\\", after the consent of the chiefs of all the leading tribes was sought. Her eldest child, daughter Heeni Katipa, was the next leading contender for the position. In contrast to the Monarchy of New Zealand, the Maori monarchy is both elective and operates outside New Zealand's constitutional structures. Consequently, the position is not automatically inherited by primogeniture as the New Zealand throne is. By overlapping magisteria Te Atairangikaahu herself was her father's second daughter, though the eldest was not born to his wife, so any of her children or a leading figure from another iwi could have been appointed.

It is south of Leeds to the west of the city centre, on the Wakefield Line and Leeds branch of the East Coast Main Line. The first Westgate station opened in 1856 a few years after the town's first station, Wakefield Kirkgate. In 1867, the station was rebuilt on the opposite side of Westgate on the main line between Leeds and Doncaster. British Rail modernised the station in 1967 when large parts of the 19th-century station were demolished and replaced with austere but functional facilities. By the 21st century, there was pressure to modernise the station and between 2009 and 2013 the station was rebuilt and modernised as a result of regeneration efforts focused upon the wider area. On 3 February 2014, the rebuilt station was officially opened. History =Early history= Entrance to the 1867 station near the bridge on Westgate During 1856, shortly after the spur line from Wakefield's first station, Wakefield Kirkgate was built, the first Westgate station opened.Bickerdike, Graeme. \\"Keeping up appearances.\\" Rail Engineer, 8 July 2013. Its southern side was built for the Bradford, Wakefield and Leeds Railway (GNR) on part of the private estate belonging to wealthy cloth merchant John Milnes and his mid-18th century mansion was partially demolished and its remains were incorporated into the station. The station was used for ten years before further developments necessitated its demolition and rebuilding. No traces remain of the original station as the site was levelled and premises for Wakefield School were built on the site. The school has since been demolished. A new station opened on the opposite side of Westgate in 1867. It was constructed for the GNR, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways on the main line from Leeds to Doncaster which approached Westgate from the north on an embankment before passing through the station and over the bridge in Westgate which is at the start of a 95-arch viaduct. The station was designed by Leeds engineer, J.B. Fraser. Built at a cost of ¬£60,000, it was described by a local newspaper as \\"one of the most perfect stations in England ‚Äì special care in designing the works having been taken‚Ä¶in order that every facility might be given for the easy and expeditious working of the goods and passenger traffic\\". A prominent feature was a turreted tower, which, as a result of lobbying by the Wakefield Tradesmen's Association, was converted into a four-faced clock tower in June 1880. The clock's mechanism was designed by the horologist and lawyer Sir Edmund Beckett and made by Potts of Leeds. Starting in 1967, British Rail embarked on an extensive rebuild of the second station, resulting in the removal of the clock tower and most of the station buildings.\\"Wakefield Westgate, West Yorkshire.\\" heritagecalling.com, 15 December 2014. The station's decorative and elegant frontage and pavilion roof were demolished and replaced with an austere counterpart. The rebuilt station was \\"aesthetically inferior to its earlier incarnation, soon proved to be too cramped to cope with a rise in passenger numbers\\". It was poorly laid out with few opportunities for retail and other services. Infilling the station forecourt to the level of the first-storey platform provided direct access to the Up platform level but there was no level access to the Down platform except via a barrow crossing. Westgate became the main station serving Wakefield because of its location on the main line from Leeds to London. Until the mid-1960s, it had regular services to Bradford Exchange via and Ossett and via Morley Top\\"Ardsley to Laisterdyke & Dudley Hill to Low Moor, 1857 - 1966, Great Northern RailwayLost Railways - West Yorkshire; Retrieved 9 March 2020 and also to Castleford via the Methley Joint Railway, but these services fell victim to the Beeching cuts between 1964 and 1966. =Regeneration= Improvements to Westgate Station were constrained by a lack of funding. In early 2007 Network Rail announced that a ¬£1.4 million redevelopment scheme was planned for the station to take place by the end of 2009. The scheme was a part of the Westgate Key Development Area authorised by Wakefield Council. The scheme involved constructing offices, leisure, small-scale retail, hotel, restaurants and housing on the site of an old dairy and disused railway goods yards. In 2009, work on the Merchant Gate development commenced and work on the first phase was completed by September 2010.\\"Regenerating Britain‚Äôs railway stations: six case studies.\\" Rail Delivery Group, June 2017.\\"Merchant Gate, Wakefield.\\" Muse Developments, Retrieved: 7 May 2018. Four years later, Westgate Station was rebuilt at the northern end of the platforms and the former overflow car park. Key aims of the project were nearly doubling station's retail facilities, an improved forecourt area, station management centre, staff offices, a customer information point, a first class waiting room and standard class waiting facilities and the installation of new passenger information technologies and automated ticket barriers to reduce fare evasion. Better pedestrian access to the multi-storey car park and taxi ranks were provided. The concourse Few elements of the modernisation programme interfered with the operational railway except for the installation of additional canopies and the replacement footbridge. The old footbridge and some 1960's station buildings were removed. Wakefield Westgate was the first newly built station on the East Coast Main Line in decades. The programme was an element of the third phase of Merchant Gate redevelopment scheme and promoted by its backers as being a key part of the area's renewal. Network Rail was appointed by East Coast as the principal contractor for the programme and the Buckingham Group was the design-and-build subcontractor.\\"Network Rail award the ¬£6million Wakefield Westgate ‚ÄúGateway‚Äù Station to Buckingham .\\" Buckingham Group, 1 March 2013. In January 2013, after planning permission was granted onsite preparations began and in March rebuilding commenced at a cost of ¬£8.8 million, a large portion was provided via the Station Commercial Project Facility (SCPF), and 1 million each from the Access for All programme and the English Cities Fund. On 23 December 2013, the station opened to service and on 3 February 2014, it was officially opened by Secretary of State for Transport Patrick McLoughlin and blessed by the Bishop of Wakefield, Stephen Platten.\\"Government minister opens new ¬£8m Wakefield rail station.\\" Yorkshire Evening Post, 4 February 2014.\\"\\"We are spending a lot of money on stations,\\" says Transport Secretary.\\" ITV, 3 February 2014. =Gallery= File:Westgate Railway Station Wakefield - geograph.org.uk - 344782.jpgOld station February 2007 File:Westgate station entrance.jpgNew station July 2018 Services In total, there are 6 tph to Leeds with additional peak services. All northbound services call at Leeds. The station is managed by London North Eastern Railway, whose services run south from platform 1 to Doncaster and stations to London King's Cross and north from platform 2 to Leeds. A half- hourly weekday service from Wakefield to London takes approximately just over 2 hours for the journey.GB eNRT 2019-20 Edition, Table 26. CrossCountry operate train services north to Newcastle, Edinburgh and Glasgow and services south to Birmingham New Street, Exeter and the South West of England. These call every hour with some additional peak services. Northern Trains operate stopping services between Leeds and Doncaster, calling every hour on weekdays and Saturdays. An hourly stopping service also operates from Sheffield to Leeds via Rotherham. Introduced at the May 2018 Timetable change, there is now another hourly service to Leeds. This train originates at Knottingley and runs via Pontefract Monkhill and Wakefield Kirkgate. This gives a 3tph Northern Trains service to Leeds (of which, 2tph call at Outwood). East Midlands Railway services from Leeds to London St Pancras via Derby or Nottingham call at Westgate. They are three early morning departures from Leeds and up to four late afternoon/evening return trips from St Pancras.GB eNRT, Table 53 This is because the maintenance depot for former Midland Mainline HST power cars is the Maintrain depot at Neville Hill in Leeds. This provides a limited but useful service between West Yorkshire and the East Midlands. The former operator Midland Mainline had plans for a regular service between St Pancras and Leeds via the Erewash Valley and Leicester but these ambitions were ultimately rejected by the Strategic Rail Authority. Facilities The station is staffed and has an information kiosk, ticket office and self- service ticket machines, refreshments and a newsagent. Outside is a taxi rank, a cashpoint and a bus stop. Train running information is via digital display screens, timetable posters and automatic announcements. Lifts and a footbridge connect the platforms, so step-free access is available throughout the station.Wakfield Westgate station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 24 January 2017 Culture Between 1988 and 2009, a modern art sculpture, titled 'A Light Wave', created by the Leeds-based artist Charles Quick, was located on the wall behind the old bay platform on the northbound side of the station. The installation comprised a series of wooden planks laid up against a wall, in the form of waves, and illuminated from behind by a succession of lamps. The sculpture gradually fell into a state of disrepair, which prompted its removal. Wakefield Westgate appeared in the TV series A Touch of Frost as Denton Station.

Guilfoyle studied at University of California, Davis and the University of San Francisco and was a prosecuting attorney in San Francisco and Los Angeles, California. She served as an Assistant District Attorney in San Francisco from 2000 to 2004. Guilfoyle married Democratic politician and future California Governor Gavin Newsom and was First Lady of San Francisco during Newsom's first two years as mayor of that city. She is a member of the Republican Party and has been the partner of Donald Trump Jr. since 2018. She worked at Fox News from 2006 to 2018 and co-hosted The Five on the network. She later joined America First Policies, a pro-Trump super PAC, to campaign for Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections. Early life and education Guilfoyle was born in San Francisco on March 9, 1969, to a Puerto Rican mother and an Irish father. She was raised Catholic. She grew up in the Mission District of San Francisco and in Westlake, Daly City. Guilfoyle's mother, Mercedes, taught special education, and died of leukemia when Guilfoyle was eleven. Her father, Anthony \\"Tony\\" Guilfoyle, was born in Ennis, County Clare, Ireland, and immigrated to the United States in 1957 at the age of 20. In 1958, while still an Irish citizen, he was drafted and served for four years in the U.S. Army. After being discharged from the army, Tony Guilfoyle took up work in the construction trades. He later became a real estate investor and, until his death in 2008, a close advisor to Mayor Newsom. Guilfoyle graduated of San Francisco's Mercy High School and the University of California, Davis, and received her Juris Doctor from the University of San Francisco School of Law in 1994. While in law school, she interned at the San Francisco district attorney's office, and modeled for Macy's and a bridal magazine. She later studied at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland. While there, she published research in international children's rights and European Economic Community law. Law career After law school, Guilfoyle taught in a public school district, and briefly worked as a prosecutor in San Francisco, but lost her job in 1996 when Terence Hallinan was elected District Attorney and fired fourteen of the city's prosecutors. Guilfoyle then spent four years in Los Angeles as a Deputy District Attorney, working on adult and juvenile cases, including narcotics, domestic violence, kidnapping, robbery, arson, sexual assault, and homicide cases. She received several awards at the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office, including Prosecutor of the Month. In 2000, Guilfoyle was re-hired by Hallinan in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office, where she served as an Assistant District Attorney from 2000 to 2004. While an Assistant D.A., she got a conviction while co-prosecuting with James Hammer in the 2002 case People v. Noel and Knoller, a second-degree murder trial involving a dog mauling that received international attention.  Media and political career  =Television= In January 2004, Guilfoyle moved to New York to host the program Both Sides on Court TV, as well as to work as a legal analyst on Anderson Cooper 360¬∞. She joined Fox News in February 2006, as host of the weekend show The Lineup. The Lineup was eventually canceled. Guilfoyle remained a regular contributor for the network and was later picked up as co-host of The Five in 2011. She remained a host on the show until 2018. In 2014, she began co-hosting Outnumbered regularly, until the show settled on more permanent hosts. Guilfoyle also appeared weekly on the recurring segment \\"Is It Legal?\\" on The O'Reilly Factor until that show's cancellation in 2017, and as a weekly Thursday guest on Brian Kilmeade's Kilmeade and Friends radio show. Guilfoyle guest-hosted Hannity, On the Record, Justice with Judge Jeanine, and Fox and Friends. In mid-2017, Guilfoyle signed a long-term contract extension with Fox. A year later, in July 2018, Guilfoyle abruptly left Fox News; she then began working for a pro-Donald Trump super PAC. HuffPost reported that, at the time of her departure, the network had been in the midst of a year-long sexual harassment investigation into Guilfoyle. Network officials had given Guilfoyle an ultimatum‚Äîresign by the end of July or be fired. The New Yorker subsequently corroborated reports that Guilfoyle had been forced to resign, rather than leaving by choice. After Guilfoyle's departure, Fox News agreed to an out-of-court settlement with an assistant who had accused Guilfoyle of sexual harassment. Terms were not disclosed, but The New Yorker reported that the settlement was at least $4 million. The assistant alleged that Guilfoyle frequently displayed herself naked, showed photographs of the genitalia of men she had had sex with, and required her to sleep over at Guilfoyle's apartment. The New Yorker independently verified several of the assistant's allegations. =Making the Case: How to Be Your Own Best Advocate= In 2015, Guilfoyle released a semi-autobiographical and advice book titled \\"Making the Case: How to Be Your Own Best Advocate\\" on her experiences growing up, working as a prosecutor, and encouraging people to always advocate for themselves. =Trump administration and Trump 2020 campaign= Guilfoyle speaking at a campaign rally in Sun City, Arizona in November 2018 In December 2016, it was reported that Guilfoyle was being considered to serve as press secretary for President Donald Trump. Sean Spicer was considered the front-runner for the position and was ultimately selected. On the May 12, 2017, edition of The Five, co-host Bob Beckel hinted that Guilfoyle turned the job down. However, in an interview with Bay Area News Group on May 15, 2017, Guilfoyle confirmed she was in contact with the White House about the position following Spicer's resignation. \\"I'm a patriot, and it would be an honor to serve the country\\", Guilfoyle said. \\"I think it'd be a fascinating job, it's a challenging job, and you need someone really determined and focused, a great communicator in there with deep knowledge to be able to handle that position.\\" However, on May 19, Guilfoyle said she was under contract with Fox, indicating she turned down the White House. One month later she extended her contract with Fox. In 2018, The Washington Post described Guilfoyle as a \\"conservative cheerleader for President Trump.\\" Charlie Kirk, Kimberly Guilfoyle, and Donald Trump, Jr., pictured at the Palm Beach County Convention Center, 2019 In 2020, Guilfoyle was reported to be the chair of the finance committee of the Trump Victory Committee. As of early 2020, the Trump campaign was paying Guilfoyle $15,000 per month through the campaign manager's private company, Parscale Strategy. Guilfoyle has been a surrogate on the stump and taken on broad advisory roles. In the Trump 2020 campaign, Guilfoyle managed a fund-raising division. This division paid socialite Somers Farkas to raise money. The fundraising division managed by Guilfoyle was in internal turmoil amid departures of experienced staff and accusations of irresponsible spending. In July 2020, Guilfoyle was diagnosed with COVID-19, but her boyfriend, Donald Trump Jr., tested negative. The pair returned to New York. In August 2020, at the Republican National Convention, Guilfoyle gave a speech that was widely described by some observers as unnecessarily loud or unhinged, though others in media described it as passionate. She was criticized for describing herself as a first-generation American when her mother was from Puerto Rico, and hence, an American citizen. =Movie appearance= Guilfoyle appeared in the 2004 film playing a public defender opposite Ed Asner and Shirley Temple's niece, Marina Black. The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival. Personal life In 2001, Guilfoyle married Gavin Newsom, then a San Francisco city supervisor; Newsom was elected mayor of San Francisco in 2003. While married to Newsom, she went by the name Kimberly Guilfoyle Newsom. The couple appeared in the September 2004 issue of Harper's Bazaar; the spread had them posed at the Getty Villa with the title the \\"New Kennedys\\". In January 2005, citing the strain of a bi- coastal marriage, Guilfoyle and Newsom jointly filed for divorce. Their divorce was finalized on February 28, 2006. On May 27, 2006, in Barbados, Guilfoyle married furniture heir Eric Villency. Guilfoyle gave birth to their son, Ronan Anthony, on October 4, 2006. In June 2009, Guilfoyle and Villency announced that they were separating; their divorce was finalized later that year. In June 2018, Vanessa Trump, who had filed for divorce three months earlier, confirmed that Guilfoyle was dating her husband, Donald Trump Jr. The divorce was finalized at the end of 2018. In mid-2019, Guilfoyle and Trump jointly purchased a $4.4 million home in The Hamptons.

Interstellar civilization collapsed during \\"The Fall\\", when extensive civil war greatly reduced the planet's technology level. Technology has redeveloped only slowly: the most advanced groups have reached the level of double-expansion steam engines, wrapped-brass-cartridges breech-loading rifles (Martini-Henry lock or very similar) and lever-action carbines, cast- steel breech-loading cannon, simple revolvers, etc. Progress is slow: the breech-loading rifle design has not changed for over two hundred years, and other groups still use flintlock or percussion cap weapons. The concept of computer technology has become the basis of religion throughout the world, the Spirit of Man, with priestly Hierarchs, Sysups, and an Inquisition called the Anti-Viral Cleansers. This religion is split into two competing sects: The Spirit of Man of the Stars, the state religion of the Civil Government, and Spirit of Man of This Earth, which is more popular among the barbarian Military Governments. The people of Bellevue speak various evolved dialects, including Sponglish, Spanjol, Namerique and Paytoiz, with elements of English, French and Spanish apparent. At the time of the Fall the planet had no horses, so now cavalry is mounted on thousand-pound dogs of various breeds. The books begin in the Year of the Fall 1103, when the protagonist Raj Whitehall and his friend Thom Poplanich stumble on a still-working remnant of the old technology, the quantum supercomputer \\"Center\\", which Raj and Thom regard as an angel. Center describes itself as a \\"sentient artificial entity of photonic subsystems tasked with the politico-military supervision\\" of Bellevue. Center charges Whitehall with uniting Bellevue and provides him, through a constant mental link, with predictive visions that simulate probable situational outcomes, historical data, eidetic memory, and minor enhancements to physical abilities including accuracy with firearms. Raj couples these assets with his own charisma and skill to become an extremely effective military leader. Meanwhile, his wife Suzette quietly uses her own highly developed court intrigue skills to neutralize Raj's political foes and obstacles behind the scenes, compensating for his more direct tactics. Center keeps Thom in suspended animation within its sanctum, explaining that he will otherwise probably be the victim of political assassination before long, and begins to educate him in matters more related to civil administration. As Raj acknowledges (and Center's projections confirm), he would not be an effective civilian leader, but Thom‚Äîthe legitimate heir, with the assistance of Raj and Center‚Äîwill. True to their historical model, the campaigns of Belisarius, the books focus on the convoluted \\"strategic offensive, tactical defensive\\" campaigns of General Whitehall around the Midworld Sea and his fraught relationships with his paranoid but capable 'emperor' ‚Äì- Governor Barholm Clerett‚Äîand Clerett's avaricious and corrupt chancellor Tzetzas. Whitehall's nation calls itself the Civil Government, and it is centrally located between the rival nations of the Military Governments‚ÄîThe Brigade and The Squadron‚Äîand the Muslim Colonists. =Characters= Civil Government =Raj Whitehall= The protagonist of the story, Raj (Raj Halgren da Luis Whitehall, Whitehall of Hillchapel, Hereditary Supervisor of Smythe Parish, Descott County) is \\"chosen\\" by the Sector Command And Control Mk-XIV Computer he calls Center to unite Bellevue in order to restore civilization on the planet and save it from a downward spiral that, according to Center's projections, might last as long as fifteen thousand years. On his campaigns, he collects a group of Companions: able commanders who form the ad hoc overall command group of the Whitehall's armies. His campaigns begin on the border of the Civil Government with the Islamic Colony at Sandoral, then go on to the barbarian-controlled Southern Territories of The Squadron and the Western Territories of the Brigade, and culminate in his defense of the Civil Government once more at Sandoral against the Colony's main army. Throughout the series, Raj Whitehall is doubted and suspected of treason by Governor Barholm Clerett, despite continuously proving his loyalty ---- even after he thwarts an attempt on Clerett's life by ending a coup staged by Thom Poplanich's brother Des and troops led by Colonel Stanson. =Suzette Whitehall= Raj Whitehall's exceptionally intelligent, strong-willed, and resourceful wife, who accompanies him on his campaigns. (Messa Suzette Emmenalle Forstin Hogor Wenqui Whitehall, Lady of Hillchapel) The Wenqui family goes back to the Fall, poor but proud. Suzette is also close friends with Barholm's wife, Lady Anne Clerett, who started out as a child-whore near the Canidrome. Suzette uses any means necessary to convince those potentially harmful to her husband to actually help him, including sleeping with those individuals despite and perhaps because of her intense devotion to Raj. She relies on a cadre of devoted servants and spies to gather intelligence in support of her husband's career. =Companions= The Companions, men loyal to General Whitehall, form the de facto overall command group of Whitehall's Expeditionary Forces, as the Army does not have a structure of command higher than battalion level. Most of them are of the Messer class, the nobility of the Civil Government. The Companions are formed in The Forge when Whitehall is called to an incident in a farmstead during the march to Komar, and Staenbridge, Foley, the Gruders, M'brust, and M'lewis volunteer to accompany him. Captain Stanson calls them The Loyal Companions in a half- serious jest, and the name sticks. *Colonel Gerrin Staenbridge (becomes Companion in The Forge) Second in overall command, Raj Whitehall's right-hand man; directly commands 5th Descott Guards (later \\"Raj's Own\\"). Before the series begins, the boredom and idleness of garrison duty had dulled his edge, but he quickly regains it during action in the field. *Colonel Jorg Menyez (becomes Companion in The Forge) Overall infantry commander, directly commands 17th Kelden County Foot. Forced into the less-prestigious infantry due to being allergic to dogs. *Colonel Grammeck Dinnalsyn (becomes Companion in The Hammer) Overall artillery commander. Dinnalsyn, like most artillerymen in the Gubernio Civil, is somewhat of an engineer, as he is knowledgeable on matters concerning fortifications and weapons development. *Muzzaf Kerpatik (becomes Companion in The Forge) Non-military: a Komarite (Arab) trader who swears loyalty to Raj Whitehall after coming to feel shame for taking part in the dealings of Chancellor Tzetzas, which had led to the weakening of Komar's defenses. He is Raj's main logistics man and the chief steward of the Whitehalls' wealth. *Major Kaltin Gruder (becomes Companion in The Forge) Commands: 7th Descott Rangers. Was a company commander of the 5th Descott; promoted to command of the 7th Descott after the Valley of Death battle in The Forge. Disapproves of Suzette Whitehall's apparent infidelity to her husband. *Major Ehwardo Poplanich (becomes Companion in The Hammer) Commands: Poplanich's Own. This battalion is recruited from the Poplanich family's estates around East Residence. Ehwardo is cousin to Thom and Des Poplanich, and is killed in The Steel by the Brigade under the walls of Old Residence. *Captain Evrard Gruder (becomes Companion in The Forge) Younger brother of Kaltin Gruder. Killed in The Forge by a shell from a Colonial pom-pom, a light field gun with a higher rate of fire and smaller shells than the Civil Government's. *Captain Barton Foley (becomes Companion in The Forge) Commands: A Company, 5th Descott Guards. Loses his left hand in The Forge to a pom-pom shell; he replaces it with a sharpened hook. Foley is Gerrin Staenbridge's protege-cum-boyfriend, and is fond of literature. Before every major battle in the field, Foley gives the following toast to end staff meetings: \\"He fears his fate too much, and his desserts are small, he who will not put it to the touch --- to win or lose it all.\\". Foley's interest in literature will garner him an award for his book, Raj Whitehall and His Times, which he writes after Thom Poplanich is enChaired as Governor and Center declares the Fall to be ended. *Senior Captain Antin M'lewis (becomes Companion in The Forge) Commands: 5th Descott Guards' Scout Unit (The Forty Thieves). Hails from Bufford Parish, the most lawless part of not-so-lawful Descott County. Distinguished by his wire garrote and the skinning knife he carries on his left side. M'lewis meets Raj Whitehall when he is brought before Raj concerning a farmer's pig (or a shoat) gone missing despite a no-foraging order. He gains Raj's confidence and eventually heads a special team of similar characters known as the \\"40 Thieves\\", leading them through intimidation and example through scouting missions into enemy territory. *Major Mekkle Thiddo (becomes Companion in The Hammer) A junior Lieutenant in the 5th, he was supposed dead in the retreat from El Djem. However, he survives and rises to command the 1st Rogor Slashers at the start of the Southern Territories campaign. Shot under truce banner after parley with Squadrone Admiral Auburn. *Major Tejan M'brust (becomes Companion in The Hammer) Commands: 1st Rogor Slashers, then 2nd Cruisers. Takes command of 1st Rogor Slashers after death of Mekkle Thiddo in The Hammer; later transferred to the 2nd Cruisers in The Anvil. *Major Peydaro Belagez (becomes Companion in The Forge) Commands: 1st Rogor Slashers, after Tejan M'Brust is transferred to 2nd Cruisers. Responsible (with Muzzaf Kerpatik) for the capture of the Squadrones responsible for the murder of Mekkle Thiddo, and their crucifixion at Raj's orders. *Major Hadolfo Zahpata (becomes Companion in The Hammer) Commands: 18th Komar Borderers. *Major Ludwig Bellamy (becomes Companion in The Hammer) Commands: 1st Cruisers, ex-Squadrone soldiers conscripted into the Civil Government Army. The son of one of the first local warlords to seek allegiance with Whitehall's invasion force. *Major Teodore Welf (becomes Companion in The Steel) Commands: 1/591st, 2/591st, 3/591st ex-Brigaderos soldiers conscripted into the Civil Government Army. Formerly second-in- overall-command of the Brigade, a position he shared with Grand Constable Howyard Carstens, under General of the Brigade Ingreid Manfrond. =Center= Center (Sector Command and Control Unit AZ12-b14-c000 Mk. XIV) is an artificial intelligence attempting to unite planet Bellevue and restore technological civilization, with the intent to later restore faster- than-light travel and then reestablish civilization on the other planets of the collapsed interplanetary federation. Center's original purpose, prior to the collapse of civilization, appears to have been as a system for tactical and strategic command of the \\"local\\" military units (the original scope of \\"local\\" is never made clear). Center originates with the collapsed Federation and the original Civil Government, and its alignment with the current Civil Government is due simply to the geographical accident of being located below the capital city. Due to the destruction of Center's external sensors (orbiting satellites etc.) during the Fall, Center is limited to data either obtained previously or via the link to Raj Whitehall's senses and thoughts. Center provides constant probabilistic analysis and future projections of the political, social and military situation. This analysis is essential in steering choices away from local optimum, decisions that appear correct at the time but which would lead to eventual disaster. Center also provides historical references to Earth's history that relate to technology and specific relevant historical conflicts. Center is not merely an assistant; it is clearly the driving force behind Raj Whitehall, using Whitehall's leadership to achieve Center's goals. Initially Whitehall's cooperation is due to superstitious obedience to what he perceives as a supernatural entity, then the relationship becomes increasingly more cooperative as Whitehall understands the true situation and the necessity of his actions. Center's stated sole motivation is the \\"betterment of mankind\\", to bring about the end of war by creating a united society. On Bellevue most people are peasants, the bottom rung in the agrarian economies, due to the mostly feudal and autocratic forms of government; this greatly limits their ability to achieve their full potential. Center plans to bring about stability, technological advancement and democracy, in that order. Mostly analytic and unengaged, Center's comments occasionally have an \\"emotional\\" shade, most often in the form of ironic humour. The Colony =The Settler= Absolute despot of The Colony. Required to be perfect in body under Islamic law. =Jamal= The Settler of The Colony in The Forge; killed during the Battle of Sandoral and his head brought to Raj Whitehall by Skinner Chief Juluk. =Ali ibn'Jamal= Became Settler after defeating his brother Akbar in a civil war following their father's death. He is cowardly, cruel, capricious, vindictive, and psychotic. Killed, presumably by his brother Tewfik (who brings his head to Raj as a peace offering), in The Sword. =Tewfik ibn'Jamal= Military commander of The Colony and brother to The Settler; would probably have been The Settler, had not an eye lost in combat disqualified him as imperfect in body. Possibly a more capable combat commander than even Raj Whitehall. Mainly appears in the first and fifth volumes of the series. =Nations and Barbarians= The Civil Government/Gubernio Civil Remnants of those who remained loyal to the Federation and the civilian government capitaled in the city of East Residence; it is the planet's most technologically advanced nation. The Civil Government is governed by a hierarchy of Ministers headed by a single Governor, who is also the head of the Church of Holy Federation and Viceregent of the Spirit of Man. Governors are placed on the Chair either by hereditary inheritance or by \\"shooting their way onto the Chair\\" ---- a coup, usually by a successful general, but sometimes a defeated one. This fear of military coups is why the Civil Government has no military structure above the brigade level. This lack of a higher command is one of the reasons why the Civil Government had suffered the loss of the Western and Southern Territories to the Brigade and Squadron respectively over the centuries. Raj Whitehall believes that the Civil Government is the legitimate ruler of all Bellevue. Residents of the Civil Government speak Sponglish, a mangled version of Spanish and English which apparently is descended primarily from Mexican Spanish. This state is modeled on the Byzantine Empire. The Colony Nation established by Islamic/Arab settlers; technologically second only to the Civil Government. The Colonists were the first to arrive on planet Bellevue during the Last Jihad, bearing a fragment of the Kaaba from, as the books describe, \\"burning Mecca.\\" The Colonist capital of Al Kebir is the oldest city in the planet. The Colony ruler is The Settler, and, as in the Civil Government, the right to the throne is settled either by hereditary inheritance or civil war, the latter usually a result of a dispute among multiple heirs to the throne. Those who are not whole in body (i.e. missing a limb or other body part) are ineligible to claim the throne, which is why Tewfik ibn'Jamal cannot become Settler: he lost an eye in the Zanj campaigns. Residents of the Colony speak Arabic. This state is modeled on the Sassanid Empire of Belisarius's time. Other Muslims also exist; Abdullah Al'aziz is a Druze whose life and family are saved by Suzette Whitehall, and who repays her by serving as her chief spy. The Brigade/Brigaderos Barbarian Military Government established by the descendants of the 591st Provisional Brigade; the most technologically advanced of the Military Governments. The Brigade, having moved from south their original lands, referred to as the \\"Base Area\\", has ruled the former Civil Government Western Territories for six hundred years. All male members of the Brigade are referred to as \\"Unit Brothers\\". The ruling or noble class of the Brigade (referred to as \\"brazazz\\" or \\"brass ass\\") bear titles that refer to the Brigade's former military organization based on officer ranks, such as \\"Hereditary Captain\\" or \\"Hereditary Colonel.\\" The Brigade is ruled by hereditary king with the title of \\"General of the Brigade\\". The General may be disposed by impeachment if called for and voted on by the members of noble class at an assembly at arms. The Brigade, unlike the Squadron, maintains a standing army with a system of compulsory service, as well as requiring nobles to contribute household troops in time of war. Brigade forces use rifle-muskets, which are primitive compared to the Armory breech-loaders used by the Civil Government Army. All Brigadero's carry a basket-hilt broadsword in conjunction with cap and ball revolvers. The Brigade do not field infantry, but only cavalry and a few brass or bronze cast siege cannon. Cavalry units are split between mounted dragoons and lancers, who also carry two-meter long lances. Brigadero soldiers wear front-and-back breastplates, which are resistant to the hollow-point lead bullets fired by Civil Government rifles; this leads the Civil Government army to switch to brass-tipped bullets to puncture such armor. Residents of The Brigade speak the dialects of Spanjol and Namerique, remnants of Spanish and French/English respectively. This state is modeled on the Ostrogoths of Belisarius's time. The Squadron / Squadrones Barbarian Military Government established by the descendants of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron. Despite having conquered the Civil Government Southern Territories some 200 years ago, and resisting at least one prior Civil Government expedition to retake the lost Territories, the Squadron is less developed than the Brigade, and with a more maritime orientation. Ruled by a hereditary king, bearing the title of \\"Admiral,\\" the Squadron does not have a standing army, but in times of war calls forth the \\"war levy\\" composed of all male Squadron members of fighting age. Armed with flintlock muskets, blunderbusses, axes and broadswords, Squadron warriors traditionally fight under household banners or associations and are noted for delivering frenzied charges into close combat with their foes. The Squadrones can be likened to the Germanic or Norse berserkers, both from physical appearance (they are described as large, pale-skinned and well-built and some with Suebian knots) and from their apparent love for combat; it is shameful in their culture to shun or flee from battle. In Raj Whitehall's campaign in the Southern Territories, the Squadrones literally charge into the fire of the Civil Government field guns and are comprehensively defeated. Residents of the Squadron's lands speak the dialects of Spanjol and Namerique, remnants of Spanish and French/English respectively. This state is modeled on the Vandals of Belisarius's time. The Skinners Barbarian nomads employed by the Civil Government as mercenaries. Notorious anarchists, with a reputation for marksmanship, dog riding, and atrocities. The Skinners speak a mangled mixture of English and French, \\"Paytoiz\\". They are reminiscent of the Huns. There are many references to the Skinners coming from French Canada, particularly Quebec. One of the groups is the \\"Trois Rivi√®re\\" tribe. There are also examples of French Canadian names. This also explains the mixture of French and English. The Zanj Little is known of the Zanj City States or its people, other than that Tewfik ibn'Jamal lost his eye while campaigning there, and that it is the source of kave (coffee) and the extremely valuable torofib silk. The Zanj are practitioners of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. This form of worship is particularly offensive to the orthodox Sunni Muslims of The Colony, and perhaps the source and cause of the Zanj Wars. Others =Chosen series= In the follow-up novel The Chosen, a copy of Center, along with the recorded mind of Raj Whitehall, is sent to the planet Visager to help boost that society to the point where it too can join what has now become Bellevue's multi-world Federation. This time, Center recruits half-brothers Jeffrey Farr and John Hosten to help remake a world. Standing in their way is a nation of eugenically bred warriors called the Chosen, the strongest, most technologically advanced military force on the planet, who believe that all non-Chosen are merely slaves who haven't been caught yet. The novel's setting is based on Europe (with recognizable analogues for England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) during the early 20th century, before and after World War I, and on what David Drake considered the reality of S. M. Stirling's Draka universe. =Hafardine= The next two books also have Center & Raj in their overseer/advisor roles, assisting Adrian Gellert, whose brother Esmond also plays a pivotal role in bringing back civilization to Hafardine. It is based upon the fall of the Roman Republic. =Duisberg= Duisberg is based on an Ancient Egyptian model. The first book in the new setting became available April 2013. Center & Raj assist Abel Dashian, the son of a military officer, in his attempt to take down a supercomputer that suppresses societal advancement. If Dashian succeeds, then civilization will be allowed to progress on Duisberg. =Additional books/outlines= There was an outline for a book called The Green Planet, which had implementation problems and was canned. The author states it was \\"probably a bad idea (no, it wasn't my idea, but I acquiesced); it's unlikely ever to be turned into a novel.\\" References External links * Raj Whitehall Universe listing at SciFan ** Series listing for original series at SciFan ** Series listing for follow- on series at SciFan * Review of \\"The Tyrant\\" at Kirkus Reviews Reviews Online Military science fiction novels Novel series ","title":"The General series"},{"id":"1385954","text":"Airmyn is a village and civil parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is situated at the mouth of the River Aire with the River Ouse, approximately north-west of Goole. It lies to the west of the M62 motorway and the A614 road. According to the 2011 UK census, Airmyn parish had a population of 768, a fall from the 2001 UK census figure of 795. The parish covers an area of . The parish was part of the Goole Rural District in the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1894 to 1974, then in Boothferry district of Humberside until 1996. In the Middle Ages, Airmyn was a small port, and up to the 18th century its dead were taken by boat upstream to be buried at Snaith, as it was quicker to go by river than by horse and cart. Buildings High Street, Airmyn St David's Church, Airmyn The village has its own primary school, Airmyn Park Primary School, which holds just over 100 pupils. The present building was opened in 1991, and has four classrooms, together with a hall, communal areas and offices. It was designed for 105 children. Before moving to the new building, the school was located on High Street, in a building which was erected in 1834 by George Percy, the Earl of Beverley. It was intended to be a Sunday School, but was being used as a day-school by 1840, and was able to accommodate 120 pupils. Near the old school is a clock tower, designed by Henry Francis Lockwood of Bradford and built in 1865, which was paid for by the village population, to honour the memory of the second Earl, who funded the building of the school. There is a memorial hall located next to the village field, and \\"Woodland Park\\", named by an Airmyn Park Primary School pupil. A Post Office at the Memorial Hall is open twice a week and staffed by volunteers. The parish church of St David's is a Grade II listed building originally built in 1318 and extended in 1676. The roof was replaced with a new one of Westmorland slate in 1858, as part of refurbishments that also included a bellcote and a porch on the west end. It also has a graveyard. Port of Airmyn Although the River Aire joins the Ouse at Airmyn, the main port facilities for the Aire and Calder Navigation were originally further upstream at Rawcliffe. However, in 1736 they decided to buy land at Airmyn, as the water was deeper, and larger vessels could not always reach Rawcliffe, particularly on neap tides. The land was bought in 1744, and Airmyn gradually replaced Rawcliffe, as staithes, woolsheds, a crane and various other buildings were erected by those who leased the navigation. In 1750, the Aire and Calder Company repaid those who had built the facilities, and took ownership of them. By 1774, most of the Aire and Calder staff were also based at Airmyn. It became possible to catch a ship from Airmyn to London, as a regular service began in 1758, charging the same fares as those from Hull to London. Success was short-lived. In 1774, the Aire and Calder decided to build the Selby Canal, which would bypass the lower Aire and join the Ouse further upstream. Until then, Airmyn had acted as a transshipment point, where cargo was transferred from seagoing ships to river vessels. A new woolshed was built in 1775, and there was a coal yard, where coal was sold. Six staff were employed to manage the facility, which was also the base for the company's river boats. In one week in July 1775, 19 boats were loaded, and nine vessels, one from London and eight from Hull, had arrived within a four-day period. Once the Selby Canal opened in 1776, decline was rapid. The coalyard and the offices closed in 1779, and two years later, all buildings on the north bank of the river were demolished, while those on the south bank were sold. The boat repair yard closed soon afterwards. Airmyn, along with nearby Rawcliffe, was the location of one of the first reliable reports of the practice of warping in agriculture in the 1730s. This was the temporary flooding of fields so as to fertilise the soil with the silt left behind.

The Virtual Hebrides was founded by photographer and film maker Sam Maynard , who had set up E√≤las Media ‚Äî a TV production company largely working through the medium of the Gaelic language ‚Äî and Scott Hatton, who in the early days of the World Wide Web had been running one of the first internet-based communities. As the first major website in the Scottish islands and based in a community where nearly everybody knows everybody else, its influence stretched far beyond that of most other websites. The staff of Eolas photographed in 1997 The Hebrides are agrarian economies, with small, close-knit, widely distributed populations and largely based on crofting, fishing and tourism. Like many marginal communities, they face the problem of depopulation of the traditional communities with young, skilled islanders moving away, matched with incomers looking for a \\"get away from at all\\" life. This can cause clashes of interest and culture. The Virtual Hebrides took these issues head- on with its twin mottos of \\"live local, work global\\" and \\"we are all islanders on the net\\". It was many things to many people: a Hebrides encyclopedia of articles, a virtual community, a local history project, a promoter of Scottish Gaelic on the internet, a genealogy forum and a campaigning platform for rural equality, amongst other aims. At one point in 1995 it claimed to be the largest rural website in the world as measured by visitors to its many pages. Based in such a small economy, the Virtual Hebrides was perhaps doomed to failure. Money was poured in from its parent company E√≤las Media. Scott Hatton left in 1998 to work on the GlobalGuide project and was replaced by Alex Tearse. It was identified that the site had become rambling with many pages having little or no content and it was also noticed the many independent local sites that were beginning to appear. It was decided that the Virtual Hebrides would be rebuilt to become the central hub for all of these local sites while remaining the main resource for Hebrides related information and discussions were held with local sites to this end. On a larger scale, it was also decided to capitalise on past investment and build 'Region in a Box' a formatted version of the site to be sold to any region wanting representation in cyber space. One of the 'Virtual hebrides' most notable innovations was the use of maps and over-laid satellite images as a central search interface. Despite there being serious interest from a number of potential purchasers of 'Region In A Box' and Eolas Media as a progressive media convergent company, before agreements were made, the company found themselves in financial difficulties and went into voluntary liquidation. By 2000 both the Virtual Hebrides and E√≤las Media were no more. While its influence can be overstated, especially in the southern Outer Hebrides, (it was based in Stornoway, Lewis), it was at least partly responsible for opening up the Hebrides to new ways of working. Some Hebrideans began to look to new media for their living. It was realised that, in the world of the internet, geographical location was suddenly less important. Subsequently, an initiative in North Lochs championed teleworking, a call centre became of one Stornoway's largest employers and a campaign for reasonably priced broadband started in the islands. Incidentally, whilst by no means the first use of the word ('virtual reality' had been around since 1989)), perhaps due to this website, the prefix \\"Virtual\\" became endemic on the world wide web for a while in the mid 1990s. Within a few months of the failure of the original Virtual Hebrides various attempts were made to resurrect the site. A number of local sites were amalgamated with an archive of the original site to create a new Virtual Hebrides External links * The Virtual Hebrides - Guide to the Inner and Outer Hebrides * The Photography of Sam Maynard Outer Hebrides Community websites Scottish websites ","title":"Virtual Hebrides"},{"id":"1385956","text":"M√∂x√§mm√§t √Ñmin or M√∂xamm√§d√§min (, ; also spelled Muhammad Amin or Emin via ) (c. 1469 - 1518) was three times a pro-Russian khan of Kazan. Family: His father, khan Ibrahim of Kazan (r. 1467-79), had at least two wives. His first wife was the Nogai princess Fatima who gave birth to khan Ilham Ghali of Kazan (r. 1479-84 and 1485-87). Another wife was Nur Soltan, daughter of the Nogai Timur, who had been married to Ibraham‚Äôs brother and predecessor, khan X√§lil of Kazan (r. 1466-67) and after his death married Crimean khan Mengli Ghirai (r 1478-1515). She gave birth to Muhammad Amin and his younger brother khan Ghabdellatif of Kazan (r. 1496-1502). History 1479: When Ibrahim died in 1479 the pro-Russian party supported the 10-year old Muhammed Amin while the eastern or anti-Russian party wanted his elder half-brother Ilham. Ilham took the throne with Nogai help and Muhammed Amin fled, or was taken, to Moscow where he was given the fief of Kashira. 1479-84: first Ilham: In 1482 Ivan III sent an army against Ilham, but an arrangement was made and the Muscovite army went home. In this campaign, for the first time in history the Muscovite army had cannon. In 1484 another army was sent, Ilham was deposed and Muhammad Amin put in his place. First reign 1484-85: He was probably too young to be an effective ruler and a year later Ilham returned to the throne with the support of a Russian army. 1485-87: second Ilham: A group of Kazan nobles sent a letter to Ivan III saying: We released Mahmet-Amin to you in case if Aleham does us foul, you would let Mahmet-Amin back to us. When Aleham found out of this, he asked as to a feast where tried to slay us, but we ran to the steppe. Ivan III sent another army to Kazan. Kazan was besieged in April 1487 and fell on 9 July. Ilham was arrested and exiled to Vologda, where he soon died. His wife and children were sent to Beloozero. A number of nobles were executed. Second reign 1487-95: M√∂xamm√§d√§min became khan again. Although the khanate remained formally independent, Ivan III started to use the title Duke of Bulgaria among his other titles. During this reign M√∂xamm√§d√§min was closely monitored by Ivan III. M√∂xamm√§d√§min corresponded with Crimean Khanate. All correspondence was sent through Moscow, translated into Russian for Ivan III to read. In 1491, when the Great Horde attempted to invade the Crimean Khanate, Kazan troops participated in a raid against it, together with Muscovy, Qasim Khanate, and the Nogays. 1495-1502: In 1495, the \\"eastern\\" or Nogai faction called in Mamuq, a Shaibanid from the Siberian khanate. Muhammad Amin called in a Russian army and Mamuq drew back, but when the Russians went home Mamuq seized Kazan and Mohammad Amin fled to Moscow. Next year, when Mamuq returned from a raid on Arsk, the city closed its gates and Mamuq was forced to return to Siberia. This time the qarachi and particularly Qol Axmat objected to the return of Muhammad Amin, citing \\"abuse and dishonor to women\\" from him. The throne was given to his younger brother Ghabdellatif of Kazan. In 1502 Ghabdellatif was removed by Russia and a local faction. Third reign 1502-18: Muhammad Amin again became khan, put Qol Axmat to death and married the widow of his brother Ilham. His new wife turned him against Moscow. In June 1505 he slaughtered the Russian merchants who had gathered for the annual fair and confiscated their goods. He marched west and burned the suburbs of Nizhny Novgorod but could not take the place because the local commander had armed 300 Lithuanian prisoners of war. He abandoned the siege because of a quarrel with his Nogai allies and returned home, the Russians not following him. In 1506 two armies were sent. The first went by water, attacked too soon and was defeated. The second arrived unexpectedly, almost won, but fell to looting and was destroyed by a counter attack. A third army was sent, but Kazan offered peace, which was accepted. In 1510 his mother Nur Soltan went from Crimea to Moscow and Kazan and improved relations between the two powers. He died in 1519 after a difficult illness. Since he left no children the throne went to Shahghali of the Qasim Khanate. M√∂xamm√§d√§min was also a prominent Old Tatar language poet. His son M√∂x√§mm√§dyar, born from his wife ≈û√§wli√§bik√§, also was one of the most prominent Tatar poets.

Its foundation is traced to a religious celibate who came from the Punjab towards the end of the 18th century. From the founder it passed through a succession of chosen disciples until 1879, when the British government recognized the ruler as an hereditary chief and it came to be known as princely state of Raj Nandgaon. Afterwards conferred upon his son the title of Raja Bahadur. The first ruler Ghasi Das Mahant was recognized as a feudal chief by the British government in 1865 and was granted a sanad of adoption.

Fatality estimates vary widely. A field survey by University of Nanking led by John Lossing Buck immediately after the flood found \\"150,000 people had drowned, and that this number represented less than a quarter of all fatalities during the first 100 days of the flood.\\" The official report found 140,000 drownedThe figure of 140,000 is also cited in and claims that \\"2 million people died during the flood, having drowned or died from lack of food\\". A cholera epidemic in the subsequent year, from May 1932, was officially reported to have 31,974 deaths and 100,666 cases. A popular high-end estimate of 3.7 to 4.0 million fatalities \\"enjoys great currency online, helping the 1931 flood to secure its position on sensationalist lists of the world‚Äôs deadliest disasters.\\" Meteorological causes and physical consequences From 1928 to 1930, China was afflicted by a long drought. The subsequent winter of 1930 was particularly harsh, creating large deposits of snow and ice in mountainous areas. In early 1931, melting snow and ice flowed downstream and arrived in the middle course of the Yangtze during a period of heavy spring rain. Ordinarily, the region experienced three periods of high water during the spring, summer and fall, respectively; however, in early 1931, there was a single continuous deluge. By June, those living in low areas had already been forced to abandon their homes. The summer was also characterized by extreme cyclonic activity. In July of that year alone, nine cyclones hit the region, which was significantly above the average of two per year.Pietz, David (2002). Engineering the State: The Huai River and Reconstruction in Nationalist China 1927‚Äì1937. Routledge. . pp. xvii, 61‚Äì70. Four weather stations along the Yangtze River reported rain totaling over for the month. The water flowing through the Yangtze reached its highest level since record-keeping began in the mid-nineteenth century. That autumn, further heavy rain added to the problem and some rivers did not return to their normal courses until November. The floods inundated approximately ‚Äì an area equivalent in size to England and half of Scotland, or the states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut combined. The high-water mark recorded on 19 August at Hankou in Wuhan showed water levels above the average, an average of above the Shanghai Bund.Winchester, Simon (2004). The River at the Center of the World: A Journey Up the Yangtze, and Back in Chinese Time. Macmillan. . In Chinese, this event is commonly known as Ê±üÊ∑ÆÊ∞¥ÁÅæ, which roughly translates to \\"Yangtze-Huai Flood Disaster.\\" This name, however, fails to capture the massive scale of flooding. Waterways throughout much of the country were inundated, particularly the Yellow River and Grand Canal. The eight most seriously affected provinces were Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Henan and Shandong. Beyond the core flood zone, areas as far south as Guangdong, as far north as Manchuria, and as far west as Sichuan were also inundated. Death toll and damage Victims of the flooding in August 1931 At the time the government estimated that 25 million people had been affected by the flood. Historians since have suggested that the true number may have been as many as 53 million. Estimated death tolls also vary widely. Contemporary studies conducted by John Lossing Buck allege that at least 150,000 people had drowned in the first few months of the flood, with hundreds of thousands more dying of starvation and disease over the following year. Using contemporary media reports, Chinese historians led by Li Wenhai have calculated the death toll at 422,499. Some Western sources allege that death toll of between 3.7 and 4 million people based on their own claims of famine and disease.\\"Dealing with the Deluge\\". PBS NOVA Online. 26 March 1996.

Throughout the whole Yangtze Valley around 15% of the wheat and rice crops were destroyed, with the proportion being much higher in the flood-affected areas.Y.Y. Kueh Agricultural Instability in China, 1931‚Äì1990: Weather, Technology, and Institutions Oxford University Press, 1995, The disaster also caused an economic shock with the price of vital commodities rising rapidly. The combined ecological and economic impacts of the disaster caused many areas to descend into famine. With no food, people were reduced to eating tree bark, weeds, and earth. Some sold their children to survive, while others resorted to cannibalism. The most lethal effect of the flood was the diseases that swept through the refugee population due to displacement, overcrowding, and the breakdown of sanitation. These included cholera, measles, malaria, dysentery, and schistosomiasis. As well as inundating rural areas, the flood caused widespread destruction to a number of cities. Refugees had been arriving in the city of Wuhan since the late spring. When the city itself was inundated in the early summer and after a catastrophic dike failure at just before 6:00 AM on July 27, around 782,189 urban citizens and rural refugees were left homeless. The flood covered an area of and the city was flooded under many feet of water for close to three months. Large numbers gathered on flood islands throughout the city, with 30,000 sheltering on a railway embankment in central Hankou. With little food and a complete breakdown in sanitation, thousands soon began to succumb to diseases. The city of Nanjing, then the capital of Republican China, was also severely affected by the disaster. One of the most disastrous single events during the flood occurred on 25 August 1931, when the water rushing through the Grand Canal washed away dikes near Gaoyou Lake. In Gaoyou County alone, 18,000 people drowned and 58,000 died due to famine and diseases the following year. Rebuilding of dikes at Lake Gaoyou  Thomas Harnsberger, a missionary of the Presbyterian Church in Taizhou, Jiangsu, was one of the two central figures (alongside General Wang Shuxiang, a PhD in hydraulics) who supervised the rebuilding of the dikes at Lake Gaoyou, as well as securing the funds for it. However, the flood remain widely unknown to the Chinese. Steve Harnsberger, the grandson of Thomas Harnsberger, wrote in 2007, \\"The 1931 flood killed 15 times the number of people lost in the Indonesian tsunamis of December 2004, and yet scarcely a word has been written of it. History focused instead on other disasters that year. China‚Äôs attention was on a civil war between the Communists and Nationalists (Note: Third encirclement campaign against the Jiangxi Soviet); the Japanese were invading in the North (Note: Japanese invasion of Manchuria), while the world was deep into the Great Depression.\\" Note: this is a biographical website built by Steve Harnsberger dedicated to his grandfather Thomas Harnsberger's missionary work in China. Government reactions =Republican Era (1930s‚Äì1940s)= The 1931 flood was one of the first major tests for the Kuomintang Government. As the scale of the disaster became apparent, the government established the National Flood Relief Commission under the auspices of T.V. Soong, a prominent politician in the Kuomintang and brother-in-law of Chiang Kai-shek. The commission employed a range of Chinese and foreign experts, including figures such as famous epidemiologist Wu Liande, health minister Liu Ruiheng, public health worker John Grant, and hydraulic engineer Oliver Todd. It also secured the assistance of the League of Nations. Even the famous aviators Charles Lindbergh and his wife Anne Lindbergh became involved, as they were commissioned to conduct an aerial survey of the flood zone. Although Song Ziwen remained the head of the commission, the day-to-day running the relief effort was entrusted to John Hope Simpson, a British refugee expert. Charity poured in to help with the relief effort from throughout the world, with overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia being particularly generous. In the United States, the celebrated author Pearl Buck wrote short stories to encourage charitable donations. The relief effort become much more difficult following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in the autumn of 1931, which caused the Chinese bond market to collapse. Eventually, the government managed to secure a large loan of wheat and flour from the United States. In the wake of the disaster, the government set up organizations such as the Huai River Conservancy Commission to address flood problems. However, due to a lack of funding and the chaos of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the subsequent Chinese Civil War, the various commissions were only able to construct small dams along the Yangtze River.Li, Cheng & Barnett, Arthur Doak (1997). Rediscovering China: Dynamics and Dilemmas of Reform. Rowman & Littlefield. . pp. 168‚Äì169. As part of an anti- superstition campaign by the Kuomintang Government, a Dragon King Temple was demolished in Wuhan shortly before the flood hit. This coincidence led to widespread discontent afterward, as many locals linked the disaster to the anger of Dragon King, a rainmaking deity. As a response, prominent officials, including He Baohua, mayor of Wuhan, and Xia Douyin, then the local garrison commander and later governor of Hubei Province, held ritual ceremonies and kowtowed to the deity. Meanwhile, many believed that evacuation efforts were hindered by superstition. According to a contemporary report, thousands \\"are convinced that Hankow is doomed and refuse to help themselves or be helped. They sit stoically awaiting death.\\" =Communist Era (1949‚Äìpresent)= In 1953, after the end of the Chinese Civil War, Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong traveled to areas neighboring the Yangtze River to promote the Three Gorges Dam flood control project. \\"The Socialist Three Gorges Dam project should excel other major projects in Chinese history such as Qin Shi Huang's Great Wall and Sui Yang Di's Grand Canal\\", he stated. Scientists and officials who raised doubts, such as Chen Mingshu, were persecuted as rightists. Li Siguang, a prominent scientist and minister of geological resources, told Mao he would commit suicide if he could not stop the construction of the dam. The project did not move beyond the planning stage in Mao's time, due to a lack of resources, rising Sino-Soviet tensions and the disruptions of the Great Leap Forward. The project was restarted in the 1980s, and the hydroelectric Three Gorges Dam began full operation in 2012, becoming the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity.

It flows generally north-westward to the Liard River, a tributary of the Mackenzie River, which empties into the Arctic Ocean. The river drains a watershed of and is formed by the confluence of the Fontas River flowing from the east, and the Sikanni Chief River flowing from the south. These, along with the Sahtaneh and Muskwa Rivers constitute the major tributaries. The source of the Sikanni Chief, on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, is ultimately the headwater of the Fort Nelson River. The land through which the river flows is generally flat, a mixture of boreal forests and muskeg. The area is rich in wildlife, and forestry and mining (especially oil and gas) are major industries. History The river has a rich history. The Dene and Sekani First Nations used it for food and trade. The river itself is named for the town of Fort Nelson, established in 1805 by the North West Company as a fur trading post near the river's junction with the Muskwa River. With the abandonment of the village and trading post at Nelson Forks and Fort Nelson's relocation roughly 8 kilometres southwest up the Muskwa River to better access the Alaska Highway built in the 1940s, there are no longer any communities along this river. Fort Nelson River in western Canada The Fort Nelson River is formed at the confluence of Sikanni Chief River and Fontas River, at an elevation of . It flows north-west and north, while the course is paralleled by BC Rail tracks north of Fontas. It receives waters from the Elleh Creek and Klua Creek, then follows a north-west direction, a short distance from Andy Bailey Provincial Park.Andy Bailey Provincial Park It turns again north near Fort Nelson, where the Muskwa River flows into the Fort Nelson River. Further north it receives the McConachie Creek, Cridland Creek and Sahtaneh River, which also carries waters from the Snake River. It then turns north-west and west, where it receives the Shush Creek, Onion Creek, Tsimeh Creek, Stanolind Creek and Kiwigana River. It is then crossed by the Liard Highway and continues westwards, receiving waters from Tsoo Creek, Etane Creek, Obole Creek and Capot-Blanc Creek. It flows into the Liard River at Nelson Forks, at an elevation of . Its waters are carried through the Liard River and Mackenzie River into the Arctic Ocean. Local disagreement Locally, particularly among the Dene and Cree population of Fort Nelson First Nation it is taught that the Fort Nelson River is not formed by the confluence of the Fontas and Sikinni Chief Rivers, but is instead formed further downriver by the Sikinni Chief's meeting with the larger Muskwa River, notably the former location of Fort Nelson, the community from which the river takes its name. The site was largely abandoned in favour of the community's current location and the nearby Fort Nelson First Nation reserve in the decades following the Second World War as the Alaska Highway usurped the river systems' place as the area's prime means of transportation. The discrepancy in beliefs is believed to trace back to the various surveyors who explored the land in the 19th and early 20th centuries, their work developing into the official view of the Fort Nelson River and its course, which can be seen on most maps and other documentation today, though the official view is almost entirely ignored locally.

Most Kuchen have eggs, flour and sugar as common ingredients while also, but not always, including some fat.

In Germany it is a common tradition to invite friends over to one's house or to a cafe between noon and evening to drink coffee and eat Kuchen (\\"Kaffee und Kuchen\\"). The term itself may cover as many distinct desserts as its English counterpart \\"cake\\". However, the word \\"cake\\" covers both Kuchen and Torte, sometimes confused with one another, the key difference being that a Torte is a Kuchen that is decorated or layered with cream, frosting, ganache, or fruit based filling after baking. A Kuchen is typically less decorative or fancy in nature. On the other hand, the word \\"Kuchen\\" covers desserts that English would call \\"pie\\", such as Apfelkuchen (apple pie). Examples of a Torte made from a base Kuchen include the Jewish Palacsinken Torte and Mohn Torte (or Kindli). Varieties * A pie-like pastry, with a thick, \\"cakey\\" crust and a sweet custard based or chopped fruit topping, known as an Obstkuchen or a type of fruit cake.

This is sometimes known as a nut roll when nuts are added. * A coffee cake-like pastry, marbled with veins and pockets of cinnamon, baked throughout; its primary components are butter and sugar. A marble cake or pound cake would be variations of this form, specifically known as a Marmorkuchen and R√ºhrkuchen respectively. Streuselkuchen is a variation of this form. * A cheese cake-like pastry, specifically called K√§sekuchen, with a yeast raised crust, sometimes filled with fruit (cherry is most popular), and a creamy filling made from the German cheese Quark. * A pan-fried pastry, specifically known as Pfannkuchen, a German pancake thicker than French Crepes and often filled with a sweet or savory filling. An egg based variation is called Eierkuchen.Baumkuchen * A layered pastry, commonly known as a Baumkuchen, made over a spit while brushing on layers of batter. * A sheet-cake-like pastry, specifically known as Blechkuchen, with variations similar to other forms of Kuchen with the key difference being that this form is baked on a sheet. Can be butter based, known as Butterkuchen, or filled with fruit. Lebkuchen is one such variation commonly made during Christmas. Kuchen also does not have to fall under a sweet category as there are savory variations of it as well. These are called Pikante Kuchen, with examples such as Zwiebelkuchen, Speckkuchen, and Kartoffelkuchen (often paired with fresh wine or beer). Jewish variations and traditions In the United States, back when Jewish immigrants were first arriving in the country, many of the recipes that they brought with them utilized dried fruits as it was difficult to come across fresh ones in their home countries. One that was particularly favored is compote. Desserts have long since changed to become more sophisticated as fresh fruits are now abundant. Lekach is a Jewish honey cake of German origin. It comes from Lebkuchen, or honey-sweetened gingerbread. This has roots from as early as the twelfth century, when it was customary for boys attending heder (school for Jewish children) to bring a piece of honey cake to the first day of school. Rugelach is a form of the rolled-pastry variation of Kuchen. They are usually filled with nuts and raisins, with a pastry composed of cheese curds and sour cream. Mandelbrot, which literally means almond bread, resembles and is served toasted like bread despite not being made of bread dough. They are commonly paired with sweet wine, and when compared to Biscotti they are more \\"cakey\\" and softer. Cultural influence Kuchen dessert recipes are presumably handed down from people of German heritage and as such are often popular in many areas of German settlement in the United States, particularly Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Kuchen was introduced into Chilean cuisine when German immigrants settled southern Chile in the 1850s. Kuchen in Chile usually have fruits, such as apples, strawberries or murtas. Nontraditional Chilean Kuchen with walnuts are sometimes offered. Now Kuchen are found in many Chilean bakeries and in many of the larger supermarkets. In Brazil it is called \\"cuca\\", or less commonly, \\"cuque\\" and can be found in areas of German settlement, like Rio Grande do Sul, Paran√° and Santa Catarina states. The French quiche was influenced by the savory version of German Kuchen and is now known as a traditional French dish. In 2000, a Kuchen was designated the state dessert of South Dakota. Introduced by German settlers in the 1870s, Kuchen is now found throughout the state and can be found in peach, apple, prune and chocolate pecan variations.

The group was put together in 1987 by the former Waysted vocalist Danny Vaughn, with Brooke St. James (guitar), Jimi Kennedy (bass), and Michael Clayton (drums). History The band saw their name painted on a wall in Brooklyn and thought it sounded cool. By 1989, the band had signed to Geffen Records and released their debut album Don't Come Easy, which included the successful single \\"Forever Young.\\" Musically, the album was somewhere between Whitesnake and Bon Jovi, and Tyketto opened for the former on many bills. However, the rise of the grunge sound in 1991 saw Tyketto's hopes of a big breakthrough begin to recede. Kennedy left the band and was replaced by Jaimie Scott. Their second album was rejected by Geffen and finally emerged in 1994 under the title Strength in Numbers on CMC International in the U.S. and Music for Nations elsewhere in the world. The following year, Vaughn left the band to look after his wife, who had developed cancer, and was replaced by former Tall Stories vocalist Steve Augeri. (Augeri later became lead vocalist for Journey.) This line-up released Shine (which was a departure from their classic sound) in 1995, again on CMC / Music for Nations. However, dwindling audiences and the changing landscape of the rock industry saw the band split up in 1996, releasing the live album Take Out & Served Up Live as a swan song, having never really broken through. The various band members went on to other projects: most notably Vaughn, Clayton, and Scott who reunited in Vaughn. Vaughn would eventually start releasing material under his own name in 2007. In 2004, Tyketto reformed for a reunion tour with the full original lineup. They played a second set of reunion dates in 2007 and stated at the time that this was the last time the original four members, or any other line up, would ever perform under the Tyketto name. To coincide with the dates the band released an The Last Sunset - Farewell 2007 consisting of alternative versions of previously released songs and unreleased songs unearthed from long forgotten demo tapes. Despite this announcement, in 2008 Tyketto reformed again for more dates. In April, they played the \\"Hard In Rio 2\\" festival in Brazil, and also played four European dates in October 2008 including Firefest. However, due to scheduling conflicts, Brooke St. James was unable to join the band for these dates and was replaced by P.J. Zitarosa, a former member of Vaughn and Vaughn's solo career backing band. Tyketto toured Europe in January 2009 and played at the Download Festival in the UK in June 2010. They also played a U.S. show and a worldwide webcast in November 2011. The live worldwide webcast was a fan interactive concert and featured the original line up of Danny Vaughn, Brooke St. James, Michael Clayton, and Jimi Kennedy onstage together for the first time in years, along with their newest member Bobby Lynch on keyboards. The band released Dig in Deep in April 2012. The European tour that followed the release of Dig in Deep was the swansong for their original guitarist Brooke St James, as touring life no longer appealed. The search for a replacement found Chris Green. Green joined now permanent keyboard player Ged Rylands to round out Tyketto heading into 2014. 2014 brought with it the 25th anniversary of the band forming and major touring plans and bookings followed, along with the release of the band's first DVD entitled Documentally Yours. The first half of the year saw a UK tour, built around the Hard Rock Hell AOR Festival; all of which were used as live prep for the booking on the Monsters of Rock Cruise which sailed from Miami in late March. The two shows on the cruise would serve as a springboard for several other high-profile bookings. The latter half of 2014 saw a twelve date, five country tour around Europe. The band released their new album, Reach, on October 14, 2016. The album features bassist Chris Childs in place of Kennedy and received excellent reviews. In 2016 they had a 3rd call back to The Monsters Of Rock Cruise (With Justin James standing in for Jim Kennedy on bass), Hard Rock Hell AOR 2016 and 2 shows as a double bill with the Dan Reed Network. A 2016 Don‚Äôt Come Easy Tour took place in November. In July they played Rockfest Barcelona along with bands such as Iron Maiden and Twisted Sister. 2016 saw a Rock Candy re-release of Don‚Äôt Come Easy with new sleeve details and photographs to commemorate the 25th anniversary of their debut album. In March the band's current line up, including Childs on bass, recorded a new Tyketto album at Rockfield Studios in Wales and was released on 15 October 2016. Live In Milan the bands first live CD/DVD combo was released in late 2017 and Greg Smith joined them on bass for the fall Reach tour dates. In 2018 Tyketto have played the Monsters Of Rock Cruise, M3 in the USA, Rock Im Tal in Switzerland and the O2 in London at the Stone Free Festival. This was followed in June by a Weekend With Tyketto (We've Got tomorrow, We've Got Tonight) in Pontypridd, Wales for a very special DVD recording which was released as a Live CD/DVD. After the Strength In Numbers 25th Anniversary Tour in March 2019, Tyketto headed to Festivals in Switzerland in August and Germany in September before holding 2 Live Album Launch Parties. This was for the release of Strength In Numbers Live and was held on 25 October at The Queens Hall in Nuneaton and the 26th October at The Corporation in Sheffield. The official album release date was November 8.

She has a propensity to write about political thinking and conflict, especially where there is a settled orthodoxy: \\"Then the rebel in me goes berserk, and I start pawing at it. I like the area where the questions are, and the ambiguities of political life, rather than the certainties.\\"  Background  Wertenbaker was born in New York City to Charles Wertenbaker, a journalist, and Lael Wertenbaker, a writer.New York Times, \\"Lael Wertenbaker, 87, Author Who Wrote of Husband's Death\\", 1997 Much of her childhood was spent in the Basque Country in the small fishing village of Ciboure.The Guardian, \\"Timberlake Wertenbaker: ‚ÄòI got to feel that nobody wanted me‚Äô\\", April 29, 2017 She has been described as possessing a \\"characteristic reticence\\"; she has indicated that this may spring partly from her upbringing in Ciboure: \\"One thing they would tell you as a child was never to say anything because you might be betraying someone who had done something politically or whatever. So I was inculcated with this idea of emotional privacy.\\"The Guardian, \\"It's All So Public\\", 30 June 2004 Career Wertenbaker was the resident writer for Shared Experience in 1983 and the Royal Court Theatre from 1984 to 1985. She was on the Executive Council of the English Stage Company from 1992 to 1997 and on the Executive Committee of PEN from 1998 to 2001.\\"Timberlake Wertenbaker\\", Literature Matters, British Council, She served as the Royden B. Davis professor of Theatre at Georgetown University, Washington D.C., for 2005-06. She was the Leverhulme Artist in Residence at the Freud Museum in 2011. She was also the artistic director of New Perspective Theatre Company. Currently, Wertenbaker is the Chair in Playwriting at the University of East Anglia. In addition, she is artistic adviser to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and on the council of the Royal Society of Literature. Themes Central topics in her work are the efforts of individuals, particularly women: pursuing quests, seeking change, breaking boundaries, and constructing or challenging gender roles. A central technique is the revisioning of actual or imaginary lives from the past, sometimes remote in place as well as in time. There is a further recurring theme in her work: displacement. In her plays, characters are often removed from the familiarity of home and are forced to live in new cultures, sometimes defined by national boundaries, other times by cultural and class divisions. From this central theme emerge related themes, including isolation, dispossession, and the problem of forging an identity within a new cultural milieu. In her work, individuals often seem to assume roles, as if identity were a matter of persons performing themselves. Wertenbaker‚Äôs work also demonstrates a keen awareness that communication occurs through language that often inadequately expresses experience. Personal life She has a home in north London, where she lives with her husband, the writer John Man. They have one daughter.

Rask (1930 ‚Äì 12 December 1977), better known as Grethe Rask, was a Danish physician and surgeon in Za√Øre (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). After setting up her own hospital in the village of Abumombazi in 1972, she transferred to Danish Red Cross Hospital in Kinshasa in 1975. She returned to Denmark in 1977 after developing symptoms of an unknown infectious disease, which was later discovered to be AIDS. Three and a half years later in June 1981 the Centers for Disease Control recognized AIDS. Rask was one of the first non-Africans (along with Arvid Noe) known to have died of AIDS- related causes. Early years and Za√Øre (1930‚Äì1974) Born in 1930 in the Danish town of Thisted, Dr. Rask practiced medicine in Za√Øre for a brief period in 1964, when she was recalled to Europe for training in stomach surgery and tropical illnesses, and from 1972 to 1977, first at a small local hospital in the Zairian town of Abumombazi, and then at the Danish Red Cross Hospital in Kinshasa starting in 1975. She was likely first exposed to HIV during 1964. Her friend and colleague, Ib Bygbjerg (a physician specializing in communicable diseases), wrote in a 1983 letter to The Lancet that \\"while working as a surgeon under primitive conditions, she [Rask] must have been heavily exposed to blood and excretions of African patients.\\" Illness and death (1975‚Äì1977) Rask apparently suffered from symptoms of Pre-AIDS starting in late 1974, including diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, and fatigue. Although the symptoms receded temporarily following drug treatments in 1975, the symptoms later grew considerably worse. Following a vacation in South Africa in July 1977, she could no longer breathe and relied on bottled oxygen. She flew back to Denmark, where tests at Copenhagen's Rigshospitalet discovered she had contracted a number of opportunistic infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus (staph infection), candidiasis (yeast infection), and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP, a fungal infection of the lungs formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia). Tests also showed that Rask had a nearly non-existent T-cell count, leading to a severely depressed immune system. At the time, the doctors treating Rask were at a loss to explain her disease progression, which in retrospect came to be seen as one of the first cases of AIDS recorded outside Africa. After numerous tests and unsuccessful treatments, she eventually returned home to her cottage on a fjord in November 1977, where her long-time spouse (a nurse) cared for her. She was called back for more tests in December and returned to the Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen where she remained until she died of AIDS- related Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia on 12 December 1977.

The current tower, high, stands on the site of a former tower, which stood briefly during the late 19th century. History In colonial times, when Native Americans still controlled the area, the Podunk used the hill as a lookout. They were competing with the Nipmuc and Mohegan for control of the areas around Mischenipsit Lake. Fox Hill commands a broad view of the Connecticut River Valley. Weather permitting, Mount Tom, Mount Holyoke and Talcott Mountain may be seen from it by the naked eye. At the time, the hill was without trees and growth. Each year, the Podunk burned the undergrowth as part of the forest management that they practiced. They also burned wood for fires, and European- American settlers cut down any large trees for firewood. The cleared land was used by colonists as pastureland. Early photographs of Fox Hill show some small trees only at the summit. In 1878 Mr. Jeffrey of Meriden erected a wooden observation tower on the hill. It was 20-feet-square at the base and extended upward; a platform was constructed at the top. The walls of the ground floor were enclosed, and ice cream and refreshments were sold. The upper platforms were open. A telescope was available and a 15¬¢ admission fee was charged to climb the tower and use the 'spy glass.' Jeffrey's Tower was very popular. On February 3, 1880, a severe blizzard destroyed the structure. It was not rebuilt and the broken timbers became overgrown with vines and bushes. The first floor remained standing. The noted still life painter Charles Ethan Porter, brother-in-law of Jeffrey, used it as his studio around 1889. He used it as a shelter for painting during the winter or when it rained. After Porter died, the small structure fell into total disrepair. Its remains gradually disappeared under overgrowth by 1923. During the next 60 years two homes were built on the south side of the summit, but the tower was not rebuilt. The Memorial Tower was constructed in 1937 and completed in 1939, as a collaborative WPA project to hire workers during the Great Depression and invest in projects to benefit local cities. It is dedicated to the veterans of all wars from the Town of Vernon. The dedication took place on August 5, 1939. The building cost approximately $75,000. The United States Work Projects Administration supplied the labor and materials. The town, city, and individuals contributed the rest. The War Memorial Tower is high, resting on solid rock. Its promenade is long. The tower is made of native stone. An observation platform is located near the top of the tower. Bronze tablets bearing the names and inscriptions of three branches of the United States military - Army, Navy and Marine Corps - are fixed to the walls. The tower is now part of Henry Park (named after E. Stevens Henry, the first landowner after purchase from the Podunk). It is maintained by the Vernon-Rockville Parks and Recreation Department. It is currently the highest man-made point in Vernon, Connecticut.

The \\"Magic Roundabout\\" in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England, is the familiar name given to the Plough roundabout. The familiar name comes from the children's television programme, and is also used for a similar junction in Swindon and the M40 junction in Denham. The official name relates to a former public house, called The Plough Inn, which was between the junction of what is now Selden Hill and St Albans Road. It has also been known as the Moor End Roundabout as it is adjacent to the part of Boxmoor nearest the town.

That‚Äôs Magic! , Hemel Gazette, 20 May 2011, The roundabout is unusual in that traffic flows both clockwise (the standard flow direction of British roundabouts) and anticlockwise. Drivers approaching the roundabout from any junction can choose to turn left or right, and they are free to make U-turns using any of the mini roundabouts at the junction. Effectively, the junction should be treated as six individual roundabouts - right of way must be given on the approach of each new mini roundabout.  Early history  The original magic roundabout had six exits in total, with the British Petroleum building spanning \\"Marlowes\\", the road leading to the town centre, in the approximate position of the earlier railway viaduct. The BP building was found to be unstable due to defective reinforced concrete and the exit had to be closed. The building was demolished but the original route was not restored, although a newer side exit from the roundabout replaced the junction with Marlowes off a side road.

A student at the National Academy of Design in New York City, he was one of the first African Americans to exhibit there. He was the only African-American artist at the turn of the century who painted in still life. Early life and education Civil war soldier, 1872 Porter was born most likely in 1847 in Hartford, Connecticut. His father was possibly a mill worker and his mother worked as a servant. Porter's family moved to what was then the nearby village of Rockville (now part of Vernon, Connecticut) by the early 1850s. The family suffered many losses when Porter was young. They endured poverty and tragedy just a few years after moving to Rockville. Porter lost seven of his siblings to illness and one to war between 1858 and 1868. Boy and Book, c 1880 Porter's brothers, Joseph and William, enlisted in the Union Army in 1863. Joseph joined the 29th Connecticut Infantry Regiment (Colored) and William joined the 14th Rhode Island Heavy Artillery (Colored). Joseph was killed in Virginia in 1864, and was buried in Rockville just days before his regiment returned home. William became seriously ill with malaria and was granted a disability discharge in January 1865. Porter was his family's first child to attend high school, graduating in 1865. Porter left Rockville in 1868 to study painting in Wilbraham, Massachusetts, a town twenty miles north of Rockville. In 1869, after two years of art study at Wesleyan Academy (now known as the Wilbraham & Monson Academy), Porter enrolled at the prestigious National Academy of Design in October 1869, becoming the first African-American admitted to the school. Porter attended the art school until the spring of 1873. While at the school, and for the first time, Porter began exhibiting his work. A painting titled Autumn Leaves was shown in the school's summer exhibition. In May 1870, Porter was among eight art students whose drawings, as part of a large school exhibition, were given special mention in the New York Times. Porter received widespread praise and attention for his work during his four years at the National Academy, earning the support of prominent benefactors such as Frederic Edwin Church and famous author Mark Twain, who lived in Hartford. Career Peonies in a Bowl, 1885, In the fall of 1873, Porter studied art with Joseph Oriel Eaton, a prominent portrait and landscape painter, for a year. Every year, he studied and painted in New York City from fall through spring but returned to Rockville in the summer to paint and teach art classes. From 1873 to 1875, Porter started to sell his work. One painting sold for $175, a high price for that time and for the artist's level of experience. Little else is known about Porter during this period. Art collectors were losing interest in American artists and traveling overseas, buying contemporary French art and Old Masters. Many young American artists, during the economic downturn, began studying overseas in the 1870s. Sales by American artists would not recover until the 1890s. In 1878, Porter moved to Hartford, Connecticut and established a studio. The city was experiencing tremendous growth, and its wealthy citizens were interested in art and culture and had the money to begin or add to art collections. Porter's traditional academic art education made him a standout compared to the many self-taught artists who had recently moved to Hartford. He was one of the few artists at the time, and the only man, to specialize in still life painting. While in Hartford, Porter created many of the still life paintings that he is known for today. A number of his paintings of fruit were not typical of the period, as they did not include tableware, porcelain, and glassware and unusual touches such as insects. His apple paintings were a commercial success and he painted apples for much of his career. Porter spent a good deal of time outdoors. He was very interested in nature, which is reflected in his paintings of butterflies, dead birds, insects, and plants. In 1879, his work gained the attention of influential landscape painter Frederic Edwin Church. Church visited Porter, purchased a few paintings, and declared Porter to \\"have no superior as a colorist in the United States.\\" Church encouraged Porter to study and paint landscapes. In 1880, Porter visited the Adirondacks for two months of sketching and painting. He declared at the time that he would focus his work primarily on landscapes, except for commissioned still life paintings. Yellow Roses in a Vase, 1890 On March 19, 1881, the Hartford Daily Courant reported that Porter was planning to move to Europe for two years to study art. The article stated that Porter would be selling at auction his entire inventory of paintings. Half of the paintings sold immediately for a total of $1062; additional sales resulted in a total of $1800. In early November 1881, Porter sailed for Liverpool. After an art tour of London, he traveled to Paris, with letters of introduction from Hartford's most prominent citizens, including Samuel Clemens, the author known as Mark Twain. Apples on the ground, 1878 In Paris he studied the works of the influential artists of the Barbizon school of painting. He enrolled in the Ecole des Arts Decoratifs, where he studied until 1884, when he ran out of money and returned to Hartford. In December 1884, he hosted an art exhibition and auction of 100 paintings from his time in France. His new work was praised by the Hartford Evening Post, but the auction did not get the attendance or make the sales that Porter had hoped for. In early 1885, Porter returned to New York City and opened a studio. He exhibited his work at the National Academy of Design and continued to paint. He spent the summer of 1885 in Rockville, Connecticut, teaching art and painting landscapes. By November 1886, Porter was back in Hartford again. He partnered with local artist Daniel Wentworth to hold auctions in 1887 and 1888, Wentworth contributing landscapes and Porter contributing primarily still lifes. The paintings sold for prices ranging from $6 to $100. By 1889, Porter had left Hartford for the last time. He spent most of the year in New York City and summers in Rockville, Connecticut until 1897, when he settled permanently in Rockville. The quality of Porter's work declined after 1900 and interest in his work subsided. Porter died on March 6, 1923, at the age of 75.  Legacy  Porter‚Äôs art began to regain interest among art historians and collectors in the 1980s. The first museum show featuring his work debuted in 2008, organized by the New Britain Museum of American Art, and his paintings have entered public collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Birmingham Museum of Art, San Antonio Museum of Art, and Wadsworth Athenaeum.

She is the largest single-masted yacht ever built. Ownership Mirabella V was built as part of a fleet of large sailing charter yachts owned by former Chairman and CEO of the Avis car rental company, Joseph Vittoria, and used for luxury private charters. She was named after Vittoria's previous yachts. Mirabella V now belongs to Rodney Lewis and has been renamed M5. It is no longer available for charters. M5 in Venice,Italy August 2020 Design The owner specifications combined fast sailing with motoryacht amenities. The righting moment of sailing vessels makes them more seakindly than powerboats and M5 has achieved speeds in excess of 19 knots in 8 ft-12 ft seas. To achieve the amenity requirements, a single mast was preferred to other rig types in order to maximize interior volumes in keel-stepped sailing yachts; To achieve the performance requirements, the higher aspect ratio of the single mast sail plan was also preferred in order to provide a better speed potential. A final demand was that the yacht be able to use the harbour at Palm Beach, Florida. This required the use of a lifting keel to reduce draft. Mirabella V was designed by yacht designer Ron Holland. Load and structural calculations of the hull and rig were carried out by Hamble-based firm High Modulus Europe Ltd, (now part of Gurit). Technical challenges While vessels of M5s size are typically made from steel or aluminium, an aramid foam core/vinylester sandwich build was chosen to achieve a shorter delivery date, reduced maintenance (regular repainting to inhibit corrosion is not required) and better acoustic thermal insulation. Historically, large yachts were built with more than one mast in order to divide the sail area for easier handling. Today's technologies in spars, rigging, sailmaking, powered winches and electronics enable rigs with larger sail areas, higher aspect ratios, larger loads and simpler handling, allowing Mirabella V to be constructed with the tallest mast and largest jib of any sailing craft ever built at the time. One of the procurement challenges was finding sheets strong enough to trim the sails. Construction Mirabella V was constructed at the former BVT Surface Fleet yard (formerly VT Shipbuilding formerly Vosper Thornycroft) at its Woolston Yard, Southampton, Hampshire. Luciana Vittoria specified to naval archited Ron Holland her wishes for interior decoration. After changing hands and being rechristened M5, she was handed over for refit to the Pendennis Shipyard in March 2013. She was relaunched in September 2013 with an extended stern and reverse transom, a lighter ballast arrangement and carbon fibre standing rigging.

It is the sensation of inability or difficulty to empty the bowel at defecation, even if the bowel contents have already been evacuated. Tenesmus indicates the feeling of a residue, and is not always correlated with the actual presence of residual fecal matter in the rectum. It is frequently painful and may be accompanied by involuntary straining and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Tenesmus has both a nociceptive and a neuropathic component. Vesical tenesmus is a similar condition, experienced as a feeling of incomplete voiding despite the bladder being empty. Often, rectal tenesmus is simply called tenesmus. The term rectal tenesmus is a retronym to distinguish defecation-related tenesmus from vesical tenesmus. Tenesmus is a closely related topic to obstructed defecation. The term is from , from Greek , from to stretch, strain. Considerations Tenesmus is characterized by a sensation of needing to pass stool, accompanied by pain, cramping, and straining. Despite straining, little stool is passed. Tenesmus is generally associated with inflammatory diseases of the bowel, which may be caused by either infectious or noninfectious conditions.

He scored 267 goals from 521 appearances in the Football League playing for Plymouth Argyle, Bolton Wanderers and Arsenal. He was the first footballer to be transferred for a fee in excess of ¬£10,000, was the first to score at Wembleyin the 1923 FA Cup Finaland was capped nine times for England. After retiring as a player he managed Southend United, Middlesbrough and Shelbourne. Personal life Jack was born in Bolton, Lancashire, in 1898, the son of Scottish footballer Bob Jack and his wife Georgina Nightingale. He had two brothers, Rollo and Donald, who also played football. Jack was married to Kathleen. Their son, also named David, became a journalist and writer who chaired both the Football Writers' Association and its Australian counterpart, the Australian Soccer Press Association. Jack died in St Thomas' Hospital, London, in 1958 at the age of 60. He served in the Royal Navy during the First World War. Playing career An inside forward, Jack started his senior career with his father's club, Plymouth Argyle, after the war. He played in the Southern League in 1919‚Äì20, and was a member of Plymouth's team for their first match in the newly formed Football League Third Division in 1920‚Äì21. He scored 15 goals in 48 appearances in all competitions. In late 1920 he returned to the town of his birth, signing for Bolton Wanderers for a world record fee of ¬£3,500 (¬£ in ). He spent eight seasons with the Trotters, forming a formidable partnership with Joe Smith, and between them they scored more than 300 goals. While with Bolton, he made history by being the first person to score a goal at Wembley Stadium, in the 1923 FA Cup Final; Bolton won 2‚Äì0 and Jack earned his first medal. A year later, he won his first England cap, in a 2‚Äì1 defeat against Wales on 3 March 1924. In eight years he played nine times for his countryfour times as captainand scored three goals. He continued to have success with Bolton, winning the FA Cup again in 1925‚Äì26, scoring the only goal in a 1‚Äì0 win over Manchester City. He was the club's top scorer for five of the eight seasons he was there, scoring 144 goals in 295 league matches. , he remains Bolton's third highest goalscorer of all time, with 161 goals from 324 senior matches. In 1928, with Bolton in financial trouble, Herbert Chapman's Arsenal made Jack the first five-digit signing in world football, almost double the previous record. Recollections of the exact figure vary, from ¬£10,000, to ¬£10,890, to ¬£11,500; all agree it was the first five-digit figure. According to Bob Wall, Chapman negotiated the transfer with Bolton's representatives in a hotel bar, his tactic being to drink gin and tonics without any gin in them, while asking the waiter to double the alcohol served to the other side. Chapman remained sober while the Bolton representatives got very drunk, and managed to haggle down the fee to a price he considered a bargain. Intended as a replacement for retired captain Charlie Buchan, Jack was a success at Highbury. He made his debut against Newcastle United on 20 October 1928, and became a regular straight away. He was the club's top scorer for the 1928‚Äì29 season. Although less prolific than centre-forward Jack Lambert, he still scored important goals, including the one in the 1929‚Äì30 FA Cup semi-final against Hull City which sent Arsenal through to the final, in which Arsenal beat Huddersfield Town 2‚Äì0 and Jack became the first player to win the Cup at Wembley with two different clubs. He played in Arsenal's 2‚Äì1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday in the Charity Shield at Stamford Bridge in October 1930. Jack continued to feature for Arsenal through the early 1930s, recording a personal best of 34 goals in their First Division-winning season of 1930‚Äì31. He won two more titles in 1932‚Äì33 and 1933‚Äì34. By the time of the latter he was in his mid-30s and reaching the end of his career; competition for his place from new signing Ray Bowden meant Jack played only 16 matches that season. He retired soon after winning his third league medal, in May 1934. Altogether he scored 124 times in 208 matches for Arsenal, making him, the tenth-highest goalscorer in the club's history. He is one of only three players to score more than 100 English top-flight league goals for two different clubs, along with Jimmy Greaves and Alan Shearer. Management career After retiring from playing, Jack went on to manage Southend United from May 1934 to August 1940 and then Middlesbrough from November 1944 to April 1952. He also managed League of Ireland side Shelbourne from August 1953 to April 1955.

Their last studio album before their hiatus, Awakened, was released on September 25, 2012. The band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2014 when Lambesis was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison for soliciting the murder of his estranged wife. The remaining members formed Wovenwar with vocalist Shane Blay. In 2018, Lambesis reunited with Hipa, Sgrosso, Mancino and Gilbert. On June 8, 2018, the band released the song \\"My Own Grave\\", their first recording in six years. They released their seventh studio album, Shaped by Fire, on September 20, 2019. History =Formation and first releases (2000‚Äì2004)= After leaving the band Society's Finest, in which he played guitar, vocalist Tim Lambesis formed As I Lay Dying in 2000. Starting out as a duet with drummer Jordan Mancino, they first met as a band in February 2001. They both were in the hardcore punk band Point of Recognition. The band's name came from the novel of the same name by William Faulkner that was published in 1930; although the band's lyrics and music are not directly inspired by the novel. Shortly after the band's formation, Pluto Records offered As I Lay Dying a recording contract and, after accepting the offer, the band entered the studio one month later to record their first album Beneath the Encasing of Ashes, released in June 2001. The band then recorded five songs for a split album, again through Pluto Records, with San Diego post-hardcore band American Tragedy. As I Lay Dying realized it needed to expand to a five-piece band to include another guitarist and a bass guitarist. Mancino commented \\"we started going on tour and we needed obviously more people than that.\\" As Lambesis and Mancino were the only permanent members, the band recruited friends to perform with them and subsequently underwent several lineup changes: bass guitarist Noah Chase departed in 2001, while Brandon Hays, and his subsequent replacement Aaron Kennedy, departed in 2003. During early 2003, when As I Lay Dying's Pluto Records contract expired, the band pursued deals with other record labels. After extensive touring and an increase in popularity, As I Lay Dying was offered a record deal with Metal Blade Records in March 2003. Phil Sgrosso became the band's rhythm guitarist in Autumn 2003. In July 2003, the band's second studio album Frail Words Collapse was released. Produced by Lambesis, the album peaked at No. 30 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart and No. 41 on the Top Heatseekers chart. William York of Allmusic thought the band \\"doesn't really add anything new to the mix from a musical standpoint\\" with the release, while also praising it for being \\"solid enough and well executed\\" with \\"adequate\\" production. Sherwin Frias of Jesus Freak Hideout had similar sentiments and commented \\"As I Lay Dying didn't exactly break many boundaries in making this record\\", but praised that each song is \\"executed so well (and with such precision) that nary a song misses its target.\\" Touring then occurred to promote the album, with support from bands Himsa, Shadows Fall, The Black Dahlia Murder, Killswitch Engage, In Flames, Sworn Enemy, and Hatebreed. Music videos for the songs \\"94 Hours\\" and \\"Forever\\" received rotation on networks such as Fuse and MTV2's Headbanger's Ball. = Success (2005‚Äì2009) = As I Lay Dying entered Big Fish recording studio in Encinitas, California, US in January 2005 to record their third studio album. Shadows Are Security was released in June of the same year and debuted at No. 1 on the Independent Albums chart. It was also the band's first release to enter the Billboard 200‚Äîat No. 35‚Äîand sold about 275,000 copies. Wade Kergan of AllMusic called it \\"one of the strongest releases of 2005,\\" and commented that new guitarists Phil Sgrosso and Nick Hipa make the band \\"stronger.\\" Rod Smith of Decibel Magazine commented: \\"Tim Lambesis's finely honed roar in bittersweet instrumental matrices augmented by occasional clean vocals by bass guitarist Clint Norris. Guitarists Phil Sgrosso and Nick Hipa whip up a melodic cyclone on 'The Darkest Nights'.\\" By this time, guitarist Evan White had quit the band for personal reasons after his mother died. All the singing was done by Dave Arthur of Kings to You, because it sounded more powerful in the studio in comparison to Clint Norris's singing. As I Lay Dying began touring to promote the new record by making appearances at Hell on Earth, Winter Headline Tour, and Ozzfest, as well as a tour with Slipknot and Unearth. The band was on the second stage alongside Rob Zombie, Killswitch Engage, Mastodon, The Haunted, and It Dies Today. The band raised its profile in 2006 through its support slot on the Taste of Chaos tour in the US, alongside bands such as Deftones, Thrice, Dredg, Funeral for a Friend, and Story of the Year. In May 2006, Beneath the Encasing of Ashes and the songs from the split album were re- released through Metal Blade Records as A Long March: The First Recordings. The album contained the original and re-recorded versions of the songs from the split album‚Äîthe band preferred to re-release the material, as they didn't want their fans paying large sums of money to listen to early releases. The re-release peaked at No. 3 on the Independent Albums chart and No. 129 on the Billboard 200 chart. In mid-2006, As I Lay Dying was the headline act at the Sounds of the Underground Festival. Norris left the band on good terms in November 2006 with a desire to focus on his marriage. The band auditioned ten bass guitarists, but none proved successful. Lambesis received demo tapes from a band called This Endearing, of which bass guitarists Josh Gilbert was a member; however, Lambesis chose to \\"sit on it\\" and waited for the band to record more material. This Endearing subsequently disbanded and Gilbert was recruited as As I Lay Dying's new bass guitarist. As I Lay Dying live at With Full Force 2007. From left to right: Sgrosso (background), Lambesis and Hipa. In 2007 As I Lay Dying started recording a new album titled An Ocean Between Us, which was released on August 21, 2007. Debuting at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Top Rock chart, with first-week sales of 39,000 units, the album was the highest charting release for the band. Co-produced by Killswitch Engage guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz and As I Lay Dying, and mixed by Colin Richardson, the album received generally positive reviews. Christa L. Titus of Billboard commented: \\"Whatever the differences between As I Lay Dying's personal desires and what its fans demand, this album surely acts as a bridge,\\" praising the song \\"Comfort Betrays\\" for its guitar solo. Scott Alisoglu of Blabbermouth.net described the album as \\"a well-rounded and often thrashy metalcore album, as the band has struck an effective balance between aggression and accessible melodies.\\" Thom Jurek of Allmusic praised the band for expanding its musical range by including melodic singing and choruses, as they had previously done on \\"Confined\\" from Shadows Are Security. It was the first time that bass guitarist Gilbert recorded a studio album with the band. To promote the album, As I Lay Dying performed at the Warped Tour 2007 in August, and toured through Europe in September with Darkest Hour, Himsa, and Maroon. The band was awarded the title \\"Ultimate Metal God\\" by MTV2's \\"All That Rocks\\" special, and was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of \\"Best Metal Performance\\" for the song \\"Nothing Left\\". The other Grammy Award nominees included winner Slayer, King Diamond, Machine Head, and Shadows Fall. The band played a portion of the 2008 Warped Tour, as well as the Taste of Chaos UK 2008 Tour with headliners Atreyu. On April 9, 2009, the DVD This Is Who We Are was released in Europe, and was released in the US on April 14, 2009. The DVD was certified Gold in the US almost a month after its release. =The Powerless Rise and Decas (2010‚Äì2011)= After recording through 2009, the band's fifth record The Powerless Rise was streamed on the MySpace Music website on May 7, 2010 up until May 10, 2010. The album was officially released on May 11, 2010 and received generally positive critical acclaim, with one critic saying: \\"Fans of metalcore in general, and As I Lay Dying in particular, will be more than satisfied with The Powerless Rise, as the band's gradual progression and consistency makes this their best album.\\" As I Lay Dying performing in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 2011. In 2010 the band toured in support of The Powerless Rise, headlining the majority of their shows. In the first half of the year, the band embarked on a US tour with Demon Hunter, blessthefall, and War of Ages. This was followed by a mid-2010 headlining tour titled \\"The Cool Tour\\" across the US, and a headlining tour across US/Canada that also featured All That Remains, Unearth, and Carnifex. The band's final headline tour of the year was in Europe, with Heaven Shall Burn, Suicide Silence, and Sylosis. In February 2011, the band headlined a US tour with support from Winds of Plague and After the Burial. The band then toured in late April/early May with Trivium, in support of Disturbed, on the \\"Music as a Weapon\\" tour in Australia and New Zealand. Then at the end of May and beginning of June, the band headlined a few performances with Heaven Shall Burn. On November 8, 2011, As I Lay Dying released a compilation, Decas, in honor of the band's ten-year anniversary. The album featured three new, original songs; four cover versions of songs by bands such as Slayer, Judas Priest and Descendents; a re-recorded medley that uses parts of several songs taken from Beneath the Encasing of Ashes; and four remixes, consisting of one song from each of their albums since Frail Words Collapse. The album's first track \\"Paralyzed\\" was released as a lyric video on September 13, 2011, and as a free download on iTunes on November 7, the day before the album's release. The band embarked on the \\"A Decade of Destruction\\" tour, coinciding with the release of the album, from November to December 2011. = Awakened, Tim Lambesis' trial and hiatus (2012‚Äì2016) = On January 25, 2012, an announcement revealed that the band would be playing the Mayhem Festival of 2012 with Slipknot, Slayer, Mot√∂rhead, Anthrax, The Devil Wears Prada, Asking Alexandria, Whitechapel, Upon A Burning Body, I, the Breather, Betraying the Martyrs, and Dirtfedd. The band announced in April 2012 that Bill Stevenson, who had previously worked with NOFX and Rise Against, would be the producer for their sixth album. On June 22, 2012, the band announced that their sixth album would be titled Awakened and the first single \\"Cauterize\\" was released on June 25, 2012. On September 12, 2012, As I Lay Dying released their second single \\"A Greater Foundation\\" with a corresponding music video. The album was released on September 25, 2012 and \\"Cauterize\\" was available on the band's website as a free download for a 24-hour period. As I Lay Dying won the \\"Metal Band of the Year\\" award from Loudwire in 2012, beating other well-known bands, including Anthrax and Lamb of God. Subsequently, prior to his criminal charges, Lambesis started a new band entitled Pyrithion with guitarist Ryan Glisan, formerly of Allegaeon. They released one EP as a band. The arrest, trial and imprisonment of vocalist Tim Lambesis caused the band to go on an indefinite hiatus in 2014. On May 7, 2013, Lambesis was arrested in Oceanside, California, US after hiring an undercover detective to kill his estranged wife. The report was made by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, leaving the future of the band uncertain. On the following day, the band released a statement in which they said: \\"The legal process is taking its course and we have no more information than you do. There are many unanswered questions, and the situation will become clearer in the coming days and weeks. We'll keep you informed as best we can.\\" They also stated that their thoughts were \\"with Tim, his family, and with everyone else affected by this terrible situation.\\" Eight days later, the band cancelled their mid-2013 tour with Killswitch Engage, stating that \\"we feel that it is best for the band to be off the road while the current situation gets sorted\\". During the month of his initial arrest, Lambesis pleaded \\"not guilty\\" and his lawyer stated: \\"His thought processes were devastatingly affected by his steroid use.\\" On February 25, 2014 Lambesis changed his plea from \\"not guilty\\" to \\"guilty\\" and consequently faced a potential sentence of nine years in prison. Rather than continue on without Lambesis, Mancino, along with former members Phil Sgrosso, Nick Hipa, and Josh Gilbert, decided to focus on a different style of music under a different band name, Wovenwar, with Shane Blay as the vocalist, This project took shape long before Lambesis' plea. although Mancino still remained a member of As I Lay Dying. During this period of time, Lambesis was also working on music and found time to release the third Austrian Death Machine album, titled Triple Brutal. On May 16, 2014, Lambesis was sentenced to six years in prison, with 48 days credit for time served. =Lambesis' release, reunion and new music (2016‚Äì2018)= Lambesis was released from prison on probation in December 2016. After his release he began reaching out to the other members of the band looking to apologize in person starting with Mancino and Gilbert. After months of silence Gilbert and Mancino eventually met with Lambesis and began speaking with him regularly after noting positive changes in his character. Lambesis attempted to reconnect with Sgrosso and Hipa following his meetings with Gilbert and Mancino‚Äîwho as a result of Lambesis' actions and the strain it put on their relationships‚Äîhad stopped speaking to each other following the recording of the second Wovenwar album. Sgrosso explained in a reunion-related discussion video posted by the band on June 16, 2018 that he initially replied to all of Lambesis' emails with explicit expressions of having no desire to speak with him. Sgrosso explained that his disdain with Lambesis started well before his arrest and took relief in not having to be in a band with him anymore upon Lambesis' arrest. His relationship with Hipa deteriorated due to what both described as not being able to deal with the weight of the aftermath properly. Hipa explained that while he initially felt empathy towards Lambesis after his tearful courtroom apology‚Äîit was short lived following Lambesis' interview with Alternative Press which Hipa claimed read like \\"one long excuse\\". After Lambesis made his public apology, Sgrosso finally agreed to meet with Lambesis and claimed Lambesis evolved into a different person than he was for the years leading up to his arrest which inspired him to reach out to Hipa to rekindle their friendship. Hipa was the last to speak with Lambesis due to what Hipa described as not being able to escape the shadow of Lambesis' arrest and the mental and physical effects it took on him. After reconnecting with Sgrosso and reading Lambesis' apology‚Äîhe agreed to meet with Lambesis as a means to \\"let go of his hatred\\" and claimed that Lambesis owned up and took responsibility for every one of his actions he was called on. Over the course of the tail end of Lambesis' incarceration and release, the band's public opinion towards Lambesis softened. Mancino did an interview primarily discussing Wovenwar, but also spoke about As I Lay Dying on MetalSucks' podcast. He stated that, contrary to popular beliefs, that Hipa, Sgrosso and Gilbert are still technically a part of As I Lay Dying due to their record contract and in another interview stated that he has \\"no ill will\\" towards Lambesis and wished him well. Hipa, when on an episode of Jamey Jasta's podcast when asked about a reunion commented \\"what it comes down to is what makes sense with what we have going on in our lives. And we've got a lot of important things going on that don't relate to that and we've made commitments to, and that's what we are honoring at this moment. Honestly it's just not something we try and consume our thoughts with. Because it's like we have families, businesses, professions, and a band‚Äîand all these things we're super invested into. It's like all of our attention is there with that at the moment.\\" On September 2, 2017, Metal Injection reported that Lambesis was working on new music and planned to release it under the As I Lay Dying name and that none of the pre-hiatus lineup aside from Lambesis would be returning. This would later be proven false, as on June 8, 2018, the band released the music video for \\"My Own Grave\\", confirming through the video that the lineup of Lambesis, Hipa, Sgrosso, Gilbert and Mancino had reunited. They performed their first show‚Äîwhich sold out in four minutes‚Äîin five years at the SOMA Sidestage in their hometown of San Diego. The band has stated the single was their first and only song written since their formal reunion in February 2018 and had no concrete plans past releasing the single and playing the SOMA show. The news of their reunion drew particularly divisive reactions from fans and media outlets. While fan and critical reception of the band's reunion and comeback single were met largely with praise, others were openly skeptical on supporting Tim Lambesis following his prison sentence. Most notably was MetalSucks, who published an editorial that they will no longer be writing about the band with multiple outlets voicing their support for MetalSucks' decision. On June 16, 2018‚Äîthe date of their comeback show at the SOMA‚Äîthe band published a video on their official YouTube account addressing the questions and criticisms fans and critics of the band had and explaining the terms in detail of the reunion. In July 2018, the band announced their first European headlining tour for December 2018. A day later, they announced their North American tour for November 2018. A vast majority of the shows sold out immediately. While tickets sold out quickly, some venues and festivals received a public backlash for booking the band because of Lambesis' crimes and decided to cancel the band's performances. Spain's Resurrection Fest announced it would be dropping As I Lay Dying from its bill in October 2018, and months later in January 2019, the Memphis, Tennessee venue Growlers cancelled their previously scheduled show in April 2019. Growlers released a statement that acknowledged Lambesis' public message from 2018, but stated: \\"After hearing the combined voice of disheartened friends, local bands, and patrons, locally owned concert venue and bar, Growlers, has cancelled their scheduled show with As I Lay Dying, previously set for April 5th, and will replace it with a local show to benefit victims of domestic violence [...] Not everyone was ready to give Lambesis a second chance, and Growlers has created controversy in Memphis for booking his band.\\" =Touring, Shaped by Fire, and Nick Hipa's departure (2019‚Äìpresent)= They embarked on a tour in March 2019 with Phinehas, Currents and Frost Koffin as support. On April 12, 2019, the band released a music video for \\"Redefined\\", including a guest appearance by August Burns Red frontman Jake Luhrs. On April 14, the band announced the \\"Shaped by Fire\\" tour of Europe with support from Chelsea Grin, Unearth and Fit for a King running from September 2019 and concluding in October. On July 15, the band announced the North American dates of the \\"Shaped by Fire\\" Tour with direct support from After the Burial and Emmure to begin on November 15 at the House of Blues in Las Vegas and conclude on December 14 with a hometown show at the Soma San Diego. Details of their forthcoming album, Shaped by Fire, were leaked through Nuclear Blast's European website with a projected release date of September 20, 2019. On August 9, the band officially announced their first album in seven years, Shaped by Fire, would be released through Nuclear Blast Records, along with releasing the album's title track. On September 13, the band released \\"Blinded\\" as the album's fourth single along with an accompanying music video. In March 2020, as a way of supporting their crew during the COVID-19 pandemic, they released an additional song, \\"Destruction or Strength\\", a B-side from Shaped by Fire album sessions. In May 2020, another music video for the song \\"Torn Between\\" was released. On August 15, it was reported that Nick Hipa had left the band. Musical style and influences The band performing at Wacken Open Air 2011 As I Lay Dying is considered a prominent metalcore band. The band also has been referred to as Christian metal, death metal, and thrash metal As I Lay Dying's music uses lots of elements of melodic death metal. In a review of Beneath the Encasing of Ashes, Bradley Torreano of AllMusic described the band's sound as a blend of heavy metal, hardcore, and grindcore. Heavy metal writer Garry Sharpe-Young described the band as a \\"Christian Hardcore act employing the Grind edged vocals of singer Tim Lambesis and a distinct hint of Scandinavian guitar chug.\\" As I Lay Dying's influences include In Flames, Living Sacrifice, Iron Maiden, Slayer, At the Gates, Pantera, Megadeth, Fear Factory, Cannibal Corpse, Thin Lizzy, Shai Hulud, Dark Tranquility, Metallica, Judas Priest, and Earth Crisis. Christianity Although As I Lay Dying has stated on numerous occasions that all of the members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. The band's lyrics do not focus on Christian themes the way many praise music bands do, nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality. Lyricist and lead singer Tim Lambesis has given mixed commentary on the subject: asked in 2008 if the members were \\"a Christian band\\" or \\"Christians in a band\\", Lambesis stated on the band's FAQ, \\"I'm not sure what the difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band, if you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life. All five of us are Christians. I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very 'preachy.' Many of our songs are about life, struggles, mistakes, relationships and other issues that don't fit entirely in the spiritual category. However, all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian.\\" Furthermore, during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis stated \\"I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics.\\" However, in later years, Lambesis showed an increasing philosophical skepticism towards Christianity and religion in general. Court documents stated Lambesis emailed his wife Meggan in August 2012, while on tour with As I Lay Dying, asking for a divorce and stating he \\"no longer believed in God\\". In explaining some of the lyrics from Awakened, Lambesis stated on his personal Tumblr account that his studies of theology had led him to the conclusion that \\"tradition and truth are often at odds with each other\\", and while he \\"didn't hate all religious belief\\", he was finding it \\"very difficult for [him] to outline exactly who it is that's worth siding with.\\" He also quoted the book Pagan Christianity by George Barna and Frank Viola, claiming that both \\"Protestant and Catholic denominations have poisonous roots\\". While on house arrest in July 2013, after being charged with soliciting his wife's murder, Lambesis published a blog post in which he obliquely confirmed his previous loss of faith in Christianity. In 2014, Lambesis said that although they were marketed as a Christian band, the members privately considered themselves atheists. Following this statement, guitarist Nick Hipa responded by calling these claims slanderous and defamatory. However, since his arrest it has been reported that Lambesis, in an April 2014 statement by the band, \\"[‚Ä¶] has spent much of the last year reevaluating what originally convinced him to abandon belief in God. After much brokenness and repentance he sees things differently, considers himself a follower of Jesus, someone submitted to the will of God, or whatever you want to call it. That‚Äôs for him to talk about when he‚Äôs comfortable and only time will tell if he is sincere.\\"  Members  Current * Tim Lambesis ‚Äì unclean vocals, occasional clean vocals (2000‚Äì2014, 2017‚Äìpresent) * Jordan Mancino ‚Äì drums (2000‚Äì2014, 2018‚Äìpresent) * Phil Sgrosso ‚Äì guitars, backing vocals (2003‚Äì2014, 2018‚Äìpresent) * Josh Gilbert ‚Äì bass, clean vocals (2006‚Äì2014, 2018‚Äìpresent) Former * Jeremy Rojas ‚Äì guitars (2001) * Jon Jameson ‚Äì bass (2001) * Noah Chase ‚Äì bass (2001, 2002, 2003) * Evan White ‚Äì guitars (2001‚Äì2003), bass (2002‚Äì2003) * Tommy Garcia ‚Äì guitars, bass, backing vocals (2002‚Äì2003; session member 2003‚Äì2010) * Jasun Krebs ‚Äì guitars (2002‚Äì2003) * Brandon Hays ‚Äì bass, guitars (2002‚Äì2003) * Aaron Kennedy ‚Äì bass (2003) * Clint Norris ‚Äì bass, clean vocals (2003‚Äì2006) * Nick Hipa ‚Äì guitars, backing vocals (2003‚Äì2014, 2018‚Äì2020) Touring musicians * Chad Ackerman ‚Äì guitars (2001‚Äì2002), backing vocals (session, 2007) * Caylen Denuccio ‚Äì bass (2002‚Äì2003) * Chris Lindstrom ‚Äì guitars (2001, 2003) * Mark Macdonald ‚Äì guitars (2003‚Äì2004) * Ruben Gutierrez ‚Äì guitars (2001) * David Arthur ‚Äì clean vocals (2005) * Justin Foley ‚Äì drums (2009) * Joey Bradford ‚Äì backing vocals (2012) * Duane Reed ‚Äì backing vocals (2007) Timeline Discography * Beneath the Encasing of Ashes (2001) * Frail Words Collapse (2003) * Shadows Are Security (2005) * An Ocean Between Us (2007) * The Powerless Rise (2010) * Awakened (2012) * Shaped by Fire (2019) Awards and nominations * San Diego Music Awards ** Artist of the Year (2005) ** Artist of the Year (2007) ** Artist of the Year (2008) ** Best Hard Rock (2011) * Grammy Awards ** Nominated for 2008 Best Metal Performance for the song \\"Nothing Left\\" *MTV2 Music Awards ** Ultimate Metal God (2007) * Hollywood Film Fest awards ** Best Music Video for \\"The Sound of Truth\\" music video * Loudwire Music Awards ** Metal Band of the Year (2012) References External links * American metalcore musical groups Heavy metal musical groups from California Musical groups from San Diego Musical quintets 2000 establishments in California Musical groups established in 2000 Musical groups disestablished in 2014 Musical groups reestablished in 2017 Metal Blade Records artists Articles which contain graphical timelines ","title":"As I Lay Dying (band)"},{"id":"1386096","text":"The Central Library of Astan Quds Razavi is a large library in Mashad, Iran.

There is no information about the exact date of the establishment of the library of Asta- Quds - Razvi. Some consider the endowment date (974 AD) of the oldest Quran to the Holy Shrine of Imam Reza (AS) by a person called Ali Ibn Simjour, as the year of establishment date of the library of Asta- Quds - Razvi (or recitation place of Quran). It can also be assumed from some extant documents concerning the endowments that the library was open to the public and used by them in 1457 AD. From about 1737 AD a special place was allocated to the library but a serious attention was paid to it in the early period of 20th century. However, an increasing inclination of using the library by the researches and scholars, prompted a faster development and growth to the library.A Glimpse at the Organization Of Libraries;Museums and Documentation Center Of Astan Quds Razavi Although the location of the library has been changed many times over years, it has always been remained in the vicinity of the Holy Shrine.

It was originally released as a PC game for CD-ROM on December 13, 2002 and subsequently re- released on DVD-ROM and for the PlayStation 2 with certain scenes removed. The title Popotan is a nonsensical word meant to reflect the prominence of dandelions, spelled in Japanese;In the Japanese language, nouns do not have a separate form in the plural. Petite Ferret also produced a fan disc shortly before the DVD-ROM re-release. Popotan has been adapted to other media, including a novel series (PopotanÔΩû Himitsu no JumonÔΩû K≈çhen) by Sassami Yachiruda; a manga series by Y≈´jiro Izumi; a twelve episode anime television series directed by Shinichiro Kimura, animated by Shaft, and licensed in North America by Geneon USA and later, Sentai Filmworks; a radio drama (Poporaji); and several art and reference books. Gameplay in Popotan follows a semi- predetermined plot; major events remain the same, but personal storylines can diverge from the player's choices. The game focuses on protagonist Chris, a drifter who meets three girls and their maid in a mansion near the ruins of Tokyo in the distant future. The player's goal is to make available sexual scenes and images that the player can view or replay at any time depicting the protagonist having sexual intercourse with one of the girls. The player can pursue other girls once they have finished one of the sisters' storylines. Sales of the visual novel and its fan disc made the top 50 list of bestselling bish≈çjo games in Japan multiple times and it spawned an internet meme when the opening was put to sped-up music by the Swedish band Caramell. Reception of the anime has been mixed with those who reviewed the first volume critical of the anime's sexual themes, especially with regard to Mii, while those who reviewed the series as a whole have tended to give overall more positive reviews, praising the story's unexpected depth. Gameplay alt=A screenshot inside Chris's Japanese bedroom. Ai's and Mii's images are separate avatar images overlaying the background. A transparent textbox at the bottom displays text over all of them. Popotan is a visual novel in which players spend most of their time in reading dynamic text, representing either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. After progressing through text, players either come to a \\"decision point\\" where they must choose from multiple options, or the text will end and the player must move to a new location, or, in the DVD-ROM and PS2 versions, use a shortcut option to continue to the next event. Time elapsed between decision points varies. The game pauses at these points and, depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress and may branch off in a specific direction. The player must romantically pursue the three sisters, and can seek other characters if one of the sisters' scenarios has been completed. A special music mini-game commences at certain points in Mii's scenario. The goal of the mini-game is to max out \\"Magical Girl Mii\\"'s magical power meter by hitting balls at the right moment. The outcome of the mini-game affects the storyline. Successfully completing her scenarios unlock an omake option on the main menu, allowing the player to play the mini-game with different music tracks. Finishing Ai's scenario unlocks a new story featuring Unagi. The player can save the game only while text is on the screen in the PC versions; this limitation was removed in the PS2 port. The PS2 port also altered the events and scenes based on the DVD version. Plot =Characters= The player assumes the role of Chris, the protagonist of Popotan. Chris is a high school dropout who dislikes the direction of society and refuses to get a job. He wanders the streets making a living as a guitar-playing busker. He feels he cannot play well without an audience, which is hard to find as a drifter. The other main characters include three sisters and their maid who live in a western-style mansion. Ai is the eldest of the three and communicates with plants. Mai is the middle sister; she is a tomboy and disapproves of Chris's behavior. Mii is the youngest and the most energetic; she often cosplays as \\"Magical Girl Mii\\" and helps people. Their maid Mea appears emotionless at first, but reveals hidden depth later in the story. =Story= Popotan takes place in the distant future within the remnants of Tokyo, destroyed by a cataclysm and since altered by geological transformations. The disaster was caused by a giant dandelion structure resembling a spire that arose in the city atop a hill. The main location of the game is a European-style mansion, seen as completely out-of-place in the city. Much of the daytime is spent outside the mansion wandering around town meeting characters and triggering event sequences. Popotan follows Chris's lifestyle changes, as well as the mysteries surrounding the spire-like object that caused the destruction of Tokyo in the past. The story opens as Chris desperately considers stealing food from a stand near a shrine entrance. His theft is unsuccessful, and he wanders around town looking for work. He finds a convenience store, where he gets directions leading him to the mansion. He enters without asking permission and runs into the three sisters and their lifelike android maid. Chris asks permission to stay because the rent is cheap and the girls are pretty; they consent, but force him to take a part-time job. The convenience store owner hires him, and as the story progresses, Chris opens up socially and begins caring about others as he interacts with the girls. He also meets new friends, including a classmate Konami, a local shrine maiden named Nono and a mysterious girl named Shizuku. Development Petit Ferret developed Popotan in 2002. Seki Hayabusa and Iwashinichi Shimizu handled scenario development, and Akio Watanabe designed its characters while working under the alias Poyoyon‚ô•Rock. Higuchi Hideki and Kajihara Masahiro composed music for the series; Under17 contributed theme music with vocals. Petite Ferret created over 1,000 two-dimensional computer graphics for backgrounds, events, and character poses. Though only characters' mouths and eyes are animated, numerous poses exist for both major and minor characters; Petit Ferret created slightly fewer graphics for the latter to reduce production costs. The game uses a character placement system to display the characters relative to the protagonist; distant characters appear small, and grow larger as the player approaches them. Petit Ferret requested applications for Japanese voice actresses from May to June 2002, seeking to fill the roles of the three sisters first. Satisfied with the applicants, Petit Ferret held open auditions for other roles starting June 30, 2002. WellMADE produced and distributed the PS2 port, , based on the DVD-ROM version of the original game. Petit Ferret made Akio Watanabe project supervisor for the PS2 port. =Release information= Petit Ferret released a trial version of Popotan for download on November 25, 2002 and released the full PC version on one CD-ROM the following December 13. To increase pre-order sales, Ferret packaged the initial CD-ROM release of Popotan with a special maxi single CD of Under17's theme songs. The firm then released a fan disc on July 11, 2003 titled . The disc includes several character-based mini-games (including the original's \\"Magical Girl Mii\\" mini-game), new storyline content and routes based around Mii and Nono, a separate music CD containing background music from the original game, themed computer wallpaper, and desktop accessories. Some of the items must be unlocked. The fan disc preceded a re-release of the main game as Popotan Po! on August 1, 2003 as a DVD-ROM with game enhancements; it would be Petit Ferret's last official release. WellMADE produced a PS2 port named Oshiete! Popotan, released March 11, 2004. Scenes in the port were changed or removed to comply with Sony's ban on sexual content, but the release still warranted CERO 18 rating. Later, after the CERO revised its rating system, it was given a CERO D rating. WellMADE tried to compensate for their absence with graphics and gameplay improvements. WellMADE enticed buyers of the port with a bonus themed calling card, reversible poster, and music CD. WellMADE also released two free spinoff games in December 2003 and March 2004, collectively named and featuring Unagi as the heroine. WellMADE designed the games to be humorous and fun; the second allows Unagi to transform into her humanoid form after a certain point in the story. The initial limited edition release of Popotan on CD-ROM suffered critical errors, such as graphic display issues, saving and loading issues, the inability to complete some routes and Mii's mini-game not starting. Petite Ferret issued a patch on January 10, 2003. Later versions of the game were released bug-free. Issho ni A-SO-BO also contained several serious errors. Petit Ferret addressed these issues in two patches. The first patch added missing voice data from the original game CD; customers were given the option of downloading the patch or exchanging for a new CD. Ferret released the second patch on July 7, 2003; it corrected grammatical errors, adjusted the game's difficulty, and enhanced stability. The second patch did not contain the first's fixes. Related media =Anime series= An anime television series adaptation of Popotan was animated by Shaft, featuring Shinichiro Kimura's directing and storyboards, Haruka Sakurai's character designs (based on Akio Watanabe's original concept), and Rondo Mizukami's animation oversight. Under17 composed the opening theme song in the same style used for the game; Funta wrote the ending theme song. Tokyo Broadcasting System's satellite station BS-i and the Bandai Channel aired the anime from July 17, 2003 through October 3, 2003. The narrative is episodic and usually focuses on one character at a time. Each of the first four episodes focuses on one of the four main characters, depicting social interaction and growth. The anime's use of time travel allows focus on the older versions or children of previously-featured characters, and contrasts their experiences with the protagonists' agelessness. Reviewers have experienced difficulty categorizing the Popotan anime, though it does feature an overall comedic tone. The characters are very lighthearted and eager to help new acquaintances. Nudity appears in many episodes, though no sexually explicit scenes occur. Geneon rated the series for ages 16+; Section23 Films gave its re-release a TV-MA rating. Shaft released a teaser DVD entitled on June 27, 2003 featuring character designs by Haruka Sakurai. The DVD also contained video interviews with the anime's Japanese voice actresses, a CD of music from radio the drama, 's theme ,metallic paint illustrations, and a plushie of Unagi. Bandai Visual released the anime on six Japanese DVDs containing two episodes each. Bandai staggered the discs' release over the period September 26, 2003 and February 25, 2004. Each disc came with a promotional figurine of one of the girls; Bandai provided DVDs without the figurines at lower costs. A misprint on the volume 3 DVD jacket occurred during production, numbering the episodes incorrectly. Bandai Visual offered free exchanges of the jackets to purchasers. Geneon USA licensed the DVDs for North American release, producing three DVDs containing four episodes each between December 7, 2004 and April 26, 2005. Geneon USA began selling a box set on August 14, 2007, shortly before the firm's demise. Sentai Filmworks licensed the anime for distribution in late 2009, having made an announcement July 28. Section23 Films re-released the complete series through a 2-disc set on October 27, 2009. Setting and plot An adaptation of the visual novel, the anime takes place in an alternate reality. The main female characters and their relations are unchanged, but the storyline is unrelated to the game's. The plot follows the perspective of the three sisters and their maid rather than the game's protagonist; all the game's major female characters appear and many of the minor characters are used in supporting or cameo roles. The story centers around the three sisters as they travel through time in a mansion, run a Christmas shop, and search for the dandelion-resembling \\"popotan\\". The sisters interact with others and try to improve their situations. The anime suggests that others, including the antagonist Keith, have attempted similar journeys in the past. The anime otherwise covers little backstory, obscuring the reason for why Shizuku, Keith and Mea are associated. The sisters meet Shizuku while traveling through time, who gives them the option to continue journeying or stay in the era they enjoy most; they choose the former. The story ends as they continue traveling through time, leaving unanswered questions concerning their final destination and why they were chosen. Their bodies are connected to the mansion where they live, which allows them to travel through time. Their bodies cease to age outside the mansion; even their hair stops growing. They jump five years into the future when traveling through time and always arrive in different places, except for a split-party scenario in which Mai and Mea are left behind. =Music= The visual novel features three themes by Under17‚Äîthe opening theme , the theme song for Mii's \\"Magical Girl Mii\\" cosplay ('), and ending theme '. Under17 added their theme songs to their Best Album soundtracks along with Popotan Kiss from the radio drama. Under17 plays work composed for Popotan in their live events. Customers who pre-ordered the game received the moe theme songs by Under17 as bonus content. Petit Ferret coincided the visual novel's premiere with the release of a special maxi single containing the anime's vocal theme songs and their instrumental counterparts, otherwise unavailable to listeners. A third Popotan image album based on the visual novel was packaged as a pre-order item with the PS2 port the following year. The anime opens with ' by Under17, and the closes with S‚ÄìU‚ÄìK‚ÄìI by Funta. Petit Ferret released two full-length albums and one extended play based on the anime in late 2003. The EP, ', debuted on August 6, 2003 and featured full versions of the anime's opening and ending themes as well as Gem Stone, an image song collaboration between Under17 and Funta. The first album, It's A PoPoTime!, contains original character songs by the Japanese voice actresses and was released November 6, 2003. The second album, Popo Music, comprised the anime's original soundtrack by Ozamu Tezuka and was released on the 27th. =Radio drama and publications= Petit Ferret developed a radio drama named Poporaji, based on a song used in the anime's broadcast premiere DVD, The Secret of the 3 Sisters. The show focused on the three sisters and Mea with their respective Japanese voice actresses playing their roles. It was broadcast by Osaka Broadcasting Corporation in two segments; the first ran from April to September 2003 and the second from October to December 2003. TBS Radio rebroadcast the drama later in its debut week. Petit Ferret announced on January 22, 2004 that Poporaji would be replayed on BEAT NetRadio on Bandai Visual's website and compiled into two CDs, and Poporaji Popoi CD2. Sasami Uachiruda and SPIRITE wrote and illustrated two novels, entitled and published by Softgarage on June 20 and August 22, 2002. These novels follow the plot of the series, involving all notable characters and combining their personal storylines. Magazine Z published a two-part Popotan manga series by Y≈´jiro Izumi whose story revolved around the three sisters. The manga was released in two volumes on December 19, 2003 and August 23, 2004. Two Popotan reference books have been released‚Äî, published by Petit Ferret and SoftBank Publishing, and distributed by Raspberry Books; and by Air Publications. The Popotan Visual Fan Book featured a new side-story printed in western format.The book is printed to be read from left to right. Traditional Japanese writing is written from right to left. Kadokawa Shoten published an art book for the series entitled . Popotan illustrations also appear in . A fan book by for the television series was released March 5, 2003, entitled and containing a Microsoft Windows CD-ROM with extra content. Legacy, reception and sales =Visual novel= alt=An animated image of Mai and Mii doing a simple dance. They hold their hands on the sides of their heads flapping them while shaking their hips sideways. Popotan visual novels released by Petit Ferret enjoyed strong initial sales. PCNews' national rating of bish≈çjo games listed Popotans initial CD-ROM release at ninth place around one-and-a-half months after its release; it stayed on the charts another half-month at twenty-first. It returned six months after release for a brief stay at forty- sixth shortly before the fan disc was released. The DVD-ROM re-release rose to twenty-fourth in overall sales one month after its debut. The fan disc's release propelled it to eleventh among the most sold bish≈çjo games within one month. The PS2 port Oshiete! Popotan received a score rating of 22 / 40. The visual novel featured a dance in its opening that became an internet phenomenon. The dance features Mai and Mii swinging their hips sideways while holding their hands near the sides of their heads and flapping them, as if making a \\"goodbye\\" motion representing cat ears Internet users set the dance to a sped-up chorus of the song Caramelldansen by Caramell. The scene's popularity helped the Popotan franchise and Caramell attain a cult following. The dance is performed by individuals (especially in Japan) at anime conventions, and in advertising, video games and other unrelated anime. The popularity of Popotan in Japan brought Momoi Haruko and her band Under17 to prominence. =Anime= The first English Popotan DVD met mixed reviews in the United States. Anime Jump gave it 1¬Ω stars, stating that beyond the pretty pictures, \\"it is created specifically to sell DVDs, tiny figurines, and other merchandise to introverted adult men.\\" DVDtalk gave it a final rating of \\"recommended\\" and only criticized the bonus content. The reviewer remarked that the first disc \\"[...]was full of surprises for even a jaded old reviewer like myself.\\" Anime News Network held mixed attitudes towards the second DVD, citing certain characters and the level of nudity. Its reviewers praised Popotans storyline, considering it especially complex for a video game-based anime. Popotan has proven notoriously difficult for English reviewers to categorize, leading several to praise its multi-genre style and appeal. Critics who reviewed only the first DVD gave the series more negative marks than those who reviewed it in full. Of the latter, Allmovie gave Popotan 4/5 stars and DVDtalk awarded it \\"recommended\\" status, citing the first two discs. Examining the Sentai Filmworks re-release, Theron Martin concurred that the anime improved towards the end despite rushed plot development. He gave the series low marks overall, feeling its quality varied wildly each episode. The level of nudity and its importance to the storyline have been widely debated. John Oppliger of Anime Nation feels explicit nudity ruined the Popotan anime, overshadowing its character depth and complex storyline. Anime News Network and Mania agreed that it was excessive; one reviewer from the former likened it to \\"kiddy porn\\" and another attributed its re-release to demand for nudity. DVDtalk's reviewers were mixed; one claimed the nude scenes were out-of-place, and another considered them appropriate. Both considered the overall use of nudity to be \\"minor\\". Critics have generally praised the animation and Akio Watanabe's character design. Despite chiding the plot, Mike Toole found the character design \\"memorable\\"; reviewer Theron Martin disagreed. found praise for his minimalist approach to the score.Ozamu Tezuka is a composer of anime music and should not to be confused with Osamu Tezuka, one of the founding Japanese animators. Geneon's voice acting also elicited good reception, credited to Rob Beckwell, Popotans English voice director. Mii is the only protagonist criticized for her voice acting; reviewers particularly praised Mea's voice.

History  At the end of the 3rd century AD, the Roman emperor Diocletian divided the great Roman province of Africa Proconsularis into three smaller provinces: Zeugitana in the north, still governed by a proconsul and referred to as Proconsularis; Byzacena to its adjacent south, and Tripolitania to its adjacent south, roughly corresponding to southeast Tunisia and northwest Libya. Byzacena corresponded roughly to eastern Tunisia or the modern Tunisian region of Sahel. Hadrumetum (modern Sousse) became the capital of the newly made province, whose governor had the rank of consularis.

Chertoff worked on Mafia and political corruption‚Äìrelated cases. In the mid-1990s, Chertoff returned to Latham & Watkins for a brief period, founding the firm's office in Newark, New Jersey. Chertoff has been a resident of Westfield, New Jersey.Corbin, Horace. \\"A Night With Michael Chertoff\\", The Westfield Leader, March 31, 2010.

In 1990, Chertoff was appointed by President George H. W. Bush as United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey. Among his most important cases, in 1992 Chertoff achieved conviction of second-term Jersey City mayor Gerald McCann on charges of defrauding money from a savings and loan scam. McCann served two years in federal prison. In 1993, he was a prosecutor in the fraud case against Eddie Antar, founder of the Crazy Eddie's electronics store chain. Chertoff was asked to stay in his position when the Clinton administration took office in 1993, at the request of Democratic Senator Bill Bradley. He was the only United States Attorney who was not replaced due to the change in administrations. He continued to work with the U.S. Attorney's office until 1994, when he entered private practice, returning to Latham & Watkins as a partner. Despite his friendly relationship with some Democrats, Chertoff was appointed as the special counsel for the Senate Whitewater Committee studying allegations against President Clinton and his wife in what was known as the Whitewater investigation. No charges were brought against the Clintons. In 2000, Chertoff worked as special counsel to the New Jersey Senate Judiciary Committee, investigating racial profiling in New Jersey. He also did some fundraising for George W. Bush and other Republicans during the 2000 election cycle. He advised Bush's presidential campaign on criminal justice issues. Chertoff was appointed by Bush to head the criminal division of the Department of Justice, serving from 2001 to 2003. He led the federal prosecution's case against suspected terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui. Chertoff also led the prosecution's case against accounting firm Arthur Andersen for destroying documents relating to the Enron collapse. The prosecution of Arthur Andersen was controversial, as the firm was effectively dissolved, resulting in the loss of 26,000 jobs. The United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction, and the case has not been retried. On March 5, 2003, Chertoff was nominated by President Bush to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated by Morton I. Greenberg. He was confirmed by the Senate 88‚Äì1 on June 9, 2003, with Senator Hillary Clinton of New York casting the lone dissenting vote; he received his commission the following day. Senator Clinton said that she had dissented to register her protest for the way Chertoff's staff mistreated junior White House staffers during the Whitewater investigation.

After a lengthy search to find a suitable replacement, Bush nominated Chertoff to the post in January 2005, citing his experience with post-9/11 terror legislation. He was unanimously approved for the position by the United States Senate on February 15, 2005. Hurricane Katrina occurred while Chertoff was Secretary of Homeland Security. The Department was criticized for its lack of preparation in advance of the well-forecast hurricane; most criticism was directed toward the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Executive Summary, Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina , 2006-2-15, Retrieved 2007-6-11 DHS in general, and Chertoff in particular, were criticized for responding poorly to the disaster, ignoring crucial information about the catastrophic nature of the storm and devoting little attention to the federal response to what became the most costly disaster in American history.Christopher Cooper and Robert Block. 2006. Disaster : Hurricane Katrina and the Failure of Homeland Security. New York: Times Books, 2006.

Views =Construction of border fence= In April 2008, Chertoff was criticized in The New York Times editorial for waiving the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and other environmental protection legislation to construct a fence along the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. The Times wrote: \\"To the long list of things the Bush administration is willing to trash in its rush to appease immigration hard-liners, you can now add dozens of important environmental laws and hundreds of thousands of acres of fragile habitat on the southern border.\\" According to The New York Times columnist Adam Liptak, Chertoff had excluded the Department of Homeland Security from having to follow laws \\"protecting the environment, endangered species, migratory birds, the bald eagle, antiquities, farms, deserts, forests, Native American graves and religious freedom.\\" A report issued by the Congressional Research Service, the non-partisan research division of the Library of Congress, said that the unchecked delegation of powers to Chertoff was unprecedented: > After a review of federal law, primarily through electronic database > searches and consultations with various CRS experts, we were unable to > locate a waiver provision identical to that of ¬ß102 of H.R. 418‚Äîi.e., a > provision that contains 'notwithstanding' language, provides a secretary of > an executive agency the authority to waive all laws such secretary > determines necessary, and directs the secretary to waive such laws. =Actions regarding illegal immigration= In September 2007, Chertoff told a House committee that the DHS would not tolerate interference by sanctuary cities that would block the \\"Basic Pilot Program,\\" which requires some types of employers to validate the legal status of their workers.DHS - EVerify \\"DHS website\\" December 1, 2007 He said that the DHS was exploring its legal options and intended to take action to prevent any interference with the law.Chertoff Warns Sanctuary Cities on Illegals \\"NewsMax\\" September 6, 2007 In 2008 it was reported that the residential housekeeping company Chertoff had hired to clean his house employed undocumented immigrants. =Globalization= At the Global Creative Leadership Summit in 2009, Chertoff described globalization as a double-edged sword.

In June 1942, he was assigned to the Midway Operation. During the subsequent Battle of Midway on June 6, 1942, Yamaguchi sparred with his superior officer, Vice Admiral Ch≈´ichi Nagumo, when a reconnaissance plane discovered an American aircraft carrier () near Midway. At the time, the Japanese carriers‚Ä≤ planes were armed with bombs. Nagumo wished to switch the armament to torpedoes. Yamaguchi demanded that no time be wasted and that the planes be launched to attack the American carrier with bombs. Nagumo rejected this; shortly afterward, American carrier aircraft destroyed all the Japanese carriers except Yamaguchi‚Ä≤s flagship Hiry≈´. Yamaguchi quickly ordered two successive attacks on Yorktown which crippled it. Shortly afterward, another carrier air strike against Hiry≈´ resulted in hits by aircraft from , consisting of her own planes and orphaned Yorktown aircraft.

He and the captain of Hiry≈´, Tomeo Kaku, summoned all officers and crew to the flight deck, and Yamaguchi addressed them, taking responsibility for the loss of Hiry≈´ and Soryu. He announced, \\"I shall remain on board to the end. I command all of you to leave the ship and continue your loyal service to His Majesty, the Emperor.\\" Yamaguchi then led his men in three Banzai cheers for the Emperor. As the men began leaving, Kaku turned to Yamaguchi and said \\"I am going to share the fate of the ship, sir.\\" The admiral agreed, and both men began calmly admiring the moon. Yamaguchi said to Kaku, \\"Let us enjoy the beauty of the moon\\". \\"How bright it shines,\\" Kaku agreed, \\"It must be in its twenty-first day.\\" Yamaguchi refused to allow his staff officers to stay with them. He asked Commander Ito for two last messages; the first was for Admiral Nagumo: \\"I have no words to apologize for what has happened. I only wish for a stronger Japanese Navy and revenge.\\" The second was for Captain Toshio Abe, commanding the destroyer : \\"Scuttle the Hiry≈´ with your torpedoes\\". All the men, including Yamaguchi and Kaku, then shared naval biscuits and water, in a farewell toast. As Commander Ito left, Yamaguchi handed him his cap as a keepsake for his family.

He also appears as a supporting character in the sequel, The Return of the Condor Heroes, and is mentioned by name in The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber. He is a descendant of Guo Sheng, one of the 108 outlaws from Mount Liang in the classical novel Water Margin. Guo Jing and Yang Kang were both named by Qiu Chuji, who urges them to remember the Jingkang Incident and be loyal towards their native land, the Song Empire. Guo Jing is killed during the Battle of Xiangyang along with the rest of his family except his younger daughter, Guo Xiang. In The Legend of the Condor Heroes Guo Jing's hometown is in Niu Family Village. His father, Guo Xiaotian, was from Shandong but moved to Lin'an (present-day Hangzhou) after the Jurchen-led Jin Empire conquered the northern part of the Song Empire in the Jin‚ÄìSong Wars. Guo Xiaotian met Li Ping in Lin'an and married her. Two years after their marriage, Guo Xiaotian was killed by a group of soldiers led by Duan Tiande during a raid ordered by Wanyan Honglie. Li Ping, who was pregnant with Guo Jing then, was captured and held hostage by Duan Tiande, but managed to escape later. She fled north and arrived in Mongolia, where she gave birth to Guo Jing. Guo Jing and his mother are taken in by some nomads later and become part of Genghis Khan's tribe. Guo Jing befriends the Khan's children and followers, and becomes anda (sworn brothers) with the Khan's fourth son, Tolui. He later meets the \\"Seven Freaks of Jiangnan\\" and learns martial arts from them. During battles between the Khan and his rivals, Guo Jing demonstrates his loyalty to the Khan by helping to fend off the attackers. The Khan sees Guo Jing as a loyal subject, places great faith and trust in him, and betroths his daughter, Huazheng, to him. At the age of 18, Guo Jing leaves Mongolia to meet Yang Kang, the son of his father's sworn brother, Yang Tiexin, for a contest arranged 18 years ago by the \\"Seven Freaks of Jiangnan\\" and Qiu Chuji. He encounters several extraordinary martial artists, who teach him some of their skills. By chance, he finds two prized texts: the Nine Yin Manual and the Book of Wumu. The knowledge he gained from the books turned him into a formidable martial artist and skilled tactician as he gradually matures in his beliefs and ideals. He also meets his future wife, Huang Rong, and they go on adventures together and are eventually married. Guo Jing returns to Mongolia after his trip to the Song Empire and joins Genghis Khan in the Mongol campaign against the Khwarezmid Empire. He plays a significant role in the capture of the city of Samarkand and returns home in triumph. When he discovers later that the Mongols are planning to invade the Song Empire, he renounces his loyalty to the Khan and flees from Mongolia. Thereafter, he establishes a base of operations in the city of Xiangyang. Since then, Guo Jing has dedicated his life to defending his homeland from foreign invaders. In The Return of the Condor Heroes Guo Jing appears as a supporting character in the sequel, which is set several years after the end of the first novel. The adult Guo Jing is now a prominent figure in the wulin (martial artists' community) and a highly revered hero in Han Chinese society. He faces the arduous task of raising the orphaned son of his late sworn brother, Yang Kang, and guiding him on the path of goodness. He had previously named the boy 'Yang Guo' in the hope that the boy would redeem his family's honour, which had been tarnished by Yang Kang's villainy. Guo Jing and Huang Rong also raise Wu Dunru and Wu Xiuwen as their apprentices. Guo Jing and Huang Rong play active roles in shaping Yang Guo's character. For example, Guo Jing's image as a fervently loyal and chivalrous hero inspires Yang Guo and serves as a role model for the boy to follow. However, Yang Guo also sees the couple as enemies because of the roles they played in his father's death, even though they did not kill him. He often harbours the intention of killing them. Yang Guo's anger and hatred gradually subsides when he discovers Guo Jing's humble and kind character, and when he learns the true details about his father's past from Ke Zhen'e. Guo Jing becomes an active member in defending the city of Xiangyang from Mongol invaders. After successfully establishing a base of operations in the city, Guo Jing and Huang Rong work closely with Xiangyang's military forces and their wulin allies to defend the city. The couple have three children; elder daughter Guo Fu and the twins Guo Xiang (girl) and Guo Polu (boy). Guo Xiang's name is inspired by the \\"Xiang\\" in \\"Xiangyang\\" while \\"Polu\\" means \\"defeat and drive away barbarians\\" (the \\"barbarians\\" refer to the Mongol invaders in this context). Guo Jing uses his knowledge and experience from his earlier campaigns to counter the Mongol invasion. It is revealed in The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber that Xiangyang eventually falls to the Mongol invaders, and that Guo Jing and his family died in the battle. Only Guo Xiang survived, and she founded the Emei Sect later. Character description Guo Jing has thick eyebrows, large eyes, a sturdy and strong stature, and a complexion somewhere between dark and fair. He is described to be \\"dumb\\", slow in learning and inarticulate. His most outstanding trait is his constant strife for moral rectitude, as seen when he faces a dilemma after Genghis Khan attempts to force him to lead the Mongol army to attack his native land.See Chapter 39 of the first novel. Although he was born and raised in Mongolia, he is unwilling to side with the Mongols to attack the Song Empire. In The Return of the Condor Heroes, the adult Guo Jing dedicates his life to defending the Song Empire from foreign invaders.See Chapter 39 of the second novel. Martial arts and skills Guo Jing is the most powerful martial artist of his generation, and one of the most formidable in the wulin in his lifetime. His profound mastery of several different types of martial arts and skills surpasses that of many others in the wulin. Towards the end of The Return of the Condor Heroes, Huang Rong names him the \\"Northern Hero\\" (Âåó‰ø†) of the new generation of the Five Greats to replace his master, \\"Northern Beggar\\" Hong Qigong.See Chapter 40 of the second novel. His repertoire of skills and martial arts are described in the following sections: =Mongolia= Guo Jing is one of the finest archers in Mongolia. He was trained in his early days by the legendary archer Jebe.See Chapter 5 of the first novel. In his youth, he once shot down two eagles in the sky with a single arrow. The incident earned him fame and the admiration of Genghis Khan. In his childhood, he also played wrestling as a sport with the Khan's children and followers. =Seven Freaks of Jiangnan= Guo Jing was first introduced to Chinese martial arts by the \\"Seven Freaks of Jiangnan\\", a group of seven martial artists from Jiaxing. The Freaks find a six-year-old Guo Jing after a long search that brought them to Mongolia. They teach him all the skills they know to prepare him for an upcoming competition with Yang Kang. The Freaks did not teach him any inner energy cultivation techniques at all. The skills taught to Guo Jing by the Freaks include: * Demon Subduing Staff Skill (‰ºèÈ≠îÊùñÊ≥ï) * Bare Handed Disarming Skill (Á©∫ÊâãÂ•™ÁôΩÂàÉ) * Bone and Joint Dislocation Hand (ÂàÜÁ≠ãÈåØÈ™®Êâã) * Golden Dragon Whip Skill (ÈáëÈæçÈû≠Ê≥ï) * Southern Mountain Saber Skill (ÂçóÂ±±ÂàÄÊ≥ï) * Mountain Splitting Palm Skill (ÈñãÂ±±ÊéåÊ≥ï) * Huyan Spear Skill (ÂëºÂª∂ÊßçÊ≥ï) * Yue Maiden Swordplay (Ë∂äÂ•≥ÂäçÊ≥ï) =Quanzhen Sect= Ma Yu, Qiu Chuji and Wang Chuyi of the Quanzhen Sect teach Guo Jing some basics of their sect's inner energy cultivation techniques. Guo Jing is able to understand the basis of Quanzhen's Big Dipper Formation (‰∏ÉÊòüÂåóÊñóÈô£) after reading the Nine Yin Manual and observing the formation being deployed in actual combat. =Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms= Guo Jing meets Hong Qigong by chance while out on adventure with Huang Rong. Huang Rong, worrying that her father will look down on Guo Jing due to his unimpressive mastery of martial arts, uses this chance to incite Hong Qigong to teach Guo Jing his most powerful skill. Tempted by Huang Rong's culinary skill, Hong Qigong agrees to teach Guo Jing his 'Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms' to repay Huang Rong's favours of preparing fine cuisine for him every day during the brief period of time he spent with them. =Zhou Botong= Guo Jing meets Zhou Botong on Peach Blossom Island and becomes sworn brothers with him. Zhou Botong teaches him the 'Seventy-two Styles Vacant Fist' (‰∏ÉÂçÅ‰∫åË∑ØÁ©∫ÊòéÊã≥). Zhou Botong also teaches him the 'Technique of Ambidexterity' (ÈõôÊâã‰∫íÊêè)), which allows him to use two different sets of martial arts simultaneously.See Chapter 17 of the first novel. Unexpectedly, the slow learning Guo manages to master this technique in a short period of time, whereas his more intelligent wife is unable to grasp it at all.See Chapter 25 of the second novel. =Nine Yin Manual= Zhou Botong has with him a copy of the Nine Yin Manual, the most coveted martial arts manual of that era because of the incredible inner energy cultivation techniques and extraordinary skills it records. He has been forbidden by Wang Chongyang to learn the skills described in the book so he lets Guo Jing learn. =Military strategy= Guo Jing learnt military strategy and tactics from the Book of Wumu, a military treatise written by the Song general Yue Fei. The book is coveted by many, as it is widely believed that whoever possesses it will conquer the world. The Jurchens and Mongols are among those actively seeking the book. Guo Jing finds the book by chance on Iron Palm Peak. He reads it thoroughly and employs some of the strategies during the war with the Khwarezmid Empire. The experience he gained from the Mongol campaigns and knowledge from the book turns him into a skilled military tactician. Legacy Before leaving for good, Yang Guo and Xiaolongn√º gave Guo Xiang their Gentleman and Lady Swords and the Heavy Iron Sword. In The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber, it is revealed that the swords were melted and reforged into the Heaven Reliant Sword and Dragon Slaying Saber. Guo Jing wrote the Nine Yin Manual from memory during the siege of Xiangyang. He also wrote a martial arts manual for the 'Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms'. Guo Jing also recorded all his military experiences and knowledge from the Book of Wumu on a piece of cloth. Both the scroll and the cloth were hidden at Taohua Island, the home of Guo Jing and Huang Rong. The co-ordinates of Taohua Island and the map to pass the maze on Taohua Island were separately hidden inside the blade of the Dragon Slaying Saber. The Heaven Reliant Sword was brought out of Xiangyang by Guo Xiang before the city was conquered, while the Dragon Slaying Saber was lost and disappeared after Guo Polu's death. The heroic deeds of Guo Jing and Huang Rong became jianghu legends and were occasionally mentioned in The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber.

Professional career In October 1976, Parker made his Broadway debut as an understudy at the Morosco Theatre in a revival of the play The Innocents, adapted and directed by Harold Pinter. In 1978, Toby was cast in Runaways, which made its Off-Broadway premiere at The Public Theater and later moved to Broadway at the Plymouth Theatre.

It is part of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region, a Hanseatic town and an independent municipality. Uelzen is characterised by timber-framed architecture and also has some striking examples of North German brick Gothic. The county town earned pan-regional fame when Friedensreich Hundertwasser was selected to redesign the station: the final work of the celebrated Viennese artist and architect was ceremonially opened in 2000 as the Hundertwasser Station, Uelzen, and has since been a popular tourist magnet. The Polabian name for Uelzen is Wilcaus (spelled Wiltzaus in older German reference material), possibly derived from wilca or wilsa (< Slavic *olƒÉ≈°a) 'alder'.  Geography  = Location = Uelzen lies on the eastern edge of the L√ºneburg Heath. The town is a transport hub on the north‚Äìsouth axis from Hamburg to Hanover as well as the east‚Äìwest axis from Bremen to Berlin. Also of economic importance is its location on the Elbe Lateral Canal. The town has a charming setting, situated as it is on the heath river, the Ilmenau, with its grassy river banks, small parks, and water meadows. Large areas in the vicinity of Uelzen have been set aside as nature parks with moors, woods, lakes, and heathland: the Elbh√∂hen-Wendland Nature Park, L√ºneburg Heath Nature Park and Lower Saxon Elbe Valley Water Meadows Biosphere Reserve. = Divisions = The following parishes belong to the borough of Uelzen: Gro√ü Liedern, Halligdorf, Hambrock, Hansen, Hanstedt II, Holdenstedt, Kirchweyhe, Klein S√ºstedt, Masendorf, Mehre, Molzen, Oldenstadt, Riestedt, Ripdorf, Tatern, Veer√üen, Westerweyhe, and Woltersburg. Furthermore, there are four other places that have the status of \\"special parishes\\" (Sonstige Ortsteile): Borne, Kl. Liedern, Pieperh√∂fen, and Oldenstadt-West. History Uelzen by Matth√§us Merian the Younger, about 1654 Old post office building The town was founded in 1250. In 1270 Duke John of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, a Welf who ruled the Principality of L√ºneburg from 1252 to 1277, granted Uelzen its town privileges (Stadtrechte).http://www.hanse.org/en/hanseatic-cities/uelzen-tourism In the Middle Ages it became an active member of the Hanseatic League. The town fortification, built in the 14th century, originally had 3 gates, a wall, and a moat. Parts of the wall are still standing. While Uelzen only played a small role in the Hanseatic League, there is evidence that it traded with Livonia and Spain. \\"At the Schnellenmarket, a London trading office purchased Uelzener linen, earthenware pitchers were offered for sale and brewery business flourished. On 21 October 1470, Uelzen was the venue for a Hanseatic League Convention. A special honour as these resolutions of the association of cities only took place annually - primarily in L√ºbeck.\\" The town became part of the Electorate of Hanover in 1708, the Kingdom of Westphalia in 1807, the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814, and the Prussian Province of Hanover in 1866.

The town is best known today for its well-preserved medieval town centre, for horse-riding, and the opportunities it provides for cycling. Bicycles are such a common means of transport in the area that many cycle paths have been built, even alongside main roads outside the town. History The origin and name Warendorf date back to the ancient Saxon royal court of Warintharpa (‚Äúthe village on the embankment‚Äù), which was most likely already formed in 700 BC. Between the years of 1197 and 1201 Warendorf became a town. During this time, among the already established parish, which belonged to the ‚Äúold church‚Äù (St. Laurentius), a new, second parish with the ‚Äúnew church‚Äù (Marienkirche) was formed just west of the town centre. The medieval records of the founding of Warendorf are missing, along with several records and documents in M√ºnster. These were all destroyed during the rule under the Anabaptists. Bishop Hermann II von Katzenelnbogen (Bishop 1173-1202) also contributed to the founding of the town. In 1224 the first recorded mention of Warendorf as a civitas, which is a civil and municipal community, was made. The wealth of Warendorf grew increasingly and developed more and more into an important trading town, since it is situated favourably between M√ºnster and Oelde. Apart from that Warendorf profited from the production and selling of linen. The wealthy citizens settled on the market square and in the streets, Emsstrasse and Oststrasse. Still today these areas of the town are most prominent in the townscape of Warendorf. In contrast, the poorer part of population lived in simple houses with dirt floors. These bad living conditions lead to the epidemics and illnesses. In 1404 there was a great fire in Warendorf, during which along with 600 houses also the ‚Äúold church‚Äù (St. Laurentius) and the town hall with all its inventory were destroyed. In 1533 the Anabaptist movement spread in Warendorf and also in M√ºnster. This movement took over rule in the town for one week in October 1534, until it was ended by a short occupation by Bishop Franz von Waldeck. Four Anabaptist apostles and the Warendorf Anabaptist movement leaders were sentenced to death and were executed by a sword on the market square. As a deterrent the bodies of the ‚Äúapostles‚Äù were laid on the four gates into the town. As a result of this, Warendorf lost its town rights and regained them again in 1542. Free elections of the local council were first held in 1556 under Bishop Franz von Waldeck's successor. The Anabaptist movement continued up into the 17th century in the background without any serious danger for the town or church.Hans-Joachim Behr, Die Stadt Warendorf in der Territorialgeschichte des F√ºrstbistums M√ºnster bis 1803, in: Geschichte der Stadt Warendorf ‚Äì Band 1., Ardey-Verlag, M√ºnster 2000, , Seiten 304‚Äì308Alois Schr√∂er, Die Kirche von Warendorf zur Zeit der Reformation und der katholischen Erneuerung (1500‚Äì1650)., in: Geschichte der Stadt Warendorf ‚Äì Band 1., Ardey-Verlag, M√ºnster 2000, , Seiten 351‚Äì358 Between 1627 and 1632 loss of the town rights occurred during religious battles of the Thirty Years' War. The first mention of the ‚ÄúFettmarkt‚Äù dates back to 1657. This event remained an important funfair with a flea market and livestock market still today. In 1741 another great fire broke out, which resulted in the destruction of the ‚Äúnew church‚Äù (Marienkirche) and 332 houses. Because many tradesmen had to move further, and so Warendorf suffered economic loss. In 1802 Warendorf came under the Prussian sovereignty. The once blossoming town impoverished. In 1826 the establishment of the Westphalian state stud farm in Warendorf was succeeded by the Prussian stud administration. In 1887 the railroad line M√ºnster ‚Äì Warendorf ‚Äì Rheda- Wiedenbr√ºck was opened. In 1937 barracks were built just north of Warendorf. Today, the sport school of the German army is also located in these barracks. On 1 January 1975, a reformation of the municipalities was carried out. This reformation integrated the communities of Einen and Milte, and the town of Freckenhorst into the town of Warendorf. Also during this reformation, the larger district of Warendorf (district) was formed by combining the districts of Warendorf and Beckum. Warendorf became seat of the district government. Geography Warendorf is situated on the Ems river in the eastern part of the M√ºnsterland area. This area of the Westphalian Lowland is characterized by agriculture. Because of its varying landscape of fields, pastures, small forests and hedgerows, people compare this area to a park. The closest large city is M√ºnster, which is located west of Warendorf. Other large cities in the area are Osnabr√ºck, approx. to the north, Bielefeld, approx. to the east, and Hamm, approx. to the south.

Japa () is the meditative repetition of a mantra or a divine name. It is a practice found in Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism,S Deol (1998), Japji: The Path of Devotional Meditation, , page 11 Buddhism, and Shint≈çism. The mantra or name may be spoken softly, enough for the practitioner to hear it, or it may be spoken within the reciter's mind.Eknath Easwaran (1977/2008). Mantram Handbook (5th ed.). Tomales, CA: Nilgiri Press. Japa may be performed while sitting in a meditation posture, while performing other activities, or as part of formal worship in group settings. Etymology The Sanskrit word japa is derived from the root jap-, meaning \\"to utter in a low voice, repeat internally, mutter\\".V. S. Apte. A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary. p. 447. It can be further defined as ja to destroy birth, death, and reincarnation and pa meaning to destroy ones sins. Monier-Williams states that the term appears in Vedic literature such as in the Aitereya Brahmana (Rigveda) and the Shatapatha Brahmana (Yajurveda).Sir Monier Monier-Williams, Japa, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages, Oxford University Press (Reprinted: Motilal Banarsidass), , page 412 The term means muttering, whispering or murmuring passages from the scripture, or charms, or names of deity. Often it is the repetitive singing of a verse or mantra, sometimes counted with the help of a rosary which is called Japa-mala. A related word, Japana appears in Book 12 of the Mahabharata, where muttering prayers is described as a form of religious offering. The concept of Japa is also found in early Buddhist texts, and is very common in Tibetan Buddhism literature. According to Sage Patanjali (400 CE), Japa is not the repetition of word or phase but rather contemplation on the meaning of the mantra, this definition sometimes persists across different sources. Varieties Japa mala, Japa beads, consisting of 108 beads plus the head bead =Beads= In some forms of japa, the repetitions are counted using a string of beads known as a japa mala. Many different types of materials are used for japa. The number of beads in the japa mala is generally 108. It is not uncommon for people to wear japa beads around their neck, although some practitioners prefer to carry them in a bead-bag in order to keep them clean. = Degrees of loudness = Japa may be performed in varying degrees of loudness: * Vaikhari Japa is spoken loud enough so that, although this is not why it is so loud (unless it is a group japa session), nearby people can hear it recited. It may be useful when there are other sounds nearby (though some consider this to be a mistake) or when concentration is difficult and is thus considered most suitable for beginners. * Upamshu Japa is said quietly, at a whisper. It is said to be one hundred times more effective than vaikhari japa. During upamshu japa the practitioner's lips should barely move so it is difficult for an observer to see that anything is being said. * Manasika Japa is recited in the mind. It is said to be one thousand times more effective than upamshu japa and thus 100 000 times more effective than vaikhari japa. It is also said to be difficult or impossible to practice for those who are not already grounded in vaikhari japa practice. = Likhita japa = Likhita japa is the writing of a mantra while, usually, reciting it aloud at the same time. Proponents say it is more effective than simply reciting the mantra aloud. Likhita japa is often written in a book dedicated to the purpose. Books intended for shorter mantras have a grid of rectangular cells with each cell holding one instance of the mantra. Practitioners may use different coloured ink to write in certain cells in order to make a decorative or symbolic pattern. =Mantracakras= Tibetan Buddhists include japa meditation as a large part of their religious practices. In Tibet, states Harvey Alper, the prayer wheels are instruments for japa. The practice of nembutsu in Pure Land Buddhism is analogous to japa. =Analogues in other traditions= Some Catholic prayer forms that involve repetition, such as use of the Rosary or one of various chaplets, are similar to, but not \\"japa\\", because the aim is different. Mental methods of repeated short prayers, very similar to japa are also used in Christian traditions, most notably the practice of repeating the Jesus Prayer found in the Eastern Orthodox Church.Doug Oman & Joseph D.

The Jesus prayer: Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy upon me] (3rd ed.) London: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. The practice of dhikr by Sufis is similar to japa. The two main Sikh scriptures open with sections, named after the term, and these are called Japji Sahib and Jaap Sahib.HS Singha (2009), The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Hemkunt Press, , page 110 Aims The stated aim, or goal of japa may vary greatly depending on the mantra involved and the religious philosophy of the practitioner. In both Buddhist and Hindu traditions mantras may be given to aspirants by their guru, after some form of initiation. The stated goal could be moksha, nirvana, bhakti, or simple personal communion with a divine power in a similar way to prayer. Many gurus and other spiritual teachers, and other religious leaders, especially Hindu and Buddhist, teach that these represent different names for the same transformed state of consciousness. However, this claim is not made about mantras that are not intended for spiritual growth and self-realization.For example, when used for magical or occult purposes. After long use of a mantra that is intended to foster self-realization or intimacy with a divine power, an individual may reach a state of ajapajapam. In ajapajapam, the mantra \\"repeats itself\\" in the mind. Similar states have been reached by adherents to other major faith traditions, using prayers from their own traditions.

Life Born into slavery in Fauquier County, Virginia, Newby married a woman also enslaved. Newby's father was Henry Newby, a landowner in Fauquier County. His mother was Elsey Newby, who was a slave, owned not by Henry, but by a neighbor, John Fox. Elsey and Henry lived together for many years and had several children, although interracial marriage was illegal in Virginia. Dangerfield was their first child. Dangerfield Newby, his mother and his siblings were later freed by his father when he moved them across the Ohio River into Bridgeport, Ohio. John Fox, who died in 1859, apparently did not attempt to retrieve Elsey, Dangerfield, or any of his siblings. Dangerfield's wife and their seven children remained in bondage.http://www.harpersferrywv.net/ghost_stories_of_harpers_ferry__.htm#Dangerfield Newby A letter found on his body revealed some of his motivation for joining John Brown and the raid on Harpers Ferry. Dangerfield Newby's wife, Harriet Newby, was the slave of Jesse Jennings, of Arlington or Warrenton, Virginia. She and her children were sold to Louisiana after the raid. Newby had been unable to purchase the freedom of his wife and seven children. Their master raised the price after Newby had saved the $1,500 that had previously been agreed on. Because all of Newby's other efforts had failed he hoped to free them by force. Harriet's poignant letters, found on his body, proved instrumental in advancing the abolitionist cause. On 17 October 1859, the citizens of Harpers Ferry set to put down the raid. Harpers Ferry manufactured guns but the citizens had little ammunition, so during the assault on the raiders they fired anything they could fit into a gun barrel. One man was shooting six inch spikes from his rifle, one of which struck Newby in the throat, killing him instantly. After the raid, the people of Harpers Ferry took his body, stabbed it repeatedly, and amputated his limbs. His body was left in an alley to be eaten by hogs. In 1899 the remains of Newby and nine other raiders were reburied in a common grave near the body of John Brown in North Elba, New York. Letter from Harriet Newby The following letter was found on Dangerfield Newby's body after the failed Harpers Ferry raid: : > BRENTVILLE, August 16, 1859. > Dear Husband. > I want you to buy me as soon as possible for if you do not get me somebody > else will. The servants are very disagreeable. They do all that they can to > set my mistress against me. Dear Husband you are not the trouble I see these > last two years.

He has published about 30 books in all, including poems, novels and biography. Among his earliest novels are Pavane and Bingo ‚Äì a virtue of Essentials. His novel Oda!, which is based on the life of Oda Krohg is regarded as a reference work on the bohemian scene in Kristiania (Oslo before 1924), and sits alongside his biography of Hans J√¶ger. A translation of his biographical work The story of Edvard Munch was published in English to coincide with a Munch retrospective exhibition. Among his other literary works are the critically acclaimed Villa Europa and the Victor-Alveberg trilogy, which consists of the novels Drift, Dream of the Sea and Road to Dhaka .

It is usually centered on Lake Baikal.‚ÄúThe Siberian High and Climate Change over Middle to High-Latitude Asia‚Äù It reaches its greatest size and strength in the winter when the air temperature near the center of the high-pressure area is often lower than . The atmospheric pressure is often above . The Siberian High is the strongest semi-permanent high in the northern hemisphere and is responsible for both the lowest temperature in the Northern Hemisphere, of on 15 January 1885 at Verkhoyansk, and the highest pressure, 1083.8 mbar (108.38 kPa, 32.01 inHg) at Agata, Krasnoyarsk Krai on 31 December 1968, ever recorded.Encyclopedia of world climatology by John E. Oliver, 2005, The Siberian High is responsible both for severe winter cold and attendant dry conditions with little snow and few or no glaciers across Siberia, Mongolia, and China. During the summer, the Siberian High is largely replaced by the Asiatic low. Overview The plot of mean sea level pressure over the winter months shows a large area of high atmospheric pressure in the South of Siberia. The Siberian High affects the weather patterns in most parts of the Northern Hemisphere: its influence extends as far west as Italy, bringing freezing conditions also in the warm Southhttps://www.thelocal.it/20180221/buran-wind-from-siberia-winter-italy, and as far southeast as Malaysia,Chang Chih-peh, The East Asian Monsoon; p. 55. where it is a critical component of the northeast monsoon. Occasionally a strong Siberian High can bring unusually cold weather into the tropics as far southeast as the Philippines.\\"Record Chill Spreads Deep into Southeast Asia\\" It may block or reduce the size of low-pressure cells and generate dry weather across much of the Asian landscape with the exception of regions such as Hokuriku and the Caspian Sea coast of Iran that receive orographic rainfall from the winds it generates. As a result of the Siberian High, coastal winters in the main city of Pacific Russia Vladivostok are very cold in relation to its latitude and proximity to the ocean. Siberian air is generally colder than Arctic air, because unlike Arctic air which forms over the sea ice around the North Pole, Siberian air forms over the cold tundra of Siberia, which does not radiate heat the same way the ice of the Arctic does.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/542609/Siberian-anticyclone Genesis and variability In general, the Siberian High-pressure system begins to build up at the end of August, reaches its peak in the winter, and remains strong until the end of April. Its genesis at the end of the Arctic summer is caused by the convergence of summer air flows being cooled over interior northeast Asia as days shorten. In the process of the Siberian High's formation, the upper-level jet is transferred across northern Eurasia by adiabatic cooling and descending advection, which in extreme cases creates \\"cold domes\\" that outbreak over warmer parts of East Asia. In spite of its immense influence on the weather experienced by a large proportion of the world's population, scientific studies of the Siberian High have been late in coming, though variability of its behavior was observed as early as the 1960s. However, recent studies of observed global warming over Asia have shown that weakening of the Siberian High is a prime driver of warmer winters in almost all of inland extra-tropical Asia and even over most parts of Europe, with the strongest relationship over the West Siberian Plain and significant relationships as far west as Hungary and as far southeast as Guangdong. Precipitation has also been found to be similarly inversely related to the mean central pressure of the Siberian High over almost all of Eastern Europe during the boreal winter, and similar relationships are found in southern China, whilst the opposite correlation exists over the Coromandel Coast and Sri Lanka. Other studies have suggested that the strength of the Siberian High shows an inverse correlation with the high-pressure systems over North Africa. Another correlation has been noted, a connection of a weaker Siberian High and Arctic oscillation when the Antarctic oscillation (AAO) is stronger.

The film stars Ernie Reyes Jr., Rob Schneider, Nicolas Cowan and Leslie Nielsen. Surf Ninjas follows two teenage surfers from Los Angeles who discover that they are crown princes of the Asian kingdom Patusan and reluctantly follow their destinies to dethrone an evil colonel that rules over the kingdom. Surf Ninjas was filmed in Los Angeles, Hawaii and Thailand. A video game was also developed and released in conjunction with the film. Surf Ninjas was released in the United States on August 20, 1993. The film was released on VHS in December 1993 and re-released on DVD in September 2002. Plot Johnny and Adam are teenage surfers who live in Los Angeles with their father, Mac. Two weeks before Johnny's 16th birthday, ninjas attack the teenagers, but they are defeated by Zatch, a mysterious warrior with an eye patch. A follow-up attack results in Mac's kidnapping, though Zatch is able to protect the teenagers and their friend Iggy from the ninjas. Adam discovers that the video game on his Sega Game Gear matches the events happening around him and finds he can control some events through his Sega. Zatch reveals to Johnny and Adam that they are actually the sons of the king of Patusan, whose land and monarchy was overthrown by the evil Colonel Chi when the boys were young. It is their destiny to return to Patusan, overthrow Colonel Chi, and free the people. Zatch takes them to the Patusani district of \\"Little Patusan\\" in Los Angeles, where Johnny is introduced to a Patusani princess, Ro-May, who has been betrothed to Johnny since they were infants. Ninjas again attack, but Johnny's abilities as a warrior prince emerge and he defeats several of his foes. Johnny, Adam, Iggy, Zatch, and Ro-May decide to return to Patusan. They are followed by a Los Angeles detective, Lieutenant Spence, who had been investigating the ninja attacks. They reach Patusan and discover what Colonel Chi's rule has wrought, including a burned village and a chain gang of political prisoners. The guards spot them and they are forced to fight. Johnny and Adam defeat them and free the villagers from their captivity. Zatch leads the crew to a hidden cave in which the ancient weapons of the Patusani monarchy are preserved. Zatch arms Johnny and attacks him to prepare him for future challenges. Johnny is beaten repeatedly, but he is finally able to disarm Zatch. Rallying the villagers, they travel to the coast, opposite from an island that houses the royal city and Colonel Chi's dungeon. Unable to go by boat due to an impassable reef, Johnny and Adam tell the Patusanis to make surfboards. They then paddle to the unguarded side of the island. Landing on the island, Johnny and Zatch lead the attack on the royal city, taking down Chi's henchmen and freeing Mac. During the battle, Zatch is revealed to be the boys' paternal uncle. Johnny confronts Colonel Chi, successfully defeating him by knocking him into a body of water with the help of Adam and his Game Gear. With Chi's rule undone, peace is restored to Patusan. Johnny is seated as the heralded warrior prince with Ro- May as his princess and Adam as a prince. Johnny declares the monarchy to be dissolved and announces that Patusan will operate as a democracy. His reason for doing this is for the people to finally be free of rule, good or evil.

Filming locations included Thailand and Hawaii. The second half of the film was shot first, and the crew moved to Los Angeles to film the first half. New Line Cinema and Sega of America established a financial relationship in which a Sega Game Gear video game (Us and Pal versions) would be developed for the film. Game designers began developing the video game Surf Ninjas when the film was only in its scripting phase, receiving creative input from director Neal Israel. In turn, Sega partially financed the film. Screenwriter Dan Gordon said that he wrote action sequences that would both suit the film and serve as a springboard for the video game. In the film, one of the lead characters is shown playing the Surf Ninjas video game on a Sega Game Gear. The video game was released in August, before the film's release, and it was considered the first movie-based video game to precede the film itself. Surf Ninjas video games were also released for the Amiga 1200 computer and related CD32 console in 1994 by Flair Software/MicroValue. Release The studio New Line Cinema released Surf Ninjas two weeks earlier than its commercial release date in Evansville, Indiana and Lubbock, Texas as part of a test of regional markets. The early release marked the first time that a major film was released in Evansville before its national opening without any local ties. The president of theatrical marketing at New Line, Chris Pula, selected Evansville for its family-oriented audiences. Pula explained: \\"Evansville is traditionally a strong family market. Also, we have a strong relationship with the exhibitors in that area\\". The president said that the studio was testing the film in a larger market than usual due to its uncertainty about the film's reception, and that the studio would measure its marketing success with ticket receipts. Surf Ninjas was widely released in 1,321 theaters in the United States on August 20, 1993. Over its opening weekend, the film grossed , placing 13th in box office rankings ahead of Manhattan Murder Mystery. Surf Ninjas ultimately grossed in the United States. The film was released on VHS on December 29, 1993. It was subsequently released on DVD on September 3, 2002. Critical response Janet Maslin of The New York Times called most of Surf Ninjas \\"only mindlessly watchable\\" and called the film \\"another of Hollywood's efforts to prove that the American mall mentality is at home in any corner of the globe\\". Maslin also found the film to lack in actual surfing content. Lynn Voedisch of the Chicago Sun-Times described Surf Ninjas as \\"a marriage of pop icons that simply was fated to be\\", citing children's love for ninjas, especially the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and for the surf culture. Voedisch considered Rob Schneider's presence as comic relief unfunny, believing that Leslie Nielsen should have received more screen time as the dictator. Calvin Wilson of The Kansas City Star called the film \\"a disgrace... even by Hollywood standards\\", seeing it as a mess of child lead roles, unfunny cameo roles by Schneider and Nielsen, martial arts action, and lame jokes. Wilson considered the story \\"stale and uninspired\\" that involved \\"people we don't care about doing things we can't believe\\". Stephen Hunter of The Baltimore Sun thought the film's lead, Ernie Reyes, Jr., was too old (20) and too muscular to be received believably as a 15-year-old. Hunter otherwise found the Reyes to impress with their fighting skills, though the film's martial arts sequences were \\"bloodless and absurd\\". Hunter also criticized the director for depriving the film of personality, with its lack of danger, seriousness, or spontaneity. Richard Harrington of The Washington Post found the film to be \\"a harmless summer's entertainment\\" for young people who enjoyed the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films and 3 Ninjas. Harrington enjoyed Reyes, Jr. as the protagonist but found Nielsen to be disappointing. Paul Sherman of the Boston Herald thought that Surf Ninjas was \\"little more than a succession of dudespeak, surfing, skateboarding, video games, generic rock soundtrack and strained knucklehead humor\\". Sherman admired the story arc in which the protagonists learn to accept their destinies, but he thought that \\"the manufactured thrills along the way get obnoxious\\". Sherman thought that the film would only appeal to children under 12 years old, though the film's locations in Thailand in the second half added an exotic atmosphere. Desmond Ryan of The Philadelphia Inquirer thought that Leslie Nielsen was deceptively portrayed in a major role similar to that of Lieutenant Frank Drebin from The Naked Gun films, instead having merely \\"a running and unfunny gag about his malfunctioning answering machine and generally wasted otherwise\\". Ryan also found the film's dialogue to be \\"painful\\" and considered Surf Ninjas to be \\"beyond airheaded\\". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle considered the story of Surf Ninjas to be \\"harmless and painfully dull\\". LaSalle thought that the pacing of the film was too long with only \\"two smirks over the course of 90 minutes\\". Sean Piccoli of The Washington Times thought that the film's \\"dull stretch\\" was buoyed by the presence of Rob Schneider. Piccoli compared the martial arts choreography in the film to the \\"cartoon fantasies that little boys re-enact on neighbors' lawns: the good guys, alone and outnumbered by the charging horde, air-punch their way to glory\\". Ron Weiskind of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette perceived Reyes, Jr. as \\"a likable presence on screen\\" and Schneider to be occasionally humorous in his series of gaffes. Weiskind thought that even with the abundance of martial arts in the film, the scenes were generally too lifeless. Joe Holleman of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch thought that Surf Ninjas pushed \\"the right buttons to guarantee adolescent enjoyment\\". Holleman acknowledged that the film was \\"not exactly a milestone in cinematic achievement\\", but he applauded the acrobatic choreography and the delivery of Schneider's throwaway lines in \\"the movie's funniest moments\\". Sean P. Means of The Salt Lake Tribune described the film as a Toys \\"R\\" Us version of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, with \\"the cartoonish martial- arts sequences [owing] their entire existence to the villains' stupidity\\". Means thought that the film was ultimately \\"as silly as it is forgettable\\".

In Ancient Roman warfare, the testudo or tortoise formation was a type of shield wall formation commonly used by the Roman Legions during battles, particularly sieges.  Formation  In the testudo formation, the men would align their shields to form a packed formation covered with shields on the front and top. The first row of men, possibly excluding the men on the flanks, would hold their shields from about the height of their shins to their eyes, so as to cover the formation's front. The shields would be held in such a way that they presented a shield wall to all sides. The men in the back ranks would place their shields over their heads to protect the formation from above, balancing the shields on their helmets, overlapping them. If necessary, the legionaries on the sides and rear of the formation could stand sideways or backwards with shields held as the front rows, so as to protect the formation's sides and rear; this reduced the speed and mobility of the formation, but offered consistent defensive strength against opposing infantry and excellent protection against arrows and other missile attacks. Plutarch describes this formation as used by Mark Antony during his invasion of Parthia in 36 BC: Cassius Dio writes about the testudo when describing the campaign of Mark Antony in 36 BC: Tactical analysis The testudo was used to protect soldiers from all types of missiles. It could be formed by immobile troops and troops on the march. The primary drawback to the formation was that, because of its density, the men found it more difficult to fight in hand-to-hand combat and because the men were required to move in unison, speed was sacrificed. As \\"phoulkon\\", it played a great role in the tactics employed by the Byzantines against their eastern enemies. The testudo was not invincible, as Cassius Dio also gives an account of a Roman shield array being defeated by Parthian cataphracts and horse archers at the Battle of Carrhae: Tacitus recorded its use during the siege of the city of Cremona by the troops of Vespasian under command of Marcus Antonius Primus. During the attack the troops advanced under the rampart ‚Äúholding their shields above their heads in close ‚Äòtortoise‚Äô formation‚Äù. Tacitus, Histories. Book III. The Fate of Cremona Later usage The testudo was a common formation in the Middle Ages, being used by the Carolingian Frankish soldiers of Louis the Pious to advance on the walls of Barcelona during the siege of 800‚Äì801, by Vikings during the Siege of Paris in 885‚Äì886, by East Frankish soldiers under king Arnulf of Carinthia during the siege of Bergamo in 894, by Lotharingians under Conrad the Red at the siege of Senlis in 949, by Lotharingian defenders at the siege of Verdun in 984 and by the Crusaders of count Raymond IV of Toulouse during the Siege of Nicaea in 1097. The testudo formation was also employed by medieval Arabs, who called it the dabbƒÅba or \\"crawler\\". It was employed by Abu Abdallah al- Shi'i in the 906 siege of Tobna (in modern-day Algeria), where he used it to protect sappers as they advanced to the city walls, where they undermined and collapsed a tower, creating a breach for their allies to enter the city. During the Euromaidan protests in Kiev, Ukraine in 2014 the Berkut riot police used the testudo tactic to protect themselves. Israeli forces and American George Floyd protesters have been known to use the formation.

It was founded in 1999. The group's beliefs are described fully in The Hacktivismo Declaration, which seeks to apply the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to the Internet. Oxblood Ruffin, the director of Hacktivismo, has argued forcefully against definitions of hacktivism that include web defacements or denial-of-service attacks. Hacktivismo has also authored its own software license agreement, the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement (HESSLA). The HESSLA prohibits use or modification that would violate human rights or introduce features that spy on the user.  Connection to cDc  In 1999 CULT OF THE DEAD COW (cDc), a loose network of individuals, announced the formation of Hacktivismo. The group set to explore ways of preventing censorship of the Internet. In particular Hacktivismo focused on firewalls or censoring mechanisms of national governments. Press releases made it clear that cDc and Hacktivismo were different groups; however Hacktivismo was also described as \\"special operations group\\" of cDc. A press release in early 2002 described Hacktivismo as \\"an international cadre of hackers founded by the cDc's Oxblood Ruffin\\".  The Hacktivismo Declaration  The group's beliefs are described fully in the \\"Hacktivismo Declaration\\" which is a list of \\"assertions of liberty in support of an uncensored internet\\" and seeks to apply the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to the Internet. The Declaration recalls the duty of member states to the ICCPR to protect the right to freedom of expression with regards to the internet and in this context what is called the \\"freedom of information\\". The Hacktivismo Declaration states: *\\"...such member states continue to willfully suppress wide-ranging access to lawfully published information on the Internet, despite the clear language of the ICCPR that freedom of expression exists in all media,\\" *\\"...that transnational corporations continue to sell information technologies to the world's most repressive regimes knowing full well that they will be used to track and control an already harried citizenry,\\" *\\"...that the Internet is fast becoming a method of repression rather than an instrument of liberation,\\" *\\"...that in some countries it is a crime to demand the right to access lawfully published information, and of other basic human rights,\\" *\\"...that denying access to information could lead to spiritual, intellectual, and economic decline, the promotion of xenophobia and destabilization of international order.\\" The Hacktivismo Declaration recognizes \\"the importance to fight against human rights abuses with respect to reasonable access to information on the Internet\\" and calls upon the hacker community to \\"study ways and means of circumventing state sponsored censorship of the internet\\" and \\"implement technologies to challenge information rights violations\\". The Hacktivismo Declaration does however recognize that the right to freedom of expression is subject to limitations, stating \\"we recognized the right of governments to forbid the publication of properly categorized state secrets, child pornography, and matters related to personal privacy and privilege, among other accepted restrictions.\\" However, the Hacktivismo Declaration states \\"but we oppose the use of state power to control access to the works of critics, intellectuals, artists, or religious figures.\\" Projects Hacktivismo logo =Camera/Shy= Camera/Shy was the first Hacktivismo project released.

As a form, routine or set, Tantui can be found in many Northern styles of Chinese martial arts. Its prevalence being so widespread, a common saying among Chinese martial artists has evolved: If your T√°n Tu«ê is good, your kung fu will be good. The term 'T√°n Tu«ê' itself has been translated into English a variety of ways, with the most prevalent equating to \\"Springing Leg.\\" Others are Pond Leg, Tam's (as in surname - used to represent name of a family style of Chinese Martial Arts) Kicks, Pond Kicks and others. The name has been translated several different ways, with the most prevalent being that of 'springing leg'. The term is made up of two Chinese words or characters. Everyone tends to agree on the second word or character: ËÖø. In standard Mandarin Chinese, this is represented by the Pinyin romanization as Tu«ê, and literally means leg, thigh, shank, etc.; a Google Image search for the Chinese character will reveal many images of legs, etc. However, in the world of martial arts, this has generally been accepted to mean 'kick,' or more specifically, a type of front snap kick. The first Chinese character or word that makes up the term, however, is the one that tends to bring some confusion. The exact reasoning for the variations is unknown, however may be tied-in with the varying accounts of the form and / or style's origins and history. T√°n Tu«ê is deeply rooted in China's Hui ethnic group of people.http://zhaochangjun.net/en/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=17&Itemid;=22 Where Wushu Went Wrong Understanding T√°n Tu«ê as a Form Little is known of T√°n Tu«ê as a complete style, however the routine bearing this name is wildly popular in various Northern styles. The two most common versions are known as 10 and 12 'road' T√°n Tu«ê. The word \\"road\\" is used to refer to a piece of the form - a group of movements strung together - such that, road one will have its set of movements (perhaps executed once, but often done three times) going in one direction, road two will have its movements going in the opposite direction and, road three going back in the other direction and so on... It continues this way through road 10 or 12. There are other varieties of this form as well, 14, 20, 24, paired or \\"two-man\\" T√°n Tu«ê, etc. Styles that have incorporated a version of T√°n Tu«ê into their curriculum usually use it as a beginner form or training form, however due to its large number of movements, could be used for intense study for many years, regardless of version.

Plot summary Ship of Magic is the first book of the Liveship Traders series and follows the fortunes of the Vestrit family. A liveship is a ship made of Wizardwood, a mystical substance, giving it magical properties. When three generations of a ship's owners die on board, a liveship \\"quickens\\", meaning that the ship awakens and becomes a sentient being with all the memories of the ancestors who have contributed to the ship's quickening. Captain Vestrit's grandmother had ordered the liveship Vivacia, and the Vestrit family is still in debt to the Rain Wild Trader family from whom they bought the Wizardwood even before the ship was quickened. Only a liveship is capable of crossing the perilous Rain Wild River to trade with the Rain Wilders, who have valuable goods plundered from an Ancient Elderling ruin. The Vestrits live in Bingtown, which borders the sea, Jamaillia, Chalced, and the Rain Wilds. Their charter comes from Jamaillia; however, the current leader of Jamaillia has ignored the promises his ancestors made with Bingtown, which causes outrage among Bingtown's citizens. Chalced's influence and customs are spreading throughout the world, because of its profitable slave trade. The story begins when Ephron Vestrit dies on Vivacia and quickens it. His daughter, Althea, who had assumed that the ship would come to her after her father's death, is shocked to see that her father has given the ship to her sister, Keffria, who in turn had given ownership to Kyle, her Chalcedean husband. Kyle believes that he can restore the family fortune by entering the slave trade. Kyle said that Althea would never sail the Vivacia until she proves her seamanship by showing him a ship's ticket. Althea sets off to prove she is a capable sailor. However, Kyle discovers that he is unable to control the ship without a blood relative of the Vestrits on board. Without Althea, the only alternative is to force his son Wintrow, who wants to be a priest, to serve aboard the ship. Wintrow finds it hard to adjust to life on the ship. Despite his bitterness at being torn from the priesthood, he has a growing bond with the ship that he can't ignore. At the same time as all of these events, the ambitious pirate Kennit desires to become more than a pirate: he wishes to unite all pirate townships under him as king. Kennit pursues slaver ships to free the slaves while throwing the slavers overboard. A crafty man with a gift for foresight, Kennit realizes that if he frees the slaves, he'll gain the allegiance of their family and friends. The freed slaves then crew the captured vessels as a pirate fleet under Kennit's command. However, Kennit desires to have a liveship of his own for his flagship. He targets the Vivacia, who has become a slaver ship under Kyle's persuasion. Kennit manages to capture the Vivacia and becomes her captain. To get the proof of her seaworthiness that Kyle requires, Althea works on board a slaughtership, disguised as a man. She discovers that Brashen Trell, a former mate on the Vivacia, and a disgraced younger son of another prominent Bingtown family, is also serving on the ship. Unfortunately, Althea is denied a ship's ticket when the captain of the slaughteship discovers her true name. Althea and Brashen separate after a romantic dispute. Brashen takes a position on a pirate's trader ship. Althea joins the crew of the liveship Ophelia, owned by the Tenira family, headed back to Bingtown which then leads to the next installment of the Liveship Trader series, The Mad Ship. Reception Ship of Magic has generally received positive reviews. Reviewers praised the novel‚Äôs complex characters and plotlines.

In the census of 2011, a total of 64,476 people declared themselves to be Protestants of different denominations, up from 42,308 in the previous census in 2001 and from 21,878 in 1992. The marked rise in the number of Protestants in the last two decades is partly due to a boom in conversions among the Bulgarian Roma. In 2001, the two largest ethnic group among the Bulgarian Protestants were the Bulgarians and the Romani with some 25,000 members each. Protestantism was introduced in Bulgaria by missionaries from the United States in 1857-58, amid the National Revival period. The two main denominations, the Methodists and Congregationalists, divided their areas of influence. The former predominated in northern Bulgaria and the latter in the south. In 1875, the Protestant denominations united in the Bulgarian Evangelical Philanthropic Society, which later became the Union of Evangelical Churches in Bulgaria. Besides setting up churches, the Protestants established schools, clinics, and youth clubs, and they distributed copies of the Bible and their own religious publications in Bulgarian. The Union of Evangelical Churches produced a translation of the entire Bible into contemporary Bulgarian in 1871 and founded the nondenominational Robert College in Constantinople, where many Bulgarian leaders of the post-independence era were educated. After independence in 1878, the Protestants gained influence because they used the vernacular in services and in religious literature. The 1871 translation of the Bible was based on the work of ABCFM missionary Elias Riggs, Methodist-Episcopalian missionary Albert Long, and Bulgarian intellectuals P.R. Slaveikov and Hristodul Sichan-Nikolov. Translation was not sponsored by the Bulgarian Evangelical Union, but by the British and Foreign Bible Society. During communist rule, Protestants were subjected to even greater persecution than the Catholics. In 1946 church funding was cut off by a law curbing foreign currency transactions. Because many ministers had been educated in the West before World War II, they were suspected automatically of supporting the opposition parties. In 1949 thirty-one Protestant clergymen were charged with working for American intelligence and running a spy ring in Bulgaria. All church property was confiscated, and the churches' legal status was revoked. Most of the mainstream Protestant denominations maintained the right to worship nominally guaranteed by the constitution of 1947. Like the practitioners of the other faiths, Protestants in Bulgaria enjoyed greater religious freedom after the fall of the communist leadership in 1989. Due to the work of new, mostly U.S. missionaries, the number of the Protestants in the country almost doubled by 2001 and is soon to overtake the number of the Roman Catholics in the country. According to estimates in 1991, the 5,000 to 6,000 Bulgarian Pentecostals made that denomination the largest Protestant group. The Pentecostal movement was brought to Bulgaria in 1920 by Russian emigrants to the United States. The movement later spread to Burgas, Yambol, Sliven, Plovdiv and Varna. It gained popularity in Bulgaria after freedom of religion was declared in 1944, and the fall of Zhivkov brought another surge of interest. In 1991 the Pentecostal Church had thirty-six clergy in forty- three parishes, with sufficient concentration in Ruse to petition the government to establish a Bible institute there. The Union of Evangelical Congregational Churches in Bulgaria is a Congregational church established by American missionaries in the late 19th century. In 2006 the Advent Christian Church had 7,637 Bulgarian members . The Adventist movement began in the Dobruja region of Bulgaria at the turn of the century and then spread to Tutrakan, Ruse, Sofia, and Plovdiv. It gained momentum in Bulgaria after 1944. During communism, mainstream Adventists maintained the right to worship. Some twenty parishes with forty pastors remained active through that era, although a breakaway reformed group was banned because of its pacifist beliefs. Some Adventists were imprisoned for refusal of military service.

F. X. Van Dusen, Ph.D., LL.D., F.R.S., M.D., M.D.S. is a fictional character in a series of detective short stories and two novels by Jacques Futrelle. Some of the short stories were originally published in The Saturday Evening Post and the Boston American. Plot In the stories, Professor Van Dusen solves a variety of different mysteries with his friend and companion, Hutchinson Hatch, reporter of a fictional newspaper called The Daily New Yorker. The professor is known as \\"The Thinking Machine\\", solving problems by the remorseless application of logic. This nickname was given to him after his winning of a match against the fictional chess champion of the day, Tschaikowsky, in a demonstration to show the power of applying pure logic. He was able to win against the reigning champion having only been taught the game the morning of the match. Many of his titles are actually honorary degrees awarded to him serving only to amuse the universities and scientific institutions that crown him with those titles. His catchphrases include, \\"Two and two always equal four,\\" \\"Nothing is impossible\\" and \\"All things that start must go somewhere.\\" Futrelle died at age 37 on April 15, 1912, on the RMS Titanic. He refused to board a lifeboat, insisting that his wife board instead. Novels # The Chase of the Golden Plate (1906) Short stories # The Problem of Dressing Room A.

Of the cake type of galette, one notable variety is the galette des Rois (King cake) eaten on the day of Epiphany. In French Canada the term galette is usually applied to pastries best described as large cookies. Fruit galette Cherry galette A common form of galette resembles a type of single crust, free-form pie with a fruit filling and the crust folded partway over the top of the filling. See several such recipes in Deborah Madison, Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone. The website joyofbaking.com defines the term galette as \\"a French term signifying a flat round cake that can be either sweet or savory and while [recipes can use] puff pastry as a base, they can also be made from yeast risen doughs like brioche, or with a sweet pastry crust.\\" Peach, blueberry, and alpine strawberry galette The fruits used in these types of galettes are typical seasonable and can include one or more of apples; berries such as strawberries or blueberries; or stone fruits such as peaches, plums, nectarines, or cherries. Various spices, zests, or peppers can be added in the preparation process if desired. The pastry base is often homemade but can also be commercially purchased. Bon App√©tit magazine has written of such galettes, \\"They're casually impressive and photogenic, but in that 'Oh, I just threw this together' way. They're rustic and inviting; come as you are. ... Their imperfections are what set them apart‚Äîin fact, the less you do, the better they look.\\" Breton galette Galette, which is more properly called Breton galette, is also the name given in most French cr√™peries to savoury buckwheat flour pancakes, while those made from wheat flour, much smaller in size and mostly served with a sweet filling, are branded cr√™pes. This type of galette is a large, thin pancake mostly associated with the region of Brittany, where it replaced at times bread as basic food, but it is eaten countrywide. Buckwheat was introduced as a crop suitable to impoverished soils and buckwheat pancakes were known in other regions where this crop was cultivated, such as Limousin or Auvergne. It is frequently garnished with egg, meat, fish, cheese, cut vegetables, apple slices, berries, or similar ingredients. One of the most popular varieties is a galette covered with grated Emmental cheese, a slice of ham, and an egg cooked on the galette. In France this is known as a galette compl√®te (a complete galette). Another variety is a hot sausage wrapped in a galette (called galette saucisse, a tradition of Rennes, Brittany) and eaten like a hot dog.

The Magnate Wars (1593‚Äì1617)  =Causes= Chancellor Jan Zamoyski Jan Zamoyski, Polish grand crown chancellor (kanclerz) and military commander (grand crown hetman), known for his opposition towards the Habsburgs, had been a vocal supporter of Commonwealth expansion in the southern direction. Since the early plans made by Commonwealth King Stefan Batory for the war against the Ottomans, Zamoyski supported them, viewing those plans as a good long-term strategy for the Commonwealth. Any policy that was against the Ottomans was also supported by the Holy See, and Pope Sixtus V strongly expressed his support for any war between the Commonwealth and the Ottomans. Three powerful magnate families from the Commonwealth, the Potockis, Koreckis and Wi≈õniowieckis, were related to the Moldavian Hospodar (Prince or Voivode) Ieremia MovilƒÉ (Jeremi Mohy≈Ça), and, after his death in 1606, they supported his descendants. The Commonwealth at its greatest extent (ca. 1630). Around the end of the 16th century, the relations between the Commonwealth and the Ottomans, never too cordial, further worsened with the growing number of independent actions by Cossacks. From the second part of the 16th century, Cossacks started raiding the territories under Ottoman rule. The Commonwealth could not control the fiercely independent Cossacks, but was held responsible for them, since at that time they were nominally under the Commonwealth rule. At the same time, Tatars living under the Ottoman rule were raiding the Commonwealth. However, they attacked mostly in the south-eastern areas of the Commonwealth, which were fairly sparsely inhabited, while the Cossacks were raiding the heart of Ottoman Empire, wealthy merchant port cities just two days away from the mouth of the Dniepr river (which the Cossacks used as their main transportation route). By 1615, Cossacks had even burned the townships on the outskirts of Constantinople. Consecutive treaties between the Ottoman Empire and the Commonwealth called both parties to curb Cossack and Tatar activities, but they were never implemented on either side of the border. In internal agreements, pushed forward by the Polish side, the Cossacks agreed to burn their boats and stop their raiding. However, Cossack boats could be built quickly, and the Cossack lifestyle required periodic hunts for glory and booty. Sometimes Cossacks just needed resources to ensure their subsistence, while on other occasions they were bribed by the Habsburgs to help ease Ottoman pressure on their borders. Also, there was widespread animosity between Cossacks and Tatars, after decades of border clashes and reciprocal looting of estates and villages. Cossacks raided Ottomans territories and their vassals near the Black Sea almost yearly, usually attracting retaliatory Tatar raids (and vice versa). The vicious circle of chaos and retaliations often turned the entire south-eastern Commonwealth border into a low-level warzone. =1593‚Äì1595= In 1593, war between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburgs started. In 1594 a very strong Tatar raid, carried by about 20,000-30,000 men led by the Khan of Crimea, ƒûazƒ± II Giray (Gazi Gerej II) plundered Pokucie and moved to Hungary through mountain passes, in order to plunder Habsburg lands. Commonwealth troops gathered too late to intercept it. The Prince of Transylvania, Sigismund B√°thory (Zsigmond B√°thory), nephew of former Polish king Stefan Batory (Istv√°n B√°thory), had strengthened Habsburg influence in Moldavia after setting »òtefan RƒÉzvan (Stefan Rozwan) on the Moldavian throne. »òtefan RƒÉzvan was a Roma from Walachia (his father had been an Ottoman Muslim Roma, therefore not a slave) and had married a Moldavian noblewoman (his story was the basis of a play by 19th century Romanian writer and historian Bogdan Petriceicu-Hasdeu). A pro-Polish hospodar was mostly tolerated by the Porte when the Commonwealth was anti-Habsburg or neutral. Therefore, when Emperor Rudolf II's forces gained control of Moldavia, Transylvania () and started supporting Mihai Viteazul (), prince of Wallachia, the Ottomans didn't look too favourably at the Commonwealth's meddling. In 1595 Zamoyski, persuaded by Moldavian refugees, decided to intervene. The Commonwealth forces (numbering ~7,000-8,000 soldiers) under hetman Jan Zamoyski crossed the Dniestr, defeated local opposition (while Transylvanian troops retreated to their own country) and Ottoman reinforcements, and set Ieremia MovilƒÉ on the Moldavian throne as a Commonwealth vassal. This was seen by many as a very dangerous step because the Ottomans were preparing to place their own candidate on the Moldavian throne. Zamoyski contacted grand vizier Sinan Pasha and negotiated with the Ottoman governor on the Black Sea island of Tyahyn (near the Dniepr river) and convinced them of his peaceful intentions and that he did not want to fight with the Ottoman Empire. However, the Khan of Crimea, ƒûazƒ± II Giray, reacted and entered Moldavia with about 20,000 men (but no cannons and few janissaries). Zamoyski fortified his camp near Cecora at Prut river, withstood a three-day siege (17‚Äì20 October), and managed to obtain an agreement with the Ottoman Empire that recognized MovilƒÉ as hospodar (Treaty of Cecora). Moldavia became Commonwealth's vassal and paid tribute to Constantinople at the same time (this is known as condominium - territory under rule of two sovereign powers). Not satisfied with this, previous hospodar »òtefan RƒÉzvan invaded Moldavia, but his troops were crushed by Zamoyski and RƒÉzvan was impaled by MovilƒÉ. =1599‚Äì1601= Mihai Viteazul, Voivode of Wallachia, Transylvania and Moldavia. In 1599, Mihai Viteazul, wishing to secure his back after Sigismund B√°thory's departure from the Transylvanian throne, defeated the new ruler of Transylvania, Andrew Cardinal B√°thory (Andrzej Batory), who lost his life fleeing after battle, and took over Transylvania as governor on behalf of the Habsburg emperor Rudolf II. Later on, Mihai defeated Ieremia MovilƒÉ and took control over almost all of Moldavia, with the exception of Khotyn (Chocim or Hotin, a castle and a city on the right bank of the Dniestr), which remained in Polish hands. Mihai used titles of voivode of Wallachia, Transylvania and Moldavia for the first time in May 1600. He tried to get recognition from Emperor Rudolf II, offered his vassalage to the Commonwealth and organized an anti-Turkish league. After King Sigismund III Vasa (Zygmunt III Waza) refused, Mihai sent his troops to take over Pokucie (as an area Moldavians were claiming to be theirs) but Commonwealth hetman Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski met them with resistance. The three Principalities and the territories united under Mihai's authority for four months. In 1600 Zamoyski and hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz gathered Commonwealth forces, returning to Moldavia, where they fought Mihai. Zamoyski defeated Mihai Viteazul near Bucov (Bukova) in Wallachia, on the Teleajen river, near present-day Ploie»ôti, restored Ieremia MovilƒÉ to the throne, and helped his brother Simion MovilƒÉ to gain the throne in Bucharest, thus temporarily extending the sphere of Commonwealth influence south all the way to the Danube. In the meantime, Mihai Viteazul traveled to Vienna to ask for the Emperor's help, in exchange for assisting the Habsburgs against the Ottomans and Imperial influence over Moldavia, previously aligned with the Commonwealth. The Emperor promised help and in 1601 sent an army led by Giorgio Basta that was to accompany Mihai on the way back. Upon their arrival in Transylvania, after the joint victory at GurƒÉslƒÉu against the prince of Transylvania, Sigismund B√°thory, general Basta assassinated Mihai Viteazul during the night, on the field of C√¢mpia Turzii (south of Cluj), effectively taking Transylvania under Emperor's lead. Captain John Smith, the famous leader of the colony at Jamestown, Virginia and the Pocahontas story, was serving Sigismund B√°thory as a mercenary. Smith was captured, and sold to Crimean Tatar slave traders. He later escaped to Poland before continuing on to England, from where he sailed to America in 1607. The Commonwealth was unable to capitalize on its gains, as the Polish-Swedish War had just started and the majority of Commonwealth forces were desperately needed to protect Livonia (Inflanty). A year later, Simion MovilƒÉ was ousted from the Wallachian throne by local boyars who replaced him with Radu »òerban, with the consent of the Ottomans (relieved to see the Polish influence at the Danube diminish). The Commonwealth managed to retain control over Moldavia, and the only side not to gain anything was the Habsburgs: in fact, they lost control over all of their former possessions in the region. However, the Peace of ≈Ωitava ended the Habsburg-Ottoman conflict known as the Long War, and forced the Ottomans to recognize the Habsburgs as equals, due to the former's inability to penetrate Royal Hungary. This ended direct war between the Ottomans and the Habsburgs for decades, but the two powers still struggled for influence in the region that constitutes modern-day Romania. =1607‚Äì1613= Hetman Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski. Ieremia MovilƒÉ died in 1606 . In 1607 Stefan Potocki set his brother-in-law (and son of Ieremia), Constantin MovilƒÉ (Konstanty Mohy≈Ça), on the Moldavian throne. However, Stefan Potocki was one of the pro-Habsburg magnates and Gabriel Batory, the anti-Habsburg ruler of Transylvania, removed Constantin MovilƒÉ in 1611 . The Moldavian throne now fell to »òtefan II Tom»ôa (Tom≈ºa). A second intervention by Stefan Potocki (with the tacit assistance from Sigismund III, but against the will of Sejm and Senate) in 1612 was a complete failure. Potocki's 7,000 strong army was defeated on 19 July in the Battle of Sasowy R√≥g (near »òtefƒÉne»ôti) by troops of Tom»ôa and Khan Temir's Tatars of the Budjak Horde. Stefan Potocki and Constantin MovilƒÉ ended their lives in Ottoman captivity in Constantinople. A counter-raid of Tatars and Tom»ôa on the Commonwealth was stopped by ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski without a fight, and an agreement between ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski and Tom»ôa was signed in October 1612 (at Khotyn). Tom»ôa assured about his friendliness, that he will help to patch up conflict between the Ottoman Empire and the Commonwealth and pledged allegiance to the Polish king. In 1613, when Sigismund signed a de facto anti-Turkish defensive treaty with the Habsburgs, counting on their support for his restoration to the Swedish throne, Poland further moved into the enemy camp from the Ottoman point of view. Hetman Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski, with a show of force, induced Moldavians and Turks to compromise and signed an agreement in 1612 with »òtefan Tom»ôa at Khotyn. =1614‚Äì1617= In 1614 Sultan Ahmed I wrote Sigismund III that he was sending Ahmed Pasha to punish ‚Äúthose bandits‚Äù, that this was not meant as a gesture of hostility to the Commonwealth, and that he asked of him not to be a host to fugitives; Ahmed Pasha wrote hetman ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski asking for cooperation. ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski answered that he had already done a lot in order to curb Cossack attacks, and that most of the Cossacks raiding Ottoman lands were not the Zaporozhian Cossacks of the Commonwealth, but rather Don Cossacks (and thus Muscovy subjects). ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski's troops made another demonstration, but Ahmed Pasha did not attempt to cross the border, and settled for building new fortifications in the region of Ochakov (Oczak√≥w, tr:Ozi) in order to prevent future raids. In 1615, Ieremia MovilƒÉ's widow and dukes Micha≈Ç Wi≈õniowiecki and Samuel Korecki organized a third intervention, this time carried against king Sigismund's wishes. Their troops consisted of their own private troops, mercenaries, Cossacks and Moldavians loyal to MovilƒÉ. Tom»ôa was removed and the young Alexandru MovilƒÉ (Aleksander Mohy≈Ça) was set on the throne. But this situation was not to last: in August 1616 Iskender Pasha, beylerbey (bejlerbej) of Bosnia, defeated magnate forces on the very same spot at Sasowy R√≥g, with duke Samuel Korecki and the MovilƒÉ family ending up as prisoners in Constantinople (Wi≈õniowiecki had died prior to imprisoning). Korecki managed to escape captivity, briefly reemerged, but was taken prisoner yet again after the defeat in the battle of Cecora in 1620 and was strangled to death while in custody. Again in 1616, Stefan ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski managed to cool the tensions, displaying Commonwealth military readiness and signing a new agreement with the new hospodar, Radu Mihnea, in Braha. He was promised Moldavian mediation in to patching up conflict between the Ottoman Empire and the Commonwealth. Radu Mihnea pledged allegiance to the Polish king and promised not to allow the Tatars passage through his territory. However, northern and eastern wars with Sweden and Muscovy diverted the attention of the Commonwealth and strained its military might to the limit. In 1617, after yet another wave of Cossack raids, the Sultan sent a powerful force under Iskender Pasha to the Commonwealth borders. The army consisted of janissaries, Tatars and vassal troops form Transylvania, Moldavia and Wallachia (numbering up to 40,000). ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski met them near Busza (on the Jaruga River), but neither side could decide to attack, and letters between leaders had been exchanged since the start of Iskender march. ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski had mostly magnate troops and no Cossacks troops, as the Commonwealth fought war with Muscovy and with newest Swedish aggression on Livonia at the same time, while the Ottomans were at war with Persia. ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski was forced to renounce all Polish claims to Moldavia through the Treaty of Busza (also known as the \\"Treaty of Jaruga\\") signed with Iskender Pasha. The treaty stated that Poland would not meddle in the internal affairs of Ottoman vassals in Transylvania, Moldavia and Wallachia, the Commonwealth was to prevent Cossacks from raiding lands in the Ottoman Empire, while ceding Khotyn. In return, the Turks promised to stop Tatar raids.  Prelude to the next conflict (1618‚Äì1620)  =1618= However, few of the treaty provisions were ever fulfilled. The Tatar raids resumed in 1618 (or perhaps even 1617), as commanders of the Dobruja and Budjak Hordes left Iskender's camp during talks. At first, ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewki could not divide forces and Tatars plundered unopposed, but he met the Iskender Pasha's force near Kamianets-Podilskyi (Kamieniec Podolski). On September 28, 1618, he drove it back while enduring heavy losses. In 1617 and 1619 ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski forced Cossacks to sign a new agreements (\\"umowa olszaniecka\\" and \\"bia≈Ço-cerkiewna\\"). Boats were to be burnt and raids were forbidden. In exchange, the Cossack register was expanded, and the annual subsidy to Cossacks from the Crown was increased. However, Cossack raids did not cease, especially as they were encouraged by Muscovy. In July 1618, after many warnings to the Commonwealth, the young and ambitious sultan Osman II send a letter to king Sigismund III with the threats of a new war and the burning of Krak√≥w. Since the Ottomans were involved in large-scale war with Persia, this was no more than a warning at the time. However, Osman planned for a war against the Commonwealth, in order to compensate for the heavy losses sustained against Persia, where, in the Ottoman‚ÄìPersian Wars of 1603‚Äì1611 and 1617‚Äì1618/1619, the Ottoman Empire lost the Caucasus. Sultan Osman II. In 1618, the Thirty Years' War began. Czech Protestants were supported by German and Hungarian Protestants. The Hungarians asked the then Prince of Transylvania, Gabriel Bethlen, for help and declared their wish to unite Hungary with Transylvania. Bethlen had been appointed to the office after the Sultan's removal of Gabriel B√°thory (ordered to the troops of Iskender Pasha in 1613). He was anti-Polish and a loyal Ottoman vassal and had aspirations to extend his rule to Moravia, Bohemia, and Silesia. Polish hetman Stefan ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski warned Bethlen against joining the Protestant side and promised help against the Ottoman Empire; however, Bethlen answered that it was too late to change allegiances. When the fight was joined by Gabriel Bethlen on the Protestant side, his siege of Vienna threatened to extend Transylvanian rule (and thus Ottoman) to Bohemia and Silesia. =1619‚Äì20= Polish nobles (Szlachta) supported the Czechs (at least verbally) because the struggle of Czech and Hungarian nobles was viewed as a struggle of \\"free\\" nobility against absolutist monarchs. Nobles would not fight the Protestants, and the Sejm had even forbidden Sigismund III to send Polish armed forces as assistance to the Habsburgs. However, the king of Poland, Sigismund, was a devout Roman Catholic and a long time sympathizer of the Habsburgs. Additionally, some of Polish magnates and szlachta hoped to get back some parts of Silesia in exchange for helping out the Habsburgs. During talks with the Sigismund's son, prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Waza, on his voyage to Silesia in mid-1619, Emperor Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor promised to allow a temporary occupation of part of Silesia by the Poles, with the possibility of incorporating those areas into Poland at a later date. Some of the Piast (old Polish dynasty) dukes of Silesia also supported returning their lands to the Polish realm, especially given the attractive religious tolerance policy of the Commonwealth and the fact that the Polish western regions had been very peaceful and secure for a long time. Sigismund III decided to help the Habsburgs and privately hired an infamous mercenary group called the Lisowczycy (name took from their founder Aleksander J√≥zef Lisowski), who were unemployed after the end of the wars with Muscovy (Dymitriads) and were plundering and terrorizing the entire region of Lithuania. Sigismund sent the Lisowczycy to aid the Habsburgs towards the end of 1619. In the end, Ferdinand did not agree to any permanent concessions in Silesia, and only made prince Karol Ferdynand (W≈Çadys≈Çaw's brother) bishop of Wroc≈Çaw. Neither did Habsburgs provide any help against the Ottoman Empire. The Lisowczycy crushed Transylvanian forces led by George I R√°k√≥czihttps://web.archive.org/web/20050308110040/http://www.bartleby.com/65/ra/Rakoczy.html (Jerzy Rakoczy) at Z√°vada, Humenn√© District and Humenn√© (November 13https://web.archive.org/web/20060429131544/http://edu.clk.pl/~pinio/ or 21-24,http://slawek-dabrowski.webpark.pl/lisowczycy.htm sources vary; see Battle of Humenn√©) and started looting, plundering, killing even children and dogs (as a contemporary historian wrote), and burning Eastern Slovakia, thus forcing Bethlen to lift his siege of Vienna and try to save his own lands. Later, the Lisowczycy plagued Silesia and Bohemia and took part in the Battle of White Mountain. The ruler of Moldavia, another vassal of the Ottoman sultan, a hospodar of Italian origin, Gaspar Graziani (Kasper Gratiani in Polish), decided he would be better off under Polish rule and started talks with Polish king, promising to send 25,000 men. The Polish envoy to Constantinople who arrived in April, 1620, was received very coldly. Later Cossack raiding and burning of Constantinople suburbs did not help. The Habsburgs had no qualms about repaying Sigismund's help with treachery. Their envoy actively worked against a new treaty between the Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire because the Habsburgs knew that any Polish-Ottoman conflict meant less trouble for themselves. This intrigue, coupled with Ottomans annoyance with Commonwealth pro-Habsburg actions and constant attempts by some Polish magnates to gain influence in Moldavia, caused a new war to be unavoidable. In Poland, the king and the hetmans exaggerated the danger in order to recruit more troops and raise taxes for the army. However, the nobles did not trust such measures, and could not be convinced to pay raised taxes for the army, speculating about the reasons behind the expedition. The nobles often thwarted the king's initiatives, even if these could prove to be in the interest of the country at large (including their own long-term purpose), becoming suspicious of any raise in the king's power as a potential reduction of their privileges. The status quo, which translated into their high standard of life, was generally favoured over any alternative. Some historians say that king Sigismund decided to intervene in Moldavia because of internal problems caused mainly by the dispatch of Lisowczycy mercenaries to the Habsburg side and their conduct in war. Others point out that some nobles threatened with armed rebellion (rokosz), and, in case of a successful intervention, the king would increase his and the hetman's authority and focus noblemen's attention on external instead of internal problems. Additionally, hetman ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski, foreseeing confrontation with the Ottoman Empire, preferred to meet their troops on foreign soil. In retrospect, this time the nobles were right about the lack of danger since neither Tatars nor Turks were ready in 1620. While the Sultan was indeed planning an expedition to Poland in 1621, this was to be done with a small contingent. However, it can be argued that the continuous policy of neglect for the military would dearly cost the Commonwealth in the coming decades.  Battle of Cecora and its aftermath (1620‚Äì21)  The next phase of the Ottoman-Commonwealth conflict would begin in 1620: the Cossacks' burning of Varna proved the last spark. The new young Ottoman sultan Osman II made peace with Persia and promised to burn the Commonwealth to the ground and \\"water his horses in the Baltic Sea\\". ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski's forces went deep into Moldavia to strike at Ottomans before they were ready, but a large Ottoman force had already invaded Moldavia to remove hospodar Graziani. In early September 1620 the Royal Grand and Field Hetman's Zolkiewski and his protegee, future hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski, assembled 8,000 men and marched south. However, Graziani's contribution comprised just 600 men. At the battle of Cecora (18 September to 6 October 1620), on the river Prut, Zolkiewski met the 22,000 strong army of Iskender Pasha, withstanding repeated attacks during September 1620. On September 29 he ordered a retreat, and for eight difficult days discipline held despite enemy attacks. On approaching the Polish border, order in much of the army melted and the forces disintegrated on the spot. The Ottomans attacked and much of the Commonwealth army was destroyed. Zolkiewski was killed, his head sent to the Sultan as a trophy, while Koniecpolski was captured. The following year, in 1621, an army of 100,000‚Äì160,000 Turkish soldiers led by Sultan Osman II in person advanced from Adrianople towards the Polish frontier, but the disaster of Cecora caused the Commonwealth to mobilise a large army (of about 25,000 Poles and 20,000 Cossacks) in response. Hetman Chodkiewicz crossed the Dniester in September 1621 and entrenched himself in the fortress of Khotyn on the very path of Ottoman advance. It was here that, for a whole month (2 September to 9 October), during the battle of Khotyn, the Commonwealth hetman held the sultan at bay, up until the first autumn snow. The deaths of his men compelled Osman to withdraw. However, the victory was to be dearly ransomed by Poland. A few days before the siege was raised, the aged grand hetman died of exhaustion in the fortress on September 24, 1621. After his death the Polish forces were led by Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski. Chodkiewicz wasn't the only one to die as a result. Sultan Osman himself paid the highest price for the failure of his plans. After the tides turned, the defeat and subsequent retreat of the Ottoman armies, coupled with internal matters, triggered the rebellion of janissaries in 1622, during which Osman II was murdered. An honorable peace (Treaty of Khotyn) was agreed, based on that at Busza, and the Commonwealth-Ottoman border was to be fairly quiet until the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War (1633‚Äì34).

Biography Fagan was born in England where he received his childhood education at Rugby School. He attended Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he studied archaeology and anthropology (BA 1959, MA 1962, PhD 1965). He spent six years as Keeper of Prehistory at the Livingstone Museum in Zambia, Central Africa, and moved to the USA in 1966. He was Visiting Associate Professor of Anthropology at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, in 1966/67, and was appointed Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1967. Fagan is an archaeological generalist, with expertise in the broad issues of human prehistory. He is the author or editor of 46 books, including seven widely used undergraduate college texts. Fagan has contributed over 100 specialist papers to many national and international journals. He is a Contributing Editor to American Archaeology and Discover Archaeology magazines, and formerly wrote a regular column for Archaeology Magazine. He serves on the Editorial Boards of six academic and general periodicals and has many popular magazine credits, including Scientific American and Gentleman's Quarterly. Unlike most scholars at research universities, Fagan chose to regularly teach large introductory archaeology classes to undergraduates at Santa Barbara. Avoiding traditional lecture formats, he experimented with technology to provide basic information as early as the 1970s, leaving his class periods for wide ranging discussions of interest to students. In conjunction with this interest in college teaching, Fagan began writing an extensive series of archaeology textbooks beginning in 1972 that are still in print in recent editions decades after their initial publication. These include In the Beginning (13th edition, 2013, with Nadia Durrani), People of the Earth (15th edition, 2018, with Nadia Durrani), Ancient North America (5th edition, 2019), Ancient Lives (6th edition, 2016), World Prehistory (9th edition, 2016, with Nadia Durrani), Ancient Civilizations (4th edition, 2016, with Chris Scarre), and Archaeology: A Brief Introduction (12th edition, 2016, with Nadia Durrani). Fagan has been an archaeological consultant for many organisations, including National Geographic Society, Time-Life, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, and Microsoft Encarta. He has lectured extensively about archaeology and other subjects throughout the world at many venues, including the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, the National Geographic Society, the San Francisco City Lecture Program, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Getty Conservation Institute. In addition to extensive experience with the development of Public Television programs, Fagan was the developer/writer of Patterns of the Past, an NPR series in 1984‚Äì86. He has worked as a consultant for the BBC, RKO, and many Hollywood production companies on documentaries. In 1995 he was Senior Series Consultant for Time-Life Television's \\"Lost Civilizations\\" series. Fagan was awarded the 1996 Society of Professional Archaeologists' Distinguished Service Award for his \\"untiring efforts to bring archaeology in front of the public.\\" He also received a Presidential Citation Award from the Society for American Archaeology in 1996 for his work in textbook, general writing and media activities. He received the Society's first Public Education Award in 1997. He has written many critiques of contemporary archaeology and has advocated non-traditional approaches, as well as writing extensively on the role of archaeology in contemporary society. His approach is a melding of different theoretical approaches, which focuses on the broad issues of human prehistory and the past. He is a strong advocate of multidisciplinary approaches to such issues as climate change in the past. Over the years, he has written a series of well-known textbooks that provide accurate summaries of the latest advances in archaeological method and theory and world prehistory. These are designed for beginners and avoid both confusing jargon and major theoretical discussion, which is inappropriate at this basic level. His approach melds traditional cultural history with more recent approaches, with a major emphasis on writing historical narrative using archaeological data and sources from other disciplines. Fagan is also well known for his public lectures on a wide variety of archaeological and historical topics, delivered to a broad range of archaeological and non-archaeological audiences. An avid sailor since childhood, Fagan wrote sailing guides to many locations on the Pacific coast of the United States and published them under his own imprint. Now retired from UC Santa Barbara, he lives in the Santa Barbara area with his wife, one of his two daughters, and numerous cats and rabbits.

Biography Moshe Baram was born in Zdolbuniv in the Russian Empire (today in Ukraine) in 1911, attending school in Kovno (now Kaunas in Lithuania). In his youth, he joined the HeHalutz Movement and \\"Freiheit-Dror\\", which was affiliated with the Poale Zion party. In 1931 he made aliyah to Mandate Palestine. After arriving in the country, he worked in the construction industry and joined the Haganah. Political career In 1934 he began working for the Jewish Agency, and in 1938 became a member of the Secretariat of the Jerusalem Branch of Mapai, and in 1943 was made the Secretary. He also served as a delegate to the Assembly of Representatives between 1944 and 1949. In 1948 Baram was elected Secretary of the Jerusalem Workers Council, and served as a Member of the Jerusalem City Council from 1955 until 1959. In 1959 he was elected to the Knesset on Mapai's list. In 1965 Mapai became part of the Alignment, with Baram remaining a Knesset Member until 1977. In 1974, towards the end of his political career, Baram was made Minister of Labour, also taking over the Welfare Ministry portfolio shortly before the 1977 elections. The elections saw the Alignment's parliamentary representation halved, and Baram lost his seat. However, his son, Uzi Baram did win a seat on the Alignment's list, and went on to become Minister of Tourism and Minister of Internal Affairs before retiring in 2001.

Because most of the sources for Nubian history during the period are in Arabic, it is sometimes used interchangeably with the Nubian region of Nobadia. The northern section of al-Maris was part of Fatimid Upper Egypt and was semi-independent under the Kanz ad-Dawla between 1046 and 1077 AD. The Kanz ad-Dawla Nasir invaded Nubia in 1066 but was repulsed and his territory raided. The main towns were Aswan (Greek Syene) in Egypt and Faras (Coptic Bakharas, Greek Pakhoras, Arabic Bajrash) and Fort Ibrim (Coptic Phrim, Greek Primis) in Nobadia. The area was occupied by Saladin's brother, al-Malik al-Mu'azzam Shams ad-Dawla Turanshah (Turan-Shah) from 1172 to 1174, but the Ayyubids withdrew a few years later. Some parts were overrun by the Banu Kanz and others were held by the Christian kings at Dotawo.

She traveled and painted for several years before discovering photography and eventually became known for her erotic photography and most controversially for using her pre-pubescent daughter as a model. Early life Ionesco was born to Romanian immigrants living in Paris. According to Ionesco's daughter, Ionesco was the product of father-daughter incest. From the age of 4 to 15 her parents sent her to Romania where she was raised by her family who were circus performers. From the ages of 15 to 22 she performed as a contortionist. In 1965 she gave birth to her only child, Eva Ionesco whom she would later feature heavily in her work. Photography career In 1974 she exhibited some of her work at the Nikon Gallery in Paris and attracted much attention. She was soon published in numerous magazines, books, and featured at galleries across the globe. Irina Ionesco is most famous for her photographs showcasing her young daughter, Eva. Ionesco began taking photographs of her daughter when she was four years old in 1969 though she did not display them publicly or gain prominence for her works until 1974. The nudes she created with Eva were immediately controversial as Eva was posed in the same manner as Ionesco's much older models. Ionesco notably photographed Eva nude for the cover of Der Spiegel which was later expunged from the magazine's records and also allowed pictures she took of Eva to appear in the Spanish edition of Penthouse. Ionesco also allowed her daughter to appear nude for other photographers including Jacques Bourboulon.Eva Ionesco, tomb√©e des nus ‚Äì Lib√©ration ‚Äì Anne Diatkine ‚Äì 22 July 2010 Ionesco continued to use her daughter as her muse until Eva was 12 years old at which point social services intervened and Ionesco was stripped of custody of her daughter. Over the following years the two would have a fractured relationship, with Eva asserting her mother was abusive and fighting for control of the images she appeared in. In 2012 Ionesco's daughter won a judgement against Ionesco where she was ordered to pay Eva ‚Ç¨10,000 in damages and hand over the negatives to the nude photos she had taken of her underage daughter. In 2015 Ionesco sued her son-in-law, writer Simon Liberati for passages he had written in his book Eva, which included unflattering descriptions of Ionesco including the fact that she was the product of incest between her father, who was also her mother's father and therefore her grandfather, and her mother, who would have also been her half-sister. The suit was ultimately unsuccessful. A major part of Irina's work features lavishly dressed women, decked out in jewels, gloves, and other finery, but also adorning themselves with symbolic pieces such as chokers and other fetishistic props, posing provocatively, offering themselves partially disrobed as objects of sexual possession. Ionesco published numerous books featuring her works. In 2004 she published a memoir, L'≈ìil de la poup√©e.

He was made cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church for San Giovanni a Porta Latina in 1529. Biography He was born in Gattinara, near Vercelli, modern Piedmont. Mercurino Gattinara initially served as the legal advisor to Margaret of Austria in Savoy. She considered him as chief amongst her various counselors. Mercurino Gattinara is however mostly famous for having served as Emperor Charles V's ‚ÄúGrand Chancellor of all the realms and kingdoms of the king.‚Äù Upon the death of Charles' counselor Chi√®vres, Gattinara would become the king's most influential advisor. He was a Roman Catholic, humanist, Erasmian, jurist and scholar--at the same time idealist in his goals, and realist in his tactics. He was a scholar of jurisprudence, the classic theory of the state, and the Christian doctrine of duty. Gattinara would guide Charles away from both his roots in dynastic Burgundy, and from the prevailing secular political theory of Spain at the time, toward a Christian humanist conception of Empire. His ideas of the primacy of the Empire in Europe were in direct contradiction with the growing trend toward the theory of the nation state. In his capacity as Chancellor, he urged Charles V to create a dynastic empire with the object of establishing global rule (\\"Dominium Mundi\\"). Gattinara in his policy advice and personal writings argued for Christian imperialism, based on a united Christendom, which would then combat or convert the Protestants, the Turks, and the infidels of the New World. His theory attempted to balance the solidarity of Christian nations, with the requirements of conquest for the establishment of one world empire. Gattinara was instrumental in shifting Charles V's policy vision from that of a regional dynastic monarch to an empire-builder. Doubtless due in large part to Gattinara's counsel, the Habsburg Empire would reach its territorial height under Charles V, although it would begin to show signs of decay at the end of his reign, most importantly with the independence granted to the economically thriving but tax-averse Low Countries. Goals After Charles's election to the throne, Gattinara wrote to him: In the conclusion to this letter, Gattinara reiterated his belief that the true purpose of monarchy was to unite all people in the service of God. During a review for the purpose of administrative reform, Gattinara advised Charles, in a section of the report entitled ‚ÄúReverence toward God‚Äù on issues such as: whether Moors and Infidels should be tolerated in his lands; whether the inhabitants of the West Indian islands and the mainland were to be converted to Christianity; and whether the Inquisition should be reformed. Another goal espoused by Gattinara was to unite Christendom against the Turk, as well as against the Lutheran heresy. There was little practical basis for achieving such an understanding between the European powers, however. Gattinara's own summation of his views included the final goal of laying the foundations for a policy that was truly imperial, leading to a general war on the infidel and heretic. His first objective was the Emperor's voyage to Italy as soon as the fleet was ready. Gattinara concealed the reason for expanding the fleet by reference to the troubles in Mexico. At every fresh opportunity Gattinara was for ‚Äútaking time by the forelock‚Äù and establishing the power of Charles V in Italy without more delay. This would function as a permanent guarantee of peace, not only on the peninsula, but in all Europe. Gattinara's views were rooted in Dante, despite having to face many practical setbacks. He faced deep-seated opposition to the imperial council, and Gattinara began to acknowledge that many were against his plan. Many Spaniards suspected Gattinara of having interests in Italy (as he was originally from Piedmont), as so his motives were questioned, and he was even threatened. Gattinara held Dante's dream of universal monarchy as the ultimate goal of Charles V's rule, united both Christendom, and eventually the world. These ideas were in line with some of Charles's other advisors. Imperial ambassador at Henry VIII‚Äôs court, M. Louis de Praet, wrote to Charles: Charles‚Äôs secretary, Alfonso de Vald√©s, a humanist and Erasmian like Gattinara, would write to Charles after the victory of Pavia (a defeat for the French, including the capture of their king Fran√ßois I): Spanish missionary spirit is here wedded with Dante‚Äôs theocratic ideal, and expresses the high expectations of the humanist Italians and Spaniards surrounding Charles. The Emperor was seen as the reviver of the Roman universal Monarchy who could put an end to the feudal and dynastic conflicts, and establish a democratic imperium. Charles' more limited goals of ordering his empire within a Respublica Christiana (a united Europe) was disappointing to his advisors seeking world-dominion, especially so to Gattinara, the aspirant to ‚Äúworld- empire.‚Äù Policies Just as Gattinara is noted for his universalist idealism, he is also recognized as adept in the practice of realpolitik. Taking over from Charles V's advisor Carlos de Chi√®vres, Gattinara shifted the policy outlook of his king. Chi√®vres had advocated protecting the Netherlands through understandings with France and England, attempting to avoid war with France especially. Gattinara aimed at broadening Charles from a narrow Burgundian/Spanish outlook toward a wide imperial vision. At the center of his imperial policy was Italy: Milan was the vital link between the Habsburg holdings of Spain/Franche-Comt√© and Tyrol. By the last months of 1521, Gattinara had succeeded in shifting the war with France from Navarre to Italy. His imperial strategy had two conditions for success: domination of Italy, and alliance with Rome. Gattinara was the source of Charles's shift in policy toward Italy‚Äîno other cabinet member pushed for these policies. A year previous to Gattinara's appointment, the English ambassador Tunstal had remarked on Gattinara's preoccupation with Italy. Gattinara had drawn up advance drafts of war plans against Italy, in which he stresses that since God called Charles to be the first prince of Christendom it was fitting that he turn his attention to Italy, saying that anyone who counseled Charles against pursuing Italy in lieu of interest elsewhere was prescribing the king's ruin, shame and blame. Gattinara emphasized the low cost of an Italian campaign, and the necessary troop mobilization necessary for overwhelming force. In deciding whether or not to advise Charles V to go to war against France in northern Italy, Gattinara constructed an allegory posing the seven deadly sins against the ten commandments‚Äîseven causes for avoiding war, and ten arguments in favor. Against, the reasons were all quite practical: an attack would place a great stake on a single strategy with an uncertain method of solution; there was not enough money in the treasury; negotiations with other Italian states were uncertain; the Swiss might ally themselves with France; and the area would soon be fraught with danger from the impending winter. However, Gattinara argued that the war was justified by Charles V's bond to honor the Pope, whom he needed as an ally. Clearly, God was on Charles's side, and to let France escape a fight would be to tempt fate‚Äîhe would not have the chance, as resources would not be mobilized so easily next time. Additionally, with the army mobilized, it would not look good to call it off at the eleventh hour. Gattinara saw to it that his ten commandments won out over the seven deadly sins. Gattinara was not an idealist when it came to policy. The Treaty of Madrid was forced upon Francis I of France by Charles after Francis was captured. The treaty spoke in romantic hyperbole and ended with an oath for both rulers to undertake a crusade together. While Fran√ßois signed the treaty under duress, Gattinara refused to affix the imperial seal to the document, because of his sense of realpolitik. Fran√ßois would subsequently break the terms of the treaty, which had been to renounce claims in Italy, surrender Burgundy, and abandon suzerainty over Flanders and Artois.

He first began making films in 1927, when he and some friends attempted to make a film about World War I. In 1931 he completed his first film Douro, Faina Fluvial, a documentary about his home city Porto made in the city symphony genre. He made his feature film debut in 1942 with Aniki-B√≥b√≥ and continued to make shorts and documentaries for the next 30 years, gaining a minimal amount of recognition without being considered a major world film director. Among the numerous factors that prevented Oliveira from making more films during this time period were the political situation in Portugal, family obligations and money. In 1971, Oliveira directed his second feature narrative film, Past and Present, a social satire that both set the standard for his film career afterwards and gained him recognition in the global film community. He continued making films of growing ambition throughout the 1970s and 1980s, gaining critical acclaim and numerous awards. Beginning in the late 1980s he was one of the most prolific working film directors and made an average of one film per year past the age of 100. In March 2008 he was reported to be the oldest active film director in the world. He was also the only filmmaker whose active career spanned from the silent era to the digital age. Among his numerous awards were the Career Golden Lion from the 61st Venice International Film Festival, the Special Lion for the Overall Work in the 42nd Venice International Film Festival, an Honorary Golden Palm for his lifetime achievements in 2008 Cannes Film Festival,Johnson, Randal. Manoel de Oliveira. University of Illinois Press. 2007. p. 1. and the French Legion of Honor. Early life and education Oliveira was born on 11 December 1908 in Porto, Portugal,Chicago Tribune dated February 5, 1996, p. 3 to Francisco Jos√© de Oliveira and C√¢ndida Ferreira Pinto. His family were wealthy industrialists and agricultural landowners. His father owned a dry-goods factory, produced the first electric light bulbs in Portugal and built an electric energy plant before he died in 1932.Johnson. p. 5. Oliveira was educated at the Col√©gio Universal in Porto before attending a Jesuit boarding school in Galicia, Spain. As a teenager his goal was to become an actor. At 17, he joined his brothers as an executive in his father's factories, where he remained for the majority of his adult life when not making films. In a 1981 Sight and Sound article, John Gillett describes Oliveira as having \\"spent most of his life in business ... making films only when circumstances allowed.\\" From an early age, Oliveira was interested in the poverty of the lower classes, the arts and especially films. While he named D. W. Griffith, Eric von Stroheim, Charlie Chaplin, Max Linder, Carl Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc and Sergei Eisenstein's The General Line as early influences, he was also disappointed to have virtually no Portuguese filmmakers to emulate.Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. 832‚Äì837. The Portuguese film industry was also highly censored and restricted under the fascist Salazar regime that lasted from the early 1930s until the mid-1970s. His later films, such as The Cannibals and Belle Toujours (a sequel to Belle de Jour), suggest an affinity with Spanish filmmaker Luis Bu√±uel. He stated \\"I'm closer to Bu√±uel. He's a reverse Catholic and I was raised a Catholic. It's a religion that permits sin, and Bu√±uel at the very deepest is one of the most moralistic directors but he does everything to the contrary. I never say that I'm Catholic because to be Catholic is very difficult. I prefer to be thought of as a great sinner.\\"Stone, Judy. Eye on the World: Conversations with International Filmmakers. Silman-James Press, Los Angeles, 1997, , pp. 496‚Äì497. Career =1927‚Äì42: Early documentaries and first feature= Oliveira's first attempt at filmmaking was in 1927 when he and his friends worked on a film about the Portuguese participation in World War I, although the film was never made. He enrolled in Italian film-maker Rino Lupo's acting school at age 20 and appeared as an extra in Lupo's film F√°tima Milagrosa. Years later in 1933 he also had the distinction of having acted in the second Portuguese sound film, A Can√ß√£o de Lisboa.Johnson. p. 6. Eventually Oliveira turned his attention back to filmmaking when he saw Walther Ruttmann's documentary Berlin: Symphony of a City. Ruttman's film is the most famous of a small, short lived silent documentary film genre, the city symphony film. These films portrays the life of a city, mainly through visual impressions in a semi-documentary style, without the narrative content of more mainstream films, though the sequencing of events can imply a kind of loose theme or impression of the city's daily life. Other examples include Alberto Cavalcanti's Rien que les heures and Dziga Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera. Oliveira said that Ruttman's film was his \\"most useful lesson in film technique\\", but that he also found it cold, mechanical and lacking humanity. The discovery of Ruttman's film prompted Oliveira to direct his own first film in 1931, a documentary short titled Douro, Faina Fluvial. The film is a portrait of his hometown Porto and the labor and industry that takes place along the cities main river, the Douro River. Rino Lupo invited Oliveira to show the film at the International Congress of Film Critics in Lisbon, where the majority of the Portuguese audience booed. However other foreign critics and artists who were in attendance praised the film, such as Luigi Pirandello and √âmile Vuillermoz. Oliveira re-edited the film with a new soundtrack and re-released it in 1934. And again in 1994, Oliveira modified the film by adding a new, more avant-garde soundtrack by Freitas Branco.Johnson. p. 8. Over the next 10 years Oliveira struggled to make films, abandoning several ambitious projects and making a handful of short documentaries on subjects ranging from artistic portraits of coastal cities in Portugal to industrial films on the origins of Portugal's auto industry. One of these shorts was a documentary about the inauguration of the hydro-electrical plant that his father built, Hulha Branca. He also first met and befriended Portuguese playwright Jos√© R√©gio during this time period. Oliveira would go on to adapt four of R√©gio's plays as films.Johnson. p. 27. Fifteen years after his first attempt at filmmaking, Oliveira made his feature film debut in 1942. Aniki- B√≥b√≥ is a portrait of Porto's street children and based on a short story by Rodrigo de Freitas. Oliveira used non-professional actors to portray the children. The story centers around two young boys who compete for the attention of a young girl. One of the boys in an extroverted bully, while the other is shy and innocent.Johnson. p. 10. The film was a commercial failure when it opened, and its merit only came to be recognized over time.Manoel de Oliveira Oliveira stated that he was criticized for portraying children that lied, cheated and stole, which in his mind made them act more like adults.Johnson. p. 9. The film's poor reception forced Oliveira to abandon other film projects he was involved in, after which he dedicated himself to work in a vineyard that his wife had inherited.Johnson. p. 15. In the early 1950s he and R√©gio submitted a screenplay to the Estado Novo-run Film Fund commission, but the commission refused to either accept or reject the film. Oliveira attributed this to his own well known dislike for the Salazar regime. =1955‚Äì70: Return to filmmaking= In 1955 Oliveira traveled to Germany to study new techniques in color cinematography. He re-emerged onto the film scene in 1956 with The Artist and the City, a twenty-six-minute documentary short film shot in color. Much like his first film, The Artist and the City is a portrait of Porto, juxtaposing color shots of the city with paintings being created by local artist Ant√≥nio Cruz. The film was shown in a number of festivals to positive reviews. In 1959, Portugal's National Federation of Industrial Millers commissioned O P√£o, a color documentary on Portugal's bread industry. In 1963, Rite of Spring (O Acto de Primavera), a partly documentary, partly narrative film depicting an annual passion play, marked a turning point for his career. The play is based on a 16th-century passion play by Francisco Vaz de Guimar√£es and was actually performed by villagers in northern Portugal.Johnson. p. 16. Along with the performance of the play, Oliveira staged the actors rehearsals, spectators watching the actors and even himself and his crew preparing to film the performance.Johnson. p. 17. Oliveira said that making the film \\"profoundly altered his conception of cinema\\" as a tool not to simulate reality, but merely represent it. O Acto de Primavera was called the first political film from Portugal by film critic Henrique Costa and gave Oliveira his first worldwide recognition as a filmmaker. The film won the Grand Prix at the Siena Film Festival and Oliveira had his first film retrospective at the Locarno Film Festival in 1964. This was shortly followed by The Hunt (A ca√ßa), a grim, surrealistic short narrative film that contrasted with the positive tones of his previous film. Due to censorship issues, Oliveira was forced to add a \\"happy ending\\" to the initial release of the film and was unable to restore his original ending until 1988.Johnson. p. 20. Because of this film and anti- Salazar comments Oliveira made after a screening of O Acto de Primavera, he was arrested by the PIDE in 1963. He spent 10 days in jail and was interrogated until finally being released with the help of his friend Manuel Meneres.Johnson. p. 21. His career again slowed down and he only completed two short documentaries in the next 9 years. In 1967, the Cineclube do Porto sponsored a Week of Portuguese Cinema, where many filmmakers from the blossoming Cinema Novo movement screened films and discussed \\"the precarious situation of Portuguese cinema in the marketplace, and the decline of the film club movement.\\"Johnson. p. 23. This resulted in the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation's creation of the Centro Portuges de Cinema, which would help to finance and distribute films in Portugal. The first film that the foundation chose to sponsor was Oliveira's next feature, and the early 1970s would come to be known as the Gulbenkian Years of Portuguese cinema.Johnson. pp. 23‚Äì24. =1970‚Äì89: Artistic breakthrough: Tetralogy of Frustrated Love and recognition= From the 1970s, Oliveira was at his most active, with the vast majority of his films having been made after his seventy-fifth birthday. Whether a late bloomer or a victim of unfortunate delays and political censorship, he became Portugal's preeminent filmmaker during the later part of his long life. Film critic J. Hoberman has said \\"at an age when many men think of retirement, Oliveira emerged from obscurity as one of the 70s leading modernists, a peer of Straub, Syberberg and Duras.\\" With a newfound artistic freedom after Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar's stroke in 1968 and the April 1974 Carnation Revolution, Oliveira's career began to flourish and receive international acclaim. Ironically the Carnation Revolution also resulted in his family's factories being occupied by factions of the Left and subsequently going bankrupt. Due to this, Oliveira lost most of his personal wealth and his home of thirty-five years.Johnson. p. 33. Oliveira's second return to filmmaking came in 1971 with Past and Present (O Passado e o Presente), a satirical black comedy on marriage and the bourgeoisie. With its lyrical surrealism and farcical situations, the film was a shift from his earlier work about lower-class people. Based on a play by Vicente Sanches, the film stars Maria de Saisset as Vanda, a woman who only falls in love with her husbands after they have died. Past and Present was the first of what has become known as Oliveira's \\"Tetralogy of frustrated loves\\". It was followed by Benilde or the Virgin Mother, Doomed Love and Francisca. Each of these films share the theme of unfulfilled love, the backdrop of a repressive society, and the beginning of Oliveira's unique cinematic style.Johnson. p. 22. Benilde or the Virgin Mother (Benilde ou a Virgem M√£e) was based on a play by Oliveira's long-time friend and fellow Salazar regime dissident Jos√© R√©gio and released in 1975. This would be the first of many films that would examine the relationship between film and theater in Oliveira's work, and the film opens with roaming exterior shots of the Tobis Studios in Lisbon until reaching the constructed set of the film. In the film Benilde is a sleepwalking eighteen-year-old who mysteriously becomes impregnated and believes herself to have been chosen for immaculate conception, despite the angry and dismissive reactions of her bourgeoisie family and friends.Johnson. pp. 28‚Äì31. Upon its release, the film was criticized for being irrelevant to the political climate of 1975 Portugal. However Oliveira defended its depiction of a moralistic and social repression on its characters as not being \\"in opposition to or in contradiction with our own times.\\" Doomed Love (Amor de Perdi√ß√£o ) is a tragic love story based on the novel by Camilo Castelo Branco. The film depicts the doomed love affair of Teresa and Simao, who come from two rival wealthy families. Teresa is sent to a convent for refusing to marry her cousin Baltasar, and after Simao kills Baltasar he is sentenced to death and eventually sent into exile. Teresa dies after Simao is sent away, and Simao dies at sea. Oliveira made two versions of the film: a six-part television miniseries that was broadcast in 1978 to disastrous reviews, and a shorter theatrical film released in 1979, which received rave reviews and was profiled on the cover of Le Monde.Johnson. p. 34-35. Oliveira stated that whereas most film adaptations of literature attempt to adapt the narrative to film, he wanted instead to adapt \\"the text\\" of Branco's novel, much like Jean-Marie Straub and Daniele Huillet's The Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach was a film more about music itself than about its own story. He stated that \\"in a novel where a lot happens, it would be a waste of time to show everything. Besides, the literary narration, the way of telling the story, the style, the sonorousness of the phrases, [and] the composition are all just as beautiful and interesting as the events that unfold. Therefore, it seemed convenient for me to focus on the text, and that is what I did.\\"Johnson. pp. 34- 35. The film achieves this idea by including extensive narration, characters that speak their thoughts or read letters aloud and shots of written text. In 1981 Oliveira made Francisca, based on the novel by Agustina Bessa-Lu√≠s. The film is a tragic love triangle detailing a real life relationship between Fanny Owen, Amor de Perdi√ß√£o author Camilo Castelo Branco and Branco's best friend Jose Augusto. Oliveira's wife was a distant relative of Owen and had access to private letter's written by all three protagonists in the film. The film was screened to great acclaim at the Director's Fortnight at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival and furthered Oliveira's global recognition. In addition to Francisca, Oliveira adapted six other novels or stories from author Agustina Bessa-Lu√≠s, as well as collaborated on the screenplay for the documentary Visita ou Mem√≥rias e Confiss√µes. This was also the first film which Oliveira made with producer Paulo Branco, who would go on to produce the majority of Oliveira's film, and with actor Diogo D√≥ria. Following the success of Francisca, Oliveira made three documentary films. Visit or Memories and Confessions is an autobiographical documentary about Oliveira's family history. After completing the film, he decided that it will not be released until after his death. He then made Lisboa Cultural and Nice... √Ä Propos de Jean Vigo , a documentary for French television on the city of Nice, and also a tribute to French filmmaker Jean Vigo. Oliveira then made his most ambitious film to that date, The Satin Slipper (Le Soulier de Satin), based on the notorious 1929 epic play by Paul Claudel, which is rarely performed in its entirety due to its length. The seven-hour film took Oliveira two years to complete. It was Oliveira's first film in French, as well as his first film with actor Lu√≠s Miguel Cintra, who would go on to act in all of his films from then on. The story of The Satin Slipper is about the unrequited love of sixteenth-century conquistador Don Rodrigue and nobelwoman Dona Prouheze with the backdrop of colonialism in Africa and the Americas. The film opens with a theater gradually being filled with an audience and an introduction to the film on stage. The film itself uses very theatrical set pieces, such as cardboard waves and backdrops. The film was never released theatrically, but was screened at both the 1985 Cannes Film Festival and the 1985 Venice Film Festival, where Oliveira received a special Golden Lion for his career up to that point. Later the Brussels Cinematheque awarded the film its L'√Çge d'or Prize.Johnson. pp. 47‚Äì51. In 1986 Oliveira made one of his most experimental films, My Case (Mon Cas), partially based on Jos√© R√©gio's one act play O Meu Caso, although the film also takes inspiration from Samuel Beckett's Fizzles and the Book of Job.Johnson. p. 51. Oliveira takes a surreal and meta-narrative approach to examine the relationship between art and life. The film begins with a theater being filled with the audience and actors before a play is about to begin. A mysterious man play by Luis Miguel Cintra enters the stage and presents \\"his case\\" about the fallacies of theater and its illusions. One by one all of the play's actors and technicians state their cases about what bothers them about the play and its relation to their own lives. An audience member then takes the stage to make a case for what the collective audience wants. This is followed by three consecutive but very different versions of the one act play: the first is a straightforward farce, the second is presented as a slapstick silent movie, and the third is performed with the dialogue read backwards. The stage performance ends with video footage of war and disasters from around the world and Pablo Picasso's painting Guernica. The entire film then shifts to a retelling of the Book of Job, with Cintra as Job and Bulle Ogier as his wife. This sequence ends with a close-up of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa.Johnson. pp. 51‚Äì55. My Case opened the 1986 Venice Film Festival and was released in 1987. Oliveira next made a satirical film in the tradition of Luis Bu√±uel, The Cannibals (Os Canibais) in 1988. The film is based on a short story by √Ålvaro Carvalhal and stars Luis Miguel Cintra, Leonor Silveira and Diogo D√≥ria. Jos√© R√©gio first showed Oliveira the little known story, and Oliveira decided to make the film his only opera in collaboration with composer Joao Paes. The film also contains a demonic narrator Niccolo who appears and disappears from scenes magically. In the film, the beautiful young Margarida (Silveira) falls in love with the mysterious Viscount of Aveleda (Cintra), while rejecting the advances of the notorious Don Jo√£o (D√≥ria). On their wedding night, the Viscount reveals to Margarida that his great mystery is that he has no arms or legs and is \\"a living corpse\\". Margarida throws herself out of their bedroom window in horror and the Viscount attempts to drink poison but rolls into the fireplace instead, singing an aria as he burns to death. Just then Don Jo√£o enters intending to murder the Viscount in jealously and witnesses the Viscounts death. The next morning, Margarida's father, brothers and family magistrate wake up and want to be served breakfast, but find an empty house. They look for the Viscount, but only discover a strange meat cooking in the fireplace, and conclude that it is a strange delicacy being prepared for them. The four men unknowingly eat the Viscount's body for breakfast with great delight. Suddenly they hear a gunshot and rush to the garden where they find Margarida's dead body and Don Jo√£o sitting next to her with a self- inflicted gunshot wound in his chest. As Don Jo√£o dies, he explains everything that has happened to the family and tells them they can find the Viscount in the fireplace. Horrified at their own cannibalism, the father and brother's decide to commit suicide until the magistrate points out that they are now the sole heirs to the Viscount's fortune. The father and brother's decide to live, and turn into rabid dogs and eat the magistrate, who has turned into a pig.Johnson. pp. 56‚Äì59. The Cannibals was screened in competition at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival and won the Critics Special award at the 1988 S√£o Paulo International Film Festival. =1990‚Äì2014: Continued success as a filmmaker= Oliveira's work since the 1990s was the most prolific of his entire career and he made at least one film a year (usually feature narratives but sometimes shorts or documentaries) between 1990 and 2012. During this period he established and consistently worked with a loyal troupe of regular actors including his grandson Ricardo Tr√™pa, Lu√≠s Miguel Cintra, Leonor Baldaque, Leonor Silveira, Diogo D√≥ria, John Malkovich, Catherine Deneuve and Michel Piccoli. He also worked with international stars such as Jeanne Moreau, Irene Papas, Bulle Ogier, Chiara Mastroianni, and Marcello Mastroianni in the actor's last film. In 1990 Oliveira directed No, or the Vain Glory of Command (Non, ou a V√£ Gl√≥ria de Mandar), starring Cintra, D√≥ria and Silveira. The film depicts the military history of Portugal, focusing on its defeats over its victories. The film's historical action includes the assassination of Viriathus, the Battle of Toro, the Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir and the Portuguese Colonial War. The only exception to the historical scenes is a sequence depicting the mythical Isle of Love, which celebrates Portuguese explorers and discoverers, instead of its military figures. The Isle of Love features winged cupids, beautiful nymphs and the goddess Venus.Johnson. pp. 63‚Äì66. The film competed at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. In 1991, Oliveira directed The Divine Comedy (A Divina Com√©dia). Set in a mental institution, the film is not an adaptation of Dante Alighieri's famous work but derived from stories on the Bible, Jos√© R√©gio's play A Salva√ß√£o do Mundo, Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov, and Friedrich Nietzsche's Antichrist. Oliveira stated that all of the texts he uses \\"deal in some way with the problem of sin and the possibility of redemption, and in this sense they all derive ultimately from the same source.\\"Johnson. p. 69. The film stars Maria de Medeiros, Miguel Guilherme, Lu√≠s Miguel Cintra, Leonor Silveira and Diogo D√≥ria and competed at the 1991 Venice Film Festival, where it won the Grand Special Jury Prize award. Oliveira at the 48th Venice International Film Festival, 1991In 1992, Oliveira returned to the adaptation of works by Portuguese writer Camilo Castelo Branco with Day of Despair (O Dia do Desespero). The film stars M√°rio Barroso as Branco, with actors Teresa Madruga, Lu√≠s Miguel Cintra and Diogo D√≥ria playing both themselves and Ana Pl√°cido, Freitas Fortuna and Dr. Edmundo Magalh√£es, respectively. The film was shot in the house where Branco lived his final years and committed suicide and is both a documentary and a narrative film about the famous Portuguese writer.Johnson. p. 72. In 1993 Oliveira made Abraham's Valley (Vale Abra√£o), based on the novel by Agustina Bessa-Lu√≠s. Oliveira had wanted to film Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary, but was dissuaded by producer Paulo Branco due to budgetary restraints. Oliveira then suggested to Bessa-Lu√≠s that she write an updated version of the novel set in Portugal, which resulted in the novel in 1991. Abraham's Valley is not a retelling of the Flaubert book, however Madame Bovary is both a subtext and a physical presence in the film.Johnson. p. 77. The film stars Leonor Silveira as Ema, a discontent Portuguese woman who wants a passionate life like the one she reads about in Flaubert's novel. Like Madame Bovary, Ema marries a doctor that she does not love and has many extramarital affairs before dying in an accident that may or may not be a suicide. Unlike Madame Bovary, there is no scandal in her love affairs, which are simply accepted by both her husband and the society that she lives in.Johnson. pp. 78‚Äì82. The film won the Critics award at the 1993 S√£o Paulo International Film Festival, as well as an award for Best Artistic Contribution Award at the 1993 Tokyo International Film Festival. In 1994 Oliveira made The Box (A Caixa), based on a play by H√©lder Prista Monteiro. The film stars Luis Miguel Cintra as a blind homeless man whose only means of support in a poor neighborhood in Lisbon is his official, government issued alms box.Johnson. p. 84. It was screened in competition at the 1994 Tokyo International Film Festival. In 1995 Oliveira's reputation had grown and his films were internationally acclaimed. That year he made his first of many films starring international movie stars: The Convent (O Convento), starring John Malkovich and Catherine Deneuve. The film is based on the novel As Terras Do Risco by Agustina Bessa-Lu√≠s and examines the Faustian theme of good versus evil. In the film Malkovich plays an American writer who travels to Portugal with his wife (Deneuve) to research his theory that William Shakespeare was really Jacques Perez, a Jewish Spaniard who fled his native country to avoid the Spanish Inquisition. The couple stay in a monastery with strange, demonic- looking staff and they eventually end up having affairs with two staff members.Johnson. pp. 87‚Äì88. The film was screened in competition at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival and won the Prize of the Catalan Screenwriter's Critic and Writer's Association at the 1995 Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival. In 1996 Oliveira worked with French star Michel Piccoli and Greek film star Irene Papas in Party. The film was co-written by Oliveira and Agustina Bessa-Lu√≠s from an original idea by Oliveira. In the film, a married couple played by Leonor Silveira and Rog√©rio Samora have a dinner party that includes a famous Greek actress (Papas) and her lover (Piccoli) and the film consists of conversations between these four characters at parties over the course of five years.Johnson. pp. 91‚Äì93. The film was screened in competition at the 1996 Venice Film Festival and won Oliveira the award for Best Director at the 1996 Portuguese Golden Globe Awards. In 1997 Oliveira made Voyage to the Beginning of the World (Viagem ao Princ√≠pio do Mundo), which was the final film of Italian film star Marcello Mastroianni. In the film Mastroianni plays an aging film director named Manoel who travels on a road trip across Northern Portugal with French film actor Afonso (Jean-Yves Gautier) and two other young companions, Judite (Leonor Silveira) and Duarte (Diogo D√≥ria). Afonso wants to see the Portuguese village that his father grew up in and see the relatives that he has never met. On the way, Manoel stops at several locations on the road that he remembers from his childhood, only to find them much different than he had remembered. The film is autobiographical in that the locations on the road are real locations from Oliveira's childhood. The film is also based on the experiences of actor Yves Afonso, whose father had immigrated from Portugal to France and who had met his long lost relatives during a French- Portuguese co-production in 1987.Johnson. pp. 95‚Äì96. The film was screened out of competition at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival and won the FIPRESCI Prize and a Special Mention from the Ecumenical Jury. It won other awards at the 1997 Haifa International Film Festival and the 1997 Tokyo International Film Festival. Oliveira then made Anxiety (Inquietude) in 1998. The episodic film contains three short films based on literary works by Helder Prista Monteiro (Os Immortais), Ant√≥nio Patr√≠cio (Suzy) and Agustina Bessa-Lu√≠s (M√£e de Um Rio). In Os Immortais a 90-year-old man (Jos√© Pinto) concludes that old age is horrible and attempts to convince his middle aged son (Lu√≠s Miguel Cintra) to commit suicide. In Suzy, an aristocrat (Diogo D√≥ria) has an affair with a beautiful young cocotte (Leonor Silveira), but social class differences prevent him from having a deep, meaningful relationship with her. In M√£e de Um Rio, Leonor Baldaque plays a discontent small town girl who yearns for a more exotic life and seek advice from the Mother of the River (Irene Papas).Johnson. pp. 102- 106. The film won Oliveira another award for Best Director at the 1998 Portuguese Golden Globe Awards. In 1999 Oliveira made The Letter (La Lettre), based on the 17th century French novel The Princess of Cleves by Madame de Lafayette. Oliveira had wanted to make a film from the novel since the late 1970s, but had initially thought that it was too complicated to be filmed.Johnson. pp. 107- 108. The film updates the novel to modern day and stars Chiara Mastroianni as Catherine de Cl√®ves, Antoine Chappey as the husband that she does not love, Leonor Silveira as her childhood friend who has become a nun and her confidant, and Portuguese rock star Pedro Abrunhosa playing himself in the role of the dashing Duke of Nemours, whom Catherine is in love with. Abrunhosa also wrote some original songs for the film.Johnson. p. 108. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. Oliveira and Michel Piccoli at the 2001 Cannes Film festivalIn 2000 Oliveira made the film Word and Utopia (Palavra e Utopia), a biography of the Portuguese Jesuit priest Padre Ant√≥nio Vieira based upon letters and sermons that the priest wrote between 1626 and 1695. Vieira is played by Oliveira's grandson Ricardo Tr√™pa as a young man, Luis Miguel Cintra in middle age and Lima Duarte as an old man. The film chronicles Vieira's missionary work in South America, testimony before the Spanish Inquisition and work as a trusted advisor to Queen Christina of Sweden (Leonor Silveira).Johnson. pp. 111- 112. The film was shown in competition at the 2000 Venice Film Festival, where it won the Film critica \\"Bastone Bianco\\" Award. It also won Oliveira his third award for Best Director at the 2000 Portuguese Golden Globe Awards. In 2001 Oliveira made two feature films at the age of 92. I'm Going Home (Je rentre √† la maison) stars Michel Piccoli as Gilbert Valence, an aging stage actor that never achieved great success who deals with the sudden deaths of his wife, daughter and son-in-law after a car accident, turning down undignified roles in commercial TV shows and raising his 9-year- old grandson. Catherine Deneuve, John Malkovich, Antoine Chappey, Leonor Baldaque, Leonor Silveira and Ricardo Tr√™pa also co-star.Johnson. pp. 114‚Äì115. The film was shown in competition at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, won awards at the Haifa International Film Festival and the S√£o Paulo International Film Festival, and won the award for Best Film at the 2001 Portuguese Golden Globe Awards. Later that year Oliveira made the autibiographical, partially documentary film Porto of My Childhood (Porto da Minha Inf√¢ncia). The film includes archival footage of Douro, Faina Fluvial and Aniki-B√≥b√≥, reenactments of parts of Oliveira's childhood and documentary footage of Porto in the early 20th century. Oliveira's grandsons Jorge Tr√™pa and Ricardo Tr√™pa portray Oliveira at different ages of his life.Johnson. pp. 119- 121. The film was screened in competition at the 2001 Venice Film Festival, where it won the UNESCO Award. Oliveira made The Uncertainty Principle (O Princ√≠pio da Incerteza) in 2002. The film is based on the 2001 novel O Princ√≠pio da Incerteza: J√≥ia de Fam√≠lia by Agustina Bessa-Lu√≠s, which won the Grand Prize from the Portuguese Writer's Association. In the film, Leonor Baldaque plays Camila, who marries a man (Ivo Canelas) to help alleviate her family's financial difficulties instead of her boyfriend (Ricardo Tr√™pa). Camila's husband begins an affair with Vanessa (Leonor Silveira), which Camila is indifferent about. This infuriates Vanessa who proceeds to do everything she can to make Camila suffer. In the end Vanessa and Camila's husband become involved with an illegal deal with some gangsters, which Camila refuses to help them with.Johnson. pp. 122- 124. The film was screened in competition at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. This was followed by A Talking Picture (Um Filme Falado), starring Leonor Silveira, Filipa de Almeida, Catherine Deneuve, John Malkovich, Irene Papas and Stefania Sandrelli in 2003. In the film Silveira takes her young daughter (Almeida) on a cruise to Bombay to meet her father's family and teaches her about the history of the places that they pass through along the way. These sights include such places as Ceuta, Marseilles, Athens, Naples and Pompeii. They also meet and learn about three successful women (Deneuve, Papas and Sandrelli) from certain location and have long conversations with the ship's captain (Malkovich), often dealing with the conflicts between Christianity and Islam.Johnson. p. 126. The film was screened in competition at the 2003 Venice Film festival, where it won the SIGNIS Award. 106-year-old film director Manoel de Oliveira was the world's oldest man still in working activity. In 2004 Oliveira made The Fifth Empire (O Quinto Imp√©rio ‚Äì Ontem Como Hoje), a highly political film based on the play El-Rey Sebasti√£o by Jos√© R√©gio. The film chronicles the history of King Sebastian I of Portugal, and at a screening at the 2004 Venice Film Festival Oliveira acknowledged that US President George W. Bush had \\"a \\"Sebastianist\\" inclination in his expressed desire to spread democracy and freedom around the globe in his own version of the Fifth Empire.\\"Johnson. p. 131. In the film King Sebastian (Ricardo Tr√™pa) contemplates pursuing his crusade in the Middle East that would lead to the Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir (where he would eventually die) and the counsel that he seeks from a variety of advisors, friends and family members. The film portrays King Sebastian as obsessed with his place in history and with his own myth of himself, while creating violent situations all around him.Johnson. pp. 132- 134. The film was screened at Venice out of competition as part of Oliveira's Career Golden Lion award.Johnson. p. 1. Oliveira followed this film with Magic Mirror (Espelho M√°gico) in 2005. Based on the novel A Alma dos Ricos by Agustina Bessa-Lu√≠s, the film stars Leonor Silveira, Ricardo Tr√™pa, Lu√≠s Miguel Cintra, Leonor Baldaque and Michel Piccoli in a cameo, but was produced by Jos√© Miguel Cadilhe instead of Paulo Branco. In the film, Silveira plays a wealthy woman who is determined to see a real apparition of the Virgin Mary with the help of Tr√™pa, who has recently been released from prison.Johnson. pp. 135- 136. In 2006 Oliveira made Belle Toujours, a sequel to Luis Bu√±uel's 1967 film, Belle de Jour. The film stars Bulle Ogier as S√©verine Serizy and Michel Piccoli reprising his original role of Henri Husson.Johnson. p. 136. In the film, S√©verine reluctantly agrees to see Henri for the first time in forty years out of curiosity to know if her former blackmailer told her dying husband about her secret life as a prostitute. Ricardo Tr√™pa and Leonor Baldaque also appear in supporting roles. Oliveira's 2007 film Christopher Columbus - The Enigma (Crist√≥v√£o Colombo ‚Äì O Enigma) was shot partly in New York and starred Ricardo Tr√™pa. In 2009 Oliveira made Eccentricities of a Blonde-haired Girl (Singularidades de uma Rapariga Loura), based on a short story by E√ßa de Queir√≥s. The film starred Ricardo Tr√™pa and Catarina Wallenstein, who won Best Actress at the 2009 Portuguese Golden Globe Awards. Oliveira's 2010 film The Strange Case of Angelica starred Spanish actress Pilar L√≥pez de Ayala and was entered into the Un Certain Regard section of the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. Oliveira's last feature film, Gebo and the Shadow, was released in 2012 and premiered at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. The film stars Michael Lonsdale, Jeanne Moreau, Claudia Cardinale, Leonor Silveira, Ricardo Tr√™pa and Lu√≠s Miguel Cintra and is based on the play The Hunchback and His Shadow by Raul Brand√£o. In November 2013 he announced production of the short film The Old Man of Belem, pending government funding. This was his last completed film and premiered at the 71st Venice International Film Festival and was released in Porto in November 2014. Oliveira originally intended to shoot the film on a studio set, but because of his failing health it was shot in a garden close to his home in Porto. It was based on the novel The Penitent by Portuguese writer Teixeira de Pascoaes and starred Lu√≠s Miguel Cintra as Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, Ricardo Tr√™pa as Don Quixote, M√°rio Barroso as Camilo Castelo Branco and Diogo D√≥ria as Teixeira de Pascoaes. Some short clips from his previous films were edited into the short film, but he stated that it was neither an \\"overview\\" of his life's work nor a \\"farewell\\" to filmmaking. It was shot by cinematographer Renato Berta and edited by Val√©rie Loiseleux. Honors and decorations In 1989 and in 2008, Oliveira was awarded doctorate degrees honoris causa by the University of Porto and by the University of the Algarve.Manoel de Oliveira na Universidade do Algarve He was also awarded the Order of St. James of the Sword by the President of Portugal. In addition, he has received multiple honours such as those of the Cannes, Venice and Montr√©al film festivals. He was awarded two Career Golden Lions, in 1985 and 2004, and an Honorary Golden Palm for his lifetime achievements in 2008. In 2002, Portuguese architect Eduardo Souto de Moura completed \\"Cinema House\\" in Porto, which was designed to commemorate the work of Oliveira.Cinema House. Ivarhagendoorn.com. Retrieved on May 22, 2014.Cinema House in Porto, Portugal by Eduardo Souto de Moura. Morfae.com. Retrieved on May 22, 2014. In November 2012 Oliveira was honored with a week-long tribute and retrospective at the 16th Cit√©philo in Lille, France. In March 2013 Oliveira attended a screening of Aniki-B√≥b√≥ at the International Film Festival of Porto, which commemorated the 70th anniversary of the film. On December 10, 2014 Oliveira was appointed grand officier of the French L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur in a ceremony conducted by France's ambassador to Portugal at the Museu da Funda√ß√£o Serralves in Porto. Personal life Oliveira answering Antonio Tabucchi at the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise on July 3, 2008 Manoel de Oliveira married Maria Isabel Brand√£o de Meneses de Almeida Carvalhais (1 September 1918 - 11 September 2019) in Porto on December 4, 1940. They remained married for nearly 75 years and had four children; their two sons are Manuel Casimiro Brand√£o Carvalhais de Oliveira (a painter born in 1941 known as Manuel Casimiro), Jose Manuel Brand√£o Carvalhais de Oliveira (born 1944), and their two daughters Maria Isabel Brand√£o Carvalhais de Oliveira (born 1947) and Adelaide Maria Brand√£o Carvalhais de Oliveira (born 1948). They have several grandchildren, including actor Ricardo Tr√™pa through his youngest daughter. In his younger days, Oliveira competed as a race car driver. During the 1937 Grand Prix season, he competed in and won the International Estoril Circuit race, driving a Ford V8 Special. Manoel de Oliveira, at the age of 101, was chosen to give the welcoming speech at Pope Benedict XVI's meeting with representatives of the Portuguese cultural world on May 12, 2010, at the Bel√©m Cultural Center. In the speech, titled \\"Religion and Art\\", he said that morality and art may well have derived from the religious attempt at \\"an explanation of the existence of human beings\\" with regard to their \\"concrete insertion in the Cosmos\\". The arts \\"have always been strictly linked to religions\\" and Christianity has been \\"prodigal in artistic expressions\\".Religion and Art: Manoel de Oliveira In an interview published the day before, Oliveira, who was raised a Catholic, said that, \\"doubts or not, the religious aspect of life has always accompanied me,\\" and added, \\"All my films are religious.\\" For several years before Oliveira's death, a feature film called A Igreja do Diabo (The Church of the Devil) was in development. In an interview conducted less than five months before his death, Oliveira revealed that he had plans for future films. Declining health and death In July 2012, Oliveira spent a week in hospital to treat a respiratory infection and congestive heart failure. Oliveira died in Porto on 2 April 2015, aged 106. He was survived by a wife, four children, and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

It causes nosemosis, also called nosema, which is the most common and widespread disease of adult honey bee diseases.Johannes Eckert, Karl Theodor Friedhoff, Horst Zahner, Peter Deplazes: Lehrbuch der Parasitologie f√ºr die Tiermedizin (German). 2nd Ed., Georg Thieme 2008, , p. 140. The dormant stage of N. apis is a long-lived spore which is resistant to temperature extremes and dehydration, and cannot be killed by freezing the contaminated comb. Nosemosis is a listed disease with the Office International des Epizooties (OIE).  Pathology  thumb Nosema apis is a single-celled parasite of the western honey bee (Apis mellifera). The species is of the class Microsporidia, which were previously thought to be protozoans, but are now classified as fungi or fungi-related. Microsporidia are intracellular parasites and they infect the epithelial cells of the midgut. N. apis has a resistant spore that withstands temperature extremes and dehydration. In 1996, a similar microsporidian parasite of the eastern honey bee (Apis cerana) was discovered in Asia, which was named Nosema ceranae. Little is known about the symptoms and the course of the disease. Chinese researchers found Nosema ceranae in spring 2005 in Taiwan for the first time, and it has now been seen on western honey bees. The new pathogen was discovered in 2005 in SpainHiges et al. and was observed to have a notably higher virulence than the western version. The disease caused by N. ceranae in western honey bees in Spain is related to heavier disease patterns deviating from the previously typical findings (unusually heavy intestine injuries in the bees, no diarrhea, preferential affliction of older collecting bees). Bees die far away from the dwellings, as when they leave they are too weak to return. This leads to collapse of the bee colony. Within a few years, a strongly increased propagation of Nosema was observed, and its occurrence was happening all year round due to the higher resistance of N. ceranae. A higher reinfection rate of the bee colonies is assumed, since the pathogen survives longer in the external environment. The two pathogen types cannot be differentiated with usual routine investigations, but can be distinguished only with the assistance of molecular-genetic methods such as polymerase chain reaction. Spanish researchers regard with alarm the insurgence of N. ceranae in Spain, which has now replaced N. apis. Because of this newly emergent parasite, the pathogen is assumed to be related to the substantial bee mortality observed in Spain since autumn 2004. They conjectured a similar cause of increased bee colony losses reported in other European countries, such as those experienced in France since end of the 1990s and in Germany in 2002 and 2003. In the samples examined in German laboratories in the winter of 2005/2006, the new pathogen was present in eight of 10 examined bee hives (CVUA Freiburg), with the distribution varying from state to state. The bees with the classical pathogen N. apis came from Thuringia and Bavaria, whereas N. ceranae prevailed in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, and North Rhine- Westphalia. Cases were also reported from Switzerland (July 2006) and from several regions of Italy (September 2006) where N. ceranae was found in bee colonies with increased mortality. German scientistsRitter, Wolfgang, (CVUA Freiburg): Nosema ceranae. Asiatischer Nosema-Erreger festgestellt. Neu verbreitet oder erst jetzt entdeckt (translation: Asian nosema pathogene diagnosed. Newly distributed or only lately discovered)?] ADIZ, die Biene, der Imkerfreund (Zeitschrift der Landesverb√§nde) 3/2006, S. 7 (Online auf der Website des Landesverbandes Schleswig-Holsteinischer und Hamburger Imker e. V.). do not know whether N. ceranae was already present in Europe and simply had not yet been differentiated from N. apis. The current disease processes possibly are more extreme when a Nosema affliction occurs because the colonies are already weakened by the Varroa mite or other factors that make them more susceptible. However, signs indicate the disease process of Nosema has changed, and the disease arises now all year round. The investigation of 131 bee colonies from BavariaZohni, Dalia: Zur Epidemiologie arthropoden√ºbertragener Virosen der Honigbiene, Apis mellifera, in Bayern (translation: About epidemiology arthropode-transmissioned viral diseases of the honey bee, Apis mellifera in Bavaria). M√ºnchen, Germany 2006 (Inaugural- Dissertation at the Tier√§rztlichen Fakult√§t of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich). supports the thesis of a causal participation between bee viruses, which were transferred by arthropods (for instance the Varroa mite), and the periodically arising mass losses of life in the hives. Since only comparatively few of these colonies were afflicted with microsporidians (evidence showed 14.5% of the cases were afflicted with microsporidian spores, with half of the cases by N. apis and/or N. ceranae), a correlation between microsporidian affliction and virus infection could not be determined. The question of whether the colonies were dying rather from the \\"new\\" version of Nosema, which (possibly) possesses a higher pathogenicity, or due to virus diseases connected with Varroa affliction, is controversially continuing to be discussed internationally among scientists and beekeepers. Symptoms The symptoms of Nosema are relatively nonspecific, which makes it difficult to distinguish from other diseases of the honeybee. It arises mostly in the spring after periods of bad weather, although it may also be a winter disease that is only noticed in the spring when beekeepers first inspect their hives. The female worker bees are most strongly afflicted, less so the drones. The queen bee is rarely infected since afflicted bees rarely participate in feeding the queen. The most notable symptom is dysentery. This appears as yellow stripes on the outside of the hive and in severe cases, inside the hive. Bees may be unable to fly (\\"crawling\\") due to disjointed wings. Further symptoms include increased girth of the abdomen, missing sting reflex, and early replacement of the queen. If the queen is infected, her ovaries degenerate and egg production drops due to atrophy of the oocytes, after which she is likely to be superseded. The disease pattern described by Higes et al.. in Spain for N. ceranae is slightly different from that of N. apis. The changes in the digestive system were substantially more serious than with N. apis, related to particularly heavy and spacious cell lesions. Conversely, classical symptoms were missing from N. ceranae, such as diarrhea, crawling, large numbers of dead bees in the apiary, etc. Bees tend to die away from the apiary, which causes a reduction in food gathered and can eventually lead to colony collapse. Ritter (CVUA Freiburg) reported symptoms can arise throughout the year from N. ceranae, in contrast to N. apis. In the winter, some colonies died within a short time and the bees lay dead in the box (in Spain, hives usually remained empty). Whether these features are related to the new form of Nosema cannot be conclusively proven. Transmission Newly emerged bees are always free from infection. Spores must be swallowed by a bee for the infection to be initiated. The most common modes of transmission are fecal- oral and oral-oral, and it has been suggested that Nosema can be transmitted sexually in honey bees. Spores germinate quickly after entering the insect, and the epithelial cells of the ventriculus are infected when the vegetative stage is introduced by way of the hollow polar filament. Once inside a cell, the vegetative stage increases in size and multiplies, effecting an apparent concurrent reduction of RNA synthesis in the host cell. In six to 10 days, the infected host epithelial cells become filled with new spores. Epithelial cells are normally shed into the ventriculus where they burst ‚Äì releasing digestive enzymes. When infected cells are shed similarly, they release 30‚Äì50 million infective spores when they burst. Effects on the hive Nosema spores are spread to other colony members through fecal matter. The disease impairs the digestion of pollen, thereby shortening the life of the bee. A greater proportion of worker bees become infected than drones or queens, probably due to the comb-cleaning activities of young bees in which drones and queens do not participate. Nosema-infected bees do not attend or feed the queen to the same extent as healthy bees, which helps the queen to escape infection. When the queen becomes infected, her ovaries degenerate and her egg-laying capacity is reduced due to atrophy of the oocytes. Queens that become infected by the parasite during the brood-rearing season are superseded by the bees. The seasonal trend of typical infections exhibits low levels during summer, a small peak in autumn, and a slow rise of infection during winter. It is more common during times of confinement - winter and spring. In the spring, the level of infection increases rapidly as brood-rearing starts and while flight possibilities are still limited. Colonies in northern climates are more seriously affected than colonies in the south because of the increased amount of time bees are confined in the hive. Nosema, if left untreated, can cause queen supersedure, winter kills, reduced honey yields, and dwindling populations. Diagnosis Diagnosis is dependent on microscopic examination of the ventricular (midgut) content and/or fecal matter or on PCR analysis of infected tissue. No specific outward sign of disease may be present, although in dissections, the ventriculus often appears whitish and swollen in late stages of infection. The disease is easily detected in samples of whole bees macerated in water. The fluid is examined under a light microscope at 250‚Äì500 x magnification where the characteristic Nosema spores can be observed. Though the spores of N. apis and N. ceranae have slight morphological and ultrastructural differences, they cannot be reliably differentiated via light microscopy. PCR analysis or electron microscopy of spores are the only reliable ways to differentiate between the two types of Nosema infection, given genetic variation and variation in the number of sporular polar filament coils between the two species. Treatment Treatment with the antibiotic Fumidil B (prepared from Aspergillus fumigatus, the causative agent of stonebrood), inhibits the spores reproducing in the ventriculus, but does not kill the spores. A disinfection of the honeycombs and utensils is recommended for an extensive disease outbreak. The spores are sensitive to chemicals such as acetic acid and formaldehyde, and physical radiation: ultrasonic and gamma radiation. Heat treatment in 49 ¬∞C (120 ¬∞F) for 24 hours can be used to kill the spores on contaminated equipment.

They were descended from the sons of sheikhs of the Arab Banu Rabi'ah tribe and princesses of the Beja Hadariba tribe. They gained official control over the region of Aswan, Wadi Allaqi and the frontier zone in the early 11th century when their chief, Abu al-Makarim Hibatallah, captured a major rebel on behalf of the Fatimid authorities. Abu al-Makarim was accorded the title Kanz al-Dawla (Treasure of the State) by Caliph al-Hakim and his successors inherited the title. The Banu Kanz entered into conflict with the Ayyubids in 1174, during which they were defeated and forced to migrate southward into northern Nubia, where they helped accelerate the expansion of Islam in the mostly Christian region. They eventually assumed control of the Nubian Kingdom of Makuria in the early 14th century, but by the early the 15th century, they were supplanted by the Hawwara tribesmen dispatched by the Mamluks to combat the Banu Kanz. Their modern-day descendants are a Sudanese tribe known as the \\"Kunuz\\", who live in the far north of the country. History =Origins= The origins of the Banu al-Kanz lay in the Arab tribal migrations to the Egyptian frontier region with Nubia in the 9th century.Holt 1986, p. 131. The nomadic Arab tribes, of which the largest were the Mudhar, Rabi'ah, Juhaynah and Qays 'Aylan,Baadj 2015, p. 90. moved to the region after the discovery of gold and emerald mines there. The Banu Kanz originated from the Banu Rabi'ah, who moved to Egypt from Arabia during the reign of Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil, between 847 and 861 CE.Lev 1999, p. 101. In 855, Abdullah ibn Abd al-Hamid al-Umari, a Medina native who studied in al-Fustat and Kairouan, emigrated to Aswan, where he sought to profit from the region's gold mines.Baadj 2015, pp. 90‚Äì91. He and his slaves were sheltered by the Mudhar and gradually, he became the latter's eminent sheikh (chieftain). Al-Umari and the Mudhar were driven out of Wadi Allaqi and Aswan by the Rabi'ah and proceeded to set up their encampments and mining colony at al-Shanka, to the east of the Kingdom of Makuria (\\"al- Maqurra\\" in Arabic).Baadj 2015, p. 91. Al-Umari was driven back north to Wadi Allaqi and Aswan by the Nubians of Muqurra in the late 9th century. Thereafter, he gained recognition from the Juhayna, Rabi'ah and Qays 'Aylan as their collective leader. Al-Umari oversaw a huge gold mining enterprise in the region, and the industry financed his own virtual independence in Wadi Allaqi and Aswan. Although he twice defeated the Egyptian army of Ahmad ibn Tulun, the governor of Egypt (r. 868‚Äì884), and forced the latter to cease attempts to subjugate him, al-Umari assassinated by Mudhar tribesmen after suppressing a revolt by Rabi'ah. Following his fall, Arab tribal activity continued to increase in the Eastern Desert region. The Rabi'ah emerged as the strongest of the Arab tribes inhabiting the Egyptian-Nubian frontier region. By the 10th century, they were running a principality that replaced that of al-Umari's. The Rabi'ah was able to grow powerful because of their alliance with the indigenous Beja people, namely the Muslim Hadariba tribe, which controlled the region between the Red Sea coastline and the eastern banks of the Nile River. The alliance manifested in business partnerships in the mining industry and intermarriage, including between the chiefs of the two tribes. The sons of Rabi'ah father and Hadariba mothers inherited the lands and titles of their maternal grandparents since Beja inheritance prioritized descent from the mother. Thus, by 943, Ishaq ibn Bishr, who was born to a Rabi'ah father, became the chief of the Rabi'ah-Hadariba principality after succeeding his maternal Beja uncles Abdak and Kawk. According to the 14th-century Arab historian Ibn Fadlallah al-Umari, the Rab'iah and Beja \\"became like one\\" during Ishaq's reign. The latter was killed during an intra-tribal war in Wadi Allaqi, and was succeeded by a paternal cousin from Bilbays, Abu Yazid ibn Ishaq.Baadj 2015, p. 92. Abu Yazid established Aswan as the principality's capital and was recognized by the Fatimid Caliphate, which controlled Upper Egypt, as the \\"protector of Aswan\\". =Kanz al-Dawla and integration into the Fatimid state= In 1006, Abu Yazid's son and successor, Abu al-Makarim Hibatallah, was given the title of Kanz al-Dawla (Treasure of the State) by Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi Amr Allah as an honorary reward for capturing the anti-Fatimid rebel Abu Rakwa. Thenceforth, Abu al-Makarim's successors inherited the Kanz al-Dawla title, while the mixed Rabi'ah-Hadariba people of their principality became known as the \\"Banu Kanz\\" (also spelled Banu'l Kanz, Banu al-Kanz or Kunuz).Holt 1986, pp. 131‚Äì132. The principality of the Banu Kanz included the countryside of Aswan to the north, the frontier with Nubia to the south and most of the Eastern Desert between Aswan and the Red Sea. This put the Banu Kanz in control of Wadi Allaqi's mines, the routes connecting the mines to Aswan and the Red Sea port town of Aydhab and the trade between Nubia and Egypt. Altogether, this enabled the Banu Kanz to derive substantial wealth and influence. Despite their power, the Banu Kanz were not independent from the Fatimid state and the Kanz al-Dawla, who reported to the Fatimid governor of Qus, benefited from the integral role he played within the Fatimid system.Baadj 2015, p. 93. The caliphs accorded the Kanz al-Dawla responsibility for regulating Fatimid diplomatic ties and commerce with Nubia, tax collection in the frontier villages, protecting the mines of Wadi Allaqi and travelers and caravans passing through the principality. The Maris-based Nubian counterparts of the Kanz al-Dawla played a similar role and also belonged to a minor branch of the Rabi'ah-Hadariba confederation. =Conflict with the Ayyubids= In 1168, the Banu Kanz provided safe haven to the disbanded black African regiments of the Fatimid army by the influential aides of Caliph al-Adid, Shirkuh and his nephew Saladin.Baadj 2015, p. 106. Saladin toppled al-Adid in 1171 and established the Ayyubid Sultanate in Egypt. In 1171/72, the Nubian army, together with the Fatimids' former black African contingents, attempted to occupy Upper Egypt and sacked Aswan, prompting the Kanz al-Dawla to request military assistance from Saladin, to which he complied.Baadj 105, p. 105. The Ayyubids and the Banu Kanz drove out the Nubians and the Fatimid rebel army units from Upper Egypt. Although the Ayyubids helped the Banu Kanz in repelling the Nubian invasion, their rule also saw the rise of a Syrian Turco-Kurdish military elite in Egypt at the expense of the Arab tribes and African regiments, both of which the Fatimids had maintained close ties with and at one point governed Egypt.Baadj 2015, pp. 105‚Äì106. Accordingly, the Banu Kanz and the Arab tribes of Upper Egypt felt that their iqta (fiefs) and official privileges were threatened by the new Ayyubid order. When Saladin transferred the iqta of the Banu Kanz to an Ayyubid emir (a brother of senior Ayyubid emir Abu al-Hayja al-Samin), the Banu Kanz killed the emir and his retinue. In 1174, Ibn al- Mutawwaj, the Kanz al-Dawla, launched an insurrection against the Ayyubids to restore the Fatimids. He gained the support of other Arab tribes in the region and the African regiments and sought to join the revolt of Abbas ibn Shadi, the leader of the Arab tribes in Middle Egypt. Before the Banu Kanz could link with Abbas, Saladin's forces under Abu al-Hayja's command defeated and killed Abbas.Baadj 2015, p. 107. The Ayyubid army proceeded to confront the Banu Kanz, who were defeated after major clashes in Aswan. Ibn al-Mutawwaj was eventually captured and executed in the aftermath of his army's defeat. The expulsion of the Banu Kanz from the frontier zone around Aswan caused the area's neglect, including the greatly reduced exploitation of the mines and the increased vulnerability of travelers and caravans to Bedouin raids, due to the absence of the Banu Kanz, the region's traditional guardians.Baadj 2015, p. 108. With the loss of their capital, the Banu Kanz migrated south to occupy Maris, where Nubian control of the region had been significantly diminished due to the Ayyubid punitive expedition in 1172. While the Banu Kanz assimilated into the Nubian culture and language, their way of life remained Islamic. The presence of the Banu Kanz in Maris significantly contributed to the spread of Islam and the Arabic language in Nubia. =Domination of Makuria and relations with the Mamluks= In 1317, the Mamluk sultan an-Nasir Muhammad (the Mamluks succeeded the Ayyubids in Egypt in 1250) maneuvered to install a puppet Muslim pretender, Barshanbu, as king of Christian Makuria, to replace King Karanbas.Holt 1986, p. 135. The latter sought to avoid his deposition by sending an-Nasir Muhammad the Kanz al-Dawla, who was a nephew of Karanbas, as a potential Muslim replacement instead of Barshanbu. Karanbas viewed the Kanz al-Dawla as more tolerable and potentially cooperative than Barshanbu. However, the Kanz al-Dawla was arrested by the Mamluks upon his arrival to Cairo and the Mamluks successfully installed Barshanbu as king. The latter subsequently made Islam the religion of Makuria. The Kanz al-Dawla was released shortly thereafter and usurped the throne, prompting an-Nasir Muhammad to launch two unsuccessful expeditions against the Banu Kanz (the last occurring in 1324), and the Kanz al-Dawla held onto the Makurian throne. During the reign of Sultan al-Ashraf Sha'ban and regent Yalbugha al-Umari, the Banu Kanz and their Arab ally, the Banu Ikrima, were in control of the region between the Red Sea ports of Aydhab and Suakin in the east and the Nile River banks to the west. The Mamluks sent an expedition against the Banu Kanz and Banu Ikrima after Dongola was captured by the tribesmen and its king killed.Holt 1986, pp. 135‚Äì136. The Kanz al-Dawla and other Banu Kanz chiefs surrendered to the Mamluk governor of Qus in December 1365. In 1366, the Banu Kanz attacked Aswan and in 1370 they attacked and burned the city again. They were defeated in a military expedition by Ibn Hassan, the governor of Aswan, in 1378. During the reign of Sultan Barquq, the latter dispatched the Berber tribesmen of the Hawwara confederation to Upper Egypt and the frontier region to counter the Banu Kanz.Holt 1986, p. 136. The Hawwara gradually replaced the Banu Kanz as the dominant force in the region. The modern tribal descendants of the Banu Kanz are known as the \\"Kunuz\\" and they inhabit the northern reaches of Sudan.Holt 1986, p. 132.

Colona and Green Rock were separate communities, but in 1997, became the first communities in Illinois to merge. Route 84 curves to the west, becomes a four- lane road, and crosses the Rock River into Rock Island County. Near the TPC at Deere Run golf course, the route turns to the north towards Carbon Cliff. It curves gently to the northwest where it meets the Route 5 and Route 92 expressway at a partial cloverleaf interchange. Route 92 joins Route 84 and they travel together through Silvis for before Route 84 splits off to the north in East Moline. Route 84 near Rapids City Continuing north, IL 84 is now following the Great River Road. It passes Campbell's Island and passes through Hampton. Southeast of Rapids City is the interchange with Interstate 80. Due to the proximity of the Mississippi River, the interchange is a partial cloverleaf, as a diamond interchange would extend over the river. The route follows the bend in the river north through Rapids City and Port Byron. North of Port Byron, IL 84 travels to the north-northeast towards Cordova. north of Cordova, the highway separates the Cordova Dragway Park to the east and the Quad Cities Nuclear Generating Station, operated by Exelon, to the west. Between the nuclear plant and Albany lies a small industrial area bordered by the Mississippi River. Across the road lies irrigated crop land of Rock Island and Whiteside Counties.  History  Galena. This bridge is part of the Illinois Route 84 / U.S. Highway 20 route. In 1924, SBI Route 84 was originally what is now Illinois Route 92, Illinois Route 192 and Illinois Route 94 from near Muscatine, Iowa to U.S. Route 67. This was dropped in 1939. In 1955, Illinois 84 was applied on a former alignment of U.S. Route 6. In 1964, Illinois 84 arrived at its current terminus, replacing then Illinois Route 80 north to Galena due to construction of Interstate 80 through the Quad Cities.

During the summer, it is replaced with an Arctic Low, or if it moves over continental land, a North American Low.  Description  North American Highs move eastward across the continent, often in the company of one or more low-pressure cells or cyclones. Its cold, dense air does not extend usually above , lower than the Canadian Rockies. Sometimes, during the winter, it breaks free and passes over the Rockies, and brings a cold front into Southwestern United States and Mexico, freezing crops and bringing snow into Mexico's mountains, as far south as Jalisco. The high's usual location east of the Rockies shelters it from the relatively warm Pacific Ocean and helps it maintain its strength. The average January sea level pressure at its centre is about 1,020 millibars (30.12 inches of mercury). The Canadian high often moves southeastward until it eventually reaches the Atlantic Ocean, where it merges with the Azores high. In the summer the Canadian high circulates cool, dry air to the United States east of the Rockies and parts of southern Canada. The North American High is akin to the Siberian High of Eurasia, but it is much smaller, and it has much less influence, merely affecting the weather of the Northern Hemisphere. The sea- level pressure (atmospheric pressure) rarely, if ever, exceeds 1055.0 millibars (1055.0 hectopascals)(hPa)(SI). Often, in the winter months, cool or cold dry air settles over the land in the vicinity of the Great Basin where it builds into a high-pressure cell or anticyclone that moves across the United States with a cold front on its leading edge. After reaching the Atlantic Ocean, the moist environment brings on changes of the qualities of the air and the dissipation of the high-pressure cell or anticyclone as the cold air warms and becomes humid.

It runs from U.S. Route 52 (US 52) in downtown Dixon to US 12/US 20/US 45 (Mannheim Road) in Westchester. It runs concurrently with the Lincoln Highway between Dixon and the junction of Illinois Route 31 in Geneva where it transitions via State Street onto Roosevelt Road at the junction of Kirk Road and continues through the western suburbs to its terminus at the junction of Mannheim Road. Roosevelt Road continues on an additional 14 miles without a route designation until terminating at US 41 (Lake Shore Drive). Illinois Route 38 travels along the former route of US 330, that existed from 1926 to 1942. It spanned from Galt to Lynwood.  Route description  Glen Ellynalt=left Illinois 38 runs along the historic Lincoln Highway for much of its length, and parallels Interstate 88 as well. Illinois 38 serves some cities that have no interchanges on Interstate 88. It enters the Chicago metropolitan area at Elburn, as this border is pushed west with the extension of the Metra rail system. Except in cities, Illinois 38 has two lanes west of Geneva. Illinois 38 generally has two lanes west of the Fox River, except in cities, and four lanes east of the river. From Villa Park to Interstate 294, Illinois 38 expands to six lanes and becomes a limited-access freeway with exits to Illinois Route 56, Illinois Route 83, Interstate 290 and Interstate 294. The ramp to Interstate 290 has an automated gate system that closes during high-volume periods, such as rush hours.  History  SBI Route 38 initially ran between Kampsville and Jerseyville. In the late 1930s, IL 38's western terminus was truncated as IL 100 was extended south of Kampsville while its eastern terminus was extended to Mount Clare. By 1941, the original route of IL 38 was decommissioned and was replaced by IL 16, IL 112, and IL 138. It remained decommissioned until 1972 when Alt US 30 was partly replaced with Illinois Route 38 while the rest was removed. In 1914, one mile of a road near Malta, Illinois was paved with concrete. This was the first \\"Seedling Mile\\" of the concrete road on the Lincoln Highway. Seedling Miles were constructed on several portions of the Lincoln Highway to encourage the paving of the highway from coast to coast. The Lincoln Highway was routed along modern-day Route 38 between Geneva and Dixon. When numbered US Highways began to replace named cross-country roads (like US 30 for the Lincoln Highway), this stretch of highway was signed as Alternate US 30. In 1972, as traffic patterns shifted, these alternates to US highways became unnecessary and fell out of favor. = U.S. Route 330 = U.S. Route 330 (US 330) was a U.S. Highway that traveled from Galt to Lynwood, and was in service from 1926 to 1942.

US 330 branched off at Geneva, where US 30 ran along present Illinois Route 38 and Illinois Route 31, and ran east to Chicago.

Biography  The second son of a prominent boyar Nikita Romanovich, Feodor was born in Moscow and was the first to bear the Romanov surname. During the reign of his first cousin Feodor I (1584‚Äì1598), young Feodor Romanov distinguished himself both as a soldier and a diplomat, fighting against the forces of John III of Sweden in 1590, and conducting negotiations with the ambassadors of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor from 1593 to 1594. He was made a Boyar in 1583. On the death of the childless tsar, he was the popular candidate for the vacant throne; but he acquiesced in the election of Boris Godunov, and shared the disgrace of his too-powerful family three years later, when Boris compelled both him and his wife, Xenia Shestova, to take monastic vows under the names of Filaret and Martha respectively. Filaret was kept in the strictest confinement in the Antoniev Monastery of the Russian North, where he was exposed to every conceivable indignity; but when the False Dmitriy I overthrew the Godunovs, he released Filaret and made him metropolitan of Rostov (1605). Patriarch Filaret of Moscow. A 19th-century hand-drawn lubok. =Patriarch of Moscow= In 1609 Filaret fell into the hands of False Dmitriy II, who named him Patriarch of all Russia, though his jurisdiction only extended over the very limited area which acknowledged the impostor. From 1610 to 1618 he was a prisoner in the hands of the Polish king, Sigismund III Vasa, whom he refused to acknowledge as tsar of Muscovy on being sent on an embassy to the Polish camp in 1610. He was released on the conclusion of the truce of Deulino (13 February 1619), and on 24 June of the same year was canonically enthroned Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia. Thenceforth, until his death, the established government of Muscovy was a diarchy. From 1619 to 1633 there were two actual sovereigns, Tsar Michael and his father, the most holy Patriarch Filaret. Theoretically they were co- regents, but Filaret frequently transacted affairs of state without consulting the tsar. He replenished the treasury by a more equable and rational system of assessing and collecting the taxes. His most important domestic measure was the chaining of the peasantry to the soil, a measure directed against the ever-increasing migration of the down-trodden serfs to the steppes, where they became freebooters instead of taxpayers. The taxation of the tsar's military tenants was a first step towards the proportional taxation of the hitherto privileged classes. Filaret's zeal for the purity of orthodoxy sometimes led him into excesses but he encouraged the publication of theological works, formed the nucleus of the subsequently famous Patriarchal Library, and commanded that every archbishop should establish a seminary for the clergy, himself setting the example. Another great service rendered by Filaret to his country was the reorganization of the Muscovite army with the help of foreign officers. His death in October 1633 put an end to the Russo-Polish War (1632‚Äì33), withdrawing the strongest prop from a tsar feeble enough even when supported by all the weight of his authority. Exercising the rights of a sovereign, Filaret issued a royal decree in May 1625 which gave the patriarch the right to judge and oversee the clerical and peasant populations of the patriarchate in all matters except for theft and robbery. Thus, under Filaret the patriarchate ultimately developed into a state within a state. While the administration of the patriarchate became more structured, it also became significantly more complex. The patriarchate's administration was divided into the following departments: the Judicial (–°—É–¥–Ω—ã–π) department which oversaw legal affairs; the Ecclesiastical (–¶–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤–Ω—ã–π) department which oversaw matters regarding parishes; the Treasury (–ö–∞–∑–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π) department which oversaw tax collections from the clergy; and the Palace (–î–≤–æ—Ä—Ü–æ–≤—ã–π) department which managed the economic matters on the patriarchal estates. Each department was headed by a patriarchal boyar (a member of the highest rank of the Russian aristocracy) and staffed with clerks and scribes. The patriarch personally received and signed reports. Filaret also ordered a full inventory of church and monastery property as well as a review of the land grants issued to the monasteries. In 1620 the new Diocese of Tobolsk was created. In 1625 as a gift from the king of Persia, Filaret received a piece of the supposed Seamless Robe of Jesus. This relic was placed in a shrine in the Kremlin's Assumption Cathedral, and today is kept in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow. Legacy The patriarch was instrumental in the establishment of the Romanov dynasty through his use of ostentatious ceremonies and architectural projects which succeeded in underlining the importance of the Crown. Due to the Thirty Years War, mercenaries were common, so he hired English and Scottish officers to modernize the army, helping to push Russia into the modern age.Sebag Monterfiore (2016), p. 33-34 Issue Filaret's marriage to Xenia Shestova produced six children, of whom two survived into adulthood: # Tatyana (d. 1612), married Prince Ivan Mikhailovich Katyrev-Rostovsky, no issue # Boris (b. 1592, died in infancy) # Nikita (b. 1593, died in infancy) # Michael (1596-1645), first tsar of Russia from the House of Romanov # Lev (b. 1597, died in infancy) # Ivan (b. 1599, died in infancy) References Sources *Sebag Montefiore, Simon.

It is located in Sandton, Johannesburg, South Africa, after it moved from downtown Johannesburg in 2000. In 2003 the JSE had an estimated 473 listed companies and a market capitalisation of US$182.6 billion (‚Ç¨158 billion), as well as an average monthly traded value of US$6.399 billion (‚Ç¨5.5 billion). As of 31 December 2013, the market capitalisation of the JSE was at US$1,007 billion. History The discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand in 1886 led to many mining and financial companies opening and a need soon arose for a stock exchange. The first share transactions on the Rand took place in a rustic canvas tent, with trade taking place on Sundays, as this was the only day when mining was not allowed, owing to a strictly enforced regulation prohibiting the entry of African workers to the gold reefs. Benjamin Minors Wollan The Johannesburg Exchange & Chambers Company was established by a London businessman, Benjamin Minors Woollan and housed at the corner of Commissioner and Simmonds Streets. Out of this the JSE was born on 8 November 1887. What immediately gave the JSE a clear advantage over exchanges such as Kimberley, Barberton, and, most importantly, London, was that listing of companies for a quotation on the Official List of the JSE was an easy and relatively cheap procedure. This relatively simple and non-restricting nature of the early Exchange promoted a wave of initial registrations on the Official List, with 68 companies by the end of November 1887. The Official List further expanded to more than 300 companies by the end of January 1890. By 1890 the trading hall became too small and had to be rebuilt but this too was outgrown. Trading then moved into the street. The Mining Commissioner closed off Simmonds Street between Market Square and Commissioner Street by means of chains. In 1903, a new building was built for the JSE on Hollard Street. It was a storey building that took up an entire whole city block bounded by Fox and Main, Hollard and Sauer Streets. After World War II, it became apparent that this building was again inadequate and in 1947 the decision was made to rebuild the stock exchange. It took 11 years before construction began and in February 1961 the second exchange at Hollard Street was officially opened. By 1963, the JSE became a member of the Federation International Bourses de Valeurs (FIBV). In 1978, the JSE took up residence at 17 Diagonal Street near Kerk Street, Johannesburg. 1993 saw the JSE become an active member of the African Stock Exchanges Association. After 108 years, the open outcry system of trading was changed to an electronic system on 7 June 1996. In September 2000, the Johannesburg Securities Exchange moved to its present location in Sandton, Gauteng at the corner of Maude Street and Gwen Lane. It adopted the JSE Securities Exchange as its new official name. In 2001 an agreement was struck with the London Stock Exchange enabling cross-dealing between the two bourses and replacing the JSE's trading system with that of the LSE. In 2009 the JSE acquired the Bond Exchange of South Africa for R240 million and rebranded it the JSE debt market adding South African government and corporate bonds as well as interest rate derivatives to its product set. On 18 June 2012, the JSE became a founding member of the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges initiative on the eve of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). 153x111pxOn 14 April 2014, the JSE re-branded to demonstrates the bourse's identity as a modern African marketplace that connects investors to growth opportunities not only in South Africa but globally. About the JSE The JSE provides a market where securities can be traded freely under a regulated procedure. It not only channels funds into the economy, but also provides investors with returns on investments in the form of dividends.The Johannesburg Exchange in 1893 The exchange successfully fulfils its main function‚Äîthe raising of primary capital‚Äîby rechannelling cash resources into productive economic activity, thus building the economy while enhancing job opportunities and wealth creation. The exchange is directed by an honorary committee of 16 people, all with full voting rights. The elected stockbroking members, who cannot number less than eight or more than eleven, may appoint an executive president and five outside members to the committee. Policy decisions are made by the committee and carried out by a full-time executive committee headed by the executive president. The JSE is governed by its members but through their use of JSE services and facilities, these members are also customers of the Exchange. Each year the JSE must apply to the Minister of Finance for an operating license which vests external control of the exchange in the FSB. =JSE TradElect= The JSE's fully automated (electronic trading) trading system is called the Millennium Exchange, which replaced the JSE TradElect system in 2012, which in turn had replaced the JSE SETS system in April 2007, which had replaced the JSE JET system in May 2002. The change to the Millennium Exchange involved moving the platform from London to a new platform housed in the JSE building in Johannesburg, thus speeding up the execution of transactions. The JSE operates an order-driven, central order book trading system with opening, intra-day and closing auctions. =Sens= In August 1997, the JSE launched the real-time Stock Exchange News Service (Sens) to enhance market transparency and investor confidence. Initially, it was optional for listed companies to use the service during its two-month trial period. From 15 October, augmented JSE listing requirements oblige companies to disseminate any corporate news or price-sensitive information on the service prior to using any other media outlet. Sens is carried by all the major wire services. =Strate= Since its inception over ten years ago, Strate (Pty) Ltd has become the licensed South Africa's Central Securities Depository (CSD) for the electronic settlement of financial instruments in South Africa. Strate's stated core purpose is to mitigate risk, bring efficiencies to South African financial markets and improve its profile as an investment destination. Strate handles the settlement of a number of securities, including equities and bonds for the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), as well as a range of derivative products such as warrants, exchange- traded funds (ETFs), retail notes and tracker funds. It has now added the settlement of money market securities to its portfolio of services. It provides services to issuers for their investors in terms of the Companies Act and Securities Services Act (SSA), 2004.

It was commissioned by the Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein, who lost his right arm during World War I. The Concerto had its premiere in January 1932, with Wittgenstein as soloist performing with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. Composition and premiere The piece was commissioned by Paul Wittgenstein, a concert pianist who had lost his right arm in the First World War. Paul Wittgenstein at the piano In preparing for composition, Ravel studied several pieces written for one-handed piano, including Camille Saint-Sa√´ns's Six √âtudes pour la main gauche (Six √âtudes for the Left Hand) (Op. 135), Leopold Godowsky's transcription for the left hand of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's Etudes (Opp. 10 and 25), Carl Czerny's Ecole de la main gauche (School of the Left Hand) (Op. 399), 24 √©tudes pour la main gauche (Op. 719), Charles-Valentin Alkan's (Op. 76 No. 1), and Alexander Scriabin's Prelude and Nocturne for the Left Hand (Op. 9). Wittgenstein gave the premiere with Robert Heger and the Vienna Symphony Orchestra on 5 January 1932; Ravel had first offered the premiere to Arturo Toscanini, who declined. The first French pianist to perform the work was Jacques F√©vrier, chosen by Ravel. Structure Ravel is quoted in one source as saying that the piece is in only one movement and in another as saying the piece is divided into two movements linked together. According to Marie-No√´lle Masson, the piece has a tripartite structure: slow‚Äìfast‚Äìslow, instead of the usual fast‚Äìslow‚Äìfast. Whatever the internal structure may be, the 18‚Äì19 minute piece negotiates several sections in various tempi and keys without pause. Towards the end of the piece, some of the music of the early slow sections is overlaid with the faster music, so that two tempi occur simultaneously. The concerto begins with the double basses softly arpeggiating an ambiguous harmony (E-A-D-G) being the background to an unusual solo of the contrabassoon. Although these notes are later given great structural weight, they are also the four open strings on the double bass, creating the illusion at the start that the orchestra is still tuning up. As is traditional in a concerto, the thematic material is presented first in the orchestra and then echoed by the piano. Not so traditional is the dramatic piano cadenza which first introduces the soloist and prefigures the piano's statement of the opening material. This material includes both an A and a B theme, though the B theme receives little exposure. An additional theme introduced at the beginning exhibits several similarities to the Dies Irae chant. An excerpt from the faster section, sometimes referenced as the scherzo, is shown in the following example. :\\\\version \\"2.14.1\\" \\\\relative c { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 184 \\\\set Score.markFormatter = #format- mark-box-numbers \\\\mark #32 \\\\time 6/8 e8^\\"Pno.\\"\\\\p a b cis dis b cis8 r b dis r b cis8 r b dis dis b cis8 r b dis r b } ew Staff { \\\\time 6/8 \\\\set Staff.timeSignatureFraction = 2/4 \\\\scaleDurations 3/2 { r8 g,4.~^\\"Trbn.\\"_\\\\markup{\\\\dynamic{mf} \\\\italic{expressivo}}-> g bes8~ bes4 a~ a8 g4. } } ew Staff { \\\\time 6/8 \\\\clef bass 8 r r r r 8 r r r r 8 r r r r 8 r r r r } >> } Throughout the piece, Ravel creates ambiguity between triple and duple rhythms. This example highlights one of the more notable instances of this. The concerto is scored for a large orchestra consisting of piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, piccolo clarinet (in E), 2 clarinets (in A), bass clarinet (in A), 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, snare drum, cymbals, bass drum, wood block, tam-tam, harp, strings, and the solo piano. Reception and legacy Although at first Wittgenstein did not take to its jazz-influenced rhythms and harmonies, he grew to like the piece. When Ravel first heard him play the concerto at a private concert in the French embassy in Vienna, he was furious. 'He heard lines taken from the orchestral part and added to the solo, harmonies changed, parts added, bars cut and at the end a newly created series of great swirling arpeggios in the final cadenza. The composer was beside himself with indignation and disbelief.' Later Wittgenstein agreed to perform the concerto as written, and the two men patched up their differences, 'but the whole episode left a bitter taste in both their mouths'.Waugh, Alexander. The House of Wittgenstein, p184-186 In May 1930 Ravel had had a major disagreement with Arturo Toscanini over the correct tempo for Bol√©ro (he conducted it too fast for Ravel's liking, who said he should play it at the slower speed he had in mind, or not at all). In September, Ravel patched up the relationship and invited Toscanini to conduct the world premiere of the Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, but the conductor declined.English translation and facsimile of French original in Even before the premiere, in 1931 Alfred Cortot made an arrangement for piano two-hands and orchestra; however, Ravel did not approve of it and forbade its publication or performance. Cortot ignored this and played his arrangement, which caused Ravel to write to many conductors imploring them not to engage Cortot to play his concerto. After Ravel's death in 1937, Cortot resumed playing his arrangement, and even recorded it with Charles Munch leading the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra.

Crime mapping is used by analysts in law enforcement agencies to map, visualize, and analyze crime incident patterns. It is a key component of crime analysis and the CompStat policing strategy. Mapping crime, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), allows crime analysts to identify crime hot spots, along with other trends and patterns. Overview Using GIS, crime analysts can overlay other datasets such as census demographics, locations of pawn shops, schools, etc., to better understand the underlying causes of crime and help law enforcement administrators to devise strategies to deal with the problem. GIS is also useful for law enforcement operations, such as allocating police officers and dispatching to emergencies. Underlying theories that help explain spatial behavior of criminals include environmental criminology, which was devised in the 1980s by Patricia and Paul Brantingham, routine activity theory, developed by Lawrence Cohen and Marcus Felson and originally published in 1979, and rational choice theory, developed by Ronald V. Clarke and Derek Cornish, originally published in 1986. In recent years, crime mapping and analysis has incorporated spatial data analysis techniques that add statistical rigor and address inherent limitations of spatial data, including spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity. Spatial data analysis helps one analyze crime data and better understand why and not just where crime is occurring. Research into computer-based crime mapping started in 1986, when the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) funded a project in the Chicago Police Department to explore crime mapping as an adjunct to community policing. That project was carried out by the CPD in conjunction with the Chicago Alliance for Neighborhood Safety, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Northwestern University, reported on in the book, Mapping Crime in Its Community Setting: Event Geography Analysis. The success of this project prompted NIJ to initiate the Drug Market Analysis Program (with the appropriate acronym D-MAP) in five cities, and the techniques these efforts developed led to the spread of crime mapping throughout the US and elsewhere, including the New York City Police Department's CompStat. Applications Crime analysts use crime mapping and analysis to help law enforcement management (e.g. the police chief) to make better decisions, target resources, and formulate strategies, as well as for tactical analysis (e.g. crime forecasting, geographic profiling). New York City does this through the CompStat approach, though that way of thinking deals more with the short term. There are other, related approaches with terms including Information-led policing, Intelligence-led policing, Problem-oriented policing, and Community policing. In some law enforcement agencies, crime analysts work in civilian positions, while in other agencies, crime analysts are sworn officers. From a research and policy perspective, crime mapping is used to understand patterns of incarceration and recidivism, help target resources and programs, evaluate crime prevention or crime reduction programs (e.g. Project Safe Neighborhoods, Weed & Seed and as proposed in Fixing Broken Windows), and further understanding of causes of crime. The boom of internet technologies, particularly web-based geographic information system (GIS) technologies, is opening new opportunities for use of crime mapping to support crime prevention. Research indicates that the functions provided in web-based crime mapping are less than in most traditional crime mapping software. In conclusion, existing works of web-based crime mapping focus on supporting community policing rather than analytical functions such as pattern analysis and prediction.

Gas found in an oil well is generally called associated gas rather than stranded gas but some flared gases from oil wells are stranded gases that are unusable due to economic reasons. Economically stranded gas A volume of gas can be economically stranded for one of two reasons: *The resource may be too remote from a market for natural gas, making construction of a pipeline prohibitively expensive. *The resource may be in a region where demand for gas is saturated, and the cost of exporting gas beyond this region is excessive. Such a reserve is likely to be tapped in the future when existing sources begin to deplete. Physically stranded gas A gas field that is too deep to drill for, or is beneath an obstruction, may be considered physically stranded. Continuous development of drilling technology provides access to many difficult-to-access fields. Examples of stranded gas =Alaska= Alaska has a large resource of natural gas stranded in its Prudhoe Bay oil field. The largest gas plant in the United States exists there exclusively to reinject the associated gas into the oil fields. Marketing of the gas awaits the completion of the Alaska gas pipeline to carry it to the lower 48 states. Building of the pipeline has been delayed by the availability of low-cost natural gas in Canada and development of non-conventional gas fields in the lower 48 states, as well as political considerations. =Canada= Canada has a large amount of stranded gas in its Arctic Islands, Beaufort Sea, and Mackenzie Delta. Marketing of this gas would require completion of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline to bring it south along the Mackenzie River. Some companies would like to combine it with Alaska gas by building a pipeline offshore in the Arctic Ocean from Alaska to the Mackenzie Delta. The government of Alaska is resisting such option because it would prefer to bring the gas first to southern Alaska, and then transport it across the Yukon along the Alaska Highway. In either case, the pipeline would feed into the continental distribution system in northern Alberta. =Russia= Russia, which has the world's largest natural gas reserves, has much natural gas stranded in Siberia. In some cases, the easiest way to bring it to market would be by sending it through a pipeline across the Bering Strait, and then feeding it into the proposed Alaska gas pipeline. Other options include moving it south to China, or west to Europe. Another alternative would be to build liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals at Siberian ports, where it could be shipped to any port in the world with an LNG regasification terminal.

The title is taken from a scientific term once used to describe the tendency of chemical species to combine with certain substances or species in preference to others. The novel is based on the metaphor of human passions being governed or regulated by the laws of chemical affinity, and examines whether or not the science and laws of chemistry undermine or uphold the institution of marriage, as well as other human social relations. Plot The book is situated around the city of Weimar. Goethe's main characters are Eduard and Charlotte, an aristocratic couple both in their second marriage, enjoying an idyllic but semi-dull life on the grounds of their rural estate. They invite the Captain, Eduard's childhood friend, and Ottilie, the beautiful, orphaned, coming-of-age niece of Charlotte, to live with them. The decision to invite Ottilie and the Captain is described as an \\"experiment\\" and this is exactly what it is. The house and its surrounding gardens are described as \\"a chemical retort in which the human elements are brought together for the reader to observe the resulting reaction.\\"Oxford University Press. (2006). Book Review of Goethe's Elective Affinities.Smith, Peter, D. (2001). Elective Affinities . Abstract from the article that appears in Prometheus 04. Theory Elective Affinities is supposed to be the first work to model human relationships as chemical reactions or chemical processes since the aphorism of the classical Greek philosopher Empedocles: \\"people who love each other mix like water and wine; people who hate each other segregate like water and oil.\\"Adler, Jeremy. (1990). \\"Goethe's Use of Chemical Theory in his Elective Affinities\\" (ch. 18, pgs. 263-79) in Romanticism and the Sciences, edited by Andrew Cunningham and Nicholas Jardine, New York: Cambridge University Press. The term \\"elective affinities\\" is based on the older notion of chemical affinities. In the late 19th century, German sociologist Max Weber, who had read the works of Goethe at the age of 14, used Goethe's conception of human \\"elective affinities\\" to formulate a large part of sociology.Herbert, Richard, H. (1978). \\"Max Weber's Elective Affinities: Sociology within the Bounds of Pure Reason\\", American Journal of Sociology, 84, 366‚Äì85.McKinnon, A.M. (2010) \\"Elective affinities of the Protestant ethic: Weber and the chemistry of capitalism.\\" Sociological Theory, vol 28, no. 1, pp. 108-126. In early nineteenth century chemistry, the phrase \\"elective affinities\\" or chemical affinities was used to describe compounds that only interacted with each other under select circumstances. Goethe used this as an organizing metaphor for marriage, and for the conflict between responsibility and passion. In the book, people are described as chemical species whose amorous affairs and relationships were pre-determined via chemical affinities similar to the pairings of alchemical species. Goethe outlined the view that passion, marriage, conflict, and free will are all subject to the laws of chemistry and in which the lives of human species are regulated no differently from the lives of chemical species.Constantine, David. (1994). Translation, Introduction, and Notes to Oxford World Classics (translation of Goethe's Elective Affinities). Oxford University Press. According to Belgian chemical engineer Ilya Prigogine, \\"B.J. Dobbs, The Foundation of Newton's Alchemy (1975), also examined the role of the \\"mediator\\" by which two substances are made \\"sociable\\"; we may recall here the importance of the mediator in Goethe's Elective Affinities (Engl. trans. Greenwood, 1976). For what concerns chemistry, Goethe was not far from Newton.\\" Opinions over the years have been split as to whether Goethe's theory was used in metaphor.Adler, Jeremy.

In the novella, the central chemical reaction that takes place is a double displacement reaction (double elective affinity), between a married couple Eduard and Charlotte (BA), at the end of their first year of marriage (for each their second marriage), and their two good friends the Captain and Ottilie (CD), respectively. The first marriages, for both Eduard and Charlotte, are described as having been marriages of financial convenience, essentially arranged marriages. Specifically, when they were younger, Eduard was married off to a rich older woman through the workings and insatiable greed of his father; Charlotte, likewise, when her prospects were none the best, was compelled or obliged to marry a wealthy man, whom she did not love. In the fourth chapter, the characters detail the world's first ever verbally- depicted human double displacement chemical reaction. The chapter begins with description of the affinity map (reaction map) or 'topographical chart' as Goethe calls it. On this reaction map, we are told that on it 'the features of the estate and its surroundings were clearly depicted, on quite a large scale, in pen and in different colors, to which the Captain had give a firm basis by taking trigonometrical measurements'. Next, to explain the reaction, we are told: :'provided it does not seem pedantic,' the Captain said, 'I think I can briefly sum up in the language of signs. Imagine an A intimately united with a B, so that no force is able to sunder them; imagine a C likewise related to a D; now bring the two couples into contact: A will throw itself at D, C at B, without our being able to say which first deserted its partner, which first embraced the other's partner.' This is shown below: :AB + CD ‚Üí AD + BC :'Now then!' Eduard interposed: 'until we see all this with our own eyes, let us look on this formula as a metaphor from which we may extract a lesson we can apply immediately to ourselves. You, Charlotte, represent the A, and I represent your B; for in fact I do depend altogether on you and follow you as A is followed by B. The C is quite obviously the Captain, who for the moment is to some extent drawing me away from you. Now it is only fair that, if you are not to vanish into the limitless air, you must be provided with a D, and this D is unquestionably the charming little lady Ottilie, whose approaching presence you may no longer resist.' Noted critical reactions =Astrida Tantillo= In her 2001 book Goethe's Elective Affinities and the Critics, she writes: =Walter Benjamin's essay on The Elective Affinities= This essay by Walter Benjamin, written around 1920-21, was described by Austrian critic Hugo von Hoffmannsthal as \\"absolutely incomparable\\". It is renowned as an exemplary instance of Benjamin subjecting his literary subject matter to a process of intensive dialectical mediation. In the essay, which attacks Goethe's prose style and intentions, Benjamin argues for the possibility of the transcendence of mythic thinking (which he locates in the medium of Goethe's prose) in favour of the possibility of an as yet unencountered (and, in principle, unimaginable) \\"freedom\\". Typically, Benjamin locates this experience in art, which is, according to him, alone able, through mediation, to transcend the powers of myth. Adaptations A 1974 East German film with the same title was directed by Siegfried K√ºhn for the DEFA film studio. Francis Ford Coppola, in the grip of clinical manic depression and anxiety over his incomplete opus Apocalypse Now, and while purportedly under the influence of his girlfriend, screenwriter Melissa Mathison, proposed making a \\"ten-hour film version of Goethe's Elective Affinities, in 3D\\".Peter Biskind. Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, New York: Touchstone, imprint of Simon & Schuster, 1998, 1999, p. 373. . John Banville's 1982 novel The Newton Letter adapts the story to Ireland. A description by Gordon Burgess can be found in German life and letters, April 1992. The 1993 play Arcadia, by British playwright Tom Stoppard, is a modern- day remake of Elective Affinities, albeit with a twist. The play takes place in modern times and 1809, Goethe's time; characters are replaced subtly, e.g. 'The Captain' becomes 'The Naval Captain'; and the chemical affinity becomes updated in the play with discussion on the second law of thermodynamics, chaos theory, and other subjects; albeit the play still holds to the idea that the characters are reactive entities, discussing ideas such as the \\"heat\\" of interactions between the characters. Robin Gordon's 1995 short story \\"Leaves in the Wind\\" adapts the story to modern England, with Edward and Charlotte as an academic couple. In 1996, a film version was made, entitled The Elective Affinities, by director Paolo Taviani. The 2009 film Sometime in August directed by Sebastian Schipper is loosely based on Goethe's novel and transposes the story to modern-day Germany.

This proposed pipeline became known as the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline. The inquiry cost C$5.3 million, and produced over 40,000 pages of text and evidence, comprising 283 volumes. The commission recommended that no pipeline be built through the northern Yukon and that a pipeline through the Mackenzie Valley should be delayed for 10 years. Proceeding The commissioner of the inquiry was Justice Thomas Berger, who heard testimony from diverse groups with an interest in the pipeline. Fourteen groups became full participants in the inquiry, attending all meetings and testifying before the commission. The inquiry was notable for the voice that it gave to the aboriginal people whose traditional territory the pipeline would traverse. Berger travelled extensively in the North in preparation for the hearings. He took his commission to all 35 communities along the Mackenzie River Valley, as well as in other cities across Canada, to gauge public reaction. In his travels he met with aboriginal (Dene, Inuit, M√©tis) and non-aboriginal residents. He held formal hearings in Yellowknife to get the views of experts about the proposal. Following this, he held community hearings across the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, and this played an important role in shaping his views. Findings Berger's report first volume was released on June 9, 1977 and followed with a second volume several months later. Titled Northern Frontier, Northern Homeland, the two-volume report highlighted the fact that while the Mackenzie Valley could be the site of the \\"biggest project in the history of free enterprise,\\" it was also home to many peoples whose lives would be immeasurably changed by the pipeline. =Environmental impact= The Berger Report concluded that the northern Yukon was too susceptible to environmental harm. Berger cautioned that a gas pipeline would be a precursor to an oil pipeline. The energy transportation corridor thus created would require an immense infrastructure of roads, airports, maintenance bases and new settlements to support it. The impact on the ecosystem (both the natural habitat and its people) would be equivalent to building a railway across Canada. The commission even recommended that no energy corridor be built in the Mackenzie Delta region. At the same time, the commission saw no significant environmental risk further south through the Mackenzie Valley. Berger suggested that a number of sanctuaries and protected areas be created for threatened and endangered species, particularly Porcupine caribou, white whales, several bird species, and other animals inhabiting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). =Economic impact= The commission found no significant economic benefit from the pipelines. The report concluded that large-scale projects based on non-renewable energy sources rarely provide long-term employment, and that those locals that did find work during construction could only fill low-skill, low-wage positions. In addition, Berger feared that pipeline development would undermine local economies which relied on hunting, fishing, and trapping, possibly even increasing economic hardship in the area. Berger ultimately found that the economy of the region would not be harmed by not building the pipeline. =Social impact= The commission believed that the pipeline process had not taken native culture seriously and that any development needed to conform to the wishes of those who lived there. Berger predicted that the \\"social consequences of the pipeline will not only be serious--they will be devastating.\\" The commission was particularly concerned about the role of natives in development plans. At the time the report was released, there were several ongoing negotiations over native land claims in the area, and Berger suggested that pipeline construction be delayed until those claims were settled. The commission found that the local population would not accept development activity without some native control. In addition, land claims were part of a broader native rights issues that needed to be settled between the government and the First Nations. In Berger's view, rapid development in the north would preclude settlement of those important issues because of the influx of non-native populations and growing business interests. Recommendations Justice Berger recommended a ten-year moratorium to deal with critical issues, such as settling Aboriginal land claims and setting aside key conservation areas, before attempting to build the proposed pipeline. Initiated in 1999 by Aboriginal leaders from across the Northwest Territories, the Mackenzie Gas Project was the second attempt to build a gas pipeline down the Mackenzie Valley.

A brilliant, feisty and highly skilled small man, Weightman enjoyed an extended career in elite Australian football, despite suffering from diabetes since early adulthood. He overcame doubts about his size and ability to play the game and won many individual awards. Weightman's early football with Mildura Imperials junior teams included competition best and fairest awards at under 15 and under 17 level, as well as three consecutive premierships. At this time, the north west area of Victoria was zoned exclusively to Richmond. The Tigers relocated Weightman to Melbourne in 1977, when he was 17. He enrolled at Melbourne High School and played for the school team, which won the schoolboy \\"Herald Shield\\". These matches were played as curtain raisers to the VFL's Tuesday night series games. Weightman first came under notice in this series. Meanwhile, on Saturdays, he turned out for the Tigers' under 19 side, and played as first rover in the team's victory against Fitzroy in the Grand Final. Weightman was selected for his senior debut in the opening round of 1978, despite some doubts about his lack of size. He played well in a winning team, but quickly found himself back in the reserves when the team's fortune slumped. This was the pattern for his first two seasons before his career turned around in 1980. After several years in the wilderness, Richmond returned to form due to the improvement of a number of young players such as Weightman. He was now sharing the roving duties with West Australian Robert Wiley. The season culminated in a record win over Collingwood in the 1980 Grand Final, when Weightman had twenty possessions. In the post season, he won Victorian selection for the first time.The Age, 13 October 1980, p34 https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ePtUAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=cZIDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6222%2C6558822 NFL rejects Vic. plea on injuries The feature of Weightman's game was his constructive handball. He played well in the losing 1982 VFL Grand Final against Carlton. Weightman represented the Australian state of Victoria, and was state captain in 1987 and 1988 v Western Australia, and against New South Wales in 1990. Overall, he played a total of 20 State of Origin games. It was said he played some of his best football for the State and was one of those rare players - the better the standard the better he would play. His other honours include winning the 1985 Tassie Medal for best player in the State of Origin series and the 1985 Simpson Medal for best player in the Western Australia v Victoria match played in Perth. Weightman is a diabetic, however this has not stopped him from being active, and in 2005, Weightman continued to have an impact in the EJ Whitten Legends Game at the Telstra Dome with competitors that were mostly around five or six years his junior. He also participated in the 2006 match. Weightman continues to be a regular face at the Richmond Football Club, and has been one of the Richmond runners on match day on and off for the past few years.

Ku≈üadasƒ± is south of ƒ∞zmir, and about from Aydƒ±n. The municipality's primary industry is tourism. Geography Kese Daƒüƒ± in central Ku≈üadasƒ± The city is situated along a gulf of the same name in the Aegean. The island of G√ºvercinada (in English: Pigeon Island) is connected to mainland Ku≈üadasƒ± by a man-made causeway, and is situated adjacent to the large hill of Kese Daƒüƒ± near the center of town. It is located south of ƒ∞zmir, the area's metropolitan centre, and approximately in driving distance from the provincial seat of Aydƒ±n, depending on the route taken. Its neighbours are Sel√ßuk to the north, Germencik to the north-east, and S√∂ke to the east and south. Demographics The district of Ku≈üadasƒ± had a total residential population of 116,966 in 2019, though the actual population is thought to rise to well over half a million in the summer months due to a significant influx of both domestic and international tourists as well as those visiting family or returning to their summer residence. This also includes the hotel and bar staff, construction workers, and drivers who are required to work in/for the restaurants and other services accommodating these visitors. In addition to tourists from overseas, there is also a substantial community of foreigners that have permanently settled in the area. History =Etymology= G√ºvercinada (\\"Pigeon Island\\") derives its name in a similar fashion to Ku≈üadasƒ± (\\"Bird Island\\"). The name Ku≈üadasƒ± comes from the Turkish words ku≈ü (bird) and ada (island), as the island has the shape of a bird's head (when seen from the sea). It was known as Ephesus Neopolis (Greek: ) during the Byzantine era, and later as Scala Nova or Scala Nuova under the Genoese and Venetians.artofilo.info Ku≈ü Adasƒ± was adopted in its place at the beginning of the 20th century. Today, the citizens of Ku≈üadasƒ± often shorten the town's name to Ada. =Antiquity= A beach in Ku≈üadasƒ±, with G√ºvercinada island seen in the background, at right. The area has been a centre of art and culture since some of the earliest recorded history, and has been settled by many civilizations since being founded by the Leleges people in 3000 BC. Later settlers include the Aeolians in the 11th century BC and Ionians in the 9th. Originally, seamen and traders built a number of settlements along the coastline, including Neopolis. An outpost of Ephesus in ancient Ionia, known as Pygela (Œ†œçŒ≥ŒµŒªŒ±) was located in the area between the B√ºy√ºk Menderes (Maeander) and Gediz (Hermos) rivers. The original Neopolis, is thought to have been founded on the nearby point of Yƒ±lancƒ± Burnu. Later settlements were probably built on the hillside of Pilavtepe, in the district called Andƒ±zkulesi today. Ku≈üadasƒ± was a minor port frequented by vessels trading along the Aegean coast. In antiquity it was overshadowed by Ephesus, until Ephesus' harbor silted up. From the 7th century BC onwards the coast was ruled by Lydians from their capital at Sardis, then from 546 BC the Persians, and from 334 BC, along with all of Anatolia, the coast was conquered by Alexander the Great. From that point on the coastal cities in Anatolia became a centre of Hellenistic culture. =Rome and Christianity= The Roman Empire took possession of the coast in the 2nd century BC and made it their provincial capitalSt. John - History in the early years of Christianity. Saint John the Evangelist and (according to Roman Catholic sacred tradition) the Virgin Mary both came to live in the area, which in the Christian era became known as \\"Ania\\". As Byzantine, Venetian and Genoese shippers began to trade along the coast, the port was re-founded (by the name of Scala Nova or Scala Nuova, meaning \\"New Port\\"), a garrison was placed on the island, and the town centre shifted from the hillside to the coast. =The Turkish era= Atat√ºrk Memorial in Ku≈üadasƒ± A view of the town center, with the Clock Tower seen on the right. Long afterwards, in 1834, the castle and garrison on the island were rebuilt and expanded, becoming the focus of the town. This was to such an extent that people began to refer to the whole town as Ku≈üadasƒ± (bird island). However, in the 19th century, trade began to decline in favor of other nearby cities with the opening of the ƒ∞zmir-Sel√ßuk-Aydƒ±n railway, which bypassed Ku≈üadasƒ±.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition During the Turkish War of Independence, Ku≈üadasƒ± was occupied from 1919-1922, first by Italian troops between 14 May 1919 and 24 May 1922, and then by Greek troops. The Turkish forces eventually gained control of the city on September 7, 1922. Under the Republic of Turkey, the Greek population was exchanged for Turkish people as part of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1922. It was a district in ƒ∞zmir Province until its transfer to Aydƒ±n Province in 27 June 1957. Economy =Industry= Cruise ships at the port of Ku≈üadasƒ±, which is close to Ephesus and other nearby archaeological sites Ku≈üadasƒ± caters to tourists arriving by land, or from the port for cruise ship passengers heading to Ephesus. In a controversial deal in 2003, the previously public-owned port was leased to a private company and renovated to attract luxury cruise liners. The area features several well- known local beaches, including Ladies Beach, the beach at the centrum, the beaches between the Batƒ±han Hotel and the Nazilli Site, the beach at G√ºzel√ßamlƒ±, and the Dilek Peninsula National Park beach, referred to by locals as simply Milli Park. Transportation Davutlar Beach near Ku≈üadasƒ± There is public transport within the town and to nearby locations via shuttle minibuses (dolmu≈ü). There are bus and taxi services going to the nearby airports in ƒ∞zmir and in Bodrum, Muƒüla Province. Day trips are available by boat from Ku≈üadasƒ± and G√ºzel√ßamlƒ±. The city is a port of call for several cruise ships. The port is linked by a six-lane highway to ƒ∞zmir's Adnan Menderes Airport. Several state roads connect the city to its surrounding districts, such as Germencik and Aydƒ±n. There are daily ferry services to the nearby Greek island of Samos. Ku≈üadasƒ±'s bus station is a transport hub. Coach buses connect the city to various parts of the country.

This article covers plating methods used in the modern electronics industry; for more traditional methods, often used for much larger objects, see gilding.  Types  There are several types of gold plating used in the electronics industry: * Soft, pure gold plating is used in the semiconductor industry. The gold layer is easily soldered and wire bonded. Its Knoop hardness ranges between 60‚Äì85. The plating baths have to be kept free of contamination. * Soft, pure gold is deposited from special electrolytes. Entire printed circuit boards can be plated. This technology can be used for depositing layers suitable for wire bonding. * Bright hard gold on contacts, with Knoop hardness between 120‚Äì300 and purity of 99.7‚Äì99.9% gold. Often contains a small amount of nickel and/or cobalt; these elements interfere with die bonding, therefore the plating baths cannot be used for semiconductors. * Bright hard gold on printed circuit board tabs is deposited using lower concentration of gold in the baths. Usually contains nickel and/or cobalt as well. Edge connectors are often made by controlled-depth immersion of only the edge of the boards. Gold plating chemistry There are five recognized classes of gold plating chemistry: # Alkaline gold cyanide, for gold and gold alloy plating # Neutral gold cyanide, for high-purity plating # Acid gold plating for bright hard gold and gold alloy plating # Non-cyanide, generally sulphite or chloride-based for gold and gold alloy plating # Miscellaneous  Jewelry  Gold plating of silver is used in the manufacture of jewelry. The thickness of gold plating on jewellery is noted in microns (or micro-meters). The microns of thickness determines how long the gold plating lasts with usage. The jewellery industry denotes different qualities of gold plating in the following terminology # Gold flashed / Gold washed - gold layer thickness less than 0.5 micron # Gold plated - gold layer thickness greater than equal to 0.5 micron # Heavy gold plated / Vermeil - gold layer thickness greater than equal to 2.5 micron Gold plated silver jewellery can still tarnish as the silver atoms diffuse into the gold layer, causing slow gradual fading of its color and eventually causing tarnishing of the surface. This process may take months and even years, depending on the thickness of the gold layer. A barrier metal layer is used to counter this effect - these can be Nickel or Rhodium. Copper, which also migrates into gold, does so more slowly than silver. The copper is usually further plated with nickel. A gold-plated silver article is usually a silver substrate with layers of copper, nickel, and gold deposited on top of it.  Infrared reflectivity  Gold, applied by evaporated methods or electroplating, has been specified by NASA to thermally control spacecraft instruments, due to its 99% reflectivity in infrared wavelengths.  Electronics  Gold-plated electrical connectors Gold plating is often used in electronics, to provide a corrosion-resistant electrically conductive layer on copper, typically in electrical connectors and printed circuit boards. With direct gold-on-copper plating, the copper atoms tend to diffuse through the gold layer, causing tarnishing of its surface and formation of an oxide and/or sulphide layer. A layer of a suitable barrier metal, usually nickel, is often deposited on the copper substrate before the gold plating. The layer of nickel provides mechanical backing for the gold layer, improving its wear resistance. It also reduces the impact of pores present in the gold layer. Both the nickel and gold layers can be plated by electrolytic or electroless processes. There are many factors to consider in selection of either electrolytic or electroless plating methods. These include what the deposit will be used for, configuration of the part, materials compatibility and cost of processing. In different applications, electrolytic or electroless plating can have cost advantages. At higher frequencies, the skin effect may cause higher losses due to higher electrical resistance of nickel; a nickel-plated trace can have its useful length shortened three times in the 1 GHz band in comparison with the non-plated one. Selective plating is used, depositing the nickel and gold layers only on areas where it is required and does not cause the detrimental side effects. Gold plating may lead to formation of gold whiskers. Wire bonding between gold plated contacts and aluminium wires or between aluminium contacts and gold wires under certain conditions develops a brittle layer of gold-aluminium intermetallics, known as purple plague.  Soldering issues  Gold-plated printed circuit board Soldering gold-plated parts can be problematic as gold is soluble in solder. Solder which contains more than 4‚Äì5% gold can become brittle. The joint surface is dull-looking. Gold reacts with both tin and lead in their liquid state, forming brittle intermetallics. When eutectic 63% tin ‚Äì 37% lead solder is used, no lead-gold compounds are formed, because gold preferentially reacts with tin, forming the compound. Particles of disperse in the solder matrix, forming preferential cleavage planes, significantly lowering the mechanical strength and therefore reliability of the resulting solder joints. If the gold layer does not completely dissolve into the solder, then slow intermetallic reactions can proceed in the solid state as the tin and gold atoms cross-migrate. Intermetallics have poor electrical conductivity and low strength. The ongoing intermetallic reactions also cause Kirkendall effect, leading to mechanical failure of the joint, similar to the degradation of gold-aluminium bonds known as purple plague. A 2‚Äì3 ¬µm layer of gold dissolves completely within one second during typical wave soldering conditions. Layers of gold thinner than 0.5 ¬µm (0.02 thou) also dissolve completely into the solder, exposing the underlying metal (usually nickel) to the solder. Impurities in the nickel layer can prevent the solder from bonding to it. Electroless nickel plating contains phosphorus. Nickel with more than 8% phosphorus is not solderable. Electrodeposited nickel may contain nickel hydroxide. An acid bath is required to remove the passivation layer before applying the gold layer; improper cleaning leads to a nickel surface difficult to solder. A stronger flux can help, as it aids dissolving the oxide deposits. Carbon is another nickel contaminant that hinders solderability.

It is a twining perennial, bearing flowers like those of Convolvulus arvensis, and having irregularly arrow-shaped leaves and a thick fleshy root. The dried juice, virgin scammony, obtained by incision of the living root, has been used in medicine as scammonium, but the variable quality of the drug has led to the employment of scammoniae resina, which is obtained from the dried root by digestion with alcohol. Both have extensive medical effects and usesThe chemical constituents and pharmacological effects of Convolvulus arvensis and Convolvulus scammonia- A review The active principle is the glucoside scammonin or jalapin, C34H114O6. The dose of scammonium is 5 to 10 grains, of scammony resin 3 to 8 grains. Like certain other resins, scammony is inert until it has passed from the stomach into the duodenum, where it meets the bile, a chemical reaction occurring between it and the taurocholate and glycocholate of sodium, whereby it is converted into a powerful purgative. Its action is essentially that of a hydragogue, and is exercised upon practically the entire length of the alimentary canal. The drug is not a cholagogue, nor does it markedly affect the muscular coat of the bowel, but it causes a great increase of secretion from the intestinal glands. It acts in about four hours. In large doses it is a violent gastrointestinal irritant. In consonance with the statement that scammony acts only after admixture with the bile, is the fact that hypodermic or intravenous injection of the drug produces no purgation, or indeed any other result. The drug frequently kills both roundworm and tapeworm, especially the former, and is therefore an anthelmintic. It is not largely used, but is very effective in the treatment of severe constipation, especially in children.

The Minesota (the single \\"n\\" in the name was a mistake in the original incorporation papers) was one of the most productive and famous early mines in the Michigan Copper Country. Geology Like almost all other Copper Country mines, the mineral sought was native copper. Some silver was said to have been recovered in the upper workings. Other minerals in the ore, but which had no economic importance include quartz, calcite, epidote, pumpellyite, chlorite and feldspar. History The Minesota fissure vein was discovered in 1847 when prospectors found a six-ton (5.4 mt) mass of native copper in a pit dug by aboriginal miners. In the pit was growing a hemlock nearly 400 years old by the number of growth rings. Mining began in 1848, and from 1855 through 1862, the Minesota was the most productive copper mine in the United States.B.S. Butler and W.S. Burbank, 1929, The Copper Deposits of Michigan, U.S. Geological Survey, Professional Paper 144, p.90. The mine had ten shafts, the deepest of which extended to a depth of 1200 feet (366 m). In 1856, miners tunneled into a 527-ton (478 mt) mass of native copper, the second-largest such mass found in the Copper Country. Besides masses of copper recovered through hand-sorting, the mine ran a small stamp mill to recover finer-grained copper in ore that ran 3%. In 1870, the rich massive copper had been worked out, and the depth of the mine shafts had reached the limit of the hoisting equipment. At the same time, the price of copper dropped to $0.19 per pound, down from a high of $0.55 in 1864. Rather than invest in new equipment and explore for new ore bodies, the company stopped working the mine, and turned it over to tributer - independent miners who paid for the privilege of mining, usually paying a share of the ore they took out. The mine continued to be profitable to tributers, who took out 270 tons (245 mt) of copper in 1870, the same year that the mine closed. In 1876, the Minesota company paid a final dividend and went out of business, having paid a total of $1.82 million in dividends, versus $456,000 in assessments.Horace J. Stevens (1902) The Copper Handbook, v.2, Houghton, Mich.: Horace Stevens, p.194-198 :\\"It is true that such recollections must be taken with a grain of salt, as the miner sees through the vista of backward years with an eye that wonderfully magnifies mineral values, and in the course of time any abandoned mine gets the name of having been rich; but in the case of the there is reliable evidence that the mine was abandoned through faint-heartedness, and not because it was worked out.\\" :::- Horace J. Stevens, 1902, The Copper Handbook, p.196-197. Through the end of the 1800s tributers continued to pick copper out of that part of the old workings that remained above water level. Through 1888, the mine had yielded 17,352 tons (15,742 mt) of copper, as well as 533 pounds of silver. In 1899 the property was acquired by the Michigan Mining Company, which also bought the nearby Rockland and Superior mines. In 1903, the Michigan company opened the Calico amygdaloid, which held 3% copper ore, and outcropped on the Minesota property only 140 feet (43m) from the outcrop of the Minesota fissure vein.Horace J.

In a cash account, a free riding violation occurs when the investor sells a stock that was purchased with unsettled funds. The Federal Reserve Board's Regulation T requires brokers to \\"freeze\\" accounts that commit freeriding violations for 90 days. Accounts with this restriction can still trade but cannot purchase stocks with unsettled sale proceeds (stocks take two days to settle). Freeriding can be avoided by using a margin account. Trade Day + 2 Days In the United States, stocks may take two business days to settle. If you buy on Monday, you don't have to pay for the purchase until Wednesday. This is known as trade day plus 2 days or T+2. This two-day settlement period is considered an extension of credit from the broker to the customer. Because the transaction is considered a credit issue, the Federal Reserve Board is responsible for the rule which is officially called Federal Reserve Board Regulation T. If a brokerage customer is approved for margin on the account there will be a line of credit to \\"cushion\\" the two day settlement period, but there is a limit on it. This credit allows customers to trade while the cash settles. A client in good faith agrees to make full payment of settled funds or to deposit securities within the two day settlement period and not to sell the newly purchased stock before making such payment. For accounts without margin (aka \\"cash accounts\\"), stock traders must have or deposit enough cash in the account to pay for any purchases on the day they are due (T+2). If a trader sells shares, the cash may be credited to their account balance immediately but may not be settled for two days. Any stock bought with this unsettled cash must be held until the cash is settled, or funds are deposited, or margin is increased, to allow settling of the purchase before selling. Free Riding Violation The Securities and Exchange Commission states \\"In a cash account, you must pay for the purchase of a stock before you can sell it. If you buy and sell a stock before paying for it, you are free riding, which violates the credit extension provisions of the Federal Reserve Board. If you free ride, your broker must freeze your account for 90 days.\\" If someone is trading rapidly and using all the cash available in the account to buy and sell, that person will likely get a \\"freeriding violation.\\" Freeriding is subject to a mandatory 90-day cash-up-front restriction. Clients can still trade, but they lose the ability to make purchases with unsettled sale proceeds. S.E.C. Enforcement Actions Apart from credit rule violations inherent in free riding, the more significant and direct harm can come when the customer never pays or deposits to cover the trade, leaving the broker to hold the bag (if the trade was a success, the broker nets the trades, but if it was not, the customer should deposit the difference). The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought successful civil injunctive enforcement actions against free riders, with follow-on criminal prosecutions by the U.S. Attorney in New York, where significant prison sentences were imposed, for both credit and antifraud violations where it was clear that the customer never intended to cover the trade and was only using a succession of brokers to play the market, hoping for success, and causing serious losses to brokers. See SEC v. Schlomo Teitelbaum, SEC News Digest https://www.sec.gov/news/digest/1981/dig061181.pdf (civil injunctive action, injunction granted) and https://www.sec.gov/news/digest/1981/dig012381.pdf (criminal prosecution, concurrent 18 months sentence). Good Faith and Free Riding The main difference between a good faith violation and free riding is the eventual deposit of funds to cover the buy. In free riding the buyer sells the security without ever depositing the funds to pay for the initial purchase. The Federal Reserve considers a good faith violation an \\"abuse of credit\\" and requires the broker keep track of them. If the trader gets three violations in one year, the broker is required to restrict the account. This is compared to the free riding violation which results in an automatic restriction. Liquidation and Free Riding A liquidation violation occurs when the client sells a security to satisfy a cash obligation for the purchase of a different security after trade date. This is a violation because the sale of the second security will not be settled by the time the first purchase settles. A liquidation violation carries the same penalties as a good faith violation. Economics In microeconomics, an agent is said to be free riding when it does not pay for its share of the cost of producing a public good. This may be a problem. See the free rider problem for further discussion. References External links * What is a Free Ride?: How Free Rides can affect your Individual Retirement Account.

In response to a question on whether he was disappointed by Appleyard's departure at the time, former Flip rider Rodrigo Teixeira explained after his own departure from the company, \\"Not really. Homie had to do what he had to do ‚Ä¶\\" In an August 2013 interview for Tony Hawk's RIDE YouTube channel, Appleyard stated that he has not sensed any animosity from former Flip teammates since his departure. Appleyard explained in an April 2013 interview that he joined Element as the company was completing the filming for a video that he was unable to appear in due to a lack of substantial footage. Appleyard later negotiated the release of a solo part with the company's management and, as of the time of the interview, Appleyard had been filming footage for approximately two years‚Äîthe scheduled release date for the video is in June 2013 and the part will be published on the Berrics website. In regard to his position at Element, Appleyard revealed: \\"I‚Äôm happy to be able to continue to riding for Element. I wish I wasn‚Äôt getting older. I‚Äôm 30 now, but that‚Äôs not really that old. I want to skate as long as I possibly can.\\" Prior to the release of his June 2013 solo part, Appleyard conducted an interview for the Berrics \\"Interrogation\\" segment and explained that he continues to enjoy his time as an Element team rider, while also remaining on good terms with people in the \\"old camp.\\" When asked about his most important friendships in skateboarding, Appleyard identified Adrian Lopez, Colt Cannon, Geoff Rowley, Josh Kalis, and Chad Muska. Appleyard also explained that his solo part will be released to public free-of-charge. =Sponsors= As of November 2011, Appleyard's sponsors are RYOT¬Æ Element Skateboards, Thunder, Autobahn, Globe Shoes, Volcom, CCS, Arnette, and Vivo. His previous sponsors were Flip, Circa Shoes, Habitat, and Ricta Wheels. Awards In 2003, Appleyard was named Thrasher \\"Skater of the Year\\". Appleyard was the recipient of the Transworld \\"Readers‚Äô Choice\\" award in 2004 and received the \\"Best Street Skater\\" award at the 2007 Transworld Awards. Personal life As of April 2013, Appleyard resides in Huntington Beach, California, United States (US), and wears a size \\"11\\" shoe. As of June 2013, Appleyard and his wife are the parents of a baby son, and Appleyard explained the experience of fatherhood following the birth: \\"Pretty eye opening. It's definitely a power move in life for sure. It's cool man. I'm happy I didn't do it earlier and that I did it when everything was in order in my own life. I'm feeling pretty good about it.\\" In 2013 Appleyard explained his mindset towards his health and skateboarding as a thirty-year- old: > As far as physically, I eat really healthy.

In time it became a generic term for other companies' similar asbestos- cement products, and later an even more generic term for a hard, fireproof composite material, fibre cement boards, typically used in wall construction. It can also be found in insulation, siding, roof gutters, and cement wallboard. The more prevalent transite found in wall construction and roofing tiles for example, will last anywhere from 50 years to over 100 years. The use of asbestos, a proven carcinogen, to manufacture transite was phased out in the 1980s. It was replaced by crystalline silica, which the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified as being carcinogenic to humans (Class 1). Crystalline silica is also known to cause silicosis, a non- cancerous lung disease. Historic Originally, transite had between 12-50% of asbestos fiber added to a cement base to provide tensile strength (similar to the rebar in reinforced concrete), and other materials. It was frequently used for such purposes as furnace flues, roof shingles, siding, soffit and fascia panels, and wallboard for areas where fire retardancy is particularly important. It was also used in walk-in coolers made in large supermarkets in the 1960s, 1970s and even the 1980s. Other uses included roof drain piping, water piping, sanitary sewer drain piping, laboratory fume hood panels, ceiling tiles, landscape edging, and HVAC ducts. Because cutting, breaking, and machining asbestos-containing transite releases carcinogenic asbestos fibers into the air, its use has fallen out of favor. Despite asbestos- containing transite being phased out, it is still not banned in the United States; some 230,000 deaths have been attributed to it. Demolition of older buildings containing transite materials, particularly siding made from transite, requires special precautions and disposal techniques to protect workers and the public. Today The transite that is produced today is made without asbestos. Transite HT and Transite 1000 are currently available fiber cement boards that contain crystalline silica, which the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified as being carcinogenic to humans (Class 1). Crystalline silica is also known to cause silicosis, a non-cancerous lung disease.

She and her first husband, Roy Redgrave (1873-1922), are considered to be the first members of the now renowned Redgrave acting dynasty. Life and career Margaret was born Daisy Bertha Mary Scudamore in Portsmouth, the youngest of five children of Clara (n√©e Linington) and William George Scudamore, a shipwright at HM Portsmouth, all residing at 7 Melbourne Place, Southsea. She left home aged 18 and found her way to the London offices of theatrical agent Sir John Denton. Mistaking her for Mary Scudamore, the young daughter of a well-known actor-playwright- manager Fortunatus Augustine Davis who had added \\"Scudmore\\" to his surname many years before, Sir John gave Daisy the unrelated Scudamore's address at Castelnau Mansions, Barnes. Fortunatus, a \\"most cheerful\\" man, welcomed Daisy into the household and she lived with his wife and children for a time until he found work for her as an actress in London. Over half a century later, an erroneous report that she was the daughter of Fortunatus in her Times obituary of 8 October 1958 was frequently repeated in other articles, even as late as 2003 in The Daily Telegraph until new Scudamore family research a few years after. While appearing in repertory at the Grand Theatre, Brighton, she met the divorced actor Roy Redgrave who had just returned from an initial period in Australia. Still called Daisy, she married Redgrave at Glasgow Register Office in 1907 while they were touring in the north, and on 20 March 1908 she gave birth to a son, Michael Redgrave, who went on to be knighted during a distinguished cinema and theatre career. Six months after Michael's birth, Redgrave left Daisy (Margaret) and returned to Australia again, this time permanently. After the dissolution of her marriage to Redgrave -- about four years after Michael's birth -- she adopted the stage name of Margaret Scudamore and continued acting in character roles. As Margaret she later married Captain James P. \\"Andy\\" Anderson, a tea planter formerly employed by the Ceylon and Eastern Agency, in London in 1922. They had a daughter together, Peg. Following Redgrave's departure, Margaret Scudamore achieved a successful career as a supporting actress in films as well as the theatre, beginning screen roles during the silent film era and culminating with character parts in two notable Powell and Pressburger films. Her grandchildren Corin Redgrave, Lynn Redgrave and Vanessa Redgrave and great-grandchildren Jemma Redgrave, Joely Richardson, Natasha Richardson and Carlo Nero have successfully followed the family tradition into acting.

According to his wife, the three movements of the piano trio are a reflection of Ives‚Äô college days at Yale. He started writing the piece in 1904, six years after graduation, and completed it in 1911. It was written 1909‚Äì10 and significantly revised in 1914‚Äì15. Movements The piano trio consists of three movements: #Moderato #TSIAJ (\\"This scherzo is a joke\\"). Presto #Moderato con moto. The first movement is the same 27 measures repeated three times, though the violin is silent for the first, the cello for the second, and all three instruments join for the third. Though the separate duets seem full enough on their own, yet all together sound amazingly and uncharacteristically consonant. The second movement, TSIAJ, employs polytonality, timbral contrast, and quotation for a downright humorous effect. Fragments of American folk songs are intertwined throughout the movement, although often grotesquely altered with respect to rhythm, pitch, and harmonic connotation. Folk songs appearing in the scherzo include \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\", \\"Sailor's Hornpipe\\", \\"The Campbells Are Coming\\", \\"Long, Long Ago\\", \\"Hold the Fort\\". and \\"There Is a Fountain Filled with Blood\\", among many others. Drawing from his college days at Yale University, Ives also quotes a number of fraternity songs including the Delta Kappa Epsilon tune \\"A Band of Brothers in DKE\\", which appears prominently near the beginning of the movement. It is notable that one of his sketches for the movement includes the subtitle \\"Medley on the Campus Fence\\", referring to the songs popular among Yale students during his college years. And although the composer himself acknowledged that the entire movement was a joke, it well characterizes the unique and novel musical world that only Ives had discovered. The lyricism of the final movement of the piano trio contrasts strongly with the variegated montage of tunes in TSIAJ. Sweeping lyrical melodies alternate with lighter syncopated sections after the opening introduction and violin recitative. Nonetheless, Ives continues with his borrowing habits ‚Äì quoting music that he had originally written for the Yale Glee Club (though it was rejected) in the lyrical violin-cello canon in bars 91‚Äì125. The coda quotes Thomas Hastings‚Äô ‚ÄúRock of Ages‚Äù in the cello, ending the movement with Ives‚Äô characteristic rooting in American folk and popular music.

The vessel was assigned to patrol the rivers and other waterways of the Confederate States of America and to enforce the Union blockade on the South.  Built in New York  Port Royal, a wooden, double-ended, side-wheel gunboat, was launched at New York 17 January 1862 by Thomas Stack and commissioned at New York Navy Yard, 26 April 1862.  Civil War service  Departing New York 4 May, Port Royal steamed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, to join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in supporting General George McClellan's drive up the peninsula toward Richmond, Virginia. She engaged Confederate batteries at Sewell's Point, Virginia, 8 May and a week later participated in the Battle of Drewry's Bluff, on the James River below the southern capital. After General Robert E. Lee's seven day campaign turned back McClellan's thrust, Port Royal shifted operations to the North Carolina Sounds. She was part of the Union Naval force which reconnoitered the Neuse River, North Carolina, arid attacked Kinston, 12‚Äì16 December. The spring of 1863 found her operating along the Florida coast. On 20 April, a landing party from the ship raided Apalachicola, Florida, capturing cotton and ordnance. On 24 May a boat expedition captured sloop Fashion laden with cotton in the same area. The Union party also burned a ship repair facility at Devil's Elbow and destroyed a barge. In ensuing months Port Royal continued to patrol the Confederate coast. In August 1864, she served with Rear Admiral David Farragut during the operations in Mobile Bay, Alabama. Port Royal then continued patrol duty through the end of the Civil War.

Jerry Potts, Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'Forty years In Canada: Reminiscences of the Great North-West' by S.B. Steele, ed M. G Niblett (Toronto and London, 1918, reprinted 1972) Early life Potts was born in or before 1840 near Fort McKenzie, Montana. He was the only child of his Kainai- CreeThe enemy Plains Cree called the Kainai Miko-Ew - \\"stained with blood\\", i.e. \\"the bloodthirsty, cruel.\\" Therefore, the common English name for the tribe is the \\"Blood tribe.\\" mother, Namo-pisi (Crooked Back), and Andrew R. Potts, a Scottish fur trader. Upon the death of his father in 1840, Jerry was given to American Fur Company trader Alexander Harvey by Namo-pisi prior to rejoining her tribe. A violent, vindictive man, Harvey neglected and mistreated Potts before deserting him in 1845. American Fur Company trader Andrew Dawson of Fort Benton, Montana, a gentle man who was called \\"the last king of the Missouri,\\" adopted young Potts. He taught the boy to read and write and allowed him to mix with the Native Americans who visited the trading post to learn their customs and languages. In his late teens Potts, who adopted the carefree mannerisms of the frontier, joined his mother‚Äôs people and, from then on, drifted between them and Dawson. During this time, Potts passed all the Kanai-Cree rites of passage including the final agony of the Sun Dance wherein the fledgling brave is tied to a pole by thongs threaded through his chest muscles. Successful completion of this rite meant the youth had achieved glory by tearing himself loose either immediately or by staying tied to the pole in absolute silence for up to three days and then tearing loose. Potts chose to remain the full three days for such was his nature. He also belonged to several of the secret warrior societies which prevailed in large numbers throughout the Blackfoot nation. Still, he wore Euro-American clothing most of the time including a fashionable hat that sported a wide headband. His bushy, drooping mustache was as stylish as that of any other Euro-American man. Adulthood Potts was employed for several years by the American Fur Company, and from 1869 to 1874 he worked as a hunter for various whiskey traders. He gained fame as a warrior. As a person of mixed blood, he had to prove to both M√©tis and Euro-Americans that he could cope in their respective cultures, and was well served by his quick wits, reckless bravery, skills with the knife and lethal accuracy with both a revolver and a rifle. Potts married two sisters of the Piegan Blackfeet (Aamssk√°√°pipikani) named Panther Woman and Spotted Killer, who blessed him with several sons and a couple of daughters. He named one of his sons \\"Blue Gun\\" in commemoration of his favourite rifle. His many descendants still live mainly in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Montana. Three of his descendants, including Janet Potts, became Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers during the middle years of the 20th century. By the time Potts was twenty-five, he was wealthy due to his horse trading. His herd rarely included less than 100 horses, which made him the second wealthiest First Nations person in the area. Though his horses carried a number of diverse brands, he could always produce bills of sale (even though he could not read them himself) for most of them. Those without papers, if they were American horses, were sold in Canada while paperless Canadian horses were sold south of the Medicine Line. Those branded with the markings of the US Cavalry were sold as far north as possible unless he had papers proving they had been purchased legally. The going rate for a good horse at the time ranged between $75.00 to $150.00 so his large inventory showed his wealth. When he journeyed to Montana Territory to buy horses he would carry cash - often as much as a thousand dollars - with which to make the transactions. People knew he carried such amounts but they also knew he was Jerry Potts so he was left alone. Around this same time, he became a minor chief with the Kainai, in recognition of his bravery in battle, his unquestioned leadership abilities, and his knowledge of the prairies. It is said he knew every trail from Fort Edmonton to the lands of the Cheyenne and Apache and every hill between those trails. He could find game when all others had returned to camp empty-handed. He spent much of his time in what is now Montana, guiding, trading horses, and drinking. Potts always received more salary than any other guide/interpreter because as a guide he had no equal. He was useful as an interpreter because he spoke all the Indigenous languages of the Prairies. His interpretations would also be different, depending on who he was speaking to. His interpretations of the long, verbose speeches of the Native Americans were always short and concise. Long speeches would be reduced to only a few words. His interpretations of the indigenous languages, however, were always long and passionate. Potts did this because he understood that long speech in Indigenous cultures was meant to show respect, while for English-speakers, it was only a way to show off.Fardy, Bernard D. Jerry Potts: Paladin of the Plains. Langley, B.C., 1984, p. 73-74 Once, following a Blackfoot chief's extremely long, flowery, impassioned speech to a delegation of visiting officials who had arrived from Ottawa to sign a historic treaty with the Blackfoot people, Potts remained silent as if fully digesting the colourful language. Finally, when asked what the chief had said, the laconic Potts shrugged and replied, \\"He says he's damned glad you're here.\\" On another occasion, when asked by Inspector MacLeod what lay beyond a high rising hill ahead, Potts muttered, \\"Nuther hill.\\" He was fluent in American English, Blackfoot, and Crow (Aps√°alooke alil√°au), had a better than average ability in Plains Cree (nƒìhiyawƒìwin) (which he would speak only when necessary), and was passable in Lakota-Sioux (Lak»ü√≥tiyapi), Assiniboine (Nakona or A' MÃÜoqazh), and Algonquin. He also understood the differing cultures of the Indigenous peoples and the North-West Mounted Police. He was able to instruct the police in the proper procedures for receiving a Chief. For all his ability to get along with Euro-Americans, though, Potts was very much Indigenous. He never fully understood the Euro-American reasoning. For instance, he could never understand the reason that Euro-American settlers equipped their houses with chamber pots. \\"Why,\\" he once asked a Mountie, \\"would anyone piss in a perfectly good eating bowl when the entire prairie lay before him\\"? From a distance the stocky, bow-legged Potts looked like a Euro-American trapper in his buckskin clothing, his Stetson at a jaunty angle upon his head. Two .44 pistols hung from his gun belt complementing the Henry rifle which never left his side. On his leg was strapped a long-bladed skinning knife. He always kept a small gun inside a hide-away pocket, a practice that saved his life on several occasions. In 1870, various Nehiyaw-Pwat bands of Plains Cree and Plains Assiniboine began a war. They hoped to defeat the Blackfoot weakened by smallpox. An advance party of Cree and Assiniboine, under the lead of Plains Chief Chief Big Bear (Mistahimaskwa) and Piapot (Hole in the Sioux), Chief of the Cree-Assiniboines (Young Dogs), had stumbled upon a Peigan camp near Fort Whoop-Up (called by the Blackfoot Akaisakoyi - \\"Many Dead\\") and decided to attack instead of informing the main Cree body of their find. Just in the nick of time, Jerry Potts with a group of Peigans and two Blood bands, who were armed with repeating rifles, came to their assistance. In the daylong so- called Battle of the Belly River, on October 25, 1870, near present-day Lethbridge (called by the Blackfoot Assini-etomochi ‚Äì \\"where we slaughtered the Cree\\") the combined Cree-Assiniboine force, who lost over 300 warriors, was defeated. The slaughter was such that Jerry Potts said: \\"You could fire with your eyes shut and be sure to kill a Cree.\\" The next winter the hunger compelled the Nehiyaw-Pwat to negotiate with the Blackfoot and, in 1873, Crowfoot (Isapo-Muxika) (Issap√≥√≥mahksika - \\"Crow-big-foot\\"), Chief of the Siksika (Siksik√°wa - ‚Ä≥Blackfoot People‚Ä≥), adopted Pitikwahanapiwiyin (Poundmaker) a man of mixed Cree and Assiniboine parentage, creating a final peace between the Nehiyaw-Pwat (Cree-Assiniboine) and Blackfoot. The Battle of the Belly River was the last major conflict between the Cree and the Blackfoot Confederacy, and the last major battle between First Nations in Western Canada. In 1871, Potts' mother was murdered by a man drunk on \\"firewater.\\" So, Potts declared his own personal war on the whiskey runners. By the time Potts was 36, he had killed at least 40 men, mostly whiskey runners. In September 1874, Potts was trading horses in Fort Benton, Montana. He was hired as a guide, interpreter and scout by the North-West Mounted Police. His contract as a guide for the North-West Mounted Police was to last twenty-two years. He was paid $90 per month, which was quite a bit higher than a regular guide, and three times a police constable's salary. He ceased working for the force at age fifty-eight, because the pain of throat cancer made it so that he could no longer ride, and died a year later, on 14 July, 1896, at Fort Macleod. The Macleod Gazette and Alberta Livestock Record paid tribute to the man who ‚Äúmade it possible for a small and utterly insufficient force to occupy and gradually dominate what might so easily, under other circumstances, have been a hostile and difficult country. . . . Had he been other than he was . . . it is not too much to say that the history of the North West would have been vastly different to what it is.‚Äù Jerry Potts is buried at Fort Macleod with the rank of Special Constable in the North-West Mounted Police. Recognition The city of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, and the town of Fort Macleod, have boulevards named in Potts' honour. There is also a Jerry Potts Elementary School in northwest Calgary. On 8 September 1992 Canada Post issued a \\"Jerry Potts, Legendary Plainsman\\" stamp as part of the Folklore, Legendary Heroes series. The stamps were designed by Ralph Tibbles, based on illustrations by Deborah Drew-Brook and Allan Cormack. The 42¬¢ stamps are perforated and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.Canada Post stamp In Sam Peckinpah's 1965 western film, Major Dundee, the character of the scout Samuel Potts, played by James Coburn, was inspired in part by the persona of Jerry Potts himself A fictional account of his life is featured in the book, The Last Crossing, by Guy Vanderhaeghe.

It was thought he was the author of the Periodos to Nicomedes, a work on geography written in Classical Greek. It is an account of the world (œÄŒµœÅŒπŒÆŒ≥Œ∑œÉŒπœÇ, periegesis) in 'comic' iambic trimeters which is dedicated to a King Nicomedes of Bithynia. This is either Nicomedes II Epiphanes who reigned from 149 BC for an unknown number of years or his son, Nicomedes III Euergetes. It was first published at Augsburg in 1600. Because it was found together with the Epitomes of Marcianus of Heraclea it was first published under his name. Because this was clearly a mistake Lucas Holstenius and Isaac Vossius were the first to attribute it to Scymnus of Chios because he was cited more than once by late grammarians as the author of a Periegesis. It continued to pass under his name until 1846 when Augustus Meineke, in republishing the extant fragments, showed clearly that there were no grounds for ascribing them to that Scymnus. The real work of Scymnus of Chios appears to have been in prose and the few statements cited from him have no resemblance to the Periodos to Nicomedes.

Schulz, was a weekly panel that appeared mainly in Schulz's hometown paper, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, from June 22, 1947, to January 22, 1950. Schulz's first regular cartoon, Li'l Folks can be regarded as an embryonic version of Peanuts, containing characters and themes which were to reappear in the later strip: a well-dressed young boy with a fondness for Beethoven, √† la Schroeder; a dog with a resemblance to Snoopy; and a boy named Charlie Brown.\\"Charles M. Schulz: Li'l Beginnings\\"  Publication history  Schulz was 24 at the time he began drawing Li'l Folks, and he was living with his father in a four- bedroom apartment above his father's barber shop. He earned $10 for each submission to the paper. The first two installments of Li'l Folks ran June 8 and 15, 1947, in the Minneapolis Tribune. It then moved to the St. Paul Pioneer Press; Li'l Folks ran in the women's section of the paper. In 1948, Schulz tried to have Li'l Folks syndicated through the Newspaper Enterprise Association (a Scripps Company). He would have been an independent contractor for the syndicate, unheard of in the 1940s, but the deal fell through. Schulz quit two years into the strip after the editor turned down his requests for a pay increase and a move of Li'l Folks from the women's section to the comics pages. Later that year, Schulz approached the United Feature Syndicate (also a Scripps Company) with Li'l Folks, and the syndicate became interested. However, by that time Schulz had also developed a comic strip (also called Li'l Folks), typically using four panels rather than one. The strip was similar in spirit to the panel comic, but it had a set cast of characters, rather than different nameless little folk for each page. The syndicate preferred the strip; however, the name Li'l Folks was too close to the names of two other comics of the time: Al Capp's Li'l Abner and a strip titled Little Folks. To avoid confusion, the syndicate chose the name Peanuts, after the peanut gallery featured in the Howdy Doody TV show. Peanuts made its first appearance on October 2, 1950, in seven newspapers.  Characters and story  Li'l Folks saw the first use of the name Charlie Brown on May 30, 1948, although Schulz applied the name in four gags to three different boys, as well as one buried in sand, during 1948-1949. The strip also featured an unnamed dog that looked much like Snoopy. Like most of Peanuts, adult characters were not shown in the strip.  Collected editions  The newspaper never returned Schulz's original artwork, so he clipped each week's strip from the paper and placed it in his scrapbook, which eventually housed over 7,000 pieces of artwork. In 2004, the complete run of the strip was collected by the Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research Center (Santa Rosa, California) in a book, Li'l Beginnings, by Derrick Bang with a foreword by Jean Schulz. It is available from the Museum and distributed by Fantagraphics Books. The complete run of the strip was also included in the penultimate volume of The Complete Peanuts, published in May 2016 by Fantagraphics Books.

A caricature to which sufferers of (or care providers for those with) the condition may object is an example of simplification, while frequent overuse of a medical term, in the absence of bona fide symptoms, might be considered an amplification. Examples =Tourette syndrome= Tourette syndrome is typically clinomorphically depicted as being a condition of involuntary (and often unconscious) outbursts of offensive language or behaviour, usually on account of being unable to repress (or unaware that they are articulating) involuntary responses. The typical clinomorphism of Tourette is both an oversimplification and a conflation of various aspects and conditions pertaining to some persons with Tourette syndrome. Some people with Tourette syndrome do have involuntary offensive speech which is termed coprolalia and is sometimes clinomorphised into the term \\"compulsive swearing\\" or \\"compulsive profanity\\", terms which have clinomorphic currency outside the use of the term \\"Tourette's\\". However, coprolalia is actually a relatively rare symptom of Tourette's. Today, the use of the term Tourette's is deemed incorrect. The correct usage is Tourette syndrome. This may seem like a minor or nitpicky distinction, but as with other disorders (such as Down syndrome), the possessive is discouraged. =Autism= Autism is clinomorphically seen as a condition where the autistic individual is essentially mentally retarded and a human calculator at the same time, a cultural perception exemplified by the movie Rain Man. In reality, although as many as 10% of individuals with autism spectrum disorders may display splinter skills such as memorization of trivia, autistic savant prodigies are extraordinarily rare; conversely, though autism is associated with mental retardation, many individuals with autism spectrum disorders are not mentally retarded. In fact, most individuals with autism spectrum disorders have an average or above-average IQ and may be exceptionally talented in music, mathematics, or science. Historical figures such as Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton, who are believed by some to have been on the autistic spectrum, are sometimes used as examples of highly intelligent people who had autistic traits. =OCD= Obsessive-compulsive disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder are two distinct psychological disorders, but media portrayals are often very simplistic and do not reflect the difference between the two. Though disorders can manifest themselves in a very wide range of symptoms, portrayals often tend towards caricature, and emphasize only the most stereotypical of symptoms. In addition, the phrase \\"obsessive-compulsive\\" is often casually used to describe behavior which may be picky or pedantic, but is not at all close to the diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive behavior. =Mood swings= Often individuals who are \\"moody\\" or have mood swings say they are bipolar. Bipolar disorder is an often severe mood disorder characterized by periods of days, weeks, or months of deep depression, alternating with periods of normal mood and/or manic episodes, which are not just periods of \\"high energy\\" or \\"productivity\\", though these may be a symptom of mania. Problems Clinomorphism is in fact often both a contributory factor in as well as being the result of the mythology and popular misconception of many medical conditions. Clinomorphism is usually the basis for controversy in medical conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder, myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome), ADHD, and dyslexia where consensus is not easily established concerning the validity of the conditions and clinomorphism is in fact seen as pejorative, so that clinomorphic references to these conditions are ascribed respectively to being \\"cowardice\\", \\"malingering\\", \\"disobedience\\" and \\"stupidity\\". Clinomorphism, whilst being a linguistic behaviour which exemplifies particular \\"errors\\" and deliberate misrepresentations, may also be a natural tendency in the sense that it is potentially an understandable consequence of the need to abbreviate or to simply use a clinomorphism as a metaphor to convey an otherwise difficult to describe idea, in much the same way as anthropomorphism might be (where one attributes the human characteristics or presence of a mind to anything nonhuman, purely for ease of description of a particular phenomenon, rather than as a result of holding a genuinely animistic or pantheistic belief). An example of clinomorphic tendency would be in the case of autism or Asperger syndrome where particular characteristics of these syndromes (such as the limitations on the ability of a sufferer to form a mental model of the state of mind of another person) would be clinomorphically used as a metaphor or simile for someone's behaviour, where the individual being described clinomorphically is not in fact believed by the utterer to be a sufferer of the condition in question. The danger is that this will be seen as an offensive misrepresentation of and disrespect towards the condition of an actual sufferer, and thus such clinomorphism (even as a metaphorical convenience) would need to be restricted to discreet private discourse, or avoided altogether.

Role and deployment  The fundamental role and purpose of the Croatian Army is to protect vital national interests of the Republic of Croatia and defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state. The Croatian Army's primary tasks are to: * Defend against possible aggression at strategic operational levels and to defend against any land, air, or amphibious assault, in co-operation with the other branches of the CAF. * Help allies and friendly countries in time of need. * Build the capability to carry out non-traditional tasks such as humanitarian support during floods, fires, and other natural disasters. = Recent and current operations =  North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)  The Croatian Army has contributed to the following NATO missions: * NATO EFP Battlegroups (Lithuania & Poland) - 2017 * Operation Resolute Support (Afghanistan) - since 2015 * NATO International Security and Assistance Force (ISAF) (Afghanistan) - from 2003-2014  United Nations (UN)  The Croatian Army was involved in the following UN missions as of December 2017: * UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO): seven military observers * UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL): one staff officer * UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP): nine military observers In the past, the Croatian Army has also contributed to: * UN Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) * UN Mission in Support of East Timor (UNMISET) * UN Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) * UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) * UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) * UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) * UN Mission in Cyprus (UNFICYP) History The Croatian Army was formed in the Croatian War of Independence, when, on November 3, 1991, the Croatian National Guard was renamed the Croatian Army. Numerous Croatian army units arose from the Croatian National Guard, including: * 1st Croatian Guards Corps * 1st Guards Brigade (Croatia) * 2nd Guards Brigade (Croatia) * 3rd Guards Brigade (Croatia) * 4th Guards Brigade (Croatia) * 7th Guards Brigade (Croatia) * Croatian 104th Brigade * 204th Vukovar Brigade The locally based regiments were named the Home Guard Regiments (Domobranska pukovnija). They were created on 24 December 1991, during the war, and ceased to exist in a 2003 reorganization. Organizational structure and status The Croatian Army is an all-volunteer force numbering 7,514 active duty personnel and 193 civil servants and employees as of August 2016. The Army can also call on 6,000 reserve personnel who serve up to 30 days every year. Croatian Army Master Sgt.(right) discusses patrol routes with a Czech Army Sgt. (left) in Germany to prepare for Afghanistan, 2012 The Croatian Army is being reorganized to fit in the NATO doctrine of a small, highly capable force with an emphasis on mobility and versatility. Major combatant commands of the Croatian Army are one armored and one mechanized brigade, each brigade having a specific role and different responsibilities. In 2012, one motorized infantry company is to be detached and put under the command of the EU Battle Group led by Germany. Croatia continues to deploy 350 personnel in support of NATO International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. Croatia achieved NATO membership in April 2009. The defence reforms that Croatia initiated in 2000 have a long- term goal of replacing and modernizing the armed forces to meet the challenges of NATO membership. The plan calls for the modernization of the Army and the introduction of training and doctrine in line with Western (NATO) standards. Replacing ex-Yugoslav/Soviet hardware is also one of the main priorities. There are various ongoing initiatives, such as the upgrade of the tank fleet, introduction of new Armored Personnel Carriers and NATO standard assault rifles, etc. Procurement of new, NATO-compatible equipment takes a significant part of the defense budget. Until less than a decade ago, Croatia had operated just under 280 main battle tanks, but this number decreased significantly due to the withdrawal of roughly 200 obsolete T-55 tanks in 2006. Most of these units have been scrapped, but a limited number have been stored as operational reserve in case of need. The mainstay now are the M-84A4 Sniper main battle tanks which are currently undergoing overhauls. However, modernization of the tank fleet to the M-84D standard is also envisaged. In July 2007 Patria AMV won the contract to supply the next generation of APCs to the Croatian Army. Only 84 vehicles were ordered at first with an additional 42 purchased in an extended contract signed in December 2008. Croatia now operates 126 units with the first six vehicles manufactured in Finland and delivered by late 2008. All remaining vehicles have been locally produced by 2014. Out of a total of 126 units, 112 are armed with 12,7 Protector (RWS) remote controlled stations. In early 2007, Croatia bought 10 Iveco LMV light armoured vehicles at a cost of 330,000 Euros per unit. According to official documents, 94 of these vehicles were needed by 2017. However, Croatia now relies on over 200 US-donated HMMWV and MRAP type vehicles. Steps have been made to standardize the difficult-to- maintain vehicle inventory of the Croatian military, which is full of various models of different origin, type and age. Starting with 2005, the Army bought 152 light trucks and vehicles, 156 in 2006 with an additional 170 obtained by the end of 2007. All vehicles are from prominent European or Japanese manufacturers including Mercedes-Benz, Land Rover, Iveco, MAN, Toyota and Nissan. These purchases are an ongoing process seen as roughly 150-180 new terrain vehicles are procured annually. The Croatian Army is introducing a new assault rifle in 5.56mm NATO caliber to replace large stocks of AK-47 and its derivatives. The chosen model is the locally manufactured VHS developed by HS Produkt. The initial batch of 1,000 rifles was ordered in 2009‚Äì2010 with the requirement for up to 20,000 rifles. The MoD press and photo releases from regular training activities indicate that the VHS had been issued to elements of the Military Intelligence Battalion, Combat Swimmer Detachment of the Special Forces Battalion, as well as to one of the infantry companies of the Guards Mechanized Brigade as early as 2011. =Order of battle= Current structure of the Croatian Army *Land Forces Command (Karlovac) **Armored Mechanized Guard Brigade (GOMBR) - (Vinkovci) *** Headquarters Company (Vinkovci) ***Tank Battalion \\"Kune\\" (ƒêakovo) *** Armored Battalion of the Guards Armored Mechanized Brigade ***1st Mechanized Battalion \\"Sokolovi\\" (Na≈°ice) ***2nd Mechanized Battalion \\"Pume\\" (Vara≈ædin ) *** Mixed Artillery Battalion (Bjelovar) *** Air Defence Battalion (Vinkovci) *** Engineer Battalion (Vinkovci) *** Reconnaissance Company (Vinkovci) *** Signals Company (Vinkovci) *** Logistics Company (Vinkovci) ** Mechanized Guard Brigade - Medium Mechanized Brigade (Knin) *** Headquarters & Headquarters Company *** 1st Mechanized Battalion \\"Tigrovi\\" (Petrinja) *** 2nd Mechanized Battalion \\"Gromovi\\" (Petrinja) *** 3rd Mechanized Battalion \\"Pauci\\" (Knin) *** Motorized Battalion \\"Vukovi\\" (Gospiƒá) *** Mixed Artillery Battalion (Karlovac/Slunj) *** Air Defence Battalion (Benkovac) *** Engineer Battalion (Sinj) *** Reconnaissance Company *** Signals Company *** Logistics Company **Training and Doctrine Command \\"Fran Krsto Frankopan\\" (Osijek) *** Command Company (Osijek) ***Infantry Regiment (Petrinja) *** Artillery Regiment (Bjelovar) ***Engineer Regiment (Karlovac) ****River Battalion (Osijek) ***Logistics Regiment (Benkovac) ***Basic Training Centre (Po≈æega) *** Combat Training Center (Slunj) *** Simulation Center (Zagreb) ***International Operations Training Center (Rakitje) *Military Police Regiment (Ogulin/Karlovac) *Signals Regiment (Karlovac) *Military Intelligence Battalion (Zagreb) *NBC Defence Battalion (Dugo Selo) *Special Operations Forces Command (Delnice) *Air Defence Regiment (Zadar) ** Command Battery (Zemunik) ** 1st Mixed Battalion (Zemunik) ** 2nd Mixed Battalion (Udbina) ** 3rd Mixed Battalion (Zagreb) *Signals Battalion (Velika Gorica) = Training Grounds = * Eugen Kvaternik Training Grounds (Slunj) * Crvena Zemlja Training Grounds (Knin) * Ga≈°inci Training Grounds (ƒêakovo) = Operational art and tactical doctrine = Building on NATO's Partnership for Peace assistance programmes and full NATO membership since 2009, the Croatian Army has embraced the alliance concepts of the 24-hour, three-dimensional battlefield and the employment of highly trained and motivated forces equipped to deploy rapidly and operate with flexibility as part of a larger multinational force. The Croatian Army is also working more closely with the air force and navy, resulting in more multi- phased operations with detailed ground/air coordination, but more needs to be done at all echelons to achieve a deeper level of jointness. In all of these activities, the land forces are in the lead. Modernization plans Croatian soldier with a VHS assault rifle Soldiers take cover beside a Patria AMV Panzerhaubitze 2000 on 2015 military parade In past decade or so, Croatian Army underwent significant changes, modernisation of the armed forces albeit at the much slower pace then anticipated due to economic recession at the start of this decade, caused realignment of Croatia's priorities, Croatia's military subsequently faced significant cutbacks and reduction in expenditure or purchase of new armaments. However, as a result of NATO membership, Croatia agreed to fulfill some of the operational responsibilities towards NATO, this includes formation of two mechanised brigades, with emphasis on equipping both brigades with NATO standard equipment. Procurement of heavy weapons is still lagging behind due to shortage of funding for the armed forces, however donations by the US Armed Forces have helped Croatia to gap some of the shortfalls. Purchase of 126 Patria AMV APCs allowed for light mechanized brigade to replace old Yugoslav and Soviet era weapon systems that saw little use with in NATO. However, the Heavy Mechanized brigade still relies heavily on Soviet and Yugoslav-era weapons systems and modernization of that brigade is one of the priorities for current government. Equipping the brigade with a modern Infantry Fighting Vehicle such as M2 Bradley, would go long way in fulfilling that task. Modernization of Croatia's M-84 main battle tanks due to significant costs but also lack of interoperability within NATO has been dropped and alternatives are being sought, Leopard 2 most likely being the only choice for the armed forces, however lack of funding ensures this remains only a distant dream at this stage. Current plans call for establishment of a 3rd mechanized battalion with in Heavy Mechanized Brigade due to NATO requirement for such unit. 60 Additional Patria AMV will be ordered to fulfill requirements for Heavy Mechanized Brigade, additional PzH 2000 howitzers are likely to be purchased from Germany to meet the NATO requirement for a 2nd Armored Battalion. Additional light mine protected vehicles to be sought from US, to meet the NATO requirements for ISTAR capability and number of drones and UAVs to be purchased as part of this capability. Army will try to update its current logistic's requirement with a purchase of up to 500 new military trucks, 300 light off-road vehicles and number of other support vehicles. This is likely to take at least a decade due to shortage of funds. Purchase of 30mm RCWS is a priority, 16 of which are already on order, requirement calls for 64 RCWS, this also includes purchase of modern anti tank system for the armed forces to replace current Soviet era systems that are nearing their use date. Army also plans to purchase modern western medium range Surface to air system, with NASAMS 2 being the most likely choice, however shortage of funds might delay the purchase until late 2020s. The budget should slowly increase due to NATO requirement for all its members to spend at least 2% of GDP on defense. Croatia plans to meet that target by around 2025, by which point Croatian economy is expected to reach around 550 billion kuna or just under $90 billion at current exchange rate. With more funds it is hopped Croatia could modernize most of its armed forces to NATO standard without US assistance by this point. Currently the US has aided Croatian Armed Forces modernization and training in tune of around ‚Ç¨120 million per year since 2015 and is expected to increase these slightly in coming years as Croatia is about to purchase UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters and number of other systems. Other programs: * Equipping motorized infantry battalion (800-1,000 men) with night vision equipment, including advanced optoelectronics and sensors, ground radars, thermal imaging cameras ‚Äì 120 million Croatian Kuna * NBC equipment for biological/chemical- decontamination unit ‚Äì 150 million Croatian Kuna * Procurement of new army engineering vehicles, armored recovery vehicles, mine clearance vehicles and armored personal vehicles designed to withstand mine blasts ‚Äì 320 million Croatian Kuna * Procurement of modern communication and battlefield management systems ‚Äì * Procurement of new logistic and amphibious vehicles ‚Äì 250 million Croatian Kuna * Procurement of 3-4 Artillery Radars ‚Äì 30‚Äì40 million Croatian Kuna * Procurement of 8-12 Mobile air defense radars ‚Äì 200 to 300 million Croatian Kuna * Procurement of Army Field Hospital - 80 to 100 million Croatian Kuna * Procurement of 16 Army Tank transporters, Heavy Equipment Transporters ‚Äì 80 to 100 million Croatian Kuna * Procurement of Bridge laying equipment ‚Äì 100 million Croatian Kuna Equipment The Croatian Army's requirement for personal protection side arms is being fulfilled by the locally produced HS2000 hand gun design, which has also become increasingly popular in the United States and elsewhere. The Croatian Army's current 2 standard assault rifles are the VHS and VHS2. The VHS's family of assault rifles replaced M70 entirely in 2015. Croatian peacekeepers and serviceman who serve on NATO/EU missions tend to be supplied with the German-made H&K; G36C rifle and, to a lesser extent, the US Colt M4 carbine. The Croatian Army inherited large quantities of Yugoslav Army light infantry weaponry, much of it captured during the Battle of the Barracks. These were supplemented by indigenous designs, some of which were very successful and found export markets. During the 1990s, these were perfectly acceptable light infantry weapons; however, with Croatia's entry into NATO, many older Yugoslav-era designs were seen as redundant and surplus to the requirement. Croatia has acquired a substantial quantity of Sako TRG 42 sniper rifles with the aim of equipping the current army (around 7 infantry battalions) with 32 Sako TRG 42 sniper rifles per battalion. Additional equipment, such as optics and grenade launchers, were also obtained from domestic and German suppliers. Machine guns inherited from the Yugoslav era are also being supplemented by a large number of western models, namely FN MAG, Ultimax 100, M249 light machine gun and, contentiously, an ever-growing quantity of M2 Browning machine guns (of which Croatia had some 570 examples at the end of 2010, but numbers are likely to grow to well over 800 by 2020 due to number of new armored vehicles being armed with remote overhead weapon stations. As of late 2017, Croatian Army maintains over 15000 VHS/VHS2 assault rifles in service, of these more than half are newer model HSP VHS-2, with ground forces transitioning to only HSP VHS-2 with in next few years. Army will retain original VHS rifles in reserve, however Army plans to order up to 50 000 HSP VHS-2 rifles. On April 24, 2013 the Defence Minister signed a memorandum with ƒêuro ƒêakoviƒá ‚Äì Specijalna vozila for the upkeep, maintenance and modernization of the M-84 fleet (48 tanks) with the aim to improve the serviceability of the fleet. According to current plans only 4 tanks are to be fully overhauled at cost of $1.8 million or $450,000 per tank with potential for further 44 tanks to be fully overhauled by late 2020 at cost of $20 million or 110 million Kuna. Long-term plans regarding the future role of M-84 tanks in Croatian Army is to be defined by MOD. The new proposed defence white paper envisages only a fleet of 48 tanks. Public consultation is being held as to what direction will be taken in regards to current tank fleet, purchase of new western tanks or further modernization to M-84D (A5) standard. In 2020 MOD announced the end of general revision and start of modernization. The Croatian Army relies on M-80A infantry fighting vehicles, of which there are 128 in service. These vehicles are deployed in two mechanized infantry battalions. Croatian MOD stated that the M-80 will be replaced at some point in the future and that there are no plans to modernize these vehicles. Due to increased defence expenditure, Croatian Government is considering a purchase of new infantry fighting vehicles, although previous SDP government was looking at Marder 1A3 as an interim solution. Current government is keen on brand new vehicle, however due to lack of funds options are limited. One of temporary measures Government is considering is purchase of Bradley M2 Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV) from US, under deal offered by US, Croatia would receive up to 64 Bradley M2 ODS and additional 24 M2s as spares, with Croatian Government responsible for upgrade and overhaul of said vehicles. as vehicles in question are a donation, Croatian government paying only for overhaul and VAT. It is not clear if these vehicles are a temporary measure until funds become available for purchase of modern vehicles such as Puma or CV90. However, these vehicles will not replace current M80A IFVs in service, they will just be added as a 3rd Mechanized Battalion to Medium Brigade, increasing the effectiveness of this particular combat brigade. Since the purchase and equipping of 126 Patria AMV has been posing a significant financial strain on the military budget for quite some time now, the current needs of the Army are going to be met primarily by acquiring second-hand hardware from allied sources. NATO, with the USA being the prime supplier of such vehicles. Previous needs for additional Patria IFVs and Iveco LMVs are now going to be met by introducing large numbers of Oshkosh M-ATVs of which 162 are to be introduced into service in 2014. Cost of the program is merely $10 million, with Croatian MOD only paying for the transport of said vehicles. Under the newly proposed plan, the Croatian Army is set to revive its capability of hitting targets beyond the 10 km range. Current systems in service are all short-ranged with Strijela-10CROA1 (Croatian army's only SAM systems) having a maximum range of 7 km. The purchase of new systems will be highly dependent on price and support packages, with VL Mica, Crotale, SPYDER and NASAMS 2 being among most likely choices. The Croatian Army has relied heavily on Russian and domestically made anti-tank systems and rocket- propelled grenades, many of which by modern standards are obsolete or inadequate. The procurement of modern anti-tank system is being addressed and current plans call for the purchase of several dozen launchers for Patria AMVs which are to be fully integrated with 30mm remote controlled turret. Swedish AT4 systems are viewed as the future unguided anti-tank weapon of the Army and a certain number of these has already entered service. The unguided M80s are being relegated to reserve status while the other domestically manufactured RPG weapon, RL90 M95 is set to remain in active service for some time. Spike and Javlin being main contenders for Croatian army choice of next generation anti tank missile systems replacing older soviet made systems currently in service. up to ‚Ç¨20 million order for launchers will be made in 2017, with up to 64 launchers being delivered to army. Longer term Croatian army requirements call for 200~ launchers including infantry and vehicle mounted. With the end of the conflict in Croatia at the end of 1995 Croatia inherited large stockpile of Yugoslav era weapons systems. Decision was made to modify two battalions of D-30 HR M94 Soviet-made artillery systems to be compatible with NATO firing tables as an interim and cheap solution, with rest of the artillery stockpile kept in prepared state of reediness. The situation is very dire, with the Croatian Army having no artillery system capable of hitting targets beyond 20 km, to avert what was a serious shortcoming the Croatian MOD placed an order for modern NATO artillery system with capability that can exceeds 20 km range requirement. According to media reports, the Croatian MOD chose to purchase 12+3 Panzerhaubitze 2000 (or one battalion) howitzers from the German Army stock for $48 million. The system ended their deliveries in 2018, and all the support infrastructure required including training and logistic and supply trucks.German Howitzers Transferred To Croatia - Defence24.com German Howitzers Transferred To Croatia, in Defence24.com] Croatian Army plans to purchase number of UAVs as part of ongoing modernization plans, longer term armed UAVs are also planned. Currently Army maintains number of UAV types with plans to purchase number of medium-sized UAVs for maritime and border surveillance. 6 Elbit's Orbiter 3b UAVs joined the service recently, however more of the same type are likely to join in coming years. The logistic component of the Croatian Army is being renewed continuously and over the past decade a number of new vehicle have been procured. Stated requirement calls for 1,250 5-10 ton military trucks, 550 4WD Jeeps of all sorts and a number of other support and utility vehicles. In recent times, the Croatian MOD has signed procurement agreements with MAN, Iveco, Mercedes and Astra Iveco. Most notably in recent history was a corruption affair that resulted in the dismissal and subsequent custodial sentence for former defence minister Berislav Ronƒçeviƒá who \\"approved procurement of 33 Iveco Astra Military Trucks at inflated price without holding a public procurement tender that is a standard procedure in any major defence procurement program\\". The Croatian MoD has since purchased a number of new military trucks and 4WD vehicles through public procurement program; the latest being a 2011 procurement of some 80 Mercedes, MAN Trucks and 120 Toyota and Nissan 4WD vehicles. Although, as of late 2012, nearly half of the Croatian Army's logistics inventory is obsolete or near obsolete and in need of a replacement. As of late 2012, the Croatian Army lacks some 400 Military trucks of all sorts. Also, many vehicles in the current stock are quite obsolete and in need of replacing. The problem is furthermore escalated by the fact that the Defence Budget for 2013 has been slashed by 250 million kuna, further reducing the probability of the Croatian Army receiving new logistic vehicles. The Croatian Army is now looking to acquire some German Army surplus stock, in good condition and available for use; 300‚Äì400 Army trucks are needed and it is likely they will all come from German Army surplus ‚Äìmost of them MAN KAT1 army trucks‚Äì and other unspecified vehicles indeed. Currently the army is seeking to acquire a number of 5t, 7.5t and 12.5 ton trucks. Due to a shortage of funds, purchase of brand new equipment is difficult, although the army annually receives up to several dozen brand new specialist vehicles. When possible, the army tries to obtain 2nd hand vehicles from German, or other NATO member surplus stock. The army has a requirement for 1500 trucks of all sorts, however currently it lacks at least 500 trucks and heavy goods vehicles.

The game play has some similarity to the game of dominoes. The card design and feel of the game is influenced by the Hippie movement and the art of Peter Max. The game has been released in two editions. The First Edition deck contained 5 Goal cards, 15 Action cards and 40 Element cards. The current Second Edition deck has 5 Goal cards, 18 Action cards, 55 Element cards and 1 \\"Wild\\" card. Rules and gameplay Each player is dealt a hand of three cards, plus one of five Goal cards, depicting one of the five elements; Earth, Air, Fire, Water or Space (called \\"Ether\\" in the First Edition). Then one card is placed face up on the table to start the layout. The player with the longest hair goes first. The objective is to connect seven cards with your goal element. The goal cards are kept secret during the game play, so you must bluff and block the other players in order to win. On your turn, you draw a card, then play a card next to one of the other cards in the layout in a standard grid-style format. You can only play a card if one or more elements on the new card touches the matching element on adjacent (not diagonal) cards.http://www.looneylabs.com/literature/aquarius-rules The Element cards have one, two or four of the five elements displayed on them. In the First Edition game, the elements were laid out only in vertical or horizontal blocks. The Second Edition added 15 new two-Element cards with the blocks aligned diagonally (corner-to-corner). Other cards in the deck allow you to swap Goals, or alter the layout in some way. These cards are known as \\"Action Cards\\". In the First Edition Game, there were 3 each of 5 different types of Action Cards: *Trade Goals: This card allows you to switch Goal cards with the player of your choice. *Shuffle Goals: This card allows you to gather up all of the goal cards, including those not in play, and deal a new one to each player. *Trade Hands: This card allows you to swap hands with the player of your choice. *Zap A Card: Select a card in play on the table, pick it up and place it in your hand. (When you use this card you are allowed to have 4 cards in your hand rather than the customary 3.) *Move A Card: Select a card in play on the table and move it to a new legal location. In the Second Edition, Shuffle Goals has been replaced by two new Action types (again, 3 of each in the deck): *Rotate Goals: Players pass their Goal cards one player over in the direction chosen by the player playing the card. *Shuffle Hands: The player playing the card gathers all the cards in the players' hands, shuffles them and redeals them evenly, starting with themselves. Also in the Second Edition, special simplified \\"Preschooler\\" variant rules have been included at three levels of play: * Elemental Connections: for ages 3‚Äì4; no Goal or Action cards used; last player to legally play a card wins. * Basic Aquarius: for ages 5‚Äì6; no Action Cards used; play otherwise regular with suggested rule that anyone under age 7 need only match as many Element cards as their age. * Single- Action/Reduced-Action Aquarius: for ages 6 and up; use only one type of Action card to start (Trade Goals is suggested); once players are familiar with that Action, future games gradually add additional Actions until all Action cards are in play. Expansions Looney Labs has produced only one promo card for Aquarius, the Wild card. It behaves like a single panel card of all five elements at once. The Wild card was originally only available as part of the now out-of-print Nanoblanks expansion for Nanofictionary. The Second Edition game includes one Wild card in the regular set. Variants Looney Labs has also licensed the Aquarius format to Covenant Communications, Inc. to produce a Mormon-themed version of the game called Search, Ponder & Play! Based on the First Edition of Aquarius, the five Elements in the regular game have been replaced with 5 photos representing Mormon concepts: the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Pearl of Great Price, Doctrine & Covenants, and the Book of Mormon. In addition, the 5 actions have been renamed (in order listed above) Swap, Stir, Shake, Fetch & Flip. The only major change to gameplay is the inclusion of a score pad and rules instructing the players to keep score through multiple rounds until someone wins with one of each of the five victory elements. The game is available through both Looney Labs' online store and through Covenant Communications' own site.

A comrade of Aeneas, he was a Trojan who was killed defending his city against the Greeks. \\"Ripheus also fell,\\" Virgil writes, \\"uniquely the most just of all the Trojans, the most faithful preserver of equity; but the gods decided otherwise\\" (Virgil, Aeneid II, 426‚Äì8). Ripheus's righteousness was not rewarded by the gods. Ripheus in later works =Dante= In his Divine Comedy, Dante placed Ripheus in Heaven, in the sixth sphere of Jupiter,Paradiso, Canto XX:1‚Äì72 the realm of those who personified justice.Paradiso, Cantos 18 through 20 Here, he provides an interesting foil to Virgil himself‚Äîwhom Dante places in the first circle of Hell, with the pagans and the unbaptized‚Äîeven though Virgil is a major character in the Commedia and for much of it remains Dante's guide through Hell and Purgatory. Although Ripheus would historically have been a pagan, in Dante's work he is portrayed as having been given a vision of Jesus over a thousand years before Christ's first coming, and was thus converted to Christianity in the midst of the Trojan War. =Boccaccio= In Boccaccio's Il Filostrato (1333‚Äì1339), Ripheus is named as one of the Trojans taken prisoner by the Greeks.Il Filostrato, IV.3. =Chaucer= Il Filostrato served as the basis for Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. In it, Ripheo is mentioned as being unable to prevent Antenor from being taken prisoner.Troilus and Cressida, Book IV.50‚Äì56 As Rupheo, he appears once, in final rhyming position.Troilus and Criseyde, Book IV.53 =Jo√£o de Barros= Jo√£o de Barros, who later became one of the main Portuguese historians of the 16th century, while still a young man of the court of King Manuel, wrote a chivalry romanche called A Chronica do Emperador Clarimundo (The Chronicle of Emperor Clarimundo), in which it is reported that Tr√≥ia, Portugal was founded by a Trojan called Ripheus (in 16th- century Portuguese Riphane), who escaped the destruction of his city with the group of Aeneas, from which it split, and moved across the Mediterranean and into the Atlantic until reaching the Set√∫bal Peninsula. There, Ripheus/Riphane's group engaged in a war with a party of Greeks led by Ulysses that established itself in what now is Lisbon, on the opposite side of the Tagus river. This 'transplanted' Greek-Trojan war continued for some generations after the death of this Ripheus.Chronica do Emperador Clarimundo, pages 396-404 (16th-century Portuguese) It is unclear if this Ripheus/Riphane is the same as the one of Virgil, and the authors previously referred to, or just a similarly named Trojan countryman of the most famous Ripheus (the fact that de Barros makes no clear references to the known deeds of the Trojan war past of Ripheus in his book and that in the original myth Ripheus fell in the Greek conquest of the town seems to go against it, but possibly de Barros is basing himself in the Boccaccio tradition of Ripheus having been taken as prisoner by the Greeks having possibly escaped subsequently, and the fact that de Barros refers to Riphane as being morally impressive seem to make an identification of Riphane and Ripheus possible. It could be also debated that post-classical versions of myths making characters dead in the Trojan War survive after it is not unusual, being also told about Hector's son Astyanax to make him survive to found the ancient Gauls and Franks).

The Paris Police Prefecture () is the unit of the French Ministry of the Interior that provides police, emergency services, and various administrative services to the population of the city of Paris and the surrounding three suburban d√©partements of Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis, and Val-de-Marne. It is headed by the Prefect of Police (Pr√©fet de police). \\"La PP\\" (Pr√©fecture de Police), as it is also known, supervises the Paris Police force, the Paris Fire Brigade, and various administrative departments in charge of issuing ID cards and driver licenses or monitoring alien residents. The Prefecture of Police also has security duties in the wider √éle-de-France r√©gion as the Pr√©fet de Police is also Pr√©fet de Zone de D√©fense (Prefect for the Defense zone).√éle-de-France is one of the seven Defense zones of the French metropolitan territory. Since 2017, it has acquired direct responsibility for the three main airports of the Paris area (Charles de Gaulle, Orly and Le Bourget). The pr√©fectureThe term pr√©fecture describes both the administration and the building(s) where it is located. is a large building located in the Place Louis L√©pine on the √éle de la Cit√©. This building was built as a barracks for the Garde r√©publicaine from 1863 to 1867 (architect Pierre-Victor Calliat) and was occupied by the Prefecture in 1871. As it is the capital of France, with government assemblies and offices and foreign embassies, Paris poses special issues of security and public order. Consequently, the national government has been responsible for providing law enforcement and emergency services since the creation of the Lieutenancy General of Police (lieutenance g√©n√©rale de police) by Louis XIV on March 15, 1667. Disbanded at the start of the French Revolution in 1789, it was replaced by the current Prefecture of Police created by Napol√©on I on February 17, 1800. This means that Paris does not have its own police municipale and that the Police Nationale provides these services directly as a subdivision of France's Ministry of the Interior. Policemen assigned to \\"la PP\\" are part of the Police nationale but the Police Prefect reports directly to the Interior Minister, not to the director of the Police nationale (Directeur g√©n√©ral de la Police nationale or DGPN). In Parisian slang, the police were sometimes known as \\"the archers\\", a very old slang term in reference to the archers of the long-defunct Royal Watch. Paris also has the \\"Direction de la Pr√©vention, de la S√©curit√© et de la Protection\\" (DPSP) (Prevention, Security and Protection Directorate) which is composed of Agents with municipal police powershttp://www.huffingtonpost.fr/eric- aziere/le-terme-police-municipale-est-il-tabou-pour-anne- hidalgo_b_8937554.html French titled inspecteurs de s√©curit√© (Security Inspectors).https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=BCFE2EF8DCF619E5A0962C7EB22BA511.tpdila20v_3?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000025507674&cidTexte;=LEGITEXT000025503132&dateTexte;=20120618 French The DPSP reports to the Mayor of Paris. Jurisdiction Paris Police Headquarters at Place Louis L√©pine, 1 rue de Lut√®ce, 75004 Paris (m√©tro Cit√©). The jurisdiction of the Prefecture of Police was initially the Seine d√©partement. Its jurisdiction also included the communes (municipalities) of Saint-Cloud, S√®vres, Meudon, and Enghien-les-Bains, which were located in the Seine-et-Oise d√©partement. These four communes were added in the 19th century to the jurisdiction of the Prefecture of Police in order to ensure special protection of the imperial/royal residences located there. The Seine d√©partement was disbanded in 1968 and the jurisdiction of the Prefecture of Police is now the city of Paris (which is both a commune and a d√©partement) and the three surrounding d√©partements of Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis, Val-de-Marne. This territory made up of four d√©partements is larger than the pre-1968 Seine d√©partement. The Prefecture of Police also has limited jurisdiction over the whole √éle-de-France r√©gion for the coordination of law enforcement, including combatting cybercrime. The Prefect of Police, acting as Prefect of the Defense Zone of Paris (Pr√©fet de la Zone de D√©fense de Paris), is in charge of planning non-military defense measures to keep public order, guarantee the security of public services, and organize rescue operations (in case of natural disaster) for the whole √éle-de-France r√©gion (which is made up of eight d√©partements, the four inner ones being the regular jurisdiction of the Prefecture of Police, and the four outer ones being outside of its regular jurisdiction). As such, he coordinates the work of the departmental pr√©fets of √éle-de-France. Nomination and missions Headed by a prefect titled The \\"Prefect of Police\\", who (as are all prefects) is named by the President in the Council of Ministers, and operates under the Minister of the Interior, commands the Prefecture which is responsible for the following: * security of Paris, if necessary in collaboration with the military; * issuing identification cards, driver's licenses, passports, residential and work permits for foreigners; * motor vehicle registration and traffic control; * registration of associations, and their creation, status modification and dissolution; * protection of the environment, general salubrity; * determining the dates of discount sales in large stores which can be held only twice a year; * issuing permits to bakeries/boulangeries for their summer vacation to assure that all the bakeries in a given neighborhood are not closed at the same time; * management of police and firefighters. The Prefect of Police can issue arr√™t√©s (local writs) defining rules pertaining to his field of competency. For instance, the rules of operation and security of Paris public parks are issued as joint arr√™t√©s from the Mayor of Paris and the Prefect of Police. Until 1977, Paris had indeed no elected mayor and the police was essentially in the hands of the pr√©fet de police. However, the powers of the mayor of Paris were increased at the expense of those of the Pr√©fet de Police in 2002, notably for traffic and parking decisions (the pr√©fet retains the responsibility on main thoroughfares such as the Avenue des Champs-√âlys√©es, and on any street during the organization of demonstrations). There is also a prefect of Paris, prefect for the √éle-de-France region, whose services handle some tasks not devoted to the Police Prefect, such as certain classes of building permits.

The Prefecture of Police is divided into three sub-prefectures headed by prefects due to their importance. Because the Police Prefecture provides some services that are normally provided by city governments, its funding partially comes from the City of Paris and other city governments within its jurisdiction. In addition to forces from the National Police, the Police Prefecture has traffic wardens or crossing guards who enforce parking rules; it has recently added some wardens that direct traffic at crossroads and other similar duties, known as circulation, with specific uniforms.

The office vanished at the start of the French Revolution and police was vested in the hands of the Paris Commune. Reorganized by Napol√©on Bonaparte in 1800, the Paris Police has been headed by the pr√©fet de police since that time. =Lieutenant generals of police= *Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie: March 29, 1667 - January 29, 1697 *Marc Ren√© de Voyer de Paulmy, marquis d'Argenson: January 29, 1697 -

It was formed in 1991 from what Croatian forces managed to capture from the Yugoslav Navy during the Breakup of Yugoslavia and Croatian War of Independence. In addition to mobile coastal missile launchers, today it operates 30 vessels, divided into the Navy Flotilla for traditional naval duties, and the Croatian Coast Guard. Five missile boats form Croatian fleet's main offensive capability. History =Origins= Since the ninth century, the Duchy of Croatia (later Kingdom) engaged in naval battles, struggling to maintain control over the eastern Adriatic coast and Adriatic merchant routes. Commemorating the first recorded Croat naval victory, when the subjects of Croatian duke Branimir defeated the Venetian naval expedition on September 18, 887, the Croatian Navy Day is celebrated yearly on September 18. Croatian fleet was particularly active under duke Domagoj and king Petar Kre≈°imir IV. Royal Croatian-Dalmatian navy with 12-15 galleys existed under Louis I in central Dalmatia in the 14th century. Afterwards Venetian Republic established control over most of Croatian coast until 1797. Modern foundations of Croatian Navy can be traced back to Austro-Hungarian Navy (1797-1918) and Yugoslav Navy (1918-1941, 1942-1991) when Croatia was a constituent part of these states. First Croatian flag ever hoisted on a naval ship, Pula, October 31st, 1918, with the crews saluting the flag When Croatia was a part of Austria-Hungary, its Adriatic coast was essentially the only access to sea this Central European state had. A Habsburg arsenal and a naval shipyard were established in Kraljevica in 1729, while naval bases, schools, shipyards, headquarters and a naval academy were later set up in Pula and Rijeka. Navy's emblem included Croatian coat of arms. Many highly ranked officers came from Croatia: grand admiral Maximilian Njegovan, ship-of-the-line captain Janko Vukoviƒá Podkapelski and others. In 1885, 44.9% of sailors and NCOs and 10.3% of naval officers came from Croatia, while in 1910 those shares dropped to 29.8% and 9.8%, respectively.\\"Sprachen beim Milit√§r im alten √ñsterreich \\", G√ºnter Ofner. Czech military historian Jind≈ôich Marek points out that \\"Croats were more often applied to heavy labour as stokers and deck hands\\" and were at comparative disadvantage due to their lack of swimming and German language skills. At the end of October 1918, while Austria-Hungary was falling apart and the war was drawing to an end, emperor Charles handed the Navy over to the Zagreb People's Council, which promoted Vukoviƒá to the rank of the rear admiral and appointed him as a fleet commander. Croatian flag was hoisted on all ships in Pula (including, most notably, the flagship SMS Viribus Unitis) and some in Kotor, but the Entente navies soon captured nearly all vessels and divided them among themselves. Croatian officers and sailors continued to man the new Royal Yugoslav Navy (1918-1941) until its demise during the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. During World War II Croatian partisans formed a guerilla Partisan Navy consisting of makeshift vessels in 1942, resisting Italian (and later German) occupation of the Adriatic. In the later phases of the war, they cooperated closely with the Royal Navy. After the war, Socialist Yugoslav Navy, sprung up from the partisan navy, had Split as its HQ and mainly used shipyards in ≈†ibenik, Split, Kraljevica, Rijeka and Pula. =Modern Croatian Navy= In 1991, after the federal Yugoslav armed forces sided with Serbian leadership under Milo≈°eviƒá and decided to fight against democratically elected Croatian government which proclaimed Croatia's independence, ethnically Croat naval officers and rank-and-file led by admiral Sveto Letica started forming new Croatian Navy. Using coastal artillery batteries they forced Yugoslav ships to retreat from Croatian territorial waters while in commando actions Croatian forces and shipyard personnel seized naval equipment and 35 vessels. At least three Yugoslav patrol boats were disabled in action and two minesweepers sunk. The Croatian Navy played an important role during the Croatian War of Independence (1991-1995), especially after acquiring strategically important RBS-15B missiles. After the war RTOP-42 Dubrovnik In 2004 Croatia joined the NATO and the Navy was restructured in the process. In addition to that, in 2007 it was reorganized by dividing the personnel and vessels with newly founded Coast Guard, which remained a part of the Navy. Two former Helsinki class missile boats, FNS Oulu and FNS Kotka, were acquired from Finland. They were renamed Vukovar and Dubrovnik respectively (both cities were almost completely destroyed by Serbian and Montenegro shelling during Croatian war of independence), and entered service in December, 2008. They were acquired along with a considerable amount of spare parts (most notably three MTU engines - to be installed on Kralj class vesselshomeland war) due to a severe shortage of vessels at present. The price of these ships was ‚Ç¨9 million and is considered rather symbolic, mostly because it was a part of the offset deal for the previous Croatian acquisition of Patria AMV armoured vehicles. The ships reached their full operational capability in June, 2009. The 2015 Strategic Defence Review envisages an overhaul and upgrade suitable for 'interception duties' to be completed in 2020. A revised out-of-service date is not known. The Konƒçar class missile boat ≈†ibenik has been overhauled with new turbine engines and radars and is due to remain in service until 2018-2020. The Kralj class vessels were planned to be extensively modernized at a price of ‚Ç¨20 million, but as a result of the recent acquisition of Helsinki class boats RTOP-11 has completed a basic overhaul and engine upgrade worth around ‚Ç¨5 million. RTOP-12 will also be upgraded to this standard. The RBS-15 missile system was due to be scrapped but this decision was reversed in 2014 and an upgrade to 20 units will be completed by 2018. Successful live firing of the upgraded missiles was conducted from a mobile launcher and from RTOP-12 during 2015 (the first missile firing exercise by the Croatian Navy since 1994)\\"RBS15 Successfully Test-Fired By The Croatian Navy\\", Saab Group, 03 November 2015 and again from RTOP-42 during 2016.\\"Successful Firing of RBS15 by the Croatian Navy\\", Saab Group, 27 october 2016 Purpose The mission of the Croatian Navy (HRM) is to defend the integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia, to promote and protect its interest in the Adriatic Sea, islands and coast-lands. It carries and organizes the naval defense of the Republic of Croatia. The Croatian Navy fulfils its role by preparing itself and carrying out the following main tasks: #Deterring the threat to the Republic of Croatia by maintaining high level of competence, training and technical quality of equipment #Constant control of the Adriatic Sea and coast-land and monitoring of foreign warships' movement #Strengthening of the safety conditions on the Adriatic Sea and preserving the integrity of the maritime borders #Implementation of the program \\"Partnership for Peace in the Mediterranean\\" Croatian Navy organization Organizational structure The following commands were created to carry out the mission of the Croatian Navy: =Navy Staff= The Navy Command in Split was reshuffled into the Navy Staff in 2013.Strategic Defence Overview 2013, MoD (in Croatian), p. 19. The Navy Staff is led by a Ship-of-the-Line Captain, who apart from being the chief of the Navy Staff also serves as a deputy commander of the Navy. This position is currently held by SotL Capt. Milan Bla≈æeviƒá. A Command company is attached to the Navy Staff. =Navy Flotilla= NATO Maritime Group 2 (SNMG2) ships with Croatian missile boats ≈†ibenik and Zvonimir during an exercise The Navy flotilla handles all tasks regarding anti-ship and anti-submarine warfare as well as minelaying and mine countermeasures, anti-terrorist activities and VIP/residential transport. Flotilla is administratively based in Lora naval base in Split. Current commander is ship-of-the-line captain Damir Dojkiƒá.\\"Navy Flotilla\\", Armed forces of the Republic of Croatia. Today it is accordingly divided into three squadrons: *Surface Action Squadron includes 5 missile boats and 3 coastal mobile RBS-15 missile launchers, forming the main offensive capability of the Navy. Four missile boats and one mobile missile launcher have successfully fired missiles in live-fire exercises at sea targets as of 2016. Two Cetina- class minelayer-landing ships have also transported Croatian Army troops and AMVs to a NATO's \\"Trident Juncture\\" exercise in Spain in 2015. *Mine Countermeasures Squadron, currently with one mine-hunter (LM-51), two REMUS autonomous underwater vehicles that were donated by US Navy in October 2016.\\"Podvodna vozila Remus stigla u HRM\\", defender.hr *Support Squadron with various tugs and other vessels. *Naval infantry company at Ploƒçe =Coast guard= Croatian Air Force Pilatus PC-9 are operationally attached to Croatian Coast Guard for maritime patrol duties The Coast Guard, founded in 2007, deals with peacetime duties, e.g. environment protection, fishing control, control of tankers, ballast waters, anti-terrorist activities, combating narcotics and trafficking of people etc.\\"Interview with Admiral Kardum\\" , Hrvatski vojnik, 2005. The Coast Guard's mission is to protect sovereign rights and carry out Croatia's jurisdiction in the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone, the continental shelf and the high seas. It also monitors vessels in the Croatian territorial waters. It provided training ship B≈†-72 Andrija Mohoroviƒçiƒá to EU's Operation Triton, rescuing migrants off the coast of Sicily in 2015. Its current commander is ship-of-the-line captain Ivo Raffanelli. It consists of two squadrons: * 1st Coast Guard Squadron, based in Split with two former Yugoslav Mirna class patrol boats and other vessels * 2nd Coast Guard Squadron, based in Pula handles Coast Guard tasks in northern Adriatic with two Mirna-class patrol boats and other vessels. Four Air Force Mil Mi-8MTV-1 helicopters (based at Divulje airfield near Split) and two Pilatus PC-9 planes (based at Zemunik Air Base) are operationally attached to the Coast Guard for maritime SAR and navy support and maritime patrol duties, respectively. =Sea Surveillance Battalion= The Sea Surveillance Battalion operates four Enhanced Peregrine naval radar posts at Lastovo, Dugi Otok, Mljet and Vis and additional nine GEM SC-2050XS naval radar posts at Savudrija, Brijuni, Mali Lo≈°inj, Dugi Otok, ≈Ωirje, Vis, Lastovo, Mljet and Molunat. The battalion also operates the navy's signals and communications equipment. =Split naval base= The Split naval base's task is to manage the Lora Naval Base in northern part of Split, including \\"St. Nicholas\\" naval barracks, and to provide logistic support for the ships and vessels in Pula (Naval Detachment North) and Ploƒçe (Naval Detachment South). It also manages Naval Training Center in Split and a medical center specifically designed to treat maritime disease, such as decompression sickness. Vessels RTOP-11 Kralj Petar Kre≈°imir IV RTOP-21 ≈†ibenik The Croatian Navy operates mostly vessels that were captured from the disintegrating Yugoslav Navy during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991. Most of those have been extensively overhauled or modernized (such as , extensively overhauled in 1991 to match the Kralj class), especially after the navy introduced RBS-15B missiles in its service instead of Soviet P-20s that used to be standard Yugoslav equipment. However, out of five missile boats, main combatant vessels, only ≈†ibenik served under Yugoslav flag. Some ships were captured laid or unfinished in the docks and were finished by Croatians (such as in 1992). (commissioned in 2001) as Kre≈°imir's improved design and Cetina-class minelayer-landing ships were built and commissioned in Croatia (1993 and 1995, respectively). Two Helsinki- class missile boats RTOP-41 Vukovar and RTOP-42 Dubrovnik (built in 1985/6) were purchased from Finland in 2008, while a small minehunter LM-51 Korƒçula was built in 2006. Kre≈°imir underwent an extensive overhaul and engine replacement in 2014 while Zvonimir, being built during international arms embargo against former Yugoslav countries in the 1990s and thus featuring a mix of Russian and western equipment, also underwent an overhaul in 2015. Navy also operates several armed landing crafts, while one school ship (B≈†-72 Andrija Mohoroviƒçiƒá) built in 1972 and one salvage ship (BS-73 Faust Vranƒçiƒá) built in 1976 are a part of the Coast Guard. Croatian forces also operate about 20 other auxiliary vessels and crafts. The Coast Guard's backbone are four Mirna class patrol boats built during the early 1980s. Their radar equipment was modernized in 2007 and stern anti-aircraft guns have been replaced with a hoist with semi-rigid-hulled inflatable boats in 2009-2012 to help in their intercepting duties. These aging patrol boats will be replaced in 2016-9 with 5 OOB-39 project ships currently under construction in Brodosplit shipyard, which is the first major modernization of Croatian Navy in a while. Construction of the first out of the projected 5 vessels was scheduled to start in 2007, however the international tender for the construction of 5 vessels was published only on April 24, 2013. The tender called for the acquisition of a total of 5 inshore patrol boats which are to be 43.5 meters long, with a displacement of roughly 220 tons and a maximum sustained speed of at least 28 knots. They will be armed with a 30mm Typhoon Weapon System stabilized remote weapon station and two 12.7mm heavy machine guns along with a MANPADS launcher. The order was placed with Brodosplit in April 2015 and the keel of the first ship was laid in September of the same year. As projected, the first vessel is to enter service in the beginning of 2017, the second and third in 2017, the fourth in 2018 and the last one in 2019. Units are projected to cost around 10 million euros, respectively. The first prototype ship, OOB-31 \\"Omi≈°\\" was accepted by the Croatian Navy on 7 December 2018.https://navaltoday.com/2018/12/07/croatia-takes-delivery-of- first-locally-built-inshore-patrol-vessel-omis/ Previously reported plans for the purchase of 2-4 offshore patrol vessels (OPV) or corvettes have been cancelled due to budgetary constraints but the 2015 strategic defence review envisages the procurement of a second-hand OPV by 2024.

Between 1857 and 1918 an Austro- Hungarian naval academy was located in Rijeka with NCO training school in ≈†ibenik. Royal Yugoslav Navy founded a three-year naval academy in Gru≈æ (Dubrovnik) in 1923 (later joined by naval staff college in 1937) while a school for petty officers was opened in ≈†ibenik. Post-WWII Yugoslav Navy set up a \\"Mar≈°al Tito\\" naval academy in Split. After a distinct Croatian Navy was founded in 1991, naval education went through various reforms and changes. Currently officers to be commissioned into the Croatian Navy receive their undergraduate education at Croatian Military Academy in Zagreb, which also hosts staff colleges and war colleges. A specific naval education and training centre is set up in Lora naval base in Split. Croatian Military Academy and Split University as of 2016 are in the process of opening a new undergraduate 4-year naval program in Split which is to have two main course tracks: naval engineering and seamanship.\\"Croatian Military Academy Day\\", Armed Forces, December 18th, 2015 Future projects * Overhaul of existing 2 Kralj class fast attack craft, including new engines.

History The restaurant was founded by Anne \\"Annette\\" Boutiaut (1851-1931), who married Victor Poulard on 14 January 1873 and founded the Hostellerie de la T√™te d'Or, finding that customers came and went quickly with the tide, giving them the idea of cooking giant omelettes in a wooden hearth to make them stay. Therefore, the restaurant became most famous for its speciality, Omelette de la m√®re Poulard, a giant omelette several inches thick, made in hand-hammered copper bowls, and cooked over an open fire. The omelettes resemble a souffl√© more than a traditional omelette. In summer 2009 the cheapest omelette on the menu at the restaurant is ‚Ç¨18 per 100 gram (the minimal portion is 250 gram, thus ‚Ç¨45 for the dish).

The Chapel of St Barthelomew still exists, as does the old vicarage, now a boat club. History Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Scammonden or Dean Head was a township covering more than 2,000 acres. In the 1870s it had a church, a Baptist chapel, a national school, a post office and 190 houses. Industry in the village included cotton-spinning and woollen manufacture and there were freestone quarries. A motorway and dam across the Dean Head Valley was proposed in the early 1960s and work began in 1964. Most buildings in the village were demolished or submerged in the reservoir when it was filled in 1969. Geologists considered the church and school would become unsafe once the dam was full. The church school closed in 1970 and is now a private residence. Geography Scammonden is surrounded by the moorland of the Pennines east of Blackstone Edge.

He served as Major Penitentiary of the Apostolic Penitentiary from 2003 to 2009. He previously served as President of the Pontifical Council for the Laity (1996‚Äì2003), Archbishop of Denver (1986‚Äì1996), Bishop of Memphis (1982‚Äì1986), and Auxiliary Bishop of Baltimore (1976‚Äì1982). He was elevated to the cardinalate by Pope John Paul II in 1998. Early life and education James Stafford was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the only child of Francis Emmett and Mary Dorothy (n√©e Stanton) Stafford. His father was the owner of a furniture store, which had been opened by his grandfather (an Irish immigrant) in 1902. He was raised in Irvington, a Catholic community in Southwest Balitmore, and graduated from Loyola High School in 1950. He then entered Loyola College in Baltimore with the intent of pursuing a career in medicine. However, in 1952, the death of a close friend in a car crash caused him to rethink his future and to enter St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore. Stafford attended St. Mary's Seminary for two years before being sent by Archbishop Francis Keough to continue his studies in Rome at the Pontifical North American College and the Pontifical Gregorian University. He earned a Licentiate of Sacred Theology from the Gregorian in 1958. Priesthood While in Rome, Stafford was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Martin O'Connor on December 15, 1957. He was ordained alongside Edward Egan, who would become a cardinal and Archbishop of New York. His first assignment, after returning to the United States, was as assistant pastor at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Baltimore, where he remained until 1962. He then studied at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he earned a Master of Social Work degree in 1964 with a thesis on the foster care of children. From 1964 to 1966, Stafford served as assistant director of the archdiocesan Catholic Charities and assistant pastor of St. Ann Church in Baltimore. He was later named director of the Archdiocesan Catholic Charities by Cardinal Lawrence Shehan in 1966, serving for ten years. In 1970, he was created a Chaplain of His Holiness by Pope Paul VI. He was elected president of the Presbyteral Senate for the archdiocese the following year. He also helped reorganize the central services of the archdiocese and create its collegial structures. Episcopacy =Auxiliary Bishop of Baltimore= On January 11, 1976, Stafford was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Baltimore and Titular Bishop of Respecta by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following February 29 from Archbishop William Borders, with Cardinal Shehan and Bishop Thomas Murphy serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen. He selected as his episcopal motto: In principium erat Verbum, which is Latin for: \\"In the beginning was the Word\\" (). As an auxiliary bishop, he served as vicar general of the Archdiocese of Baltimore from 1976 to 1981. From 1978 to 1984, he led the U.S. Catholic Conference Commission on Marriage and Family Life. He also served as administrator of Sts. Philip and James Church (1980‚Äì1981). He attended the Fifth Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in Vatican City from September to October 1980. =Bishop of Memphis= On November 17, 1981, Stafford was appointed the second Bishop of Memphis, Tennessee, by Pope John Paul II. He was installed on January 17, 1982. During his tenure, he revised the structure of the Pastoral Office, improved the fiscal conditions of the diocese, and concentrated on the evangelization of African Americans. In addition to his duties in Memphis, he was chairman of the USCCB Commission for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs (1984‚Äì1991) and co-president of the Dialogue between Roman Catholics and Lutherans (1984‚Äì1997). =Archbishop of Denver= Following the death of Archbishop James Casey, Stafford was appointed the third Archbishop of Denver, Colorado, on June 3, 1986. He was installed at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception on the following July 30. During his tenure, he hosted the 1993 World Youth Day in Denver, which was the first WYD in North America. In his last year as archbishop, he launched the first capital campaign in forty years and a \\"Strategic Plan\\" for Catholic schools. = Successful Reform of the Denver Roman Catholic Seminary = Upon his arrival in Denver in 1986, Stafford was faced with many complaints about the teaching of the faith at his Archdiocesan Seminary, St. Thomas. Since the 1960s the seminary had been owned and run by the Vincentian Fathers and there were many complaints both about the tolerance in the seminary for dissent from Church teaching and the same among seminary faculty. According to Michael Rose, \\"the problems, moral and pedagogical, were well known and documented\\" at St. Thomas. Rumors of tolerance for homosexual practice had been rampant since the years of Archbishop James Casey. After seven years trying to get the Vincentian Fathers to fix things, Stafford gave up in 1995 and shut the seminary permanently and fired the Vincentian Fathers. He then worked to find a new team to re-open the institution with entirely new staff and under a new name. Although the actual opening in 1999-2000 would be credited to the new Archbishop, Charles Chaput, the entire plan had been crafted by Stafford with the help of a young Fr. Samuel Aquila who would be founding Rector. The closure of four years also allowed a cleaning house among the seminarians and an aggressive new promotion of the priesthood which resulted in growth in those years from 29 seminarians in 1995 to 68 in 1999. Since 2005, when Archbishop Chaput ordained 7 men to the priesthood (the first group only trained at the new seminary), the Archdiocese has ordained an average of 8 men per year. For a Diocese of only just over 300,000 Catholics, this makes it the highest number of ordinations per capita of any Diocese in the USA. Career in the Roman Curia Archbishop Stafford was appointed president of the Pontifical Council for the Laity on August 20, 1996, he became Cardinal-Deacon of Ges√π Buon Pastore alla Montagnola in the consistory of 1998. In 2003, Cardinal Stafford was appointed Major Penitentiary, overseeing matters pertaining to indulgences and the internal forum of the Church. He was thus one of the highest ranking American members of the Roman Curia and the second to serve as Major Penitentiary, the other being William Wakefield Baum. The Major Penitentiary is one of the few Curia officials whose office is not automatically suspended upon the death of the pope, and is the only one allowed to be in contact with anyone outside the conclave. In accordance with canon 354 of the Code of Canon Law, Cardinal Stafford submitted his letter of resignation to Pope Benedict XVI on the occasion of his 75th birthday in 2007. On June 2, 2009, Pope Benedict appointed as his successor Fortunato Baldelli, who was then Apostolic Nuncio to France. Stafford was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. On March 1, 2008, Cardinal Stafford took the option, after ten years as a Cardinal Deacon, for promotion to the rank of Cardinal-Priest, and was assigned the titular church of San Pietro in Montorio. In 2009, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology and inducted into their College of Fellows. Criticism of Barack Obama The online version of the National Catholic Reporter reported on November 19, 2008, that Cardinal Stafford harshly criticized President-elect Barack Obama, saying he has \\"an agenda and vision that are aggressive, disruptive and apocalyptic\\".http://ncronline3.org/drupal/?q=node/2588 The story was first reported by The Tower, the student newspaper of the Catholic University of America, where Stafford made those remarks. Saying that the United States experienced a \\"cultural earthquake\\" when Obama was elected president November 4, 2008, Stafford said the president-elect \\"appears to be a relaxed, smiling man\\" with rhetorical skills that are \\"very highly developed\\". \\"But under all that grace and charm, there is a tautness of will, a state of constant alertness, to attack and resist any external influence that might affect his will\\", he added. The cardinal compared the upcoming years of the Obama administration to \\"Jesus' agony in the Garden of Gethsemane\\". The Catholic News Agency revealed more details about the highly controversial words of the cardinal on November 17, 2008: \\"If 1968 was the year of America's 'suicide attempt,' 2008 is the year of America's exhaustion,\\" he said, contrasting the year of publication of Humanae vitae with this election year. \\"For the next few years, Gethsemane will not be marginal. We will know that garden,\\" Cardinal Stafford told his audience. Catholics who weep the \\"hot, angry tears of betrayal\\" should try to identify with Jesus, who during his agony in the garden was \\"sick because of love\\". The cardinal also attributed America's decline to Supreme Court decisions such as the 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade, which imposed \\"permissive abortion laws nationwide\\".

The causative agents are motile bacteria, Candidatus Liberibacter spp. The disease is vectored and transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, and the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae, also known as the two-spotted citrus psyllid. It has also been shown to be graft-transmissible.Lin, K. H. 1956. Observation on yellow shoot on citrus. Etiological studies of yellow shoot on Citrus. Acta Phytopathological Sinica 2:1‚Äì42. Three different types of HLB are currently known: The heat-tolerant Asian form, and the heat-sensitive African and American forms. The disease was first described in 1929 and first reported in China in 1943. The African variation was first reported in 1947 in South Africa, where it is still widespread. Eventually, it affected the United States, reaching Florida in 2005. Within three years, it had spread to the majority of citrus farms. The rapid increase in this disease has threatened the citrus industry not only in Florida, but the entire US. As of 2009, 33 countries have reported HLB infection in their citrus crop. Symptoms HLB is distinguished by the common symptoms of yellowing of the veins and adjacent tissues; followed by splotchy mottling of the entire leaf, premature defoliation, dieback of twigs, decay of feeder rootlets and lateral roots, and decline in vigor, ultimately followed by the death of the entire plant. Affected trees have stunted growth, bear multiple off-season flowers (most of which fall off), and produce small, irregularly shaped fruit with a thick, pale peel that remains green at the bottom and tastes very bitter.Hong-Ji Su (2001-02-01). \\"Citrus Greening Disease\\". Food & Fertilizer Technology Center. Retrieved 2014-05-18. Common symptoms can often be mistaken for nutrient deficiencies; however, the distinguishing factor between nutrient deficiencies is the pattern of symmetry. Nutrient deficiencies tend to be symmetrical along the leaf vein margin, while HLB has an asymmetrical yellowing around the vein. The most noticeable symptom of HLB is greening and stunting of the fruit, especially after ripening. Transmission HLB was originally thought to be a viral disease, but was later discovered to be caused by bacteria, carried by insect vectors. HLB infection can arise in various climates and is often associated with different species of psyllid insects.Andrew Paul Gutierrez and Luigi Ponti 2013. Prospective Analysis of the Geographic Distribution and Relative Abundance of Asian Citrus Psyllid (Hemiptera:Liviidae) and Citrus Greening Disease in North America and the Mediterranean Basin. Florida Entomologist, 96(4):1375‚Äì1391 For example, citrus crops in Africa become infected under cool conditions as the bacteria are transmitted by the African citrus psyllid Trioza erytreae, an invasive insect that favors cool and moist conditions for optimal growth. Citrus crops in Asia, however, are often infected under warm conditions as the bacteria are transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri. The young larval stage is the most suitable for acquisition of Ca. L. asiaticus by the Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri, and some cultivars show greater efficiency in transmitting the disease to the vector than others. Temperature also shows a great influence in the parasite-host relationship between the bacteria and the insect vector, affecting how it is acquired and transmitted by the insects. The causative agents are fastidious phloem-restricted, Gram-negative bacteria in the gracilicutes clade. The Asian form, Ca. L. asiaticus is heat tolerant. This means the greening symptoms can develop at temperatures up to 35 ¬∞C. The African form, Ca. L. africanus, and American form, Ca. L. americanus, are heat sensitive, thus symptoms only develop when the temperature is in the range 20‚Äì25 ¬∞C.Garnier, M., S. Jagoueix-Eveillard, P. R. Cronje, G. F. LeRoux, and J. M. Bov√©. 2000. Genomic characterization of a Liberibacter present in an ornamental rutaceous tree, Calodendrum capense, in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Proposal of 'Candidatus Liberibacter africanus subsp. capensis.' International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology 50: 2119‚Äì2125. Although T. erytreae is the natural vector of African citrus greening and D. citri is the natural vector of American and Asian citrus greening, either psyllid can in fact transmit either of the greening agents under experimental conditions.Lallemand, J., A. Fos, and J. M. Bov√©. 1986. Transmission de la bacterie associ√© √† la forme africaine de la maladie du ‚Äúgreening‚Äù par le psylle asiatique Diaphorina citri Kuwayama. Fruits 41: 341‚Äì343. Distribution Diaphorina citri Distribution of the Asian citrus psyllid that is a vector of the citrus greening disease, is primarily in tropical and subtropical Asia. It has been reported in all citrus-growing regions in Asia except mainland Japan. The disease has affected crops in China, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Pakistan, Thailand, the Ryukyu Islands, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, and Afghanistan. Areas outside Asia have also reported the disease: R√©union, Mauritius, Brazil, Paraguay, and Florida in the U.S. since 2005, and in several municipalities in Mexico since 2009 On March 30, 2012, citrus greening disease was confirmed in a single citrus tree in Hacienda Heights, Los Angeles County, California. The first report of HLB in Texas occurred on January 13, 2012 from a Valencia sweet orange tree in a commercial orchard in San Juan, Texas.Kunta, M., S√©tamou, M., Skaria, M., Rascoe, J., Li, W., Nakhla, M., da Gra√ßa, J.V. 2012. First report of citrus Huanglongbing in Texas. Phytopathology 102, S4.66. Prospects are bleak for the ubiquitous backyard citrus orchards of California as residential growers are unlikely to consistently use the pesticides which provide effective control in commercial orchards. The distribution of the African citrus psyllid includes Africa, Madeira, Saudi Arabia, Portugal, and Yemen This species is sensitive to high temperatures and will not develop at temperatures greater than 25 ¬∞C. It is also a vector of the African strain of huanglongbing (Candidatus Liberibacter africanus), which is also sensitive to heat. This strain of HLB is reported to occur in Africa, (Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Reunion, Rwanda, South Africa, St. Helena (unconfirmed), Swaziland, Tanzania, Zimbabwe), Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. The disease was not reported in the EU or USA as of 2004; however see above. Control Some cultural practices can be effective in monitoring this disease. Cultural methods include antibacterial management, sanitation, removal of infected plants, frequent scouting, and most importantly, crisis declaration. Tracking the disease will help prevent further infection in other affected areas and help mitigate more local infections if detected early enough. The Asian citrus psyllid has alternative hosts that may attract psyllids to citrus plants in the vicinity such as Murraya paniculata, Severinia buxifolia, and other plants in the family Rutaceae. No cure for citrus greening disease is known, and efforts to control it have been slow because infected citrus plants are difficult to maintain, regenerate, and study. Ongoing challenges associated with mitigating disease at the field-scale include seasonality of the phytopathogen (Candidatus Liberibacter spp.) and associated disease symptoms, limitations for therapeutics to contact the phytopathogen in planta, adverse impacts of broad- spectrum treatments on plant-beneficial microbiota, and potential implications on public and ecosystem health. No naturally immune citrus cultivars have been identified; however, creating genetically modified citrus may be a possible solution, but questions of its acceptability to consumers exist. A researcher at Texas AgriLife Research reported in 2012 that incorporating two genes from spinach into citrus trees improved resistance to citrus greening disease in greenhouse trials.R-Santaana (26 March 2012) Spinach genes may stop deadly citrus disease Agrilife Today, Texas A&M;, Retrieved 1 October 2012 Field tests by Southern Gardens Citrus of oranges with the spinach genes in Florida are ongoing. A resistant variety of mandarin orange called 'Bingo' has been bred at the University of Florida. Other varieties can have a partial tolerance to the disease. =Antibiotics= Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture have used lemon trees infected with citrus greening disease to infect periwinkle plants in an effort to study the disease. Periwinkle plants are easily infected with the disease and respond well when experimentally treated with antibiotics. Researchers are testing the effect of penicillin G sodium and biocide 2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide as potential treatments for infected citrus plants based on the positive results that were observed when applied to infected periwinkle. In June 2014, the USDA allocated an additional US$31.5 million to expand research combating citrus greening disease. Certain antibiotics, specifically streptomycin and oxytetracycline, may be effective in the fight against citrus greening disease and have been used in the United States but have been banned in Brazil and the European Union. In 2016, the EPA allowed use of streptomycin and oxytetracyclin on orchards with citrus fruits like grapefruits, oranges and tangerines in Florida on an emergency basis, this approval was expanded and broadened to other states for oxytetracycline in December 2018. Further expansion of medically important antibiotics is proposed by the EPA but opposed by the FDA and CDC, primarily as antibiotic resistance can be expected to develop and impact human health. =Peptide= University of California Riverside announced that geneticist Hailing Jin discovered a peptide capable of treating citrus greening disease. The university entered into an exclusive license with Invaio to develop an enhanced injectable version of the product.

History American Jed Sunden founded the Kyiv Post weekly newspaper on Oct. 18, 1995 and later created KP Media for his holdings. The newspaper, which went online in 1997, serves Ukrainian and expatriate readers with a general interest mix of political, business and entertainment coverage. The 50-member staff is a team of mainly Ukrainian journalists, numbering 35 editorial team members and 15 in the commercial division as of Jan. 10, 2020, including 40 Ukrainians. Historically, the editorial policy has supported democracy, Western integration and free markets for Ukraine. It has published numerous investigative stories, including coverage of the 2000 murder of journalist Georgiy Gongadze, in which ex-Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma is a prime suspect; the 2004 Orange Revolution, in which a massive public uprising blocked Viktor Yanukovych from taking power as president after the rigged presidential election of November 26, 2004; the 2013-14 EuroMaidan Revolution that overthrew Yanukovych as president; the Russian invasion of Crimea; the War in the Donbass; and Oligarch Watch, a series of articles from September to December 2016 about Ukraine's top eight oligarchs. History of ownership The Kyiv Post has had only three owners in its existence, Sunden, Mohammad Zahoor, a native of Pakistan, and Adnan Kivan, a native of Syria. Sunden's KP Media sold the newspaper to British citizen Zahoor on July 28, 2009.Letter from the publisher, Kyiv Post (November 19, 2009) Zahoor owns the ISTIL Group and is a former steel mill owner in Donetsk.Mohammad Zahoor buys Kyiv Post for an estimated $1.1 million, Kyiv Post (July 30, 2009) Zahoor published the newspaper through his Public Media company. In an interview with the Kyiv Post published on August 6, 2009, Zahoor pledged to revive the newspaper and adhere to its tradition of editorial independence. On 21 March 2018, Odesa-based businessman Adnan Kivan a Syrian native and Ukrainian citizen, purchased the Kyiv Post from Zahoor for a selling price both said was more than $3.5 million. Kivan pledged editorial independence of journalists in an interview with Kyiv Post chief editor Brian Bonner. The newspaper is operated by his Businessgroup LLC. Kivan owns the KADORR Group of companies that specializes in construction and agriculture. His wife, Olga, and three children participate in his business. He used to be active in metals trading in the Black Sea port city from 1991-2007. Sunden created the newspaper in the early years following the collapse of the Soviet Union, starting with $8,000 in capital, three computers and a staff of seven people working from a small flat in Kyiv. The first 16-page issue was put out by an editorial staff of two people. Sunden built the newspaper into a profitable enterprise, one that served the needs of the expatriate community that then regarded Ukraine as a potential hotspot for investment. During Sunden's tenure, he held to libertarian and anti-Communist views on the editorial and opinion pages, but established the business model of editorial independence on the news pages. He said the policy is good for business and news. Sunden was controversial for allowing paid \\"massage\\" advertisements from women engaging in prostitution. After Zahoor bought the newspaper, he retained the entire editorial team. One of his first acts as publisher, however, was to eliminate the paid \\"massage\\" advertisements, saying he didn't want to own a newspaper that promoted prostitution. Zahoor sustained the policy of editorial independence, with limited exceptions. After the newspaper's editors endorsed Yulia Tymoshenko over Viktor Yanukovych for president in the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election, the publisher issued a policy to forbid editorial endorsements of any political candidate or political party, saying the newspaper should remain non-partisan even on its opinion pages. Zahoor relaxed the policy during the May 25, 2014 presidential election, when he and his wife, singer-actress Kamaliya, came out publicly in strong support of billionaire Ukrainian businessman Petro Poroshenko's election as president. While the newspaper was free to endorse any candidate for the election, its editorial board made no endorsement in the contest that Poroshenko easily won. Zahoor's purchase and significant investment improved a newspaper that had been badly battered by the global recession of 2008-2009, a sharp downturn that struck the Kyiv Post particularly hard in October‚ÄìNovember 2008. The Kyiv Post lost advertising and cut costs, but still ended the year in the black, the last profitable year of its existence. In the last months under Sunden in 2009, the newspaper's editorial staff shrunk to 12 members, its page count to 16 and its print distribution to 6,000 copies. Zahoor invested in journalists, increased distribution and improved newsprint. He boosted the page count‚Äîto 32 pages through much of 2010-2011, dropping back to 24 pages again through much of 2012-2013 and then to 16 or 24 pages since then. However, despite the investments, the Kyiv Post never regained consistent profitability, despite further staff and cost cuts, as print advertising continued to shrink, especially in the once all-important sector of employment advertising. However, combined with Zahoor's subsidies, the newspaper has been able to minimize financial losses through special publications, such as the Legal Quarterly, Real Estate and Doing Business supplements, as well as special events, including the annual Tiger Conference and others. The start of an affiliated nongovernmental organization, the Media Development Foundation, also raises money for independent journalism. Kivan's first six months as owner have also seen renewed investment as the Kyiv Post hired three new foreign correspondents - Iryna Somer in Brussels, Askold Krushelnycky, a former chief editor of the Kyiv Post, in Washington, D.C.; and Olena Goncharova in Edmonton, Canada. Somer left her Brussels position at the end of 2018. Chief editors and CEOs The Kyiv Post has had 15 chief editors since its first edition on October 18, 1995. They include Andrea Faiad, Igor Greenwald, Askold Krushelnycky, Tom Warner, Greg Bloom, Diana Elliott, Scott Lewis, Paul Miazga, Andrey Slivka, Roman Olearchyk, John Marone, Stephan Ladanaj, Zenon Zawada and Jakub Parusinski. The longest-serving chief editor is Brian Bonner, an American citizen who became the editor in the summer of 1999 and returned on June 9, 2008. He continues to serve today. Bonner's tenure was interrupted briefly twice. The first came on April 15, 2011, when publisher Mohammad Zahoor fired him for publishing an interview with then- Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysazhnyuk, who is currently on Ukraine's wanted list on suspicion of massive corruption. The 2011 interview with Prysazhnyuk included the agricultural minister's contradictory explanations about who is behind KlibInvestBud, a mystery company which sought to monopolize Ukrainian grain exports. The front-page story was published on April 15, 2011. Bonner's firing lasted only five days, after almost the entire staff went on strike in support of his decision to publish the article. On April 18 in Kyiv, a group of visiting U.S. senators met with Bonner and some Kyiv Post staff members in the InterContinental Hotel in Kyiv and issued a statement of support Zahoor reinstated Bonner as senior editor on April 20, 2011, elevating him to chief editor again later in the year. The incident garnered international attention as a barometer of the state of freedom of the press in Ukraine. One example of the news coverage included a story from The New York Times on April 24, 2011. Zahoor also fired Bonner as chief editor a second time on April 30, 2013, as the newspaper underwent deep budget cuts, but reinstated him on September 1, 2013. After Zahoor's purchase on July 28, 2009, he has had six chief executive officers, including American James Phillipoff (July 2009-July 2011), Michael Willard (July 2011-August 2013), Jakub Parusinski (September 2013-August 2014), Nataliya Bugayova (August 2014-December 2015) and Luc Chenier (August 2016 ‚Äì March 1, 2018). Bugayova was the former chief of staff to Economy Minister Pavel Sheremeta before becoming the first Ukrainian and first woman to be CEO of the Kyiv Post. Bugayova resigned to relocate and take a new job as the director of development for the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, D.C. Bugayova wrote her farewell column \\"Kyiv Post's values are made for new Ukraine\\" in the Dec. 18, 2015, edition of the Kyiv Post. Commercial director Alyona Nevmerzhytska became acting chief executive officer in March 2016 until Chenier took over in August 2016. After Chenier's departure on March 1, 2018, Brian Bonner took over the duties of the CEO but retained his title as chief editor amid the transfer to Kivan's ownership. EuroMaidan Revolution and war in the Donbas In 2013, the Kyiv Post covered what became known as the Euromaidan, and began on November 21, 2013, triggered by then-President Viktor Yanukovych's broken promise to sign a political and economic association agreement with the European Union. The Kyiv Post published hundreds of stories in print and online about the revolution, which ended in Yanukovych fleeing to Russia on February 21‚Äì22, 2014. The first Kyiv Post story about the revolution was published on November 22, 2013. After Yanukovych and many members of his government took up exile in Russia, the Kyiv Post covered the formation of an interim Ukrainian government, the Russian annexation of Crimea on February 27, 2014, the start of the conflict in the Donbass in April 2014 and the May 25, 2014, election of Petro Poroshenko as independent Ukraine's fifth president after Yanukovych (2010-2014), Viktor Yushchenko (2005-2010), Leonid Kuchma (1994-2005) and Leonid Kravchuk (1991-1994). Awards and recognition The Kyiv Post's longtime motto on its masthead was \\"Independence. Community. Trust.\\" meant to underscore its commitment to high journalistic standards and ethical practices, in contrast to many Ukrainian news outlets where publishers and owners dictate editorial policy and advertising is disguised as news stories through the purchase of space known as \\"jeansa\\" or advertorials. The newspaper changed its official motto to \\"Ukraine's Global Voice\\" in February 2018, when the slogan appeared in the first print edition and on the website home page under the masthead. In 2014, the Kyiv Post staff won the University of Missouri Journalism School's prestigious Medal of Honor for Distinguished Service in Journalism. The award was given to chief editor Brian Bonner and then-deputy chief editor Katya Gorchinskaya, who held the position from 2008-2015, at a ceremony at the journalism school in Columbia, Missouri, on October 28, 2014. Also in 2014, Moscow-based AGT Communications Company released the findings of its survey from November 21, 2013 to May 21, 2014, that found the Kyiv Post is the most-quoted Ukrainian source of news by American and European news organizations and the second-most quoted in Ukraine and Russia, after Russia's Kommersant. The findings were based on citations in Factiva, the Dow Jones research database. Five Kyiv Post journalists have also won six-month fellowships through the Alfred Friendly Press Partners program, administrated by the University of Missouri's School of Journalism. They were Anastasia Forina, who worked at the Chicago Tribune in 2014; Oksana Grytsenko, who worked at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 2015; Olena Goncharova, who worked at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 2016; Yulianna Romanyshyn, who worked at the Chicago Tribune in 2017; and Anna Yakutenko, who started her fellowship in March 2018. She was assigned to KCUR, the National Public Radio affiliate in Kansas City, Missouri. Website, paywall and social media The Kyiv Post launched its website in 1997 under Sunden. Currently, the website is updated seven days a week, approximately 10 hours a day, and includes Kyiv Post exclusive content, news and photos from wire services and aggregated articles from other news sources about Ukraine. The Kyiv Post launched an online paywall in March 2013. The erection of the paywall became financially necessary because of the decline in print advertising in the newspaper industry generally, including at the Kyiv Post. During times of intense national crisis, such as the EuroMaidan Revolution and Russia's current war against Ukraine, the Kyiv Post has relaxed its paywall and made its coverage available freely for a limited amount of time. The website currently provides many categories of stories for free, including its aggregated content, its opinions and editorials and its multimedia offerings, including video, cartoons and photo galleries. In August 2014, the Kyiv Post launched Kyiv Post+, a special public project covering Russia's war against Ukraine and the aftermath of the EuroMaidan Revolution; the coverage continues today, although the marketing campaign Kyiv Post+ was discontinued in February 2016. In October 2014, the Kyiv Post started a Reform Watch project to track the progress under President Petro Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk in eliminating corruption and bureaucratic obstacles to democratic progress and economic growth. Print circulation, distribution The Kyiv Post's print circulation is currently 10,000 copies. The Kyiv Post began selling corporate print subscriptions for delivery in 2011 as it seeks to replace its free delivery policy with paid subscriptions. Nonetheless, free copies of the printed newspaper - published on Fridays‚Äîare available in more than 160 locations, mainly in Kyiv, including hotels, restaurants, cafes, nightclubs and business centers. The newspaper is also distributed in Odesa, Lviv, Kharkiv and Dnipro, among other Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian‚ÄìRussian language website The Kyiv Post launched a Ukrainian-Russian-language version of the paper on July 16, 2010 to reach a mass audience, but discontinued the project in May 2012. During this period, the editorial staff reached a record high of 30 members. Threats to existence The Kyiv Post has withstood numerous threats to its existence since 1995. According to the audiotapes released by Mykola Melnychenko, bodyguard to ex-President Leonid Kuchma, then-tax inspector Mykola Azarov talked about conducting tax audits of the newspaper and other news outlets that criticized the administration. Azarov went on to become prime minister under President Viktor Yanukovych. He has since fled abroad and is now on Ukraine's wanted list on suspicion of massive corruption. During the Yanukovych administration, the Kyiv Post faced and overcame three distinct political threats to its survival during the administration of President Viktor Yanukovcyh (February 27, 2010 - February 22, 2014). *The first came when Ukrainian billionaire oligarch Dmytro Firtash filed a libel lawsuit against the Kyiv Post in the United Kingdom over a July 2, 2010 story about corruption in the gas trade industry. One December 14, 2010, the Kyiv Post began blocking all internet traffic from the United Kingdom (UK) as a protest against English defamation law.Kyiv Post homepage accessed 2011-01-20 from the UK and the Firtash libel lawsuit in the United Kingdom. The case was dismissed on Februbary 24, 2011 because the UK court believed Firtash had no major connection with the country and the UK block was dropped later that year.A libel without a cause, Varsity (24th February 2011) *The second threat came in the form of indirect, but sustained, pressure on the Kyiv Post to soften its news coverage of Yanukovych. The threat came to a head on April 15, 2011, when Zahoor fired Bonner for publishing an interview with a government minister despite the owner's request to drop it, allegedly under pressure from government officials. Journalists on the paper went on strike in protest. Zahoor reinstated Bonner as an editor on April 20, 2011, ending the strike. The weekly newspaper never missed a print issue during the work stoppage and Bonner, who has served as chief editor since June 2008, remained on the job until April 30, 2013. However, there was controversy after Bonner's reinstatement, when two journalists who did not sign the petition in support of him left the newspaper. Bonner did not provide a reason for their departures, with sources indicating it was due to the two withholding their endorsement of him. *The third threat came in the form of at least two offers to buy the newspaper from businessmen close to Yanukovych. Zahoor refused both offers, citing his desire to keep the newspaper editorially independent. However, the biggest threat may be economic, not political. Many Central and Eastern European English-language newspapers, including the Moscow Times, Prague Post and Sofia Echo, have ceased their print publications in light of falling advertising demand and changing readership patterns online. America media analyst Ken Doctor chronicled the Kyiv Post's challenges in an April 17, 2014, article. The Kyiv Post also was featured in the September/October 2014 edition of the Columbia Journalism Review. Under the headline, the \\"Kyiv Post's unlikely success\\" author Oliver Bullough writes that: \\"The more you learn about the Kyiv Post, the more you realize how remarkable it is that it holds its own against these (other media) behemoths. Its newsroom budget is less than $25,000 a month. It has but 19 editorial staff; it has faced repeated attacks from regime-allied oligarchs. The fact its reporting survives at all, let alone flourishes, comes down to the unlikeliest of pairings: a journalist from Minnesota and an Anglo-Pakistani billionaire. Each has his own reasons for loving Ukraine, and the Post brought them together.\\" Investigative journalism and non-profit Media Development Foundation The Kyiv Post is also a center for investigative journalism. Bonner, besides serving as chief editor, was also regional coordinator of the OBJECTIVEPROJECT.ORG - My Future Project Objective Investigative Journalism Project, funded by the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, from 2013-2017 along with Olga Rudenko, the Kyiv Post's deputy chief editor since Oct. 6, 2017. Stories were published at mymedia.org.ua and other news outlets. Ex-Kyiv Post staff writer Vlad Lavrov, meanwhile, is the regional coordinator for the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, whose donors include the U.S. Agency for International Development. A group of Kyiv Post journalists in 2013 launched the Media Development Foundation, a nongovernmental organization that has raised $865,000 in the last five years to support independent journalism in three ways: #Investigative journalism #Student journalism internship exchanges #Training programs for experienced professionals. The Kyiv Post was one of the media outlets that participated in the 2016 Panama Papers investigation. Kyiv Post employees also launched a second nongovernmental organization, the Free Press Foundation, to support independent journalism projects.

There is a mile marker every to mark your location at the trail, useful during emergencies. The trail runs east towards downtown Oakland over the former Orange Belt Railway where it crosses the Florida Turnpike on a converted railroad bridge. The path passes through the Oakland Nature Preserve on the way through downtown Oakland (Mile 2) where there is an outpost. From Oakland to Winter Garden, the Orange Belt Railway and the Tavares, Orlando and Atlantic Railroad ran right next to each other; the trail uses both rights-of-way. The trail runs through downtown Winter Garden in the median of Plant Street where the railroad used to run, passing through the Winter Garden Station (Mile 5). The trail leaves downtown on the north side of Plant Street (there SR 438). At 9th Street, the path curves north (along what had been planned as an extension of 9th Street) away from the old railroad grade, to allow the Florida Central Railroad to continue to serve a customer along the line via a connection from another line. The trail rejoins the railroad grade on W. Crown Point Rd where at Mile 7, the Chapin Station is located. The trail leaves again near SR 429 to avoid a complicated crossing of the freeway. The trail heads north to avoid a golf course, then hugs its perimeter heading north then east, passing under SR429, continuing north, east and then south. The trail heads east returning to the railroad grade once again along Clarcona-Ocoee Rd at the junction with Ingram Rd, where the Ingram Outpost is located on Mile 12. The trail heads east towards Clarcona. The Apopka-Vineland Outpost is located before the trail joins the Apopka-Vineland Road heading north, where it stays along its west side for about and then makes a sudden right, crossing the road to connect to a different railroad grade, the old Florida Midland Railroad, which then heads northward. A spur to Clarcona Horseman's Park Outpost on Damon Rd. continues along the west side of Apopka-Vineland Road. The trail continues along the old Florida Midland into Apopka, where the Florida Midland ended after around 1900. A recent extension takes it north along a new alignment, and then along the east side of Rock Springs Road, to end at the intersection with Welch Road. The section through downtown Apopka, including a bridge over US 441, opened in June 2007. A future extension is planned east along Welch Road to Wekiwa Springs State Park. This bridge was built by Orange County, FL and the City of Apopka, FL over State Road 441 connecting two sections of the Rails to Trails system forming the Orange County Bike Trail. Major sections of the trail are right next to main roads as sidepaths, since the roads were built next to the railroads.

It was named after Colm Cille (St Columba, 521-597 AD), whose monasteries shaped and spanned the Gaelic world of Ireland and Scotland. Scope It involves Scotland and Ireland, but not the Isle of Man, which has its own Gaelic language, Manx. However the Isle of Man has become increasingly involved in the Initiative in recent years. The Initiative provides a channel for interaction, cultural exchange and relationship building over complex geographical and political boundaries. Its activities include community exchanges, cultural events, language courses and an annual youth parliament.

The town is home to the Junior \\"A\\" Ville- Marie Pirates of the Greater Metro Junior A Hockey League. History Already in 1679, the place functioned as a trading post between the French and indigenous Algonquians. In 1720, the North West Company opened a trading post and built a store in 1785, which came into the hands of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1821 when the two companies merged. In 1836, a mission was established, followed in 1863, by a mission founded by the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, who gave it the name \\"Ville-Marie\\". Originally the area was called Kelly Bay in honour of its first settler, James Kelly, who lived as a hermit. In 1874, Oblate missionary Joseph Moffet (1852‚Äì1932) cleared some land and moved to Kelly Bay that came to be known as Baie-des-P√®res (Bay of Fathers). In 1883, he was joined by a group of settlers from Nicolet. In 1886, the Parish of Notre-Dame-du-Saint-Rosaire-de-Ville-Marie was founded, and in 1891, the Baie-des-P√®re Post Office opened. The Village Municipality of Ville- Marie was incorporated in 1897 and the following year the post office was renamed to match the village's name. In 1899, the HBC post closed.

In 2014, he was named a MacArthur Fellow. Early life  Steve Coleman grew up in South Side, Chicago. He started playing alto saxophone at the age of 14. Coleman attended Illinois Wesleyan University for two years, followed by a transfer to Roosevelt University (Chicago Musical College). Coleman moved to New York in 1978 and would work big bands such as the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra, Slide Hampton's big band, Sam Rivers' Studio Rivbea Orchestra, and briefly in Cecil Taylor's big band.Steve Coleman in: Fred Jung, My Conversation with Steve Coleman, July, 1999, M-base.com Shortly thereafter, Coleman began working as a sideman with David Murray, Doug Hammond, Dave Holland, Mike Brecker and Abbey Lincoln. For the first four years in New York Coleman spent a good deal of time playing in the streets and in tiny clubs with a band that he put together with trumpeter Graham Haynes, the group that would evolve into the ensemble Steve Coleman and Five Elements that would serve as the main ensemble for Coleman's activities. In this group, he developed his concept of improvisation within nested looping structures. Coleman collaborated with other young African-American musicians such as Cassandra Wilson and Greg Osby, and they founded the so-called M-Base movement. Research Coleman regards the music tradition he is coming from as African Diasporan culture with essential African retentions, especially a certain kind of sensibility. He searched for these roots and their connections of contemporary African-American music. For that purpose, he travelled to Ghana at the end of 1993 and came in contact with (among others) the Dagomba (Dagbon) people whose traditional drum music uses very complex polyrhythm and a drum language that allows sophisticated speaking through music (described and recorded by John Miller ChernoffJohn Miller Chernoff, African Rhythm and African Sensibility: Aesthetics and Social Action in African Musical Idioms, 1981; CD: Master Drummers of Dagbon). Thus, Coleman was animated to think about the role of music and the transmission of information in non-western cultures. He wanted to collaborate with musicians who were involved in traditions which come out of West Africa. One of his main interests was the Yoruba tradition (predominantly out of western Nigeria) which is one of the Ancient African Religions underlying Santer√≠a (Cuba and Puerto Rico), Vodou (Haiti) and Candombl√© (Bahia, Brazil). In Cuba, Coleman found the group Afrocuba de Matanzas who specialized in preserving various styles of rumba as well as all in Cuba persisting African traditions which are mixed together under the general title of Santer√≠a (Abakua, Arara, Congo, Yoruba). In 1996 Coleman along with a group of 10 musicians as well as dancers and the group Afrocuba de Matanzas worked together for 12 days, performed at the Havana Jazz Festival, and recorded the album The Sign and the Seal. In 1997 Coleman took a group of musicians from America and Cuba to Senegal to collaborate and participate in musical and cultural exchanges with the musicians of the local Senegalese group Sing Sing Rhythm. He also led his group Five Elements to the south of India in 1998 to participate in a cultural exchange with different musicians in the carnatic music tradition.

Frankwell is a district of the town of Shrewsbury, in Shropshire, England. It lies adjacent to the River Severn, to the northwest of the town centre, and is one of Shrewsbury's oldest suburbs. The main road running through the area is also called Frankwell. Frankwell grew up as a port and trading location by the river and on the road to Wales, but across the river from the walled borough of Shrewsbury and therefore beyond the town's jurisdiction. There have been a number of suggestions about where the name derives from, but one possible origin is \\"Frankville\\", which means a town of free trade. Being independent from the larger borough of Shrewsbury gave it a local nickname of the Little Borough, a name which is used to this day. Today Frankwell continues to be a commercial area of the town, lying just outside the town centre, with its own character and identity. There has been much redevelopment recently near to the river, especially now flood defences have been constructed, and new buildings include The Guildhall (originally built for Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council) and Theatre Severn. Early origins Mardol with Frankwell, circa 1500 Frankwell's origins are connected with the crossing of the River Severn from the meander core which forms the centre of Shrewsbury. Water Lane, which still exists today, led to a ford over the river that was probably a crossing point in the early Middle Ages. St George's Bridge, a fortified and partly inhabited structure, was built in the mid twelfth century. This bridge, which also became known as Welsh(man's) Bridge in the thirteenth century, crossed the river from the end of Mardol on the town side to a position close to a former Methodist chapel on the Frankwell side. Although this bridge was demolished in the 1790s, remnants of the foundations and land arches remain. A number of buildings in Frankwell show evidence of Frankwell's medieval development. 92 Frankwell is the surviving half of a two-bay cruck-framed hall house, and 111-12 Frankwell is a pair of early fifteenth century semi-detached houses. Boundaries in the oldest part of Frankwell have been strongly influenced by medieval burgage plots approached from the main street through passages. Early modern period Frankwell was highly prosperous in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. 4-7 Frankwell is an imposing building with ground-floor shops and first- and second- floor workshops above, built in about 1590. 113-14 Frankwell, built around 1620, remains a splendid and imposing half-timbered building. Late seventeenth and early eighteenth century buildings, including the 'Anchor' public house, line the corner to the approach to the old Welsh Bridge. The old Welsh Bridge (St George's Bridge) was replaced by the present day Welsh Bridge in the 1790s. The new Welsh Bridge is located some further downstream from the old bridge. Frankwell today A new headquarters for Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council was opened on Frankwell Quay in March 2004. After Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council was abolished in 2009, it became surplus to requirements and was converted for use as an academic facility for the University Centre Shrewsbury. Frankwell Forge was a small industrial area by the side of the Welsh Bridge, founded in 1878 and closed only recently, in 2004. It closed to make way for the new theatre complex planned for the area. The name of the company which operated the site when it closed was \\"H and E Davies\\". Also in Frankwell is St George's Church and Frankwell Quay (with its small marina/boat yard and the town's only major permanent flood defences). Two bridges connect the district with the town centre - the historic Welsh Bridge and the modern Frankwell Footbridge. Flooding, which affected the district regularly and badly, no longer occurs due to flood defences built in 2002/03. Only the main car park and some houses on New Street are affected by flooding today. Frankwell gained notoriety for the 2006 'Brothel Slayings' in which 2 women were brutally murdered with a blunt instrument. The brothel, now closed, was situated next to the Wheatsheaf pub and is now a tattoo studio.Life and Death tattoos Frankwell holds the County Ground of Shropshire County Cricket Club, which was played on as early as 1862.Cricket Archive ground record See also *Mountfields, Shrewsbury - a distinct area of Frankwell References Suburbs of Shrewsbury History of Shropshire Roads in Shropshire Populated places on the River Severn ","title":"Frankwell"},{"id":"1386888","text":"Interstate 375 may refer to: *Interstate 375 (Florida), a spur in St. Petersburg, Florida *Interstate 375 (Michigan), a spur in Detroit, Michigan 75-3 3 ","title":"Interstate 375"},{"id":"1386897","title":"Terry Crisp"},{"id":"1386899","text":"A 1910 Railway Clearing House map of the interaction of the Oxted line and the Redhill to Tonbridge Line. The Oxted line is a railway in southern England and part of the Southern franchise. The railway splits into two branches towards the south and has direct trains throughout to London termini. It was opened jointly by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and the South Eastern Railway in the 19th century. The line branches from the London to Brighton Main Line (which has two diverging northern branches) at South Croydon in Greater London. The line then passes under the North Downs in two tunnels, and then splits into two branches at Hurst Green, adjoining Oxted in Surrey. One of these branches ends at East Grinstead, the other at Uckfield, both market towns in Sussex. The line between and is double-track throughout, as is all of the branch. The branch has two tracks as far as ; the rest of the line is mostly single-track, but with two short double-track sections (a passing loop at , and a short distance between and just north of ). History =Conception= A line was proposed in 1864 from Croydon to Tunbridge Wells via Oxted by a group of former LB&SCR; directors. Their proposal for the Surrey and Sussex Junction Railway (S&SJR;) was to have the scheme underwritten and then operated by the LB&SCR.; The Oxted line with other railway lines in South London, Kent and parts of East Sussex and Surrey. However, the South Eastern Railway (SER) saw the S&SJR;, and particularly the involvement of the LB&SCR; chairman Leo Schuster, as a significant incursion into its territory. In addition to creating a rival to its own line to Tunbridge Wells, the SER saw the LB&SCR;'s direct involvement as contravening an 1849 agreement between the two companies. In retaliation, the SER put forward proposals for a 'London, Lewes and Brighton' railway together with the London Chatham and Dover Railway. As a result of these difficulties and the financial crisis of 1866-7, the LB&SCR; signed a new agreement with the SER in which it withdrew support for the S&SJR;, and the SER abandoned its scheme. Work on the S&SJR; immediately ceased, but the holding company remained in existence until 1869, when it was merged with the LB&SCR; and then closed. On 10 March 1884, the LB&SCR; and the SER formed a joint venture company, the Croydon, Oxted & East Grinstead Railway. Surveyed and engineered by the LB&SCR;'s Chief Engineer Frederick Banister, the proposed route in part used trackbed constructed for but never used by the S&SJR.; The line was jointly owned and operated until , when it split into three: *to Crowhurst South junction, allowing connection to the SER's Redhill‚ÄìTonbridge line *to , owned by the LB&SCR; but jointly operated with the SER *to , owned by the LB&SCR; with junctions with the Wealden Line, the Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells Central Line, and the Cuckoo Line =Part-electrification= The Southern Railway electrified the Woodside and South Croydon Joint Railway in 1935 but the line closed in 1983. Some of the redundant materials were used to electrify the short section between South Croydon and Selsdon railway station in 1984 and a few electric trains then operated from London to Sanderstead via East Croydon. The section beyond Sanderstead to East Grinstead was electrified in 1987 at 750 V DC third rail. However, the Uckfield branch is not electrified, and is worked by Class 171 diesel multiple units, which replaced Class 205 and Class 207 DEMUs.  Services  Off-Peak service map on the Oxted Line Typical off-peak services on the Oxted Line are: * 2 tph from London Victoria to East Grinstead calling at Clapham Junction, East Croydon, Sanderstead, Riddlesdown, Upper Warlingham, Woldingham, Oxted, Hurst Green, Lingfield and Dormans *1 tph from London Bridge to Uckfield calling at East Croydon, Oxted, Hurst Green, Edenbridge Town, Hever, Cowden, Ashurst, Eridge, Crowborough and Buxted. In peak hours, this service increases to 2 tph. In peak hours, 2 tph between Bedford/Luton and East Grinstead. This service calls at all stations between South Croydon and East Grinstead, except in the mornings southbound, and evenings northbound, it skips stations between Sanderstead and Oxted exclusive. On Sundays, the London Bridge to Uckfield service runs only between Oxted and Uckfield. Oyster and contactless payment cards are valid on the Oxted route as far as Upper Warlingham.  Connections with Heritage Railways  The two branches of the line connect with different heritage railways directly: *the Spa Valley Railway runs from to , where it has restored the disused down island platform and commenced services on 25 March 2011. *the Bluebell Railway runs from to , where it has built a new single-platform station which interchanges with the National Rail station. Through running to Network Rail started in March 2010, when GB Railfreight was contracted to run occasional trains carrying 1,000 tons of excavated material from the Bluebell's northern extension to a disposal site at Calvert, Buckinghamshire. Passenger services started on 23 March 2013. =Former connections and sub-branches= One branch formerly had three sub-branches: *from East Grinstead to: **Three Bridges **Lewes; the northernmost section of this branch is preserved as the Bluebell Railway, operated by steam and classic trains. **Tunbridge Wells. (All three of these terminus towns are served by other lines.) * Ashurst on the Uckfield branch was a junction for Tunbridge Wells (Kent) part of which is used by the 'Spa Valley Railway'. * Eridge on the Uckfield branch is a junction for Tunbridge Wells (Kent) used by the 'Spa Valley Railway' It was until 1965 a junction for Cuckoo Line to Eastbourne. A short stretch of the \\"main line\\", between Uckfield and Lewes is preserved at Isfield as the Lavender Line. Between Hurst Green and Lingfield (in Surrey) there was a connection with the Redhill to Tonbridge line until 1965.http://www.semgonline.com/location/crowhurst-spur.html Until 1983 there was a junction at Selsdon (in Greater London) with the Woodside and South Croydon Joint line to Elmers End.  Proposed developments  A ¬£140,000, six- month study was commissioned by the East Sussex County Council and Network Rail looking into the possibility of rebuilding the line between Uckfield and Lewes. This was set up by the Wealden Line Campaign Group. In July 2008 the Central Rail Corridor Board (a joint group of local councils and stakeholders) study, commissioned by Network Rail, reported that there was not a forecast viable economic case for reopening, citing a ¬£141 million cost and a low anticipated benefit to cost ratio (BCR) of 0.64 to 0.79; in comparison a BCR of 1.5 was the minimum needed to obtain finance for the scheme.The full report by Network Rail, at East Sussex CC - 23 July 2008 =Brighton Main Line 2= The Wealden Line Campaign Group has, in addition to campaigning for the reopening of a line between Uckfield and Lewes, proposed an extension north from to Elmers End.['Could a second main line offer Brighton a brighter future?' Rail Magazine Issue 642, 21 April-4 May 2010, Page36-37]Brighton Main Line 2 website There would also be new platforms at , and of the East Coastway line would be upgraded. The line would branch off the East Coastway beyond . A new Ashcombe tunnel would be bored after crossing the A27 before crossing the Keymer Junction (Wivelsfield) to Lewes line. The line would take back the preserved Lavender Line at Isfield. No stations would be reopened between Lewes and Uckfield, and all level crossings would be closed. A new station at south of the current one would allow 12-carriage trains. The line to would be double-tracked and electrified, with a maximum speed limit of . New passing loops at Eridge would allow fast trains to overtake slower stopping services. The proposal also includes bringing the Eridge to Tunbridge Wells line back into operation, with through services to Brighton from Royal Tunbridge Wells. The line between and / would be electrified with overhead wiring (25 kV AC).BML 2 route plans Instead of carrying on to the Brighton Main Line, the line would branch off at Sanderstead and reopen the former line, but Croydon Tramlink has taken over the section between Coombe Road and Elmers End. The line would join the Hayes Line at Elmers End possibly alongside the proposed Bakerloo line extension to Hayes and then run to London Bridge, London Charing Cross and possibly on to the Thameslink network. There is also a suggestion for some trains to run on the East London line and branch off after Whitechapel to London Liverpool Street or onto a new line to Stansted Airport via Canary Wharf and Stratford. The whole project could see as little as one building demolished. The project would have trains diverted away from bottlenecks at East Croydon and Windmill Bridge junction, and provided more capacity between London and Brighton.

The great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, Ford joined the board in 1988 and has served as chairman since January 1999. Ford also served as the president, CEO, and COO until turning over those roles to former Boeing executive Alan Mulally in September 2006. Ford is also the vice chairman of the Detroit Lions NFL franchise. Ford serves as a chairman of the United States-Mexico Chamber of Commerce. He holds a B.A. degree from Princeton University and a M.S. degree from MIT. Early life and education Ford was born in Detroit, Michigan, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and great-grandson of Harvey S. Firestone. His father was William Clay Ford Sr. and his mother is Martha Firestone. On his mother's side his grandparents are Harvey S. Firestone Jr. and Elizabeth Parke. On his father's side his grandparents are Edsel Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay. Edsel Ford II, son of Henry Ford II and also a board member, is his first cousin. Ford has three sisters: Martha Morse (who has 3 children), Sheila Hamp (who has 3 children), and Elizabeth Kontulis. He, like his great-grandfather Henry Ford, is of mainly Irish, English, and Belgian descent. Ford graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1975. He then attended Princeton University and graduated with an A.B. in history in 1979 after completing a 105-page long senior thesis titled \\"Henry Ford and Labor: A Reappraisal.\\" While a student at Princeton, Ford was president of the Ivy Club and played on the Princeton rugby team. In 1984 he received an M.S. in management as a Sloan Fellow from the MIT Sloan School of Management. Career He joined Ford in 1979 and 1981 held a variety of positions, beginning in product development and on the financial staff, a grooming ground for future executives. He served several years as a mid-ranking executive in product development. He also briefly headed the Climate Control Division (since divested from the company as part of the Visteon spinoff). At the time of the Ford 2000 reorganization, he was in charge of heavy truck operations. =Corporate governance= Ford gave up an executive position in heavy truck program management to become chairman of the finance committee on the board of directors, a non-executive corporate governance position. He was elected chairman of the board in September 1998 and took office on January 1, 1999. Ford added the title of chief executive officer on October 30, 2001, following the ouster of then-CEO Jacques Nasser. That ouster reflected significant differences in corporate values‚ÄîNasser focused on maximizing corporate profits and shareholder value, while Ford was noted for valuing people and tradition. With the retirement of Ford president and chief operating officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed those roles as well. On September 5, 2006, Ford announced that he was stepping down as president and CEO, naming former Boeing senior executive Alan Mulally as his replacement. Ford continues as the company's executive chairman. At the time of his stepping down, Ford was ranked 264th on Forbes' list of top- earning CEOs, at $10,000,000.00 per year.\\"CEO Compensation\\" ‚Äì 251-275 on Forbes.com's top-earning CEO's list. URL accessed September 6, 2006. =Business developments= In 2000, he announced that the company would achieve a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency in the company's light truck fleet, including SUVs, by mid-decade. Under his direction, Ford Motor Company made technological progress toward improving fuel efficiency, with the introduction of the Hybrid Electric Escape, the most fuel-efficient SUV on the market, achieving 36 mpg (EPA) in city driving.Ford presskit display vehicle . media.ford.com. The Escape's platform mates Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute were also scheduled to receive hybrid-electric powertrain options, along with other upcoming vehicles in the Ford product line including the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan. Ford announced that half of the vehicle lineup would be available with advanced hybrid-electric powerplant options by 2010, although the Company's earlier pledge to build 250,000 hybrid vehicles a year by 2010 proved to be overly optimistic and had to be abandoned. Ford also continued to study Fuel Cell-powered electric powertrains and demonstrated hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next- generation hybrid-electric systems. In addition to the Ford Escape, Hybrid Escape, Mercury Mariner, and Mazda Tribute, Ford marketed high efficiency crossover SUVs such as the Ford Freestyle, the Volvo XC70 and the Volvo XC90. Ford also developed new crossover SUVs, such as the Ford Edge, Lincoln MKX, and Mazda CX-7. Ford expanded its lineup of flexible-fuel vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, and dual-fuel vehicles. Flexible fuel vehicles can operate on a range of fuel mixtures ‚Äì such as ethanol-gasoline blends ranging from pure gasoline to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Alternative fuel vehicles operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. Dual fuel vehicles generally have two fuel tanks ‚Äì one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline ‚Äì with a selector switch to choose between them. Vehicles using those fueling alternatives were in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some were available for sale to the public. Ford was committed to sell 250,000 alternative and flexible fuel vehicles ‚Äì the majority of which would be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 ‚Äì in 2006.Innovation technology ethanol Capable Vehicles . ford.com. Speaking at conference in November 2000 in London, Ford suggested that the company might one day offer a service where it owns vehicles and makes them available to people when they need access to them. Market competition, health care, and raw material costs led Ford to announce a second restructuring for its North American operations in four years. Ford's restructuring plan, dubbed \\"The Way Forward\\", reversed a $1.6 billion loss during 2009 in its North American operations. The company returned to profitability in 2010.. media.ford.com. =Fontinalis Partners= Ford has been a vocal advocate for improvements to be made in all modes of global transportation, having stated that governments and private industry would need to rethink transportation infrastructure and technology as the global population expands and the existing infrastructure is unable to keep pace. In January 2010, he announced the launch of a strategic investment firm, Fontinalis Partners, with the purpose of investing in innovative companies developing next-generation mobility solutions. Ford co- founded the firm with Ralph Booth (Chairman and CEO of Booth American Company and a media and telecom investor), Mark Schulz (former head of Ford Motor Company's international operations), Chris Cheever, and Chris Thomas. Personal life Ford is married to Lisa Vanderzee Ford, and they have four children. Ford has been a vegetarian since 1990, and adopted a vegan diet in 2010.

It is a rare type of cancer that bears a resemblance to fat cells when examined under a microscope. It is typically a large, bulky tumor, and tends to have multiple smaller satellites that extend beyond the main confines of the tumor. Liposarcomas, like all sarcomas, are rare. Signs and symptoms Left leg swelling caused by underlying liposarcoma Patients usually note a deep-seated mass in their soft tissue. Only when the tumor is very large do symptoms of pain or functional disturbances occur. Retroperitoneal tumors may present themselves with signs of weight loss and emaciation and abdominal pain. These tumor may also compress the kidney or ureter, leading to kidney failure. Diagnosis CT image showing a lesion that proved to be a liposarcoma The diagnosis is established by histologic examination of the tissue, i.e., biopsy or excision. Lipoblasts are often present; these are cells with an abundant clear multivacuolated cytoplasm and an eccentric darkly staining nucleus that is indented by the vacuoles. =Medical imaging= Ultrasonography may not be able to distinguish a liposarcoma from a benign lipoma, and therefore, MRI is the initial imaging of choice.

Known for its poets, culture, and Afro-Cuban folklore, it is located on the northern shore of the island of Cuba, on the Bay of Matanzas (Spanish Bahia de Matanzas), east of the capital Havana and west of the resort town of Varadero. Matanzas is called the City of Bridges, for the seventeen bridges that cross the three rivers that traverse the city (Rio Yumuri, San Juan, and Canimar). For this reason it was referred to as the \\"Venice of Cuba.\\" It was also called \\"La Atenas de Cuba\\" (\\"The Athens of Cuba\\") for its poets. Matanzas is known as the birthplace of the music and dance traditions danz√≥n and rumba. History Libertad Square in Matanzas city Necropolis de San Carlos Borromeo Matanzas was founded in 1693 as San Carlos y San Severino de Matanzas. This followed a royal decree (\\"real c√©dula\\") issued on September 25, 1690, which decreed that the bay and port of Matanzas be settled by 30 families from the Canary Islands. Matanzas was one of the regions that saw intensive development of sugar plantations during the colonial era. Consequently, many African slaves were imported to support the sugar industry, particularly during the first half of the nineteenth century. For example, in 1792 there were 1900 slaves in Matanzas, roughly 30% of its population. In 1817, the slave population of Matanzas had grown to 10,773, comprising nearly 50% of the overall population. By 1841, 53,331 slaves made up 62.7% of the population of Matanzas.Bergad, Laird W. Cuban Rural Society in the Nineteenth Century: The Social and Economic History of Monoculture in Matanzas. Princeton University Press, 1990. Census figures for 1859 put the Matanzas slave population at 104,519. Matanzas was the site of several slave insurrections and plots, including the infamous Escalera conspiracy (discovered in late 1843). Due to the high number of both slaves and, importantly, free Afro-Cubans in Matanzas, the retention of African traditions is especially strong there. In 1898, Matanzas became the location of the first action in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The city was bombarded by American Navy vessels on April 25, 1898, just after the beginning of the war. =Name origin= The name Matanzas means \\"massacre\\" and refers to a putative slaughter in 1510 at the port of the same name, in which 30 Spanish soldiers tried to cross one of the rivers to attack an aboriginal camp on the far shore. The Spanish soldiers had no boats, so they enlisted the help of native fishermen. However, once they reached the middle of the river, the fishermen flipped the boats, and due to the Spanish soldiers' heavy metal armor, most of them drowned.Matanzas legend (pdf) Only two women‚Äîone said to be the beautiful Mar√≠a de Estrada‚Äîsurvived, the result of being taken by a Cacique. De Estrada is said to have later escaped the \\"power of the Cacique\\" and married Pedro S√°nchez Farf√°n in the city of Trinidad. According to municipal historian Arnaldo Jimenez de la Cal, \\"[i]t was the first act of rebellion of natives in Cuba.\\" Geography Sauto Theater The city is located on the north shore of the island of Cuba, on all three sides of the Bay of Matanzas. The bay cuts deep in the island, and three rivers flow in the bay inside city limits (Rio Yumuri, San Juan, and Canimar). To the south-east, the landscape rises into a hill called Pan de Matanzas, divided from the Atlantic coast by the Yumuri Valley and a coastal ridge. The city of Matanzas is divided into three neighborhoods: Versalles, Matanzas, and Pueblo Nuevo. The municipality is divided into the barrios of Bachicha, Bail√©n, Barracones, Bellamar, Camarioca, C√°rcel, Ceiba Mocha, Col√≥n, Corral Nuevo, Guan√°bana, Ojo de Agua, Refugio, San Luis, San Severino, Simpson y Monserrate, Versalles and Yumur√≠. Demographics In 2004, the municipality of Matanzas had a population of 143,706. With a total area of , it has a population density of .  Infrastructure  =Transportation= Air Matanzas is served by Juan Gualberto G√≥mez Airport, 15 km east of the city. Rail The city has two railway stations. The main station is on the main line from Havana to Santiago de Cuba. The electrified Hershey train operates by a different route to Havana from a separate station in the barrio of Versalles. Buses Matanzas is also served by Viazul and Astro buses. Tramway After two failed attempts Matanzas had a tramway in 1916 (initially as Ferrocarril El√©ctrico de Matanzas, then as city owned Compa√±√≠a de Servicios P√∫blicos de Matanzas in 1918 and Compa√±√≠a de Tranv√≠as de Matanzas in 1926).http://www.tramz.com/cu/mt/mt.html In 1952 it acquired tramcars from Havana Electric Railway, but converted with buses by new owners Omnibus Urbanos SA in 1954.

He studied electro mechanical engineering at University of Tehran and graduated in 1955. In 1956, Entezam left Iran for study at A.S.T.E.F. Institute (Paris). He then went to the U.S. and completed his postgraduate education at the University of California in Berkeley. Career After graduation, he remained in the US and worked as an entrepreneur.The official web site of Mr. Entezam click on Biography Around 1970 Entezam's mother was dying and he returned to Iran to be with her. Because of his earlier political activities, the Shah's Intelligence Service would not allow him to return to the U.S. He stayed in Iran, marrying, becoming a father and developing a business in partnership with his friend and mentor, Mehdi Bazargan. Bazargan appointed him as the head of the political bureau of the Freedom Movement of Iran in December 1978, replacing Mohammad Tavasoli.http://www2.tulane.edu/liberal-arts/political- science/upload/gasioroski-MEJfall2012.pdf In 1979, the Shah was overthrown by the Iranian Revolution.

Bazargan (later forced into retirement), Forouhar (later killed) and Khamenei (later Supreme Leader) While serving as deputy prime minister in April 1979 Entezam actively advocated the retirement of army officers from the rank of brigadier general. In 1979, Entezam \\"succeeded in having the majority of the cabinet sign a letter opposing the Assembly of Experts\\", which was drawing up the new theocratic constitution where democratic bodies were subordinant to clerical bodies.

Among his works is his noted biography of Ulysses S. Grant. Richardson was shot on two separate occasions, the second time fatally, by a jealous husband of the women Richardson was in love with. Timeline *Born in Franklin, Massachusetts, October 6, 1833 *Obtained first job with newspaper, Pittsburgh Commercial Journal, 1851. *Married Mary Louise Pease, April 1855. *Correspondent for the Boston Journal, 1857. *Edited The Western Mountaineer of Golden City, Colorado, 1860. *Journalist for the New York Daily Tribune. *Captured by the Confederates at Vicksburg, May 3, 1863. *Wife and daughter died. *Escaped Salisbury, NC, prison, December 18, 1864. *Shot by Daniel McFarland, March 14, 1867. *Wrote Through to the Pacific for the New York Tribune, May‚ÄìJune, 1869. *Shot again by Daniel McFarland, November 25, 1869. *Married Abby Sage McFarland, November, 1869; marriage performed by Henry Ward Beecher. *Died December 2, 1869 (McFarland acquitted in a sensational trial). Civil War imprisonment and escape Richardson wrote for the New York Tribune owned by Horace Greeley, and traveled to battlefields during the American Civil War to report on the war, often with fellow journalist Junius Henri Browne. Richardson and Browne were imprisoned for 20 months in seven different prisons, confined successively at Vicksburg, Jackson, Atlanta, Richmond, and Salisbury, North Carolina, prisons. On December 18, 1864, after 20 months of imprisonment, he escaped from Salisbury, along with Browne. They traveled together more than 400 miles through hostile country, and reached the Union lines on January 14, 1865. His list of Union soldiers who died at Salisbury, published in the Tribune, is the only authentic account of their fate. A Tragic Affair Richardson was one of the best known reporters of his age, due to his abilities as a writer and his services (during the American Civil War) as a Union spy. Unfortunately his reputation is recalled as the victim of a homicide that gained considerable notoriety in the Gilded Age. Richardson's wife and daughter had died during the war, and he subsequently met Abby Sage McFarland, an actress married to one Daniel McFarland. McFarland claimed to be a major businessman and politician, but basically he was a violent husband and alcoholic with connections with Tammany Hall. Richardson and Abby Sage McFarland lived together, their friends and acquaintances (including Horace Greeley) understanding Richardson was protecting the woman he loved while she was trying to get a divorce, something that was not well received generally by the public in the 1860s. Allaire stands guard over Daniel McFarland as Albert D. Richardson identifies him as his murderer. Leander P. Richardson Sage McFarland and Richardson got advice from his friend Vice President Schuyler Colfax on using Indiana divorce laws for the fastest results. McFarland shot and wounded Richardson in March 1867, but the latter recovered. But on November 25, 1869 McFarland shot Richardson in the offices of the New York Tribune in front of the night clerk Daniel Frohman (later a famous Broadway producer). Richarson was fatally shot, but lived for over a week. By this time Abby Sage had gotten her divorce, and Richardson married her at a special bedside marriage performed by the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher. The trial was a farce, with Tammany connections and dislike for the people who worked at the Tribune being used fairly shamelessly to protect McFarland. He was shown by his defenders to be a defender of the home and hearth against a seducer, as Harry K. Thaw would be shown to be in his 1907 trial for the murder of Stanford White. McFarland was acquitted among cheering crowds. But his ex-wife did not return to him and spent the rest of her life as Abby Richardson, working in the theater as play reader. She died in 1900. McFarland went west. In the words of the criminal historian Edmund Pearson, it did not take him long to drink himself to death. Looked at today the story has a modern ring because of Abby being the victim of domestic violence. Yet even sixty years later the historian Claude G. Bowers in his partisan history The Tragic Era (1929) showed a mean comfort in the fate of Richardson, and the tarnishing of Beecher, Colfax, and Greeley by the scandal (as though they were responsible, not McFarland). Journalist Leander Richardson was the son of Albert and Mary Louise. Books (reprint edition, June 1, 1967, by Johnson Reprint Corp, ) *A Personal History of Ulysses S Grant.

It is a tourist location due to its white sandy beaches and warm waters. Guardalavaca beach is protected by a large coral reef and is visited by both local Cubans and tourists. Most Cuban workers in the all- inclusive hotels are transported daily in buses from neighbouring cities like Holguin, Banes, and Rafael Freyre, as only a few Cubans live in Guardalavaca due to the small size of the resort. Between Guardalavaca and Playa Esmeralda are dry tropical forest where endemic Cuban birdlife like hummingbirds Cuban emerald can be seen. Endemic Cuban Anole knight anole lizards are numerous in these forest. A daily flea market is popular for handmade Cuban souvenirs and tourists from beaches further away from Guardalavaca centre like Playa Esmeralda and Playa Pesquero come here on excursion. A main tourist attraction is the Taino museum and museum village between Guardalavaca and Banes, and the wildlife trail at Bahia de Naranjo. Bahia de Naranjo also offers swimming with dolphins and a small zoo. Frank Pais Airport is situated approximately 1 hour drive south of the resort and is a reason this area was developed for beach- tourism. Ecotourism and Wildlife tourism trips to Baracoa Tropical Rainforest use the large mass-tourism all-inclusive resorts of the Guardalavaca area due to their convenient location near Frank Pais Airport. Geography It is located on the northern shore of Cuba, bordering Bahia de Naranjo (Orange Bay), and is part of the municipality of Banes. Beaches in Guardalavaca include the main Guardalavaca Beach, as well as a number of smaller beaches located west and east of the main beach. Several beaches west of Guardalavaca have also been developed for tourism but there is not abundant housing for local population and little infrastructure outside of the hotels.

Ten km to the west are Playa Yuraguanal and Playa Pesquero. All of these beaches feature coral sand and are protected by coral reefs and feature all-inclusive hotels. History =Naming= \\"Guardalavaca\\" literally means \\"guard the cow\\" in Spanish. There are several accounts as to how this name may have originated; one version maintains that Guardalavaca is a malapropism for its original name Guardalabarca, meaning \\"guard the ship\\". The area was once heavily targeted by sea pirates, and Bah√≠a de NaranjoBah√≠a de Naranjo at cubatechtravel.com near what is now the town of Guardalavaca is a secluded shallow bay connected to the open sea by a narrow inlet, which made it a proper safe haven to guard ships against pirates. On the other hand, the name may have originated from pirates going after the cattle grazing in the area. As pirates were spotted, the local farmers would thus shout, \\"Guarda la vaca\\" - guard the cow. The Cuban government has attempted on several occasions to change the name of the area as they deem it not to be very appealing; they have so far been unsuccessful.[citation needed] References External links * Populated places in Holgu√≠n Province Beaches of Cuba Banes, Cuba ","title":"Guardalavaca"},{"id":"1386982","text":"The 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards (QDG) is a cavalry regiment of the British Army. Nicknamed The Welsh Cavalry, the regiment recruits from Wales and the bordering English counties of Cheshire, Herefordshire, and Shropshire, and is the senior cavalry regiment, and therefore senior regiment of the line of the British Army. The regiment is part of the Royal Armoured Corps and is paired with the Royal Yeomanry. History The current regiment was formed in 1959 by the amalgamation of 1st King's Dragoon Guards (raised in 1685 by Sir John Lanier as Lanier's or the 2nd Queen's Regiment of Horse in response to the Monmouth Rebellion) and the 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays) (raised in 1685 by the Earl of Peterborough as Peterborough's or the 3rd Regiment of Horse, also in response to the Monmouth Rebellion). The regiment has spent much of its history based in Germany. It served during the Aden Emergency in 1966 and 1967 and its squadrons were dispersed throughout the Middle East during that time. Perhaps the best known member in the 1970s was Captain Mark Phillips, one-time husband of The Princess Anne: they married in 1973. In 1983, the regiment was deployed to Lebanon in support of the allied Multinational Force, in 1990 it was sent to the Middle East for the Gulf War and in 1996 it was deployed to Bosnia as part of NATO peacekeeping forces during the Yugoslav Wars. In 2003, the regiment served in Iraq during the invasion of Iraq providing the reconnaissance and light armour support necessary to allow 3 Commando Brigade's advance north to Basra. On their return from Iraq in 2005, Brigadier Rose of 3 Commando Brigade presented the Regiment with the Commando Dagger in recognition of the superb relationship between 'C' Squadron and the Royal Marines during the liberation of Iraq. It is of note that this squadron had the distinction of spending one of the longest periods of constant contact with the enemy for 20 days or so during this operation. In 2006, the QDG deployed again to Iraq on Op TELIC 8 and oversaw the successful transfer of Al Muthanna province back to Iraqi control. At the end of 2007, the Regiment left Osnabr√ºck and moved to Dempsey Barracks, Sennelager where they trained for a six-month deployment to Afghanistan as part of 3 Commando Brigade. Here they carried out a variety of frontline tasks across Helmand province. QDG were the first Formation Reconnaissance Regiment to deploy to Helmand as the Intelligence, Surveillance and Target Acquisition Group (ISTAR Gp) on Operation HERRICK 15 in 2011. The ISTAR Gp consisted of HQ Squadron, 'C' Squadron, 'D' Squadron QRH, an Intelligence Company, K Battery 5 Regt RA and 11 UAV Battery with 'B' Squadron initially detached to the Danish Battlegroup but joining the remainder of the Regiment towards the end of the tour. The regiment celebrated its fiftieth anniversary on 31 July 2009 with a ceremony at Cardiff castle and a parade through the streets of Cardiff city, both attended by the Colonel-in-Chief The Prince of Wales. The regiment received a great response from the people of Cardiff. That same year, the unit was also awarded with the Freedom of the City of Swansea. In 2012, the regiment were called in to provide security for the 2012 London Olympics with composite squadrons focused on supporting the beach volleyball and securing the athletes village. In May of that year, there was speculation that the unit would become a victim of the defence budget cuts. As it was one of only three regiments historically associated with and one that still largely recruits from Wales, there was much support from the Welsh public to keep the QDG. However, Ministry of Defence officials announced no such plan has been made. As part of the Army 2020 plans, most units based in Germany returned to the UK and the QDG moved to Robertson Barracks, Swanton Morley, Norfolk in June 2015. They have re-roled as \\"light cavalry\\", using Jackal vehicles. In 2014, the Regiment deployed on the final British combat deployment to Helmand Province on Operation HERRICK 20. The principal focus was the protection and handover of Camp Bastion,'C' Squadron formed the Brigade Reconnaissance Force and the remainder of the Regiment worked with the Afghan Army to develop the latter's capabilities and professionalism. In 2018, the QDG conducted two tours of Poland on Operation Cabrit providing the role for NATO as the enhanced forward presence in order to protect and reassure NATO's Central and Northern European member states on NATO's eastern flank of their security. The future for the QDG sees the regiment deploy on Operation Newcombe in Mali where they will provide the reconnaissance force for the UN.

Uniform, cap badge and march Farrier-Major with the regimental mascot, Tpr Emrys Forlan Jones In 1896, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria was appointed Colonel-in-Chief of the 1st King's Dragoon Guards and allowed the regiment to wear the Austrian imperial coat of arms, which is still used as the regiment's cap badge today; the collar badge is that of The Queen's Bays. Also the regiment adopted an Austrian military march, Radetzky March, as quick march. The current Regimental March is the Radetzky March and Rusty Buckles, the latter being the Regimental March of The Queen's Bays. Other items of uniform draw on the regiment's dual heritage: thus, whilst the cap of 1st King's Dragoon Guards (with dark blue velvet strip and piping) is worn, trousers have the distinctive broad white stripe of The Queen's Bays. Full dress is still worn by some on ceremonial occasions:BBC Hereford & Worcester the 1st King's Dragoon Guards tunic (scarlet with blue velvet facings) being paired with Queen's Bays white-striped overalls.

Knox and his History In 1559 during the Scottish Reformation, the leaders of the Protestant nobility, the Lords of the Congregation, asked Knox to write a history of the movement. This short pamphlet became the second book of the History. In 1566 Knox continued writing the rest of the History while in Kyle in Ayrshire. By this time he probably had completed drafts of the third book which chronicles the events leading up to the arrival of Mary, Queen of Scots in Scotland. Knox mainly worked on the first and fourth books during this time. The first book covers the period from the beginnings of the Scottish Reformation up to 1559. The fourth book recorded the events from August 1561 to June 1564. The fifth book first appeared in an edition published by David Buchanan (a relative of the Scottish historian George Buchanan) in 1644. It covers the period from September 1564 to August 1567 when Mary was forced to abdicate the throne. In Buchanan's biography of Knox, he claims that the History is based on Knox's own manuscripts and papers. In a 1732 edition of the History, an unknown editor attributes the fifth book to Buchanan. It is not known who is the author of the fifth book., Vol. II Analysis Knox's History of Reformation has been used as an historical source since its full publication in 1644. However, its own qualities as a text and its ideological context have only been examined in more recent years, starting with Arthur Williamson of New York University's Scottish National Consciousness in the Age of James VI, (1979). Knox was addressing a problem of legitimacy for the new Scottish church compared with age old traditions of the Catholic church. The task was to provide a reassurance that the new community was meaningful and godly. To this Knox brought his evident skills as a preacher and his doctrine of adherence to biblical texts, with application not just to moral situations but in legal contexts and political argument. Working on these lines Knox tends to indicate clearly in his interpretation of past events whether actions were godly or not, thus imposing an intelligible structure on past events. Roger A Mason, of St Andrews University, summarized this aspect of the History of the Reformation, \\"This kind of thinking, with its strong apocalyptic overtones, is evident on virtually every page of Knox's surviving writings.\\" Arthur Williamson contrasted Knox's work (apart from Book 1), with John Foxe's Book of Martyrs, wherein with a more abundant supply of historical materials, Foxe was able to create a progressive narrative of the Protestant church in England. Knox choose not to include historical or legendary material about the early church in Scotland. In this omission Roger Mason saw the possibility that Knox took his record of events of the Scottish Reformation, and laid the focus of his History on those events, and on the progress of the new Scottish kirk after the Reformation, producing a critique of recent familiar events which may have helped build community consensus.Mason, Roger A., Kingship and Commonwealth, Tuckwell, (1998), pp.165-180, reviewing Arthur Williamson (1979), esp. pp.1-20: Mason, Roger A, 'Writing Scotland's History', SHR, 76 (1997), 54-68 Notes References *, OCLC 5437053. *, OCLC 1296659.

A bullet or pellet, made of soft material and often with a concave base, will flare under the heat and pressure of firing, filling the bore and engaging the barrel's rifling. The mechanism by which an undersized soft-metal projectile enlarges to fill the barrel is, for hollow-base bullets, expansion from gas pressure within the base cavity and, for solid-base bullets, \\"upsetting\\"‚Äîthe combined shortening and thickening that occurs when a malleable metal object is struck forcibly at one end. For shotgun shells which have multiple pellets much smaller than the barrel bore, obturation is achieved by placing a plastic wad or biodegradable card of the same diameter as the barrel between the propellant powder and the pellets. More importantly, \\"obturation\\" refers to the action of a soft metallic cartridge case being pressed outwards against the chamber walls by the high pressure of the internal gases. This creates a self-sealing effect which prevents gasses from leaking out of the breech mechanism, without requiring a complex built-in sealing system. This difficulty with leakage was one of the major obstacles to the early adoption of the breech-loading firearm, as it lowered pressures (and hence velocity), and also created danger or irritant to the shooter. Although there were early paper-cartridge breechloaders, the self-obturating nature of metallic cartridges (along with their waterproof nature) led to their rapid and almost universal adoption, in spite of their much greater cost. Obturation in firearms ammunition With reference to firearms and air guns, obturation is the result of a bullet or pellet expanding or upsetting to fit the bore, or, in the case of a firearm, of a brass case expanding to seal against the chamber at the moment of firing. In the first case, this both seals the bullet in the bore, and causes the bullet to engage the barrel's rifling. In the second case, it seals the case in the chamber and prevents backward travel of gases against the bolt. The thin brass case easily seals the chamber, even in low pressure rounds like the .22 CB, but expanding or upsetting the bullet sufficiently for effective obturation requires sufficient pressure to deform the bullet material. The formula used to calculate the pressure required for solid base bullets is: :Bullet's Brinell hardness number (BHN) x 9.80665 N/kgf√ó106 mm¬≤/m¬≤ = [N/m¬≤] = pressure in pascals :Bullet's BHN x 1422 = pressure in pounds per square inchCast Bullet Alloys and Obturation by Glen E. Fryxell on the LASC website The conversion factor of 1422 is mathematically derived in order to convert the pressure in kgf/mm¬≤ (the units used to measure BHN) to lbf/in¬≤ (the units used to measure cartridge pressure). That is: :Conversion factor = 25.4 (mm/in) x 25.4 (mm/in) x 2.2046 (lbf/kgf) = 1,422. Note that this number should only be used with cast lead plain-base bullets. It does not apply to jacketed or gas-check cast bullets. Below is a chart containing various bullet alloys, the BHN, and the PSI required to expand a bullet to the bore: { ----- ! rowspan=2Material rowspan=2  rowspan=2BHN rowspan=2 colspan=2 Pressure - ! (psi) (MPa) -----  Pure lead  align=right 5  align=right 7,110 align=right 49 -----  1:20 tin/lead  align=right 10  align=right 14,200 align=right 98 -----  1:10 tin/lead  align=right 11.5  align=right 16,400 align=right 113 -----  Pure copper  align=right 40  align=right 56,900 align=right 392 } Pure lead is very soft, and can be expanded or upset by most firearm cartridges, but the pressures required are higher than those encountered in most airguns. To allow obturation in airguns, pellets use soft alloys or flexible polymershttps://www.pyramydair.com/s/p/Gamo_Lethal_177_Cal_5_56_Grains_Domed_Lead_Free_100ct/1100 in conjunction with a thin, concave base designed to expand more easily. Some airgun projectiles are composed of materials harder than the soft alloys traditionally relied upon; these instead commonly make use of elastomer rings capable of providing sufficient obturation under pressurehttp://www.eco- slug.com/pelletcal50.htm. Some firearms ammunition, such as Foster slugs and hollow base wadcutter bullets, also use a hollow base to allow the bullet to expand and conform to a barrel's irregularities, even as the chamber pressure drops as the bullet travels down the barrel (see internal ballistics). For example, it is not uncommon for revolver barrels to have a slight constriction at the breech end where they thread into the revolver's frame; a hollow base bullet will expand to fill the larger diameter of the barrel after passing through the constriction. To prevent excessive deformation in high pressure rifle and magnum pistol cartridges, lead bullets are often covered in copper or another harder alloy. These bullets are generally designed to be compressed upon firing as they leave the chamber and enter barrel. This seals the bullet to the interior of the barrel and engages the rifling. The same principles apply to artillery ammunition; guns are traditionally categorized (in English- speaking countries) as \\"BL\\" and \\"QF\\" guns, or \\"Breechloading\\" and \\"Quick firing\\" guns. \\"BL\\" guns are the older style, and typically use propellant stored in a number of fabric bags, the number of which can be adjusted to vary the range in some cases, as well as a separate shell that is rammed before the powder charge is placed into the breech. Large-caliber naval guns are traditionally of the \\"BL\\" type. Lacking a cartridge case to seal the breech, these guns require a complex and strong breech mechanism to safely seal the breech during firing. \\"QF\\" guns were a later development, usually of small to medium caliber, and came about from the need for rapid firing guns to counter torpedo boats and other small, nimble threats. A QF gun fires metallic-cased ammunition, generally with the shell fixed to it, as a single unit, just like a firearm cartridge. This allows a simpler breech mechanism, such as a sliding block breech, which when coupled with the easier ammunition handling and ramming procedures, allows a much higher rate of fire. Larger guns are most often BL guns, because the ammunition is so large and heavy, that even adding a metallic cartridge case would add a great deal of weight and make handling more difficult, even if you still loaded the shell and propellant separately. There have been exceptions, however; some German naval guns during WWII used fabric powder bags with just thin brass base section, to provide obturation to the breech without adding too much weight, similar to a modern plastic shotshell with a \\"low-brass\\" base for sealing and extraction.

However, given the ever-increasing size of aircraft assemblies, the \\"Sky Box\\" method of shipping parts was developed in the late 1960s specifically to transport parts for the Boeing 747 and other \\"jumbo\\" jets of the time. The \\"Sky Box\\" consists of a two-piece metal shell that is placed atop a standard flatcar to support and protect wing and tail assemblies and fuselage sections in transit (originally, depressed-center or \\"fish belly\\" cars were utilized). Boeing 737 aircraft have been shipped throughout the United States on special trains, including the fuselage. = Chaincars = Flatcars with tie down chains =Bulkhead flatcars= ICE stakesided bulkhead flatcar in the RBMN Duryea yard in July 2012 Bulkhead flatcars are designed with sturdy end- walls (bulkheads) to prevent loads from shifting past the ends of the car. Loads typically carried are pipe, steel slabs, utility poles and lumber, though lumber and utility poles are increasingly being hauled by skeleton cars. Bulkheads are typically lightweight when empty. An empty bulkhead on a train puts it at a speed restriction to go no more than . Since bulkheads are lightweight when empty, hunting can occur when the car is above . Hunting is the wobbling movement of the trucks on a freight car or a locomotive. If the wheels hunt against the rails for a period of time, there is a high risk of a derailment. =Centerbeam flatcars/lumber racks= BC Rail #871027, a centerbeam flat car, leaves Burlington Northern's Eola Yard, in Illinois in 1992. Centerbeam flatcars, centerbeams, center partition railcar, or \\"lumber racks\\" are specialty cars designed for carrying bundled building supplies such as dimensional lumber, wallboard, and fence posts. They are essentially bulkhead flatcars that have been reinforced by a longitudinal I-beam, often in the form of a Vierendeel truss, sometimes reinforced by diagonal members, but originally in the form of stressed panels perforated by panel-lightening \\"opera windows\\", either oval-shaped (seen above) or egg-shaped. These flatcars must be loaded symmetrically, with half of the payload on one side of the centerbeam and half on the other, to avoid tipping over. =Heavy capacity flatcars= A heavy duty flatcar with load in Ontario in 2004 Heavy capacity flatcars are cars designed to carry more than . They often have more than the typical North American standard of four axles (one two-axle truck at each end), and may have a depressed center to handle excess-height loads as well as two trucks of three axles each (one at each end) or four trucks (two at each end) of two axles each, connected by span bolsters. Loads typically handled include electrical power equipment and large industrial production machinery. =Circus use= A circus train is a modern method of conveyance for circus troupes. One of the larger users of circus trains was the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus (RBBX), a famous American circus formed when the Ringling Brothers Circus purchased the Barnum and Bailey Circus in 1907, merged in 1919, and closed permanently as a merged company in May 2017. =Remote control use= Some companies, such as CSX Transportation, have former wood-carrying flatcars rebuilt into platforms which mount remote control equipment for use in operating locomotives. Such platforms are fitted with appropriate headlights, horns, and air brake appliances to operate in the leading position on a cut of cars (i.e. coupled ahead of the locomotive). = Intermodal freight use = This Kansas City Southern Railway flatcar is fitted with fifth wheel couplings for hauling trailers. (2004) A P&O; Nedlloyd intermodal freight flatcar at Banbury station in 2001 A Florida East Coast Railway flatcar carries two shipping containers as it passes through Glen Haven, Wisconsin. COFC (container on flat car) cars are typically long and carry four intermodal containers or two / shipping containers (the two containers are carryable due to the fact that the car is actually long, over the strike plates). With the rise of intermodal-freight-transport‚Äìspecific cars, and given the age of most of these flats, numbers will decline over the next several years. Indeed, when the first well cars appeared, allowing double stacking, many container flats were re-built as autoracks. The few \\"new build\\" container flats are identifiable by their lack of decking, welded steel frame, and standard length. One variant is the car (which usually carries one large container as a load); these are actually re-built old boxcars. Common reporting marks are FEC, CP, SOO and KTTX. The ATTX cars, which feature non- sparking grips and sides, are built for hauling dangerous goods (ammunition, flammable fluids, etc.). A TOFC (trailer on flat car, a.k.a. piggy-back) car, once again, is usually an car. In the past, these carried three trailers which are, as of 2007, almost obsolete, or one large, , two or trailers. As intermodal traffic grows, these dedicated flats are in decline. Most have been modified to also carry containers. One notable type is Canadian Pacific Railway's XTRX service‚Äîdedicated five-unit flats that only carry trailers.  Spine car  A spine car with a 20 ft tanktainer and an open-top 20 ft container with canvas cover A car with only center and side sills and lateral arms to support intermodal containers or semi-trailers. A spine car, trailer- on-flat car, or piggy-back car allows two trailer pups or one semi-trailer up to to be carried. Like well cars, these usually come in articulated sets of five or three. = Skeleton car = Similar to the spine car except that it is designed to carry lumber or utility poles, a skeleton car is composed of a center sill and lateral arms only. No deck, sometimes no side sills and sometimes no end sills. log flat car with side stakes log flat car with side stakesSkelleton logging car, capacity = Idler flatcars = In marine service, the linkspan between a ferry or barge and its dock is very weak. In order to avoid loss of cargo or heavy locomotives, an old flatcar (which is usually the lightest car available) is used as a bridge between the locomotive on the dock and the cars on the ferry or barge. Idler flatcars are also used in oversize freight service, as loads such as pipe often overhang the ends of most standard-sized flatcars. Empty flatcars will be placed on both ends of the loaded car. This protects the cargo ends from damage and ensures that the loaded cars don't bind and damage the ends of adjacent cars. Often a flat car is placed directly in front of a crane (\\"big hook\\") in order to: * provide a way to remove a wrecked car from a crash site. * provide a way to store new or removed rail from a work site. * allow room for the crane's boom while in transit to and from a work site.

Origin  A selection of blacksmithing swages The term \\"swage\\" comes from the Old French term souage, meaning \\"decorative groove\\" or \\"ornamental moulding\\".http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/swage Swages were originally tools used by blacksmiths to form metal into various shapes too intricate to make with a hammer alone. These have handles for holding or pegs for attaching to an anvil, and often a flat head for striking with a hammer. Swage blocks are anvil-like dies with various shapes forged into them, which are also used for forming metal. Swages called \\"fullers\\" are specific to making grooves in swords and knives. Swage is most often pronounced (AHD format: swƒÅj).Headword \\"swage\\". The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th ed. Houghton Mifflin, 2004, 2000.Headword \\"swage.\\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged. Merriam-Webster, 2002. (Online version requires subscription to view.) http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com (Accessed 2007 March 10.) Another (less common) pronunciation sometimes heard in the metalworking industries is (AHD format: swƒïj)Headword \\"swage.\\" Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary, online version. (Accessed 2007 March 10.) (perhaps influenced by sledge as in sledgehammer).  Process  Rotary swaging machine As a general manufacturing process swaging may be broken up into two categories: *The first category of swaging involves extrusion of the workpiece, forcing it through a confining die to reduce its diameter, similar to the process of drawing wire. This may also be referred to as \\"tube swaging\\". *The second category involves two or more dies used to hammer a round workpiece into a smaller diameter. This process is usually called \\"rotary swaging\\" or \\"radial forging\\". Tubes may be tagged (reduced in diameter to enable the tube to be initially fed through the die to then be pulled from the other side) using a rotary swager, which allows them to be drawn on a draw bench. Swaging is normally the method of choice for precious metals since there is no loss of material in the process. Rotary swaging is usually a cold working process, used to reduce the diameter, produce a taper, or add a point to a round workpiece. It can also impart internal shapes in hollow workpieces through the use of a mandrel (the shape must have a constant cross-section). Swaging a bearing into a housing means either flaring its groove's lips onto the chamfer of the housing, or flaring the housing's material over the edge of the bearing. The flaring is done with a pair of rolls that travel around the hole and are fed down into the part, deforming the metal in a controlled, predicted way. Grease is often used to lubricate this swaging process, which is also called roller swaging. A swaging machine works by using two or four split dies which separate and close up to 2000 times a minute. This action is achieved by mounting the dies into the machine's spindle which is rotated by a motor. The spindle is mounted inside a cage containing rollers (looks like a roller bearing). The rollers are larger than the cage so as the spindle spins the dies are pushed out to ride on the cage by centrifugal force, as the dies cross over the rollers they push the dies together because of their larger size.Rotary swaging On a four-die machine, the number of rollers cause all dies to close at a time; if the number of rollers do not cause all pairs of dies to close at the same time then the machine is called a rotary forging machine, even though it is still a swaging process. A variation of the rotary swager is the creeping spindle swaging machine where both the spindle and cage revolve in opposite directions, this prevents the production of fins between the dies where the material being swaged grows up the gap between the dies. There are two basic types of rotary swaging machine, the standard (also known as a tagging machine), and the butt swaging machine. A butt swaging machine works by having sets of wedges that close the dies onto the workpiece by inserting them between the annular rollers and the dies, normally by the use of a foot pedal. A butt swaging machine can allow a workpiece to be inserted without the dies closing on it, for example a workpiece can be inserted and then the dies closed, drawn through until remain and the dies are then released, the finished workpiece would then, for example, be but still of its initial diameter for at each end.  Uses  = Blacksmithing = Swages are used for shaping the metal in various ways, to enhance its beauty or its fit for a desired purpose.English Mechanic and World of Science by R. J. Kibblewhite. Bradley and Co. 1892 Page 53. = Electronics = In printed circuit board assembly individual connector pins are sometimes pressed/swaged into place using an arbor press. Some pins have a hollow end that is pressed over by the arbor's tool to form a mushroom-shaped retaining head. Typical pin diameter range from 0.017 to 0.093 inches (0.43mm to 2.36mm) or larger. The swaging is an alternative or supplement to soldering.Electronic PCB swage pin = Plastics = Heat swaging is a similar process to heat staking, but it involves rolling or reforming a wall (typically a perimeter) of a plastic part to retain another part or component. = Pipes and cables = The most common use of swaging is to attach fittings to pipes or cables (also called wire ropes); the parts loosely fit together, and a mechanical or hydraulic tool compresses and deforms the fitting, creating a permanent joint. Pipe flaring machines are another example. Flared pieces of pipe are sometimes known as \\"swage nipples\\", \\"pipe swages\\", or \\"reducing nipples\\". In furniture, legs made from metal tubing (particularly in commercial furniture) are often swaged to improve strength where they come in contact with the ground, or casters. = Saw blade teeth = In sawmills, a swage is used to flare large bandsaw or circle saw teeth, which increases the width of the cut, called the kerf. A clamp attaches a mandrel and die to the tooth and the eccentric die is rotated, swaging the tip. A much earlier version of the same operation used a hardened, shaped swage die and a hand held hammer. Saw teeth formed in this way are sometimes referred to as being \\"set\\". A finishing operation, shaping, cold works the points on the tooth sides to flats. It might be considered as a side swage. This slightly reduces the tooth width but increases the operating time between \\"fittings\\". Swaging is a major advance over filing as the operation is faster, more precise and greatly extends the working life of a saw. = Manufacturing = When dealing with rubber components with mold bonded metal sleeves, swaging provides a more controlled and cost-effective alternative to 'shooting' the rubber part into a metal sleeve, where an intensive and less dependable secondary operation is needed to finish the product. A metal can with a bonding component (such as phosphate) is painted to the inside diameter, and molten rubber is injected into the metal sleeve. This creates a product that when cooled may be swaged to the desired size. The second reason for this is that the product is more reliable, and during the swaging process the rubber is more relaxed when the outside can to which the rubber is bonded has its diameter reduced, changing the springrate (K) values and damping coefficient (C) of the rubber. After swaging, any inconsistencies in the metal and rubber have been minimized. = Firearms = In internal ballistics, swaging describes the process of the bullet entering the barrel and being squeezed to conform to the rifling. Most firearm bullets are made slightly larger than the inside diameter of the rifling, so that they are swaged to engage the rifling and form a tight seal upon firing. Compare to obturate. In ammunition manufacture, swaged bullets are bullets manufactured by compressing metal at room temperature into a die to form it into the shape of a bullet. The other common manufacturing method is casting, which uses molten metals poured into a mold. Since metals expand when heated and contract when cooled, cast bullets must be cast with a mold slightly larger than the desired finish size, so that as the molten metal cools, it will harden at just the right point to shrink to the desired size. In contrast, swaged bullets, since they are formed at the temperature at which they will be used, can be formed in molds of the exact desired size. This means that swaged bullets are generally more precise than cast bullets. The swaging process also leads to fewer imperfections, since voids commonly found in casting would be pressed out in the swaging process. The swaging process in reference to cold flow of metals into bullets is the process not of squeezing the metals into smaller forms but rather pressing smaller thinner items to form into shorter and slightly wider shapes. Individuals who make their own bullets usually are not aware of available manual specialized equipment and dies required for swaging bullets, and thus choose to make cast bullets. To get high precision results, it is common to cast the bullets slightly oversized, then swage the resulting castings through a die to do the final forming. Since the amount of pressure required to size the bullet is far less than that required to form a bullet, a simple mechanical press can be used, often the same press used for handloading ammunition. All of the larger manufacturers of reloading equipment have abandoned making or marketing bullet swaging equipment due to the downturn in the popularity of the manual methods and the subsequent loss of sales. Currently there are only a few die makers who manufacture and market bullet swaging equipment. Four die and equipment makers, CH/4D, RCE, Corbin, and Custom Maker Kaine Dies, manufacture the bulk of bullet swaging equipment in the United States. = Medicine = In surgery, the thread used in sutures is often swaged to an eyeless needle in order to prevent damage as the needle and suture thread are drawn through the wound. = Musical instrument repair = In musical instrument repair the usual term on both sides of the Atlantic is swedging, not swaging, though it is generally acknowledged that the former derives from the latter. Keyed instruments such as the clarinet, bassoon, oboe and flute need swedging when years of key movement has worn or compressed the metal of the hinge tube they swivel on and made it slightly shorter, so that the key can travel along the rod it is mounted on instead of being held firmly between the posts attaching the rod to the body of the instrument. This gives rise to floppy keys and a poor air-seal and needs to be corrected by lengthening (swedging) the hinge tube. This is a job that needs to be done by hand, and swedging pliers with highly polished oval holes in the jaws to fit common sizes of hinge tubes are often used to achieve this, though various proprietary designs of swedging tools are available to do the same job more efficiently. In piano technology, swaging happens in several areas: key leads, underlever leads, and bass strings. Key leads which, in the piano's earliest history, were actually made using lead, are soft, round chunks that are inserted into holes drilled into the side of piano keys as a means of balancing actions. Key leads vary in size, generally small, medium, and large. Basically, key leads help to make a keyboard's touch light enough to play. Over time, fluctuations in humidity and aging of wood in piano key-sticks and underlevers causes space to develop around leads, causing them to rattle, tick, or knock. Loose leads in underlevers tend to be the most annoying to pianists because it's difficult to pinpoint where the noise (often a \\"tick\\" sound) is coming from. The remedy for the noise is swaging‚Äîsquashing the leads with a short steel rod. Swaging the lead fills the void and eliminates the noise. Bass strings in pianos are generally constructed with round‚Äîsometimes hexagonal‚Äîdrawn-steel cores, over which copper is wound. Especially on round core wire, the last several inches of the area where the winding terminates is often flattened‚Äîswaged‚Äîto create a grabbing point for the copper winding material. = Car styling = As swaging is a technique in which cold metal is formed over a grooved tool or swage, the term was adopted in the field of automotive styling to describe when two panels were brought together, an edge of one panel was swaged so to overlap the other to create the impression of one continuous surface. The term is now often used generically to refer to any similar designs. = Lockbolts = A lockbolt is a fastener similar to a bolt in appearance and function. However, instead of using screw threads which connect to a nut using a turning motion, a lockbolt has annular grooves around the shaft of the bolt (pin). After placing the lockbolt in a hole, a threadless collar is forced at high pressures around the annular grooves, deforming the collar and permanently locking it into place around the grooves. Swaging is the generic term for setting a lockbolt and collar assembly. During the installation cycle of a lockbolt, the collar is deformed around the pin with locking grooves using special tooling. The tool engages onto the pintail, which is an extra portion of pin material protruding past the collar that the tool grabs and pulls. This force on the pintail pushes the joint together, and the conically-shaped cavity of the tooling is forced down the collar, which reduces its diameter and progressively swages the collar material into the grooves of the harder pin. As the force required for swaging increases during the process, the installation is finalised when the pintail breaks off. Lockbolts could be viewed as a heavy-duty cousin of structural blind rivets (\\"pop rivets\\" in some regions), though the way the collar material's plastic deformation is achieved is different. Some tools are capable of \\"setting\\" both variants, as in both cases traction is applied to a sacrificial pintail.

It is traditionally made from solid milled wood or plaster, but may be of plastic or reformed wood. In classical architecture and sculpture, the molding is often carved in marble or other stones. A \\"plain\\" molding has right-angled upper and lower edges. A \\"sprung\\" molding has upper and lower edges that bevel towards its rear, allowing mounting between two non-parallel planes (such as a wall and a ceiling), with an open space behind. Moldings may be decorated with paterae as long, uninterrupted elements may be boring for eyes. Types Table of architecture in the Cyclopedia Decorative moldings have been made of wood, stone and cement. Recently moldings have been made of extruded PVC and Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) as a core with a cement-based protective coating. Synthetic moldings are a cost- effective alternative that rival the aesthetic and function of traditional profiles. Common moldings include: * Astragal: Semi-circular molding attached to one of a pair of doors to cover the gap where they meet. * Baguette: Thin, half-round molding, smaller than an astragal, sometimes carved, and enriched with foliages, pearls, ribbands, laurels, etc. When enriched with ornaments, it was also called chapelet. * Bandelet: Any little band or flat molding, which crowns a Doric architrave. It is also called a tenia (from Greek œÑŒ±ŒπŒΩŒØŒ± an article of clothing in the form of a ribbon. * Baseboard, \\"base molding\\" or \\"skirting board\\": Used to conceal the junction of an interior wall and floor, to protect the wall from impacts and to add decorative features. A \\"speed base\\" makes use of a base \\"cap molding\\" set on top of a plain 1\\" thick board, however there are hundreds of baseboard profiles. * Baton: See Torus * Batten or board and batten: Symmetrical molding that is placed across a joint where two parallel panels or boards meet * Bead molding: Narrow, half-round convex molding, when repeated forms reeding * Beading or bead: Molding in the form of a row of half spherical beads, larger than pearling **Other forms: Bead and leaf, bead and reel, bead and spindle * Beak: Small fillet molding left on the edge of a larmier, which forms a canal, and makes a kind of pendant. See also: chin-beak * Bed molding: Narrow molding used at the junction of a wall and ceiling. Bed moldings can be either sprung or plain. * Bolection: Raised molding projecting proud of a face frame at the intersection of the different levels between the frame and an inset panel on a door or wood panel. It will sometimes have a rabbet on its underside the depth of the lower level so it can lay flat over both. It can leave an inset panel free to expand or contract with temperature and humidity. * Cable molding or ropework: Convex molding carved in imitation of a twisted rope or cord, and used for decorative moldings of the Romanesque style in England, France and Spain and adapted for 18th-century silver and furniture design (Thomas Sheraton)Lewis, Philippa & Gillian Darley (1986) Dictionary of Ornament, NY: Pantheon * Cabled fluting or cable: Convex circular molding sunk in the concave fluting of a classic column, and rising about one-third of the height of the shaft * Casing: Finish trim around the sides of a door or window opening covering the gap between finished wall and the jam or frame it is attached to. * Cartouche escutcheon: Framed panel in the form of a scroll with an inscribed centre, or surrounded by compound moldings decorated with floral motifs * Cavetto: cavare(\\"to hollow\\"): Concave, quarter-round molding sometimes employed in the place of the cymatium of a cornice, as in the Doric order of the Theatre of Marcellus. It forms the crowning feature of Egyptian temples and took the place of the cymatium in many Etruscan temples. * Chair rail or dado rail: Horizontal molding placed part way up a wall to protect the surface from chair-backs, and used simply as decoration * Chamfer: Beveled edge connecting two adjacent surfaces * Chin-beak: Concave quarter-round molding, rare in ancient buildings, more common today. * Corner guard: Used to protect the edge of the wall at an outside corner, or to cover a joint on an inside corner. * Cove molding or coving: Concave-profile molding that is used at the junction of an interior wall and ceiling * Crown molding: Wide, sprung molding that is used at the junction of an interior wall and ceiling.

When the concave part is uppermost, it is called a cyma recta but if the convex portion is at the top, it is called a Cyma reversa (See diagram at Ogee.) When crowning molding at the entablature is of the cyma form, it is called a cymatium. * Dentils: Small blocks spaced evenly along the bottom edge of the cornice * Drip cap: Molding placed over a door or window opening to prevent water from flowing under the siding or across the glass * Echinus: Similar to the ovolo molding and found beneath the abacus of the Doric capital or decorated with the egg-and-dart pattern below the Ionic capital * Egg-and-dart: egg shapes alternating with V-shapes; one of the most widely used classical moldings. ** Also: Egg and tongue, egg and anchor, egg and star * Fillet: Small, flat band separating two surfaces, or between the flutes of a column. Fillet is also used on handrail applications when the handrail is \\"plowed\\" to accept square shaped balusters. The fillet is used on the bottom side of the handrail between each of the balusters. * Fluting: Vertical, half-round grooves cut into the surface of a column in regular intervals, each separated by a flat astragal. This ornament was used for all but the Tuscan order * Godroon or Gadroon: Ornamental band with the appearance of beading or reeding, especially frequent in silverwork and molding. It comes from the Latin word Guttus, meaning flask. It is said to be derived from raised work on linen, applied in France to varieties of the, bead and reel, in which the bead is often carved with ornament. In England the term is constantly used by auctioneers to describe the raised convex decorations under the bowl of stone or terracotta vases. The godroons radiate from the vertical support of the vase and rise halfway up the bowl. **Also: Gadrooning, lobed decoration, (k)nukked decoration, thumb molding * Guilloch√©: Interlocking curved bands in a repeating pattern often forming circles enriched with rosettes and found in Assyrian ornament, classical and Renaissance architecture. * Keel molding : Sharp-edged molding resembling a cross-section of a ship's keel, common in the Early English and Decorated styles. * Lamb's Tongue: Lambs Tongue is a moulding having a deep, symmetrical profile ending in a narrow edge. * Muntin: Narrow strip of wood or metal separating and holding panes of glass in a window. * Ogee: see \\"Cyma\\" * Ovolo: Simple, convex quarter-round molding that can also be enriched with the egg-and-dart or other pattern * Neck molding * Panel Mould: A moulding that is flat on the back and profiled on the face.

Also carved in wood, and used for topiary designs for parterres. * Torus: Convex, semi-circular molding, larger than an astragal, often at the base of a column, which may be enriched with leaves or plaiting. * Trim molding: General term used for moldings used to create added detail or cover up gaps, including corner moldings, cove moldings, rope moldings, quarter rounds, and accent moldings.Distinctive Wood Designs Inc. (2010) \\"Trim Mouldings\\" Use At their simplest, moldings hide and help weather seal natural joints produced in the framing process of building a structure. As decorative elements they are a means of applying light- and dark-shaded stripes to a structural object without having to change the material or apply pigments. Depending on their function they may be primarily a means of hiding or weather-sealing a joint, purely decorative, or some combination of the three. As decorative elements the contrast of dark and light areas gives definition to the object. If a vertical wall is lit at an angle of about 45 degrees above the wall (for example, by the sun) then adding a small overhanging horizontal molding, called a fillet molding, will introduce a dark horizontal shadow below it. Adding a vertical fillet to a horizontal surface will create a light vertical shadow. Graded shadows are possible by using moldings in different shapes: the concave cavetto molding produces a horizontal shadow that is darker at the top and lighter at the bottom; an ovolo (convex) molding makes a shadow that is lighter at the top and darker at the bottom. Other varieties of concave molding are the scotia and cong√© and other convex moldings the echinus, the torus and the astragal. Placing an ovolo directly above a cavetto forms a smooth s-shaped curve with vertical ends that is called an ogee or cyma reversa molding. Its shadow appears as a band light at the top and bottom but dark in the interior. Similarly, a cavetto above an ovolo forms an s with horizontal ends, called a cyma or cyma recta. Its shadow shows two dark bands with a light interior. Together the basic elements and their variants form a decorative vocabulary that can be assembled and rearranged in endless combinations. This vocabulary is at the core of both classical architecture and Gothic architecture.

Purley Oaks, also in Travelcard Zone 6, is nearby.  History  Sanderstead station looking north from the bridge carrying Sanderstead Road over the line. The station was opened on 10 March 1884 by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and the South Eastern Railway with their line between South Croydon and East Grinstead. The population was around 300, rising to 534 by 1901. In 1913 the station was set alight in an act of arson. The suffragette Elsie Duval was the main suspect. The replacement building was weather-boarded, cheap to construct but requiring regular maintenance. An extensive bookstall was on the up platform, and a signal box on the down platform. In 1928 the Southern Heights Light Railway was approved, which would have left the Oxted line south east of the station and finished at . On it would have run a loop service from Charing Cross to Lewisham and then Woodside-Sanderstead-Orpington and back, or vice versa. However, the scheme could not attract investment and was moribund even before electrification of the Woodside and South Croydon Joint Railway as its first stage. This was from Woodside to Selsdon and over a short section of the Oxted Line to Sanderstead, and was completed in 1935. This route terminating at Sanderstead involved the only electric train service at the station until 1984. These electric trains, on the Woodside and South Croydon Railway via Selsdon to Elmers End, ran from 1935 until the line closed in 1983; at that time, fewer than 150 people were using the service per day, which operated only on weekdays at peak hours to Elmers End.Mitchell, V. and Smith, K., plate 38. Electrification of the South Croydon-Selsdon and Sanderstead-East Grinstead sections of the Oxted Line was approved by BR in the early 1980s: South Croydon-Selsdon was electrified in 1984 using some redundant materials from the closed Woodside-Selsdon line, and a London Bridge to Sanderstead electric train service begun.Mitchell, V. and Smith, K., plate 55 The station building was destroyed by fire again in June 1986, and a new brick building opened in September 1987.Mitchell, V. and Smith, K., plate 39. The signal box had already closed on 2 November 1985, and was demolished the previous month in August 1987.Mitchell, V. and Smith, K., plate 35. Electrification to East Grinstead was completed in October 1987.  Services  The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is: *2 to London Victoria via East Croydon *2 to East Grinstead In peak period trains run to and from London Bridge, calling at South Croydon, the next station north. Services normally use Class 377 Electrostars, with Class 700 in the peaks.  Facilities  The station is staffed until five minutes after the last train.. There is a small tea bar at one end of the station which has recently been re- opened during morning peak hours. There is a footbridge between the platforms.

The SOFAR channel acts as a waveguide for sound, and low frequency sound waves within the channel may travel thousands of miles before dissipating. An example was reception of coded signals generated by the Navy chartered ocean surveillance vessel Cory Chouest off Heard Island, located in the southern Indian Ocean (between Africa, Australia and Antarctica), by hydrophones in portions of all five major ocean basins and as distant as the North Atlantic and North Pacific.Figure 1 of the reference \\"The Heard Island Feasibility Test\\" (Munk) shows ray paths to receiving locations. Table 1 lists the sites with one being a Canadian research vessel with a towed array off Cape Cod. This phenomenon is an important factor in ocean surveillance.

In testing the concept in 1944 Ewing and Worzel hung a hydrophone from Saluda, a sailing vessel assigned to the Underwater Sound Laboratory, with a second ship setting off explosive charges up to miles away.  Principle  Acoustic pulses travel great distances in the ocean because they are trapped in an acoustic \\"wave guide\\". This means that as acoustic pulses approach the surface they are turned back towards the bottom, and as they approach the ocean bottom they are turned back towards the surface. The ocean conducts sound very efficiently, particularly sound at low frequencies, i.e., less than a few hundred Hz Temperature is the dominant factor in sound speed with higher temperatures, thus higher sound speed, near the ocean surface excepting polar seas. Temperature decreases with depth with sound speed decreasing accordingly until temperature becomes stable and pressure becomes the dominant factor. The axis of the SOFAR channel lies at the point of minimum sound speed at a depth where pressure begins dominating temperature and sound speed increases. This point is at the bottom of the thermocline and the top of the deep isothermal layer and thus has some seasonal variance. Other acoustic ducts exist, particularly in the upper mixed layer, but the ray paths lose energy with either surface or bottom reflections. In the SOFAR channel low frequencies in particular are refracted back into the duct so that energy loss is small and the sound travels thousands of miles. Analysis of Heard Island Feasibility Test data received by the Ascension Island Missile Impact Locating System hydrophones at an intermediate range of from the source found \\"surprisingly high\\" signal to noise ratios, ranging from 19 to 30 dB, with unexpected phase stability and amplitude variability after a travel time of about 1 hour, 44 minutes and 17 seconds. Profile showing sound channel axis and bottom at critical depth. Where bottom profile intrudes into the sound channel propagation is bottom limited. Within the duct sound waves trace a path that oscillates across the SOFAR channel axis so that a single signal will have multiple arrival times with a signature of multiple pulses climaxing in a sharply defined end.The \\"History of the SOFAR Channel\\" reference has a recording and sonogram of the effect. That sharply defined end representing a near axial arrival path is sometimes termed the SOFAR finale and the earlier ones the SOFAR symphony. Those effects are due to the larger sound channel in which ray paths are contained between the surface and critical depth.The term also has a biological oceanography application. Critical depth is the point below the sound speed minimum axis where sound speed increases to equal the maximum speed above the axis. Where bottom lies above critical depth the sound is attenuated, as is any ray path intersecting surface or bottom.Figure 2 on page three of the Williams/Stephen/Smith reference is helpful in understanding critical depth, the SOFAR channel, the entire channel and the ray paths involved. Bathymetry profile with SOFAR channel axis depth, Heard Island to Ascension Island. The channel axis varies most with its location reaching the surface and disappearing at high latitudes (above about 60¬∞N or below 60¬∞S) but with sound then traveling in a surface duct. A 1980 report by Naval Ocean Systems Center gives examples in a study of a great circle acoustic path between Perth, Australia and Bermuda with data at eight locations along the path. At both Perth and Bermuda the sound channel axis occurs at a depth of around . Where the path meets the Antarctic convergence at 52¬∫ south there is no deep sound channel but a in depth surface duct and a shallow sound channel at . As the path turns northward, a station at 43¬∫ south, 16¬∫ east showed the profile reverting to the SOFAR type at .  Applications  The first practical application began development during World War II when the Navy began experimenting and implementing the capability to locate the explosion of a SOFAR bomb used as a distress signal by downed pilots. The difference in arrival times of the source at an unknown location at known locations allowed computation of the source's general location. The arrival times form hyperbolic lines of position similar to LORAN. The reverse, detection of timed signals from known shore positions at an unknown point, allowed calculation of the position at that point. That technique was given the name of SOFAR backwards: RAFOS. RAFOS is defined in the 1962 edition of The American Practical Navigator among the hyperbolic navigation systems. The early applications relied on fixed shore stations, often termed SOFAR stations. Several became acoustic research facilities as did the Bermuda SOFAR Station which was involved in the Perth to Bermuda experiment. The records of the Bermuda station are maintained by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI). In the recent past SOFAR sources were deployed for special purposes in the RAFOS application. One such system deployed bottom moored sources off Cape Hatteras, off Bermuda and one on a seamount to send three precisely timed signals a day to provide approximately accuracy. The first application quickly became of intense interest to the Navy for reasons other than locating downed air crews. A Navy decision in 1949 led to studies by 1950 recommending the passive sonar potential of the SOFAR channel be exploited for the Navy's Anti- Submarine Warfare (ASW) effort. The recommendation included one that $10 million a year be spent on research and development of the system. By 1951 a test array had proven the concept and by 1952 additional stations were ordered for the Atlantic. The first major exploitation of the SOFAR channel was to ocean surveillance in a classified program that led to the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS). That system remained classified from inception until the fixed systems were augmented by mobile arrays to become the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System with the mission and nature of the system declassified in 1991.It is not entirely coincidental that some of the SOSUS shore facilities, termed Naval Facilities (NAVFAC), were located in the vicinity of older SOFAR stations. For example Naval Facility Bermuda and Naval Facility Point Sur. The local acoustics were already well known. Earthquake monitoring through use of SOSUS after limited civilian access was granted to the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 1991 revealed ten times the number of offshore earthquakes with better localization than with land based sensors. The SOSUS detection could sense earthquakes at about magnitude two vice magnitude four. The system detected seafloor spreading and magma events in the Juan de Fuca Ridge in time for research vessels to investigate. As a result of that success PMEL developed its own hydrophones for deployment world wide to be suspended in the SOFAR channel by a float and anchor system. =Other applications= * Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) - International Monitoring System (IMS) * Missile Impact Location System (MILS): System to localize impact and location of test missile nose cones * Ocean acoustic tomography: A technique to measure ocean temperatures and currents by the time delay of sounds between two distant instruments * Search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: Sounds carried by the SOFAR channel were analyzed to determine if they detected a possible ocean impact of a passenger jet which disappeared in the Southern Indian Ocean  In nature  Mysterious low-frequency sounds, attributed to fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), are a common occurrence in the channel.

The bank was renamed in the mid-1980s after a series of mergers. After being acquired by First Union Corporation, which later merged with Wachovia National Bank, CoreStates Financial Corporation became a part of Wells Fargo in 2008 when Wachovia was acquired by Wells Fargo. History =Philadelphia National Bank and 1st Pennsy= The bank was founded in Philadelphia on September 8, 1803, as The Philadelphia Bank. George Clymer was the bank's first president. Later, the bank became known as Philadelphia National Bank, or PNB. During the early years of the United States, Philadelphia developed as the banking center of the country. The First Bank of the United States chartered in 1791, was based in the city until its charter expired in 1811 and was purchased by Stephen Girard and then renamed Girard Bank for its founder. The Second Bank of the United States was directed for most of the period 1816 to 1836 by Nicholas Biddle, the nation's first chief banker and scion of the city's most iconic family. The Philadelphia National Bank was neither the oldest nor the most aggressive of the big banks headquartered in the nation's birthplace for most of the city's history. That distinction went to the First Pennsylvania Bank, the \\"Pennsy Company.\\" While founded as an insurance company in 1809 (chartered 1812), it traces back to an even earlier banking dynasty. the Bank of North America was chartered in 1781 by the Continental Congress as America's first bank. It went through a number of charter changes and minor upheavals until merging with the Commercial Trust Company to form 1923's Bank of North America and Trust Company. That didn't survive long; by the 1870s, 1st Pennsy had transitioned to banking in the 1870s, and it bought the old bank in 1929, and shortly thereafter renamed itself the Pennsylvania Company for Banking and Trust. It was led in the twentieth century by an increasingly ambitious and risk-taking board of directors. Another merger with First National Bank in 1955 brought another name change, prepending \\"First,\\" and the First National branch at 315 Chestnut Street was maintained until the Wells Fargo period. Serendipitously, 315 Chestnut is next door to the original location of the Bank of North America at 305 Chestnut. PNB, on the other hand, maintained a reputation for financial caution and civic responsibility. On occasion, the bank made headlines for quiet innovations, such as when during the late 1960s it led all the nation's banks in ending the practice of \\"redlining\\" poorer neighborhoods so that personal and small business loans could be extended to residents of poorer city districts, or when, during the middle 1970s, the bank helped universalize ATM banking by building one of the nation's first and largest network of banking machines, known by their acronym, \\"MAC\\", for Money Access Center or Money Access Card. By the dawn of the new age of banking in the late 1970s and 1980s, when lending grew highly competitive and banks began vying for power and influence by buying each other, PNB was well positioned to compete. It maintained offices in all of the major financial capitals of the world with headquarters of its subsidiary, Philadelphia International Bank (PIB), in London and New York City, through its practice of Correspondent banking. PNB was particularly aggressive in the then-developing Middle East oil-rich states. The real estate bust of the late 1970s, accompanied by high interest rates and rates of foreclosure, did not hurt PNB to the extent it did its more highly exposed crosstown rival, First Pennsylvania, which never completely recovered from the temporary collapse of the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry and was eventually purchased by PNB in 1990. =Creation of CoreStates= PNB's first merger involved Hamilton Bank of central Pennsylvania in 1982; later, in the mid-1980s, it would take control of New Jersey National Bank of Trenton, New Jersey. Corestates Financial Corporation evolved out of the merger of PNB with Hamilton. Meanwhile, Corestates Bank of Delaware would focus on lending to the many corporations, including chemical giant DuPont, headquartered in the low-tax First State just south of the Pennsylvania border. After it acquired First Pennsylvania Bank in 1990, CoreStates/PNB spent $20 million to win naming rights for 20 years for the new arena being built next to Philadelphia's Spectrum that would subsequently be known as the \\"CoreStates Center\\" associated with the bank holding company. In the fall of 1995, CoreStates acquired another regional rival, Meridian Bancorp, at $3.2 billion their largest acquisition to date. George W. Strawbridge, Jr., a Campbell Soup Company director, heir to the Strawbridge & Clothier department store fortune, and major shareholder in Meridian Bancorp, became director and largest individual shareholder in the Corestates Corporation, continuing an ongoing marriage between the bank and one of the region's most iconic companies, the Campbell Soup Company, that had in the 1970s made G. Morris Dorrance, Jr., scion of the Campbell clan and prominent Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, socialite, PNB's board chairman. =Acquisition by First Union= In the rash of regional bank takeovers that occurred near the end of the twentieth century, CoreStates was then acquired by First Union Corporation of Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1998. The CoreStates-First Union merger, at $17 billion, was then the largest bank merger that had ever taken place in the United States. First Union later bought Wachovia National Bank in 2001 and the combined company took the Wachovia brand name. Wachovia Bank, suffering losses during the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, was acquired by Wells Fargo, headquartered in San Francisco, California. Headquarters building The company's original headquarters building is located at the corner of Broad and Chestnut Streets in Center City Philadelphia and is now known as One South Broad. It has long been known for the oversized bell on its uppermost floor that once tolled noon over the city's financial district, once centered at the foot of its building but now moved farther west among the office buildings lining West Market Street. First Pennsylvania Bank's Centre Square twin office towers, with their iconic \\"Clothespin\\" sculpture by Claes Oldenburg, shifted the center of that district west at its opening in 1976. In 1973, the bank opened a second Center City office complex on Independence Mall at Fifth and Market Streets that became headquarters for its operations divisions. In keeping with the company's civic commitment to the City of Philadelphia, the bank simultaneously redesigned and rebuilt SEPTA's Fifth Street/Independence subway station on the Market-Frankford/Blue Line at the intersection's northeast corner, a station whose design subsequently won international awards for its striking combination of colors, textures, and materials.

Reactions Benzimidazole is a base: :C6H4N(NH)CH + H+ -> [C6H4(NH)2CH]+ It can also be deprotonated with stronger bases: :C6H4N(NH)CH + LiH -> Li [C6H4N2CH] + H2 The imine can be alkylated and also serves as a ligand in coordination chemistry. The most prominent benzimidazole complex features N-ribosyl- dimethylbenzimidazole as found in vitamin B12. N,N'-Dialkylbenzimidazolium salts are precursors to certain N-heterocyclic carbenes.  Applications  Benzimidazoles are often bioactive. Many anthelmintic drugs (albendazole, mebendazole, triclabendazole etc.) belong to the benzimidazole class of compounds. Benzimidazole fungicides are commercialized. They act by binding to the fungal microtubules and stopping hyphal growth. It also binds to the spindle microtubules and blocks nuclear division. Benomyl (Benlate) is a fungicide with a benzimidazole core The proton-pump inhibitors (antacids) omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, and tenatoprazole all contain a benzimidazole group.

These include the House of Representatives of Thailand, (which combines with the appointed Senate of Thailand to create the National Assembly of Thailand), local Administrations, Governorship of Bangkok and national referendums. Thailand has so far had 28 general elections since 1933; the last election was in 2019. Voting in elections in Thailand is compulsory. All elections in Thailand are regulated by the Election Commission of Thailand. Suffrage Example ballot paper on show at voting booth, 2007 Elections are held under universal suffrage in accordance with the 2007 Constitution; however, certain restrictions apply: *The voter must be a national of Thailand; if not by birth, then by being a citizen for 5 years. *They must be over 18 years old the year before the year the election is held. *The voter must have also registered ninety days before the election at his constituency. *Those barred from voting in House elections are: members of the sangha or clergy, those suspended from the privilege (for various reasons), detainees under legal or court orders, and people of unsound mind or of mental infirmity. Elections =House of Representatives= The House of Representatives consists of 500 members, of which 350 are directly elected through the first past the post system in which each member represents one \\"constituency\\". The other 150 is elected through party lists given to the election commission by the political parties before election day. In the current system as laid out by the 2017 constitution, known as \\"mixed member apportionment (MMA)\\", the voter casts a single vote for his or her constituency MP, which is then also used in the calculation of the party list seats. This differs from the previous 2007 constitution, where the vote for constituency MP and party list MP were separate. Special elections can be called if the candidate fail to pass the commission's standards (known as yellow-cards) or if a vacancy occurs. The commission also have the authority to annul or ban candidates based on their standards (red-cards). The last election for the House occurred in 2019, with a special election being held in Chiang Mai after the winning candidate was disqualified. The House has a term of four years but may be dissolved before that time. =Senate= The current 250 senators of the Senate of Thailand were not elected, but were appointed by the National Council for Peace and Order, the military junta which ruled Thailand from 2014 to the 2019 general election. The 2017 constitution does not include elections for the Senate. In the previous 2007 constitution, the Senate was composed of 150 members. Of these, 76 were directly elected, while 74 members were appointed. Of the elected members, 75 came from the Provinces of Thailand, and one from the Bangkok Metropolitan Area. The election was based on the first past the post system. The last election for the Senate occurred in 2014. The Senate is a non-partisan chamber and therefore candidates cannot be a member of a political party. Terms are fixed at six years. 2007 general election =Local Administration= There are three different levels of municipalities (), which all elect their own municipal council and mayor. The municipalities are split into constituencies, which each elect six councillors. The number of constituencies depends on the municipal level. * thesaban nakhon (city): 4 constituencies, 24 councillors. * thesaban mueang (town): 3 constituencies, 18 councillors. * thesaban tambon (subdistrict municipality): 2 constituencies, 12 councillors. The Tambon Administrative Organizations, a local government similar to the municipalities, also has an elected council and mayor. Every administrative village within the TAO sends two councillors to the council, only if there are less than three villages the number of councillors per villages is increased to reach the minimum size of six councillors. Pattaya as a special administrative area has a council with 24 seats and an elected mayor, same as a city. Additionally, every province has a province-wide local government named Provincial Administrative Organization with an elected council and chairman. The size of the council depends of the population of the province. For all the local governments, the electoral term is four years. If a councillor positions becomes vacant, a by-election is held in the corresponding constituency, if a mayor position becomes vacant, a new election for a four-year term is held. Thus elections for mayor and council aren't necessarily on the same date. =City of Bangkok= Councils Bangkok is divided into 50 local district councils, one for every district. The size of these councils differ between 7 and 8. Additionally, there are 61 seats in the Bangkok Metropolitan Council (BMC). The election follow a four-year cycle. The most recent local election was in 2010. =Gubernatorial= The Governor of Bangkok is the only elected Governor in the country. The Governor holds a four-year renewable term. The election does not coincide with that of the district councils or the BMC. The most recent election for Governor of Bangkok was in 2013. =Referendums= There has only been two constitutional referendums, in 2007 and 2016. Issues There have been many issues especially in recent years concerning elections in Thailand. Accusations of vote buying and blackmail have been most cited. Most accusations leveled concern vote buying, particularly in rural areas where representatives of political parties or district captains are sent out offering up to 2,000 Baht for a vote. Others concern cheating and ballot tampering. Other issues concern the powers of the Election Commission, an unelected and unaccountable body of five, which has absolute authority to cancel elections at will. It is also the sole arbiter and interpreter of Thai election laws. It has been incredibly active in the last two general elections in annulling and disqualifying candidates. Voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution a citizen must exercise. Turnout is however much higher during general elections (85% in 2007, 75% in 2019) than they are for Senate (56% in 2008, 43% in 2014) or local elections (54% for Bangkok Governor in 2008).

The Caribbean monk seals' main predators were sharks and humans. Overhunting of the seals for oil, and overfishing of their food sources, are the established reasons for the seals' extinction. The last confirmed sighting of the Caribbean monk seal was in 1952 at Serranilla Bank, between Jamaica and Nicaragua. In 2008, the species was officially declared extinct by the United States, after an exhaustive search for the seals that lasted for about five years. This analysis was conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Marine Fisheries Service. Caribbean monk seals were closely related to Hawaiian monk seals, which live around the Hawaiian Islands and are now endangered, and Mediterranean monk seals, another endangered species. Description Drawing of Neomonachus tropicalis Caribbean monk seals had a relatively large, long, robust body, could grow to nearly in length and weighed . Males were probably slightly larger than females, which is similar to Mediterranean monk seals. Like other monk seals, this species had a distinctive head and face. The head was rounded with an extended broad muzzle. The face had relatively large wide-spaced eyes, upward opening nostrils, and fairly big whisker pads with long light-colored and smooth whiskers. When compared to the body, the animal's foreflippers were relatively short with little claws and the hindflippers were slender. Their coloration was brownish and/or grayish, with the underside lighter than the dorsal area. Adults were darker than the more paler and yellowish younger seals. Caribbean monk seals were also known to have algae growing on their pelage, giving them a slightly greenish appearance, which is similar to Hawaiian monk seals. Behavior and ecology Historical records suggest that this species may have \\"hauled out\\" at resting areas on land in large social groups, typically 20-40 animals, but sometimes up to 100 individuals, throughout its range. The groups may have been organised based on age and life stage differences. Their diet most likely consisted of fish and crustaceans. Like other true seals, the Caribbean monk seal was sluggish on land. Its lack of fear of humans, and an unaggressive, curious nature was taken advantage of by human hunters. =Reproduction and longevity= Two young individuals in New York Aquarium, 1910 Caribbean monk seals had a long pupping season, which is typical for pinnipeds living in subtropical and tropical habitats. In Mexico, breeding season peaked in early December. Like other monk seals, this species had four retractable nipples for suckling their young. Newborn pups were probably about in length and weighed and reportedly had a sleek, black lanugo coat when born. It is believed this animal's average lifespan was approximately twenty years. Habitat Caribbean monk seals were found in warm temperate, subtropical and tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the western Atlantic Ocean. They probably preferred to haul out at low sandy beaches above high tide on isolated and secluded atolls and islands, but occasionally would visit the mainland coasts and deeper waters offshore. This species may have fed in shallow lagoons and reefs. Relationship with humans Depiction by Henry W. Elliott from 1884 The first historical mention of the Caribbean monk seal is recorded in the account of the second voyage of Christopher Columbus. In August 1494 a ship laid anchor off the mostly barren island of Alta Velo, south of Hispaniola, the party of men went and killed eight seals that were resting on the beach. The second recorded interaction with Caribbean monk seals was Juan Ponce de Le√≥n‚Äôs discovery of the Dry Tortugas Islands. On June 21, 1513 Ponce de Le√≥n discovered the islands, he ordered a foraging party to go ashore, where the men killed fourteen of the docile seals. There are several more records throughout the colonial period of seals being discovered and hunted at Guadelupe, the Alacrane Islands, the Bahamas, the Pedro Cays, and Cuba. As early as 1688 sugar plantation owners sent out hunting parties to kill hundreds of seals every night in order to obtain oil to lubricate the plantation machinery. A 1707 account describes fisherman slaughtering seals by the hundreds for oil to fuel their lamps. By 1850 so many seals had been killed that there were no longer sufficient numbers for them to be commercially hunted. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, scientific expeditions to the Caribbean encountered the Caribbean monk seal. In December 1886 the first recorded scientific expedition to research seals, led by H. A. Ward and Professor F. Ferrari Perez as part of the Mexican Geographical and Exploring Survey, ventured to a small collection of reefs and a small cay known as the Triangles (20.95¬∞ N 92.23¬∞ W) in search of monk seals. Although the research expedition was in the area for only four days, forty-two specimens were killed and taken away; the two leaders of the expedition shared them. Two specimens from this encounter survive intact at the British Museum of Natural History and the Cambridge Zoological Museum respectively. The expedition also captured a newly born seal pup that died in captivity a week later. The first Caribbean monk seal to live in captivity for an extended period was a female seal that lived in The New York Aquarium. The seal was captured in 1897 and died in 1903, living in captivity for a total of five and a half years. In 1909 The New York Aquarium acquired four Caribbean monk seals, three of which were yearlings (between one and two years old), and the other a mature male. =Extinction= Through the first half of the twentieth century, Caribbean monk seal sightings became much rarer. In 1908, a small group of seals was seen at the once bustling Tortugas Islands. Fishermen captured six seals in 1915, which were sent to Pensacola, Florida, and eventually released. A seal was killed near Key West, Florida in March 1922. There were sightings of Caribbean monk seals on the Texas coast in 1926 and 1932. The last seal recorded to be killed by humans was killed on the Pedro Cays in 1939. Two more seals were seen on Drunken Mans Cay, just south of Kingston, Jamaica, in November 1949. In 1952 the Caribbean monk seal was confirmed sighted for the last time at Serranilla Bank, between Jamaica and Nicaragua. The final extinction of the Caribbean monk seal was triggered by two main factors. The most visible factor contributing to the Caribbean monk seals' demise was the nonstop hunting and killing of the seals in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to obtain the oil held within their blubber. The insatiable demand for seal products in the Caribbean encouraged hunters to slaughter the Caribbean monk seals by the hundreds. The Caribbean monk seals' docile nature and lack of flight instinct in the presence of humans made it very easy for anyone to kill them. The second factor was the overfishing of the reefs that sustained the Caribbean monk seal population. With no fish or mollusks to feed on, the seals that were not killed by hunters for oil died of starvation or did not reproduce as a result of an absence of food. Surprisingly little was done towards attempting to save the Caribbean monk seal; by the time it was placed on the endangered species list in 1967 it was likely already extinct. Unconfirmed sightings of Caribbean monk seals by local fishermen and divers are relatively common in Haiti and Jamaica, but two recent scientific expeditions failed to find any sign of this animal. It is possible the mammal still exists, but some biologists strongly believe the sightings are of wandering hooded seals, which have been positively identified on archipelagos such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

Retrieved 12 January 2017. All historical references to the YSS are referred to as the organisation was known at the time of being referenced.  Campaigning  In 2001 SSY began campaigning for a change to drug laws, including arguing for the legalisation of cannabis, They later broadened to demand new thinking on approaches to all drugs, prompted by the 2009 banning of mephedrone. They were involved in the campaign against the G8 summit at Gleneagles. In June 2007, five members of the SSY were arrested at Faslane as part of the Faslane 365 campaign SSY Members arrested at Faslane They were also heavily involved in campaigning for the SSP during the 2005 general election and in the 2007 Scottish Parliament and council elections where a number of members stood as SSP candidates. Currently they are campaigning against low pay for young workers, and are arguing for an ¬£8 per hour minimum wage regardless of age. They have produced workers' rights cards to let young workers know what they are entitled to and how to get it. In November 2007, the SSY organised a protect in conjunction with the SSP LGBT Network against Stagecoach, after two young gay men were threatened with being thrown off a bus as one had their arm around the other. The results of the 2010 UK election resulting in a coalition government led by the Tories, has led to the SSY campaigning against the new government and the cuts that they are inflicting. SSY received national media attention in 2010 when they organised a demonstration at short notice to coincide with David Cameron's first visit to Scotland as Prime Minister, on 14 May 2010. Recently, YSS have also been involved in anti-fascist activity in Scotland, notably helping organise mobilisations against the far-right Scottish Defence League in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Kilmarnock, as well as participating in UKUnCut actions targeting major retailers which practice large scale tax avoidance.  Structure  Although the YSS is affiliated to the Scottish Socialist Party, it is an autonomous body and is open to all socialists in Scotland (except members of opposing parties) under the age of 27. The day-to-day running of the YSS is the responsibility of the National Organiser, assisted by the National Executive Committee which plays a leadership role. The NEC is elected at the annual National Conference with its membership split equally between men and women. The National Organiser is also elected at the conference. Additionally, SSY has branches across Scotland that conduct activity in their area. SSY held their tenth annual conference in Glasgow in July 2011.  Women's Group  Women's Group logo SSY had a self- organised women's group, to which all young women are invited. The aim of the Women's Group is to create a space for young socialist women to talk about the issues that affect them. The Women's Group feel that, in a male-dominated environment, young women can be sidelined and may feel that their opinion is less valid. The SSY Women's Group aims to give young women confidence in their abilities. At the SSY Conference 2005, the Women's Group decided that their main campaign would be on sex education, in particular discouraging and campaigning against abstinence-only education, which was run in some state schools at the expense of the Scottish Government. Their campaign, \\"Fuck Abstinence!\\", involved giving information on reproductive rights to young women denied adequate sex education.

Experiment The phenomenon was famously documented by ecologist Joseph Connell's study of species overlap between barnacles on intertidal rocks. He observed that Chthamalus stellatus and Balanus balanoides inhabited the upper and lower strata of intertidal rocks respectively, but only Chthamalus could survive both upper and lower strata without desiccation. If Balanus was removed from the lower strata, Chthamalus was able to occupy its fundamental niche (both upper and lower strata) which is much larger than its realized niche of upper strata. Niche width vs. realized niche width The niche width of an organism refers to a theoretical range of conditions that a species could inhabit and successfully survive and reproduce with no competition. The niche width is defined as the parameters of this range which are determined by biotic and abiotic factors such as appropriate food sources and suitable climate respectively. The niche width often differs from the area that a species actually inhabits, with the area a species actually persists in referred to as its realized niche width. This is due to interspecific competition with other species within their ecosystem and other biotic and abiotic limiting factors. A species realized niche is usually much narrower than its theoretical niche width as it is forced to adapt its niche around superior competing species.

Background When General John Coffee returned to Fort Strother after defeating the Red Sticks at the Battle of Tallushatchee, General Andrew Jackson received a call for help from friendly Creeks who were being besieged by Red Sticks at Talladega. Jackson and his force of about 2,000 men (about 1,200 infantry and 800 cavalry) were camped at Ten Islands on the Coosa River, near the present day Henry Neely Dam. The Creeks under command of Weatherford numbered about 700 warriors. A few white men and about 150 friendly Indians known as White Sticks, were inside a small defensive area known as Fort Leslie (it is often called Fort Lashley mistakenly). Fort Lashley was a palisade constructed around the trading post of a Mr. Leslie. One of the White Sticks in the stockade was Chief Chinnabee. His son Selocta, according to legend, put a pigskin with its head still attached over his body and grunted and routed through the surrounding Red Sticks after dark. When he got to the edge of the encampment he shed the skin and ran through the wilderness until he reached Jackson's camp. Battle On November 9, 1813, Jackson's army arrived outside the village. The Red Sticks inflicted 17 casualties on Jackson's forces. The number of casualties for both sides are most accurately stated in Gen. Jackson's letter to governor of Tennessee, Willie Blount, written a few days after the battle. Jackson inflicted 299 casualties on the Red Sticks and drove them from the field.Click here to see a hand-drawn map of the battlefield from 1813. Aftermath Casualties for the Creeks numbered about 300 killed and about 110 wounded. Jackson's casualties numbered 15 killed and around 85 wounded. After the battle, there was a significant lull in the fighting between the Red Sticks and Jackson's army. By December, the U.S. force was down to almost 500 because of desertion and enlistments running out. In January, in order to support the Georgia militia, Jackson marched toward the village of Emuckfaw with an inexperienced force. This move resulted in the Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek. After these battles Jackson retired to Fort Strother. When Jackson received additional reinforcements (some of the regular U.S. troops), he once again went on the offensive and met the Red Sticks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.

He is the son of South African 400-metre runner Peter Thorrington, who was denied a chance to compete in the Olympics because of the sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era. Although raised in the United States, Thorrington started his career as a youth team player in England with Premier League side Manchester United. In 1999, he moved to Germany and signed with Bayer Leverkusen, however he failed to make the first team with either club and returned to England where he signed for Huddersfield Town. He went on to feature for Grimsby Town as well before moving to the United States where he signed with Chicago Fire in 2005.  Early Life  Thorrington was born in Johannesburg, but moved to California at the age of 2. From 4, he began playing in the American Youth Soccer Organization. He was spotted by Octavio Zambrano and invited to join Mission Viejo Pateadores. His mother Monique drove him to training there twice a week. Career =Early career= Thorrington attended the Chadwick School in Palos Verdes Peninsula, California. Thorrington was the CIF-SS Division V Player of the Year in 1996 and 1997. After his junior year of high school and while playing for the Pateadores, Thorrington was spotted by an Englishman, Steve Kelly, who had connections to Manchester United, and Kelly got Thorrington a trial at Manchester United. At the age of 17, Thorrington signed with Manchester United in 1997. Later, he moved to Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen. After his time in Germany, he spent a short spell on trial with Bolton Wanderers in the 2000‚Äì2001 season. =Huddersfield Town= After failing to make a first-team appearance with Manchester United and Leverkusen, Thorrington signed with Huddersfield Town in the summer of 2001 on a free transfer. Huddersfield had recently suffered relegation to the third tier of English soccer and were managed by former Manchester United player Lou Macari. Macari handed Thorrington his full professional debut on August 11, 2001 in a 1-0 league victory over A.F.C. Bournemouth. He scored his first Town goal September 2, 2001 in a 2-1 victory over Wycombe Wanderers. At the end of a promising first season, he developed a hamstring injury, which led to chronic leg troubles. Thorrington said that he considers his debut with Huddersfield Town as one of his favorite moments professionally along with his debuts with the U.S. National Team and the Chicago Fire. Thorrington made 97 appearances and scored seven times during a three-year spell with the Yorkshire club. During the 2002‚Äì2003 season, Huddersfield were yet again relegated to the Third Division. =Grimsby Town= On transfer deadline day in March 2004, Thorrington signed with Grimsby Town on a free transfer until the end of the season. He was brought to the club by Town's newly appointed manager Nicky Law along with veterans Alan Fettis and Paul Warhurst. He made his Mariners debut on March 13, 2004 in a 1-1 draw with A.F.C. Bournemouth. Thorrington would only manage two other appearances for Grimsby and missed the end of the season due to ongoing injury woes. Grimsby suffered relegation at the end of the 2003‚Äì2004 season, and with Law dismissed as manager at the end of the season, Thorrington's contract was not renewed. =Chicago Fire= Thorrington returned to the States and signed with MLS side Chicago Fire in early 2005, but injury problems continued. In mid-2006, during the team's inaugural training session in its new stadium, Thorrington suffered a knee injury. The following season, Thorrington scored his first goal of the campaign on October 21, 2007, netting a stoppage-time strike for the Chicago Fire against the Los Angeles Galaxy that helped send the fire into the MLS Cup playoffs. From that point on, Thorrington formed an integral part of the Chicago midfield. In 2008, he scored five goals and had two assists. Although normally a winger, he played defensive midfield and attacking midfield in the 2009 season due to the absences of Logan Pause and Cuauht√©moc Blanco. =Vancouver Whitecaps FC= Thorrington was left exposed by Chicago for the November 2010 MLS Expansion Draft and was selected by Vancouver Whitecaps FC. Thorrington injured his right leg and had to undergo surgery early during the 2011 season. After spending 2011 with Vancouver, the club re-signed him for the 2012 season on December 5, 2011. =D.C. United= When Thorrington had his 2013 contract option declined by Vancouver, he elected to participate in the 2012 MLS Re- Entry Draft. On December 14, 2012, he was selected by D.C.

He was a member of the U.S. U-20 squad that advanced to the second round of the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship in Nigeria. Thorrington made his U.S. U-20 international debut in a 1-0 victory over Denmark on January 24, 1999. He scored his first international goal in a 1-1 draw with Morocco on October 3, 1999. =U.S. Under 23= Thorrington played in four matches for the U.S. Under-23 men's national team in 2000, including three of the U-23's four matches (two starts) in the 2000 CONCACAF Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Hershey, Pennsylvania, helping the squad advance to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. His first goal for the U-23s was in a 3-0 victory over Honduras on April 21, 2000, in the opening round of the 2000 CONCACAF Olympic Qualifying Tournament. He was unable to participate in the 2000 Olympics after suffering a hamstring injury leading up to the tournament. =U.S. National Team= He made his debut coming on for Steve Cherundolo in the 71st minute of a 0-0 draw versus Ecuador on June 7, 2001. His second cap came seven years later in early-round CONCACAF World Cup qualifying when he came on as a substitute against Barbados on June 22, 2008, with his third cap (and first start) against Guatemala in the last game of the semi-final round. His fourth came in a friendly against Sweden. In addition to playing four times for the U.S. national team, he was called up to multiple national team camps, including one in January 2009 and another before the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. However, he failed to make another matchday roster.  Post-playing career  After retiring from football, Thorrington served as special assistant to MLS Players' Union executive director Bob Foose and received an MBA from Northwestern‚Äôs Kellogg School of Management. He was named LAFC's first EVP of Soccer Operations and General Manager on December 8, 2015. He presided over 'the best regular-season team in MLS history', as LAFC broke the league record for points with 72, equaled the single-season best with 85 goals and outscored opponents by 48.

She was considered America's first major prima ballerina. She was the first Native American to hold the rank, and is said to have revolutionized ballet. Almost from birth, Tallchief was involved in dance, starting formal lessons at age three. When she was eight, her family relocated from her birth home of Fairfax, Oklahoma, to Los Angeles, California, to advance the careers of her and her younger sister, Marjorie. At age 17, she moved to New York City in search of a spot with a major ballet company, and, at the urging of her superiors, took the name Maria Tallchief. She spent the next five years with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, where she met legendary choreographer George Balanchine. When Balanchine co-founded what would become the New York City Ballet in 1946, Tallchief became the company's first star. The combination of Balanchine's difficult choreography and Tallchief's passionate dancing revolutionized the ballet. Her 1949 role in The Firebird catapulted Tallchief to the top of the ballet world, establishing her as a prima ballerina. Her role as the Sugarplum Fairy in The Nutcracker transformed the ballet from obscure to America's most popular. She traveled the world, becoming the first American to perform in Moscow's Bolshoi Theater. She made regular appearances on American TV before she retired in 1966. After retiring from dance, Tallchief was active in promoting ballet in Chicago. She served as director of ballet for the Lyric Opera of Chicago for most of the 1970s and debuted the Chicago City Ballet in 1981. Tallchief was honored by the people of Oklahoma with multiple statues and an honorific day. She was inducted in the National Women's Hall of Fame and received a National Medal of Arts. In 1996, Tallchief received a Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime achievements. Her life has been the subject of multiple documentaries and biographies. Early life Elizabeth Marie Tall Chief (her birth name) was born in Fairfax, Oklahoma on January 24, 1925 to Alexander Joseph Tall Chief (1890‚Äì1959), a member of the Osage Nation, and his wife, Ruth (n√©e Porter), of Scottish-Irish descent. She was known as \\"Betty Marie\\" to friends and family. Porter had met Alexander Tall Chief, a widower, while visiting her sister, who was his mother's housekeeper at the time. Elizabeth Tall Chief's paternal great-grandfather, Peter Bigheart, had helped negotiate for the Osages concerning oil revenues that enriched the Osage Nation. Her father grew up rich as a result, never working \\"a day in his life.\\" In her autobiography, Tallchief explained, \\"As a young girl growing up on the Osage reservation in Fairfax, Oklahoma, I felt my father owned the town. He had property everywhere. The local movie theater on Main Street and the pool hall opposite belonged to him. Our 10-room, a terracotta-brick house stood high on a hill overlooking the reservation.\\" The family spent summers in Colorado Springs to escape the Oklahoma heat. Life was far from perfect, though, as her father was a binge drinker and her parents often fought about money. Tallchief had five siblings, three from her father's first marriage to a German immigrant: Alexander; Frances (1913‚Äì1999); and Thomas (1919‚Äì1981), who played football for the University of Oklahoma, and was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers; Gerald (1922‚Äì1999), who was injured in childhood when kicked in the head by a horse and never regained normal cognitive function. Her sister Marjorie, an accomplished ballerina in her own right, was Ruth's second child and Betty Marie's \\"best friend.\\" Maria Tallchief with Erik Bruhn in 1961. As a child, Ruth Porter had dreamed about becoming a performer, but her family could not afford dance or music lessons. She was determined that her daughters would not suffer the same fate. Betty Marie was enrolled in summer ballet classes in Colorado Springs at age 3. She and other family members performed at rodeos and other local events. Tall Chief studied piano and contemplated becoming a concert pianist. In 1930, a ballet teacher from Tulsa, Mrs. Sabin, visited Fairfax looking for students and took on Betty Marie and Marjorie as students. Looking back on Sabin many years later, Tallchief wrote, \\"She was a wretched instructor who never taught the basics, and it's a miracle I wasn't permanently harmed.\\" In addition to the problems in her teaching technique, Sabin had put Tall Chief on pointe shortly after she joined the school (at 5 years old) while she was far too young to be able to dance on pointe without injury. At age five, Tall Chief was enrolled at the nearby Sacred Heart Catholic School. Impressed by her reading ability, the teachers allowed her to skip the first two grade levels. Between piano, ballet, and school work, Tall Chief had little free time but loved the outdoors. In her autobiography, she reminisced about time spent \\"wandering around our big front yard\\" and \\"[rambling] around the grounds of our summer cottage hunting for arrowheads in the grass.\\" In 1933, the family moved to Los Angeles with the intent of getting the children into Hollywood musicals. The day they arrived in Los Angeles, her mother asked the clerk at a local drugstore if he knew any good dance teachers. The clerk recommended Ernest Belcher, father of dancer Marge Champion. \\"An anonymous man in an unfamiliar town decided our fate with those few words,\\" Tall Chief later recalled. California moved Tall Chief back to the proper grade for her age but put her in an Opportunity Class for advanced learners. \\"Opportunity Class or not, I was still way ahead,\\" she recalled. \\"With nothing to do, I often wandered around the schoolyard by myself.\\" At this time Tall Chief was removed from pointe, probably saving her major injury. Bored with school, Tall Chief devoted herself to dance in Belcher's studio. In addition to ballet, which she had previously been doing all wrong and went back to square one, she learned tap, Spanish dancing, and acrobatics there. She found tumbling very difficult and eventually quit the class, but later in life put the skills to good use. The family moved to Beverly Hills where schools offered better academics. At Beverly Vista School, Tall Chief experienced what she described as \\"painful\\" discrimination and took to spelling her last name as one word, Tallchief. She continued to study piano, appearing as a guest soloist with small symphony orchestras throughout high school. At age 12, Tallchief began to work with Bronislava Nijinska, a renowned choreographer who had recently opened her own studio in Los Angeles, and David Lichine, a choreographer and former dancer. Nijinska \\"was a personification of what ballet was all about,\\" Tallchief recalled. \\"I looked at her, and I knew this was what I wanted to do.\\" Nijinska imparted a strong sense of discipline and the belief that being a ballerina was a full-time task. \\"We didn't concentrate only for an hour and a half a day,\\" Tallchief recalled. \\"We lived it.\\" It was under Nijinska that Tallchief decided ballet was what she wanted to devote her life to. \\"Before Nijinska, I liked ballet but believed that I was destined to become a concert pianist,\\" she recalled. \\"Now my goal was different.\\" Nijinska saw Tallchief was serious and began devoting great attention to her. When Tallchief was 15, Nijinska decided to stage three ballets in the Hollywood Bowl. Tallchief expected a lead role but instead was put in the corps de ballet. She was devastated: \\"I was hurt and humiliated. I couldn't understand what was happening ... Didn't she love me anymore?\\" After a pep talk from her mother, Tallchief rededicated herself and soon worked her way into a lead part in Chopin Concerto. When the big day came, she slipped during rehearsal and was concerned, but Nijinska dismissed it saying \\"happens to everybody.\\" Tallchief also received instruction from various distinguished teachers during their visits to Los Angeles. For Ada Broadbent, she danced her first pas de deux. Mia Slavenska took a shine to Tallchief and arranged for her to audition for Serge Denham, director of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. He was impressed, but nothing came of it. Career =Early career= Tallchief graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1942. She had given up piano and wanted to go to college, but her father was against it. \\"I've paid for your lessons all your life,\\" he said. \\"Now it's time for you to find a job.\\" She won a bit part in Presenting Lily Mars, an MGM musical with Judy Garland. Dancing in the movie was \\"not gratifying\\" and Tallchief decided against making a career of it. That summer, family friend Tatiana Riabouchinska asked if Tallchief would like to go to New York. With Riabouchinska chaperoning, she set off for the big city at age 17. Once in New York, Tallchief looked up Serge Denham. A secretary told her that the company did not need any more dancers and she left crying. A few days later, she was told there was a place for her after all. Denham did not actually remember her, but she had something he needed ‚Äì a passport. Many of his dancers were Russian √©migr√©s who lacked passports and the troupe had a Canadian tour coming up. Based on a combination of her talent and her passport, Tallchief was taken on as an apprentice. Her first performance was in Ga√Æt√© Parisienne. After the Canadian tour, one of the dancers left the troupe due to pregnancy and Tallchief was offered the woman's place and a $40 per week salary. Maria Tallchief as the Sugar Plum Fairy and Nicholas Magallanes as her cavalier The Nutcracker (1954). On her first day as a full member of the company, Tallchief was surprised to find Nijinska had come to town to stage Chopin Concerto with Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. She soon cast Tallchief as first ballerina Nathalie Krassovska's understudy for the lead role. At the Ballet Russe, the Russian ballerinas frequently feuded with American ballerinas, whom they reportedly viewed as inferior. When Tallchief was surprisingly promoted by Nijinska, she became the primary target of their animosity. At the same time, the company was preparing to stage Agnes de Mille's Rodeo, or The Courting at Burnt Ranch, an early example of balletic Americana. One day, de Mille suggested that Tallchief change her name. It was a sensitive subject for Tallchief; Dunham had previously suggested Tallchief change her surname to a Russian-sounding name such as Tallchieva, a practice common among ballet dancers at the time. She refused: \\"Tallchief was my name, and I was proud of it.\\" However, de Mille had a more acceptable idea ‚Äì using a modified version of her middle name. Tallchief agreed and was known as Maria Tallchief for the remainder of her career. Within her first two months at Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Tallchief had appeared in seven different ballets as part of the corps de ballet. While in New York, she took classes at the School of American Ballet, but on tour there were no official classes. Instead, Tallchief studied the efforts of her more experienced colleagues. In particular, she admired Alexandra Danilova who was known for her work ethic and professionalism. Tallchief practiced whenever she could, earning a reputation as a hard worker. \\"I was always doing a barre,\\" she wrote, \\"always giving it my all in rehearsals.\\" Krassovska feuded with management regularly, raising the possibility of a sudden promotion for Tallchief. She nearly quit the company late in 1942 and Tallchief was told she would go on in her place. Krassovska was persuaded to return, but the incident made it clear to Tallchief she needed to be ready to perform Krassovska's technically difficult role on short notice ‚Äì something for which she was not yet ready. In the spring of 1943, Krassovska argued with Denham and left the company. \\"Unprepared, I was numb with terror,\\" Tallchief recalled. When the company returned to New York, Tallchief received positive reviews. The New York Times dance critic John Martin wrote, \\"Tallchief gave a stunning account of herself in Nijinkska's Chopin Concerto ... She has an easy brilliance that smacks of authority rather than bravura,\\" and predicted she would be a big star in the near future. Glory, however, was short lived as Tallchief returned to the corps when the staging of Chopin Concerto was complete. Back on tour, Tallchief saw her parents in Los Angeles. Seeing Tallchief's frail appearance ‚Äì she had lost a lot of weight from a combination of poor nutrition and stress ‚Äì and her minor role in The Snow Maiden, her mother attempted to persuade Tallchief to quit ballet and return to piano. Ruth Tallchief changed her mind when Lichine showed her Martin's column and explained that he was America's top dance critic. Tallchief's second year with Ballet Russe brought bigger roles. She was a soloist in Le Beau Danube and got the lead in Ancient Russia, another Nijinska ballet. =Balanchine era= In the spring of 1944, well known choreographer George Balanchine was hired by Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo to work on a new production called Song of Norway. The move would mark a turning point in Tallchief's and Balanchine's careers. She was drawn to Balanchine from the start. Describing one of her first experiences with him, she wrote, \\"When I saw what he had done, I was astonished. Everything seemed so simple yet perfect: An elegant ballet fell into place before my eyes.\\" At first, she was not sure if he was paying much attention to her, but she quickly found out he was. Balanchine assigned Tallchief a solo in Song of Norway and on the night before the premiere also informed her that she would be Danilova's understudy. The ballet was a success and Balanchine was offered a contract for the rest of the season. He was glad to get back into ballet after years on Broadway and in Hollywood and accepted the offer. Sensing Tallchief's star was on the rise, her mother demanded a raise for her daughter. Tallchief was \\"mortified\\" by the move, but Denham gave into the demands and increased her salary to $50 per week and promoted her to \\"soloist.\\" Balanchine continued to cast Tallchief in important roles. In Danses Concertantes, she was part of a jazzy pas de trois created for Mary Ellen Moylan, Nicholas Magallanes, and herself. The steps were classical in form, but they were presented in a unique manner. \\"The accent was sharp, the rhythm swinging and modern,\\" she wrote. \\"Performing the steps seemed more like an exercise for pleasure and enjoyment than work. It was magical.\\" In Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, she had a pas de deux with Yurek Lazowsky. Shortly before Ballet Imperial was to open, Balanchine informed Tallchief that she would be second lead behind Moylan. \\"I nearly fainted,\\" she recalled. \\"I couldn't get over it.\\" As the season wore on, Balanchine grew fond of her both professionally ‚Äì The Washington Post called Tallchief his \\"crucial artistic inspiration\\" ‚Äì and personally. Tallchief was ignorant of the personal attraction for a long time and their relationship remained mostly on a professional level. Slowly they became friends; then one day, Balanchine asked Tallchief to marry him, much to her surprise. After some thought, she agreed and the couple wed on August 16, 1946. One night on tour in 1945, Tallchief was doing her barre when Balanchine remarked, \\"If only you would learn to do battement tendu properly you wouldn't have to learn anything else.\\" It was his way of saying she needed to start all over ‚Äì battement tendu is the most basic ballet exercise there is. \\"I wanted to die,\\" she recalled. \\"But I had seen the difference between Mary Ellen's [who was a pupil of Balanchine] dancing and mine. I knew he was right.\\" Under the tutelage of Balanchine, Tallchief lost ten pounds and elongated her legs and neck. She learned how to hold her chest high, keep her back straight, and keep her feet arched. \\"My body seemed to be going through a metamorphosis,\\" she recalled. Tallchief relearned the basic exercises the way Balanchine wanted and transformed her greatest weakness‚Äìturnout‚Äìinto a strength. Danilova devoted a lot of her time to instructing Tallchief in the ballerina's art, helping her transform from a teenage girl into a young woman. Tallchief rose to the rank of \\"featured soloist\\" as Balanchine continued to cast her in important roles. She created (was the first person to perform) the role of Coquette in Night Shadow, the ballet's most technically challenging role, after Danilova selected the other female lead for herself. New York City Ballet Also in 1946, Balanchine joined with arts patron Lincoln Kirstein to establish the Ballet Society, a direct forerunner to the New York City Ballet. Tallchief had six months remaining on her contract with Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, so stayed with the company until 1947. When her contract expired, she joined Balanchine who was in France as guest choreographer at the Paris Opera Ballet. He has been called upon to \\"save\\" the famous troupe, but not everyone appreciated his presence. A group of supporters of Serge Lifar, who was on leave while accusations of aiding the Nazis during World War II were investigated, led a vocal campaign to get rid of Balanchine. Spectateur and Les Arts joined in, publishing articles attacking Balanchine personally. He ignored the company's hierarchy, further angering some dancers. When Tallchief arrived, she was put to work immediately with roles in Le baiser de la f√©e and Apollo. Another dancer pulled out of Apollo shortly before opening night, forcing Tallchief to learn more difficult role on short notice. In spite of all the difficulties, opening night was a huge success. The French press was fascinated by Tallchief's dancing, and even more so her background. \\"Peau Rouge danse a l'Opera pour le Roi de Suede\\" [Redskin dances at the Opera for the King of Sweden], read a front-page headline. \\"La Fille du grand chef Indien danse a l'Opera\\" [The daughter of the great Indian chief dances at the Opera], read another. Her colleagues never appreciated Tallchief's presence, but French audiences loved her. After six months in Paris, Tallchief and Balanchine returned to New York. During her time in Paris, Tallchief became the first American to perform with the Paris Opera Ballet. When the couple returned to the states, Tallchief quickly became one of the first stars, and first prima ballerina, of the New York City Ballet, which opened in October 1948. Balanchine \\"revolutionized ballet\\" by creating roles that demanded athleticism, speed, and aggressive dancing like nothing before. Tallchief was well suited for Balanchine's vision. \\"I always thought Balanchine was more of a musician even than a choreographer, and perhaps that‚Äôs why he and I connected,\\" Tallchief recalled. He created many roles specifically for Tallchief, including the lead of \\"The Firebird\\" in 1949. Of her \\"Firebird\\" debut, Kirstein wrote \\"Maria Tallchief made an electrifying appearance, emerging as the nearest approximation to a prima ballerina that we had yet enjoyed.\\" The role created a sensation and launched her to the top of the ballet world, granting her the prima ballerina title. Noting the great technical difficulty of the role, The New York Times critic John Martin wrote that Tallchief was asked \\"to do everything except spin on her head, and she does it with complete and incomparable brilliance.\\" Maria Tallchief in a 1955 promotion for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo Tallchief's popularity help grow the fledgeling dance company and she was asked to perform as many as eight times a week. In 1954, Tallchief was given the role of Sugar Plum Fairy in Balanchine's newly reworked version of The Nutcracker, then an obscure ballet. Her performance of the role helped transform the work into an annual Christmas classic, and the industry's most reliable box-office draw. Critic Walter Terry remarked \\"Maria Tallchief, as the Sugar Plum Fairy, is herself a creature of magic, dancing the seemingly impossible with effortless beauty of movement, electrifying us with her brilliance, enchanting us with her radiance of being. Does she have any equals anywhere, inside or outside of fairyland? While watching her in The Nutcracker, one is tempted to doubt it.\\" Other notable roles Tall Chief created under Balanchine include the Swan Queen in Balanchine's version of Swan Lake and Eurydice in Orpheus. She created the lead role of \\"Prodigal Son,\\" \\"Jones Beach,\\" \\"A La Fran√ßaix,\\" and plotless works such as \\"Sylvia Pas de Deux,\\" \\"Allegro Brillante,\\" \\"Pas de Dix,\\" and \\"Symphony in C.\\" Her fiery, athletic performances helped establish Balanchine as the era's most prominent and influential choreographer. Tallchief remained with the New York City Ballet until February 1960, but also took time off to work with other companies. She made guest appearances with the Chicago Opera Ballet, the San Francisco Ballet, the Royal Danish Ballet, and the Hamburg Ballet, among others. Working for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1954‚Äì55, she was paid $2,000 a week, reportedly the highest salary ever paid to a dancer at the time. In 1958, she created the lead in Balanchine's Gounod Symphony before taking a leave of absence to have her first child. =Later career= After leaving the New York City Ballet, Tallchief joined American Ballet Theatre, first as a guest dancer then as prima ballerina. That summer, she appeared alongside Danish danseur Erik Bruhn in Russia, where she was recognized for \\"aplomb, brilliance, and dignity of the American style.\\" In so doing, she became the first American dancer to perform at Moscow's famed Bolshoi Theater. From 1960 to 1962, Tallchief expanded her repertoire taking on dramatic, as opposed to abstract, roles such as the title roles of Birgit Cullberg‚Äôs Miss Julie and Lady from the Sea, as well as the melancholy heroine of Antony Tudor‚Äôs Jardin aux Lilas. Tallchief's dancing was not confined to the stage. She appeared on multiple TV shows, including The Ed Sullivan Show. She portrayed Anna Pavlova in the 1952 movie musical Million Dollar Mermaid. In 1962, Tallchief was Rudolf Nureyev's partner of choice for his American debut which was broadcast on national television. Her final performance in America was on television's \\"Bell Telephone Hour\\" in 1966. On the urging of Balanchine, she relocated to Germany, briefly becoming the lead dancer of the Hamburg Ballet. One of her last performances was a 1966 title role in Peter van Dyk‚Äôs Cinderella, before she retired from dancing. Feeling alone and missing her new husband, she retired, not wishing to dance beyond her prime. During her career, she danced throughout Europe and South American, in Japan, and in Russia. She made guest appearances with several symphony orchestras. =Teaching and administration= After retiring from dancing, Tallchief moved to Chicago, where husband Buzz Paschen resided. She served as director of ballet for the Lyric Opera of Chicago from 1973 to 1979. In 1974, she founded Lyric Opera's ballet school, where she taught the Balanchine technique. Explaining her teaching philosophy she wrote \\"New ideas are essential, but we must retain respect for the art of ballet‚Äìand that means the artist too‚Äìor else it is no longer an art form.\\" With her sister Marjorie, Tallchief founded the Chicago City Ballet in 1981. She served as co-artistic director until its demise in 1987. Despite the company failing, the Chicago Tribune called her \\"a force in the history of Chicago dance,\\" and said she arguably increased the popularity of dance in the city. Tallchief was featured in the documentary film Dancing for Mr. B in 1989. From 1990 until her death, she was artistic adviser to Von Heidecke's Chicago Festival Ballet. Dance style Maria Tallchief on the front cover of Dance Magazine in 1954. Tallchief was known for \\"dazzling audiences with her speed, energy and fire.\\" She was said to exhibit both \\"electrifying passion\\" and great technical ability. She combined precise footwork with athleticism. Ashley Wheater, artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, remarked, \\"When you watch Tallchief on video, you see that aside from the technical polish there is a burning passion she brought to her dancing. In her interpretation of Balanchine‚Äôs \\"Firebird,\\" she was consumed both inside and out. She was not just a great dancer, but a real artist‚Äîa true interpreter who brought her personality to bear on the dancing.\\" According to Time, she was also \\"a master in the perfect pause, the moment of stillness allowing the audience and the narrative to keep pace with the choreography.\\" William Mason, director emeritus of the Lyric Opera of Chicago, described Tallchief as \\"a consummate professional ... She realized who and what she was, but she didn't flaunt it. She was unpretentious.\\" Fellow dancer Allegra Kent remarked \\"She didn‚Äôt seem to be frightened of the stage, like some of the others. She had in iron will inside ... She phrased her curls and extensions as delicately or as strongly as the music itself.\\" Personal life During her first year at the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo Tallchief dated Alexander \\"Sasha\\" Goudevitch, the darling of the company. \\"For both of us it was our first love,\\" Tallchief recalled. \\"We saw each other every day and I was convinced it was true love.\\" Goudevitch moonlighted for extra money, and bought Tallchief an engagement ring. However, in the spring of 1944 he had a sudden change of heart when another girl began to pursue him. \\"My heart was broken,\\" she recalled. After George Balanchine was hired by the Ballet Russe, he was attracted to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: \\"It never occurred to me that there was anything more than dancing on his mind ... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal.\\" Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he sat in silence for a moment before saying, \\"Maria, I would like you to become my wife\\". \\"I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond,\\" she recalled. She eventually replied, \\"But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you.\\" He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal. When she told her parents about the engagement, her mother was furious: \\"I've never heard of anything more ... idiotic [...] What's wrong with you?\\" Balanchine was unshaken by her objection, saying that she would come around eventually. While they were engaged, Balanchine made extravagant romantic gestures and treated Tallchief with great affection. \\"He was obviously trying to convince me [that our marriage] was inevitable,\\" she wrote. \\"I didn't need convincing. I was falling in love.\\" Tallchief and Balanchine were married on August 16, 1946, when she was 21 years old and he was 42. Her parents continued to oppose the marriage, and did not attend the ceremony. The couple did not have a traditional honeymoon: \\"For both of us, work was more important.\\" According to Tallchief, \\"Passion and romance didn‚Äôt play a big part in our married life. We saved our emotions for the classroom.\\" However, she described Balanchine as \\"a warm, affectionate, loving husband.\\" Their marriage was annulled in 1952, when both parties were attracted to other people. In 1952, Tallchief married Elmourza Natirboff, a pilot for a private charter airline. The couple divorced two years later. In 1955, she met Chicago businessman Henry D. (\\"Buzz\\") Paschen Jr. \\"He was very happy, outgoing, and knew nothing about ballet ‚Äî very refreshing,\\" she recalled. The couple married the following June, and honeymooned with a ballet tour of Europe. With Paschen Tallchief had her only child, Elise Maria Paschen (born 1959), who became an award-winning poet and executive director of the Poetry Society of America. With this marriage Tallchief also had a stepdaughter, Margaret Wright. The couple remained together, through Paschen's brief imprisonment for tax evasion, until his 2004 death. Tallchief was direct when she expressed her opinion, not mincing words. \\"It gave her the illusion of being a diva,\\" said Tallchief prot√©g√© Kenneth von Heidecke, \\"but it was really a keen sense of honesty.\\" Death and legacy In December 2012, Tallchief broke her hip. She died on April 11, 2013 from complications stemming from the injury. Tallchief was considered America's first major prima ballerina, and was the first Native American to hold the rank. She remained closely tied to her Osage history until her death, speaking out against stereotypes and misconceptions about Native Americans on many occasions. Tallchief was involved with America for Indian Opportunity and was a director of the Indian Council Fire Achievement Award. She and her sister Marjorie are counted as two of a group of five Native American ballet dancers from Oklahoma born in the 1920s. However, she wished to be judged on the merits of her dance alone. \\"Above all, I wanted to be appreciated as a prima ballerina who happened to be a Native American, never as someone who was an American Indian ballerina,\\" she wrote. Publisher Rudolf Orthwine presents Tallchief with a Dance Magazine award on April 28, 1961. Tallchief was called \\"one of the most brilliant American ballerinas of the 20th century\\" by The New York Times. According to Wheater, she \\"paved the way for dancers who were not in the traditional mold of ballet ... she was crucial in breaking the stigma.\\" Upon Tallchief's death, Jacques d'Amboise remarked \\"When you thought of Russian ballet, it was Ulanova. With English ballet, it was Fonteyn. For American ballet, it was Tallchief. She was grand in the grandest way.\\" Time remarked \\"of all the ballerinas of the last century, few achieved Maria Tallchief‚Äôs artistry, a kind of conscious dreaming, a reverie with backbone.\\" She is credited with \\"[breaking] down ethnic barriers\\" and was among the first Americans to flourish in a field long dominated by Russians and Europeans. Reflecting on her own career, Tallchief wrote \\"I was in the middle of magic, in the presence of genius. And thank God I knew it.\\" =Honors= In Oklahoma, Tallchief was honored by the governor for both her ballet achievements and her pride in her American Indian heritage.

His music is an eclectic mix of folk music and popular songs in addition to radio airplay hits. He is best known for his baritone singing voice and trademark whistling ability as well as his guitar skills. He is widely known for his version of \\"Wind Beneath My Wings\\" (1982), as well as his own compositions \\"Durham Town (The Leavin')\\" (1969) and \\"I Don't Believe in 'If' Anymore\\" (1970). American audiences are most familiar with his 1970 hit \\"New World in the Morning\\" and his 1975 hit \\"The Last Farewell\\", the latter of which is his only single to hit the Billboard Hot 100 (it made the Top 20) and also hit No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. His final top-charting hit was \\"Albany\\", which scored No. 1 in West Germany in 1982. Childhood and beginning Whittaker's parents, Edward and Vi Whittaker, were from Staffordshire, England, where they owned and operated a grocery shop. His father was injured in a motorcycle accident and the family moved to a farm near Thika, Kenya, because of its warmer climate. His grandfather sang in various clubs and his father played the violin. Roger learned to play the guitar. Upon completing his primary education, Whittaker was admitted to Prince of Wales School (now Nairobi School). Upon completing his high school education, he was called up for national service and spent two years in the Kenya Regiment fighting the Mau Mau in the Aberdare Forest. In 1956 he was demobilized and decided on a career in medicine. He enrolled at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. However, he left after 18 months and joined the civil service education department as a teacher, following in his mother's footsteps. Recording and performing career To further his teaching career, Whittaker moved to Britain in September 1959. For the next three years, he studied zoology, biochemistry and marine biology at Bangor University and earned a Bachelor of Science degree while singing in local clubs and released songs on Flexi discs included with the campus newspaper, the Bangor University Rag. Shortly afterwards, he was signed to Fontana Records, which released his first professional single, \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\", in 1962. (On the labels of the Fontana singles, he is billed as \\"Rog Whittaker\\".) In the summer of 1962, Whittaker performed in Portrush, Northern Ireland. He achieved a breakthrough when he was signed to appear on an Ulster Television show called This and That. His second single was a cover version of \\"Steel Men\\", released in June 1962. In 1966, Whittaker switched from Fontana to EMI's Columbia label, and was billed as Roger Whittaker from this point forward. His fourth single for the imprint was \\"Durham Town (The Leavin')\\", which in 1969 became Whittaker's first UK Top 20 hit. Whittaker's US label, RCA Victor, released the uptempo \\"New World in the Morning\\" in 1970, where it became a Top 20 hit in Billboard magazine's Easy Listening chart. That same year, his downbeat theme song \\"No Blade of Grass\\", written for the film adaptation of the same name that was sung during both the opening and ending titles, became his first film credit. In the early 1970s, Whittaker took interest in the Nordic countries when he recorded the single \\"Where the Angels Tread\\" (√Ñnglamarken) to the music of Evert Taube in 1972. In 1974 he performed at the Finnish Eurovision qualifications. The song \\"The Finnish Whistler\\" he performed became famous in Finland as it was used as a title music for the popular Finnish Yle television cooking programme Patakakkonen. In 1975 EMI released \\"The Last Farewell\\", a track from his 1971 New World in the Morning album. It became his biggest hit and a signature song, selling more than 11 million copies worldwide. In 1979, Whittaker wrote the song \\"Call My Name\\" which reached the final of the UK Eurovision selection, A Song For Europe, performed by Eleanor Keenan and coming third. Whittaker recorded the song himself and the single charted in several European countries. He established himself in country music with \\"I Love You Because\\" getting \\"into the lower reaches of the country chart\\" in late 1983. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Whittaker had success in Germany, with German language songs produced by Nick Munro. Unable to speak German, Whittaker sang the songs phonetically. He appeared on German and Danish TV several times, and was on the UK Top of the Pops show ten times in the 1970s. Whittaker's German- language songs were not initially well received by the critics, who derided the songs as \\"meaningless folk music\\". Notwithstanding, Whittaker released 25 albums in Germany and managed to grow a considerable fan base within the country, where he feels he has his most loyal fans, saying \\"The past few decades have been wonderful ‚Ä¶ My relationship with the German fans is great.\\" In March 2006, Whittaker announced on his website that a 2007 Germany tour would be his last, and that he would limit future performances to \\"occasional concerts\\". Now more fluent in German, he was seen singing and was interviewed in German on Danish TV in November 2008. In a 2014 interview, Whittaker reiterated that he had retired from touring in 2013, but claimed that he had written 18 new songs for an album and said \\"I still whistle very well\\". Personal life Before moving on to a career in music, Whittaker studied medicine and trained as a teacher in his native Kenya. He also completed his National Service in the Kenya Regiment. He said that he was \\"stupid, selfish and angry\\" in his youth and that the army \\"made a man\\" out of him. On 1 April 1989, Whittaker's parents (still living in Kenya) were subjected to a brutal attack by a gang of four men in which his mother was tortured for eight hours and his father was murdered. His mother moved back to England after the incident. Roger Whittaker said about the incident, \\"It will affect me for the rest of my life, but I believe we should all live without hate if we can\\". In 1964, Roger met Natalie O'Brien, and they married in August. She has been Whittaker's manager since 1989. They have six children: three sons and three daughters (Emily, Lauren, Jessica, Guy, Daniel and Alexander). Jessica became a presenter on VH-1. They now have 11 grandchildren. In 1986, he published his autobiography, So Far, So Good, co-written with his wife. In recent years he had been living in Eyrecourt, County Galway, Ireland, close to the River Shannon. He moved to France in 2012. Tours In 1976, Whittaker undertook his first tour of the United States. In 2003, he again toured Germany. After recovering from heart problems at the end of 2004, he started touring in Germany in 2005, and then in the UK from May to July. Awards In his career to date, Whittaker has earned over 250 silver, gold and platinum awards. He was part of a successful British team that won the annual Knokke Music Festival in Belgium, and won the Press Prize as the personality of the festival. He was awarded a 'Gold Badge Award', from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA) in 1988 and earned a \\"Golden Tuning Fork\\" (Goldene Stimmgabel in Germany) in 1986, based on record sales and TV viewer votes. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1982 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

It is lower than Dinner Plain in Victoria, and lower than Charlotte Pass Village in New South Wales. The last residents are scheduled to leave the town in January 2018 with the current workforce housed being replaced with drive-in/drive-out staff. The name Cabramurra may be derived from Wiradjuri gambirra marra (\\"crooked hand\\"). History Cabramurra was established in 1954 using prefabricated houses, as part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme and associated Snowy Mountains Hydro- Electric Scheme. An earlier surveying camp had been established there in 1951. The town was moved some 500m and 20m vertically to a more sheltered position, its current site, in 1974, leaving the original site as the lookout. The original houses were either demolished or relocated to Talbingo, Adaminaby and Jindabyne. The new houses were built with Besser blocks to a design specifically tailored to the environment. Long steep roofs allow snow to slide off, and the interiors are designed around a central heater (originally fuelled by oil) which warms all rooms in the house either directly or indirectly (chimney passes between upstairs bedrooms). All power and phone lines are routed underground. In early January 2020 the town was damaged by fire during the 2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season. In the town itself a \\"significant number\\" of houses and buildings were lost, plus the school and old ski club. Present status Cabramurra is a 'company town', being the place of residence for workers in the nearby Tumut 1 and Tumut 2 power stations and electrical switching yards, and Tumut Pondage dam. Only persons directly employed by Snowy Hydro, and their families, are permitted to live in the town. The town has 269 houses, a general store and petrol station, primary school, wet canteen (pub) (tavern), indoor swimming pool, single 'Poma' tow downhill ski slope, and tennis courts. The nearest small town for other shopping is Adaminaby; the nearest large towns/cities (that is, with a hospital) are Canberra, Tumut and Cooma. Emergency evacuation can be conducted by helicopter. The primary school has one classroom, with one teacher taking all the children. The nearest high schools are at Tumbarumba and Cooma but only Tumbarumba is served by a daily bus service. The short Snowy Hydro airstrip on the plateau above the town is often used by military aircraft practising short landing/takeoff exercises. The town's water supply is close to this airstrip and is known as \\"Dry Dam\\", on the dirt road that goes to Kiandra via \\"Kings Cross\\" and the Selwyn Snowfields day-only ski resort. In winter, unlike the vast majority of Australia, the town can be covered by snow for 3‚Äì4 months. This has dictated the building design with a very highly pitched roof for the houses. The town's downhill ski run was the first in Australia to have lighting installed to allow night use. The town is located within the boundaries of Kosciuszko National Park, on the road between Kiandra on the Snowy Mountains Highway to the north and Khancoban, another hydro- electric power site, to the south. The road is kept open to and beyond Kiandra by snow plough during winter, also serving the Selwyn Snowfields. The road south of Tumut Pond Dam is closed to traffic. The permanent workforce of the settlement is currently being replaced with drive-in/drive-out staff, however the school will remain open to service surrounding areas. Climate Cabramurra has a subalpine climate (IBRA 1,400‚Äì1,800 m) with cool summers and cold, very snowy winters. In terms of precipitation, Cabramurra is a very wet climate during the cooler months, but still retains significant sunshine hours due to its summer dry-season. Under the K√∂ppen classification, the town has a cold oceanic climate (Cfb). Owing to the town's position, perched over the western escarpment of the ranges, temperature inversion does not occur as the coldest air drains into the valleys and plains; thereby giving Cabramurra much warmer minimum temperatures than surrounding areas of its altitude and latitude, such as nearby Kiandra. Instead of radiational cooling, Cabramurra receives its coldest temperatures solely via cold-pooling (caused by its persistent winter snowpack).

Comparison between Moldova's and Transnistria's political system While Transnistria has a strongly centralized political system, with the president being also the head of government and having the right to appoint the heads of local (rayonal) administrations, in Moldova the prime minister, elected by the parliament, is the head of government and the heads of rayonal administrations are established by the rayonal councils resulted from local elections. In Transnistria, the president is elected directly, while in Moldova, the president is elected by the parliament, the political structure of Moldova being a parliamentary republic. Participation of Transnistrians at Moldovan elections The number of Transnistrian holding Moldovan citizenship is disputed. According to the Moldovan government, 400,000 Transnistrians have Moldovan citizenship,Nearly 400 thousand Transnistrians have Moldovan passports (Azi.md) which would be the majority of the population and would exceed by a wide margin the amount of ethnic Moldovans living in Transnistria. However, 2004 Transnistrian census data puts the official number of Transnistrians with Moldovan citizenship at 107,600 people (19.4% of respondents).2004 Census results Transnistria does not allow the organisation of Moldovan elections in Transnistrian territory, just like Moldova does not allow the organisation of Transnistrian elections in Moldovan territory. Polling stations were organised only in those areas of Transnistria under Moldovan government control. Political parties from Moldova have organisations in TransnistriaPosition of Transnistrian structures of \\"Our Moldova\\" Alliance but refuse to participate in elections organized by the de facto Republic. They participate only in the elections of the Republic of Moldova. In 2005 Moldovan parliamentary elections nine special polling stations were organised near the Dniester for \\"guest voters\\" coming from Transnistria who wished to vote in the Moldovan elections. Around 8000 citizens voted there, who were included in supplementary voter rolls. In those special polling stations results were: 30% for Communist Party of Moldova (compared with 46% in entire Moldova), 50% for Democratic Moldova Bloc (28.5% in entire Moldova), 8% for Christian-Democratic Party (9.1% in entire Moldova) and 6% for each Social Democratic Party and Patria-Rodina Bloc. Due to large turnout of Transnistrian voters queues were formed and some voters didn't manage to vote. As claimed by the Coalition for Free and Democratic Elections, many Transnistrian voters were not informed properly about the place of the voting and some owners of Soviet passports which don't bear the mention \\"citizen of Moldova\\" were not allowed to vote.e-democracy report about 2005 Moldovan election See also *Elections in Moldova References External links *Transnistria's \\"Government\\" Showcases Foreign, Minority Rule, Global Policy Forum, 2 February 2007 *Russian organizations in Transnistria campaign for a second Kaliningrad, Vladimir Socor, Eurasia Daily Monitor, 11 August 2006 *Russia‚Äôs Business to Vote for President of Transdniestria, Kommersant, 1 November 2006 *A thaw in the river, The Economist 19 April 2007 History of Transnistria since 1991 ","title":"Politics of Transnistria"},{"id":"1387214","text":"Mansfield Woodhouse is a settlement about north of Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, England, along the main A60 road in a wide, low valley between the Rivers Maun and Meden.OS Explorer Map 270: Sherwood Forest: (1:25 000): Founded before the Roman Empire, it is noteworthy for its stone-built centre. Originally separate with an urban district council, after continuous development it has become a large part of the Mansfield Urban Area. After the Local Government Act 1972, Mansfield Woodhouse and Warsop Urban District Councils merged with the Municipal Borough of Mansfield on 1 April 1974, to form a new local government area known as Mansfield District Council. Mansfield Woodhouse's economy was traditionally based on the quarrying, mining, farming and textile industries. History The Romans had a fortress and a civilian settlement in the area (remains of a Roman villa were famously found here by Hayman Rooke in the 1780s). The area declined after the Romans left but by the 13th century, there was a growing settlement of smallholders. On 12 September 1304, fire destroyed the settlement, including its timber- framed church. The settlement was rebuilt using local materials and the new stone-built church, Church of St Edmund, Mansfield Woodhouse, still stands. The settlement recovered and by Tudor times, was home to a number of wealthy families. Farming and quarrying were the main livelihoods and Mansfield Woodhouse also prospered with the growth of the textile and hosiery trades into the 19th century. In 1839 the designer of the Houses of Parliament, Sir Charles Barry, selected a sand-coloured magnesian limestone as the stone that would be used in its construction. This was quarried in Anston, South Yorkshire as well as in Mansfield Woodhouse. On the road to Edwinstowe stands the Parliament Oak, which, according to legend, was once the location of a session of Parliament held by the king. There is a commemorative plaque. During the UK miners' strike, some coal miners at nearby Sherwood Colliery on the edge of Mansfield Woodhouse continued working, a decision made with members and officials as part of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, a breakaway from the National Union of Mineworkers.

Biography  Dutkiewicz, of Polish, Austrian, Scottish, and English descent, grew up in Westhampton, Massachusetts. Dutkiewicz attended Hampshire Regional High School. Dutkiewicz also later attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, studying production, audio engineering, and bass guitar. While at college, he began playing in the band Aftershock with friend Joel Stroetzel. Stroetzel would later join Dutkiewicz, Mike D'Antonio, and Jesse Leach in forming Killswitch Engage. Dutkiewicz was the drummer of Killswitch Engage, until the release of its second album, Alive or Just Breathing, when he moved to guitars, and Tom Gomes became the band's drummer. He has assumed the role of producer on all of Killswitch Engage's records, except on their second self-titled album Killswitch Engage, which was released June 30, 2009. For this album he took on the job of co-producer alongside Brendan O'Brien (known for his work with AC/DC, The Offspring, Pearl Jam, Rage Against the Machine, Incubus, Mastodon, and Stone Temple Pilots). Adam has also produced for the bands As I Lay Dying, Under√∏ath, The Devil Wears Prada, The Acacia Strain, Unearth, All That Remains, From Autumn to Ashes, Johnny Truant, Parkway Drive, The Agony Scene, Every Time I Die and others. He has been compared to Ross Robinson, producer of many nu metal albums, because of his influence on modern metal and shaping the sound of melodic metalcore. He is also an engineer for Zing Recording Studios, which has produced for numerous artists, including several from Tooth & Nail Records and its heavy metal sub-label Solid State Records. In 2016, Adam formed Serpentine Dominion also consisting George \\"Corpsegrinder\\" Fisher and Shannon Lucas. Equipment Adam Dutkiewicz (far right) performing in Times of Grace. =Guitars= Dutkiewicz has been a longtime player of Caparison Guitars mostly using the Caparison PLM-3, a discontinued model, with EMG pickups (EMG 85 in the bridge, and two EMG SA single coils in the middle and neck positions) and DR Tite-Fit .012-.052 strings. He also uses the Caparison Dellinger, Horus, TAT, and Angelus models. He is quoted as saying that he likes the guitars because they have a very \\"strat-like neck.\\" Ever since 2007, he has been seen using various models and brands, but still uses Caparison for tracking in the studio. In 2008 shows, he used a black Parker Fly with an EMG 81/EMG 85 set for pickups. Atop this, he used a custom Caparison, modeled after the Dellinger model. He previously used Parker Guitars for their light weight so as to avoid worsening his back problems, but ended his endorsement due to quality issues after getting his signature model. Sometime in 2008, he switched to using a stock PRS Guitars Custom 22, which he used for a few years. In the video for \\"In Due Time\\", Adam can be seen using an EVH Wolfgang Hardtail. He has since then switched to EVH Wolfgangs full-time. The modifications done to the Wolfgangs involve removing the neck pickup, pickup selector switch, and tone knob, replacing the Schaller fine-tuning stop-tail piece with a standard stop-tail piece, replacing the locking nut with a standard nut, and installing locking tuners. Adam Dutkiewicz officially re-joined Caparison Guitars in 2015. Adam now also uses Fishman Fluence Modern pickups. He uses his signature model, the Caparison Metal Machine. It is based on the TAT Special FX with Fishman Fluence Killswitch Engage Signature pickup in the bridge position. He left out the neck pickup for more wood mass in the guitar.https://www.caparisonguitars.com/products/tat-special-fx-metal-machine- adam-dutkiewicz-signature/ =Amplification and effects= Dutkiewicz has used a wide variety of amps throughout his career, including the Mesa Boogie Roadster and Triple Rectifier heads, a Marshall JCM900, a modified Soldano SLO-100, and a Hughes and Kettner TriAmp MKII, which he did not like for metal because he said it \\"didn't hold together well.\\" He has also used the Framus Cobra and Dragon, the Peavey 5150, the Splawn Nitro, the Diezel VH4, and the Fuchs Viper for distorted tones, and the Fender Twin '65 Reverb and Vox AC30 for clean tones. He is currently endorsed by Laney Amplification, used their Ironheart series of amplifiers and currently using Tony Iommi‚Äôs signature amplifier TI-100. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbzdGCg_edw In his current live amp rig, he uses both Laney amps, making use of a Laney Iommi head with a Celestion Vintage 30-loaded Laney Iommi 4x12 cabinet for his distorted tones, and a Laney Lionheart 1x12 combo for clean tones. For his current live effects rig, he makes use of a Maxon OD808 Overdrive, Maxon AD-9 delay, Maxon CP-9 Pro+ compressor, Boss Corporation NS-2 Noise Suppressor, Boss ABY switcher, Jet City JetDirect DI box, and a Korg DTR2000 tuner. For wireless, he uses an Audio-Technica 5000 Series. He currently uses D'Addario EXL115 (.011 - .049) string sets with Intune 1.14mm picks. Stage show Adam Dutkiewicz (far right) performing in Killswitch Engage. Adam Dutkiewicz is well known for his unique stage attire. Joel Stroetzel stated about Adam's stage personality saying: \\"Adam likes to take the piss out of things. Just wants to have a good time‚Äîkind of act like an asshole, but in a funny way. He likes to get people going, egg the crowd on. He gets up there and calls the crowd ‚Äòpussies‚Äô and all this stuff. But coming from a guy wearing short shorts and a cape, you gotta take things like that in stride.\\" Jesse Leach has stated about Adam's stage attire: \\"That's his sort of middle finger to everybody, to all the people who act very tough and think metal has to be doom and gloom and trying to be a cool or tough guy, that's his punk rock way.\\" https://www.ultimate- guitar.com/news/general_music_news/killswitch_engages_leach_i_never_liked_term_metalcore_its_not_accurate_representation_of_all_bands_in_that_category.html Personal life Dutkiewicz used to be straight edge.http://roadrunnerrecords.co.uk/2010/01/getting-to-know-you-adam-d- killswitch-engage/ On February 10, 2015, Dutkiewicz was a contestant on the CBS game show The Price Is Right where he won $51,832 in prizes including a 2015 Honda Fit, a 2015 Nissan Frontier, a small trailer, and a trip to Borrego Springs.

Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Dorris had built an experimental gasoline car circa 1896‚Äì1897 in his family's bicycle shop. He relocated to St. Louis, Missouri, where he joined with John L. French to found the St. Louis Motor Company. Dorris served as chief engineer. When French relocated to Peoria, Illinois, in 1905, Dorris quit the firm and founded the Dorris Motor Car Company soon after. With his departure, French and the St. Louis Motor Carriage Company quickly foundered. History 1921 Dorris Model 6-80 Dorris is credited with developing and patenting the float carburetor, an innovation that was used for decades. For much of the Dorris production life the slogan was \\"Built up to a standard, not down to a price.\\" =Production vehicle= The company took over the original St. Louis Motor Company plant and began production there. The first vehicle had a four-cylinder engine with wheel- base, which took the New York Automobile Show by storm in January 1906. Over time, Dorris' cars became more powerful, graduating from a four to six- cylinder engine, and increasing nearly in the wheelbase. The engines were of the OHV design, unusual at the time.Automobile Engineering, American Technical Society, Chicago, Vol. 1 p. 28, 1919 edition The price tag of these cars was nearly $7,000.

His early work was concerned with the development and use of fluorescent probes for the study of structure and function of membranes and enzymes. He became interested in using spectroscopic methods including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study complex biological material. In 1974, his research paper was the first to introduce the use of NMR to study tissue metabolites. In 1981, he and his colleagues published the first scientific report on the clinical application of his work. This resulted in the installation of a magnet large enough to accommodate the whole human body for NMR investigations in 1983 at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. From 1996, until his retirement in 2004, Sir George was Chief Executive of the Medical Research Council in the UK. Currently, Sir George is the new head of the merged departments of Physiology and Human Anatomy and Genetics at the University of Oxford and Chairman of the Singapore Bioimaging Consortium, a research institute of ASTAR in Singapore.

Among many other things, he helped finance the expansion of American railroads and the Japanese military efforts against Tsarist Russia in the Russo-Japanese War. Born in Frankfurt, Germany, Schiff migrated to the United States after the American Civil War and joined the firm Kuhn, Loeb & Co. From his base on Wall Street, he was the foremost Jewish leader from 1880 to 1920 in what later became known as the \\"Schiff era\\", grappling with all major Jewish issues and problems of the day, including the plight of Russian Jews under the Tsar, American and international anti-semitism, care of needy Jewish immigrants, and the rise of Zionism.Naomi Wiener Cohen, Jacob H. Schiff: a study in American Jewish leadershipGlazer, N (1957) American Judaism, UCP. He also became a director of many important corporations, including the National City Bank of New York, Equitable Life Assurance Society, Wells Fargo & Company, and the Union Pacific Railroad. In many of his interests he was associated with E. H. Harriman. Early life Schiff was born in 1847 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, to Moses and Clara (n√©e Niederhofheim) Schiff, members of a distinguished Ashkenazi Jewish rabbinical family that traced its lineage in Frankfurt back to 1370. One ancestor, David Tevele Schiff, became lead rabbi in Great Britain and from 1765 until his death was acting head of the London Synagogue. Meir Ben Jacob Schiff, another relative, had become renowned as a Talmudic scholar and commentator in the 14th century. Jacob's father, Moses Schiff, was a broker for the Rothschilds. Schiff was educated in the schools of Frankfurt, and was first employed in the banking and brokerage business as an apprentice in 1861.The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, Vol. XIII, p. 533. New York: James T. White & Company, 1906. After the American Civil War had ended in April 1865, Schiff came to the United States, arriving in New York City on August 6. He became a broker on November 21, 1866, and joined the firm of Budge, Schiff & Company in 1867. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in September 1870. Upon the dissolution of Budge, Schiff & Company in 1872, Schiff decided to return to Germany. In 1873 he became manager of the Hamburg branch of the London & Hanseatic Bank. He returned to Frankfurt, however, upon the death of his father later that year. In 1874 Abraham Kuhn of the banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Company invited him to return to New York and enter the firm.

Cutting, and Joseph Seligman, he was a founder of the Continental Bank of New York in August 1870. =Kuhn, Loeb & Company= Schiff accepted Kuhn's invitation in January 1875, bringing to Kuhn, Loeb & Company his connections with Sir Ernest Cassel of London, Robert Fleming of Dundee (later of London), and of the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas. On May 6, 1875, he married Therese Loeb, daughter of Solomon Loeb. The couple were the parents of a son, Mortimer L. Schiff and a daughter, Frieda.Their daughter Frieda Schiff-Warburg (February 3, 1876 ‚Äì September 14, 1958); married Felix M. Warburg in 1895. Both her husband and her brother became partners in Kuhn, Loeb & Co. In 1885 Schiff became head of Kuhn, Loeb & Company. Besides financing such Eastern railroads as the Pennsylvania and the Louisville & Nashville, he took part in the reorganization of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in 1896‚Äì99, and at various times aided the American Smelting & Refining Company (ASARCO), the Westinghouse Electric Company, and the Western Union Telegraph Company. Less fortunate was his share in the reorganization in 1902 of the Metropolitan Street Railway of New York. He became associated with E. H. Harriman in notable contests with James J. Hill and J.P. Morgan & Company for control of several Western railroads. Schiff served as a director of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, National City Bank of New York, Central Trust Company, Western Union Telegraph Company, Union Pacific Railroad, Bond & Mortgage Guarantee Company, and Wells Fargo & Company. He was elected a director of Wells Fargo in September 1914 to succeed his brother-in-law, Paul Warburg, who had resigned to accept appointment to the original Federal Reserve Board. =National loans= What was perhaps Schiff's most famous financial action was during the Russo-Japanese War, in 1904 and 1905. Schiff met Takahashi Korekiyo, deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, in Paris in April 1904. He subsequently extended loans to the Empire of Japan in the amount of $200 million (equivalent to $ billion in ), through Kuhn, Loeb & Co. These loans were the first major flotation of Japanese bonds on Wall Street, and provided approximately half the funds needed for Japan's war effort. Schiff made this loan partly because he believed that gold was not as important as national effort and desire in winning a war, and due to the apparent underdog status of Japan at the time; no European nation had yet been defeated by a non-European nation in a modern, full-scale war. It is quite likely Schiff also saw this loan as a means of answering, on behalf of the Jewish people, the anti-Semitic actions of the Russian Empire, specifically the then-recent Kishinev pogrom of 1903. This loan attracted worldwide attention, and had major consequences. Japan won the war, thanks in large part to the purchase of munitions made possible by Schiff's loan.In 1905, Japan awarded Schiff the Order of the Sacred Treasure;Cyrus Adler, Jacob Henry Schiff: A Biographical Sketch, p. 12. New York: The American Jewish Committee, 1921 and in 1907, the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star, the second highest of the eight classes of that Order.Adler, p. 14. Schiff was the first foreigner to receive the Order in person from Emperor Meiji in the Imperial Palace.Pamela Rotner Sakamoto, Japanese Diplomats and Jewish Refugees, p. 17. Westport, Conn.: Praeger Publishers, 1998. Schiff also had a private audience with King Edward VII of the United Kingdom in 1904. In addition to his famous loan to Japan, Schiff financed loans to many other nations, including those that would come to comprise the Central Powers. During World War I, Schiff urged U.S. President Woodrow Wilson and other Allied statesmen to end the war as quickly as possible, even without an Allied victory. He feared for the lives of his family, back in Germany, but also for the future of his adopted land. He arranged loans to France and other nations for humanitarian purposes, and spoke out against submarine warfare. Schiff made sure none of the funds from his loans ever went to the Russian Empire, which he felt oppressed Jewish people. When the Russian Empire fell in 1917, Schiff believed that the oppression of Jews would end. He formally repealed the impediments within his firm against lending to Russia. However, Schiff's stance changed upon the Bolsheviks seizure of power: > \\"Schiff's gripe against Russia had been its anti-Semitism. At home Schiff > had never shown any sympathy for socialism, not even the milder Morris > Hillquit variety. Schiff had declared victory for his purposes in Russia > after the tsar was toppled in March 1917 and Alexander Kerensky, > representing the new provisional government, had declared Jews to be equal > citizens. In addition to repeated public statements of support, he used both > his personal wealth and the resources of Kuhn Loeb to float large loans to > Kerensky's regime. When Lenin and Trotsky seized power for themselves in > November 1917, Schiff immediately rejected them, cut off further loans, > started funding anti-Bolshevist groups, and even demanded that the > Bolsheviks pay back some of the money he'd loaned Kerensky. Schiff also > joined a British-backed effort to appeal to fellow Jews in Russia to > continue the fight against Germany.\\" Charitable endeavors Schiff always felt strongly about his connection to the Jewish people, and demonstrated this through his philanthropy. He founded the Jewish Industrial Removal Office which relocated New York immigrant Jews to western United States. He also founded an additional point of immigrant entry to the U.S. through Galveston, Texas. He supported relief efforts for the victims of pogroms in Russia, and helped establish and develop Hebrew Union College, the Jewish Theological Seminary, the Jewish Division in the New York Public Library, and the American Jewish Committee. Schiff grew to be one of American Jewry's top philanthropists and leaders, donating to nearly every major Jewish cause, New York examples being the Montefiore Home for Chronic Invalids, of which he was president,Heilbrunn, Bernice. \\"Jacob H.

Last modified August 05, 2013. the Young Men's Hebrew Association building and the Jewish Theological Seminary. He was also involved with many secular American causes: in addition to serving on the Board of Managers of the New York Zoological Society, he gave to such organizations as the Boy Scouts of America, the Harvard Semitic Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, Metropolitan Museum of Art, American Fine Arts Society, American Geographical Society, and Barnard College; and a number of other organizations for civil rights and the disadvantaged, such as the American Red Cross, the Visiting Nurse Service of New York and Henry Street Settlement (New York) and Tuskegee Institute. On his 70th birthday, he distributed $700,000 among various charitable organizations and public institutions. Schiff was actively concerned with the improvement of civic conditions in New York. He was a vice president of the New York Chamber of Commerce, and a member of the Committee of 70 which resulted in the overthrow of the Tweed Ring. Last years The Action Fran√ßaise movement and its leader, Charles Maurras, claimed that Schiff was thoroughly pro-German and had worked to prevent American entry into World War I. Maurras went so far as to suggest that a telegram from Schiff and other prominent American Jewish leaders convinced President Wilson to give in to certain German arguments at the post-war peace negotiations ‚Äì including allowing Upper Silesia to have a plebiscite rather than being ceded to Poland.Charles Maurras, Dictionnaire Politique et Critique, 1930‚Äì32, vol. II, pages 361‚Äì3. The telegram is not known to have actually existed. Moreover, it has been argued that Schiff stopped financing transactions for Germany or the Central Powers as of 1914, stopped speaking German in public and was eager to demonstrate his moral and financial commitment to the Allied cause.Stephen Birmingham, Our Crowd: The Great Jewish Families of New York, at p. 316‚Äì7 A practitioner of Reform Judaism,\\"Schiff: Jacob Henry Schiff\\". Jewish Encyclopedia. Schiff supported political, secular Zionism. Despite not agreeing fully with the ideas of Theodore Herzl, and in fact believing that Zionism would cause Americans to question his loyalty, he donated to many Jewish projects in Israel, including the Technical Institute of Haifa. As the situation for Eastern European Jews grew more dire, with the Russian Revolution and subsequent Russian Civil War, and pogroms in Ukraine, Schiff made more considerable contributions to the Zionist effort; he even offered to join the Zionist organization, provided he could publish a statement he'd prepared. This offer was denied, and so he never formally joined the Zionist camp. Historian George F. Kennan noted that Schiff helped finance revolutionary propaganda during the Russo-Japanese war and revolution of 1905, through the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom. The Jewish Communal Register of New York City stated that \\"Mr. Schiff has always used his wealth and his influence in the best interests of his people. He financed the enemies of autocratic Russia and used his financial influence to keep Russia from the money markets of the United States.\\"The Jewish Communal Register of New York City, 1917-1918, Second Edition, Kehillah, New York, (1919), p. 1019 Schiff died at his Fifth Avenue home in Manhattan, New York City on September 25, 1920. His funeral was held three days later at Temple Emanu-El, then located at Forty-third Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. His estate was estimated at about $50,000,000 (approximately $ today). He bequeathed $1,350,000 to various institutions, most of which had received benefactions during his life. The largest bequests were $500,000 to the Federation for the support of Jewish Philanthropic Societies of New York City and $300,000 to the Montefiore Home. Legacy He was succeeded as head of Kuhn, Loeb & Company by his son, Mortimer Leo Schiff (1877‚Äì1931). Schiff was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1982. The Jacob Schiff Center, named after him, was a prominent Jewish cultural center and synagogue from the 1930s through at least the 1960s. It was located on Valentine Avenue, near the intersection of Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse in the Fordham section of the Bronx.Julian Voloj, \\"On Fordham Road: Signs of the Times\\". The New York Times. October 22, 2006. New York City public school number 192 in West Harlem is also named for him. It serves grades pre-K through 5.

This administrative dependency lasted until it was elevated to status of vila, as stipulated by the Carta de Lei (Charter Law) conferred by Queen D. Maria, on July 10, 1839. There exists a couple of versions for Capela's toponymic origin. Father Gaspar Frutuoso in Saudades das Terras notes the following: :\\"Some say that they call it 'capelas', not because there existed in those parts churches or chapels, but that on the feast day of Saint John [the Baptist] some men constructed there some [small] chapels, forgetting them hung from a tree...\\" Likewise, the brothers Bullar, in an account in their journeys, referred to a likely reality: they refer to a general local reference to the rocks along the coast as capelas, rocks taking on the appearance of small grottos and seeming to appear as chapels. Its main church, to the invocation of Nossa Senhora da Apresenta√ß√£o (Our Lady of the Presentation) was raised on the ruins of an older priory and concluded in 1780. Similarly, the church of Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o, built on the orders of Captain Agostinho de Medeiros Costa, in the 17th century, and reconstructed and expanded in 1830. Although Capelas may not have been named for the religious sanctuaries that were erected there, there are many to speak of, including the chapels of Anjo da Guarda, Santa Rita, Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio and Nossa Senhora de Santana, as well as many smaller hermitages to the invocation of the Holy Spirit. During the whaling era in the Azores (early to middle 20th Century), Capelas was an important northern processing center on the island of S√£o Miguel; close to the public pools around Po√ßos is the ruins of the mixed-use factory used to process whale oil and mill flour. In Calhau Mi√∫do there existed two factories (Companhia Nova and Companhia Velha) to process whale byproducts during this period. Geography View of the Morre of Capelas, along the northern coast, as seen from the outlook in S√£o Vicente Ferreira Located along the northern coast, the parish has been connected to major centers by a series of roads linking the community to the city of Ponta Delgada (to the south), Mosteiros (to the west) and Ribeira Grande (to the east). Farmlands dominate the north and east portions of the parish, while the area from the E.R.1-1¬™ regional road towards the interior are dominated by mountains, river valleys and some ancient volcanic cones. The administrative extent of Capelas incorporates the localities () of Teatro Novo, Concei√ß√£o and Po√ßos. Capelas has two small ports, one of which (known as \\"Po√ßos\\") played a crucial role during centuries when Capelas was an important whaling center. Culture =Festivities= On the fourth Sunday of August, the community celebrates the feast day of the parishes patron, Our Lady of the Presentation. Similar acts of faith are also expressed in the festivals of Corpo de Deus (Body of Christ) and Nossa Senhora de Lurdes (Our Lady of Lourdes).

He also printed many maps that were often out of print, which he reissued. Some of his most popular maps were of the African continent, detailing locations such as Morocco and Madagascar. Many of his later works were printed for the general public in French and Dutch.  Early life and family  Pieter van der Aa's mark, with the Latin motto Tempore et industria Pieter van der Aa was born the son of a German stonecutter from Holstein, one of three sons who came to run a family printing business. His brother Boudewyn was a printer and his other brother Hildebrand a copper plate engraver.  Career  Pieter van der Aa began his career at Lieden in 1683 as a Latin trade publisher, publishing classical texts pertaining to medicine and science. As he progressed, he began to publish atlases and maps, compiling numerous multi-volume collections of works. His ambition to become Lieden's most famous printer was fulfilled in 1715 with his appointment to head printer for the city and its university. One of Pieter van der Aa's largest compilations relates to the history of Italy and Sicily, an area of immense personal interest. Though he took credit for many of his compilations, several, such as the Dutch collection of travels to the East and West Indies, were admittedly simple improvements to others' works.

The Landtag of Liechtenstein has 25 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation in two multi-seat constituencies. Electoral process A variation of the standard party-list proportional format is used to elect 15 members from the district of Oberland and 10 members from the district of Unterland. The highest- remainder method dictates each party‚Äôs seat total in a district based on their vote share (which will be covered in more detail) there. Elections in these two districts are essentially separate, and the individual municipal divisions technically play no role in determining the eventual winners. There are four parties currently registered in Liechtenstein: the Progressive Citizen‚Äôs Party (FBP), Patriotic Union (VU), the Independents (DU), and Free List (FL). Each party may nominate as many candidates in a district as can be elected there (15 available for Oberland and 10 for Unterland). Voters are assigned voting locations (either Oberland or Unterland district) based on their living. When voting, each voter must choose one party but is allowed to select as many candidates as they like (but only up to the maximum given: 15 candidate votes per Oberland voter and 10 candidate votes for each Unterland voter). Any ballots without a single party mark at the top are considered void, but will be accepted no matter how many candidates are chosen. If more candidates are chosen than the limit, the candidates following the fifteenth (if in Oberland) or tenth (if in Unterland) are ignored and only the first 15 (Oberland) or 10 (Unterland) distinct choices will count. If the name of a candidate is repeated, only in the first instance where the candidate is named is taken into consideration and all subsequent mentions are ignored. Although the number of candidates selected by each voter can vary and is up to their own determination, Oberland voters still must cast 15 total votes, and Unterland voters always give 10. The difference is made through the candidate rankings, which will be discussed later. Each candidate that is chosen by a voter counts as a vote for that candidate‚Äôs party. Each remaining vote out of the 15 (for Oberland) or 10 (for Unterland) corresponding to the number of candidates not chosen counts as a vote for the party initially specified by the voter. For example, if a voter from Oberland chooses the FBP as their party of choice, and then chooses 4 candidates from the VU, 2 candidates from the FBP, and 1 candidate from the DU, then the party votes that this voter has cast are 4 for the VU, 1 for the DU, and 10 for the FBP (by virtue of the 2 votes for candidates from this party and the 8 remaining, empty candidate votes). Likewise, if an Unterland voter chooses DU as their party of choice, then casts 18 votes for the same FBP candidate and a vote for each of 2 VU candidates, then this voter‚Äôs party votes are counted as 1 for the FBP (since only 1 FBP candidate was selected), 2 for the VU, and 7 for the DU due to the 7 remaining candidate votes. Note that it is impossible for a voter to cast votes for any party other than the one listed at the top of their ballot without selecting the requisite number of candidates from that party. This has been criticized by some as restricting the freedom of voters to choose multiple parties while refraining from supporting at least 1 particular candidate. Also keep in mind that a maximum of 1 vote can be cast for each candidate by a single voter, and thus it would be impossible for a given voter to cast multiple votes for a single candidate. Especially because parties may not nominate a full slate in a given district since the party usually desires maximum influence on the candidates elected and because it is unlikely for the party to win a very large majority of seats that they had not anticipated, voters who support just one party have complained that their influence is diminished because they can only support the candidates their party has nominated and thus their remaining votes would only count as party votes and not also candidate votes. Additionally as fact, the expected transition by Liechtenstein authorities to new, electronic voting machines could eliminate the possibility of a voter selecting too many candidates, especially if mistakenly believing that they would all be counted and being told that they could only vote for 15 in the Oberland and 10 in the Unterland. The party choice for each voter does not matter if the voter chooses the maximum number of candidates that they are allowed (15 in Oberland and 10 in Unterland) but makes a difference of one party vote if they leave one candidate choice blank, and it counts as two party votes if two are unchecked. Once the number of seats for each party in every district has been determined by the party vote count in that district, the corresponding candidates of that party with the highest number of votes are elected. For example, if the VU is given three seats in Unterland, then the 3 most popular VU candidates in Unterland are elected as the 3 representatives of the VU from the Unterland, regardless of how many votes these candidates garnered in relation to candidates from other parties. If a party is given more seats in a district than the number of candidates that it has nominated there, then the extra seats are redistributed to the other parties as if the party of concern had not received that many votes also by using the Hare quota. In this case, the maximum number of seats that this party can earn in the relevant district is also equivalent to the total candidates it has nominated there. It is important to note that votes for a party and votes for candidates are separate and affect the count differently: as explained above, party votes are used only for determining the number of seats given to a party in each district, while candidate votes determine which candidates from a party win election from each district, this value corresponding to the number of seats that the party in question receives as determined in the previous step. This is also why the two districts are not compared outside of the separate elections: Oberland voters get 15 votes each and Unterland voters 10 votes, which would distort support if a party‚Äôs vote share is different between the two districts. However, this is evened out because the seats are determined by district, and therefore both districts are approximately equally represented since the ratio of seats between them must be roughly proportional to their population difference.

Many of Ahern's comic strips took a surreal or screwball approach, notably The Squirrel Cage with its nonsensical catchphrase \\"Nov shmoz ka pop?\\"  Biography  Ahern was born and raised in Chicago, attending public schools and working as a butcher boy, as noted in a 1929 newspaper article: In his teens, he worked as a model, which he later recalled, \\"Daily, I slipped on cutaway coats, silk top hats and immaculate white gloves‚Äîand stood indolently in the front of a room while an artist sketched me for a catalogue.\\" =Comic strips= Room and Board (May 2, 1952) In 1914, after three years study at the Chicago Art Institute, Ahern went to Cleveland and worked for the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) syndicate as a sportswriter and artist, initially inking comic drawings for $18 a week.\\"Hoople v. Puffle, Time, May 11, 1936. He worked on such strips as Dream Dope, Fathead Fritz, Sporty Sid and his Pals, Taking Her to the Ball Game, Ain't Nature Wonderful, Squirrel Food, Balmy Benny and Otto Auto, about a man who loved driving so much that he couldn't stop. Comic strip historian Allan Holtz described the transitions of these Ahern creations: =The Nut Brothers= In 1921 he introduced the Nut Brothers, Ches and Wal, in Crazy Quilt. That same year, NEA General Manager Frank Rostock suggested to Ahern that he use a boarding house for a setting. Our Boarding House began September 16, 1921, scoring a huge success with readers after the January 1922 arrival of the fustian Major Hoople. The Nut Bros: Ches and Wal ran as a topper strip above Our Boarding House. =From Hoople to Puffle= Ahern was making an annual $35,000 at NEA, and King Features Syndicate offered to double that figure. Leaving NEA in March 1936 for King Features, Ahern created Room and Board (1936‚Äì1953). A resident in that boarding house was Judge Puffle, very much in the Hoople tradition. Don Markstein traced the proliferation of Puffle and other Hoople variations: =Radio= Our Boarding House was adapted into the radio series Major Hoople (1942‚Äì43). No copies of this radio series are known to exist.  Personal life  Living in California for 36 years, Ahern resided at 1280 Stone Canyon in Los Angeles during the 1940s. He was a member of the Los Angeles Art Association, the Bel-Air Country Club, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association and the National Cartoonists Society. When he died of a heart attack in 1960, he was survived by his wife, Jane; a daughter, Mrs. Nancy Hayward of Clemmons, North Carolina; a sister, Mrs. Donald McCurdy; and three brothers, Walter, Harold and John, all of Chicago.The New York Times, March 7, 1960. Influence Ahern's The Squirrel Cage (1936‚Äì53) featured a bearded character known as The Little Hitchhiker, who became notorious for his frequent expression, \\"Nov shmoz ka pop?\\", which he uttered while thumbing for a ride. Some sources say that the phrase is Russian for \\"Going my way?\\", others say that the phrase is complete nonsense. The character was the acknowledged inspiration for Robert Crumb's Mr. Natural. The Squirrel Cage was collected into a book by publisher Ken Pierce.Ken Pierce Books It was popular enough that it was used as nose art on at least two US bomber aircraft during the Second World War, a B-17G with 487th Bomb Group and a B-24 that served with the 466th, 93rd, and 446th Bomber Groups.http://www.b24bestweb.com/ridgerunner1.htm References Sources Strickler, Dave.

The season officially began on June 15, 1946, and lasted until November 15, 1946. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. However, the first storm, developed in the Gulf of Mexico on June 13, while the final system dissipated just offshore Florida on November 3\\\\. There were seven tropical storm; three of them attained hurricane status, while none intensified into major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. This had not occurred since 1940 and would not again until 1968. Operationally, the fifth tropical storm, which existed near the Azores in early October, was not considered a tropical cyclone, but was added to HURDAT in 2014. Although every tropical storm impacted land, effects overall were light, with less than $10 million (1946 USD) in damage and no deaths in the United States throughout the season. The season's most intense cyclone was the fourth hurricane. While the storm was moving northeastward offshore the East Coast of the United States, the Norwegian tanker Maril II was destroyed at sea, causing 16 drownings; the incident could not be directly attributed to the hurricane. The second storm brought relatively minor damage to the Cape Fear region of North Carolina after striking the state early in its duration. While an extratropical cyclone, the remnants of the fifth cyclone devastated a few islands of the Azores and left 120 fishermen missing. The Florida hurricane severely damaged sugar cane in western Cuba and caused five deaths in the island nation. Additionally, the storm left $5.2 million in damage in Florida, mostly inflicting citrus crops. The final storm caused several millions of dollars in damage to crops near Lake Okeechobee. __TOC__ Season summary ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/06/1946 till:01/12/1946 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/1946 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_‚â§39_mph_(‚â§62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(118‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì129_mph_(178‚Äì208_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_130‚Äì156_mph_(209‚Äì251_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_‚â•157_mph_(‚â•252_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:13/06/1946 till:16/06/1946 color:TS text:\\"One (TS)\\" from:05/07/1946 till:10/07/1946 color:C1 text:\\"Two (C1)\\" from:25/08/1946 till:26/08/1946 color:TS text:\\"Three (TS)\\" from:09/09/1946 till:10/09/1946 color:TD text:\\"Depression (TD)\\" from:12/09/1946 till:17/09/1946 color:C2 text:\\"Four (C2)\\" from:01/10/1946 till:06/10/1946 color:TS text:\\"Five (TS)\\" from:05/10/1946 till:14/10/1946 color:C2 text:\\"Six (C2)\\" from:31/10/1946 till:03/11/1946 color:TS text:\\"Seven (TS)\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/06/1946 till:01/07/1946 text:June from:01/07/1946 till:01/08/1946 text:July from:01/08/1946 till:01/09/1946 text:August from:01/09/1946 till:01/10/1946 text:September from:01/10/1946 till:01/11/1946 text:October from:01/11/1946 till:01/12/1946 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale)\\" The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 16, 1946. However, tropical cyclogenesis began on June 13, three days before the official start of the season. There was a total of seven tropical storms, slightly below the contemporaneous 20-year average of 8.5 per season. Three of those strengthened into hurricanes, while none reached major hurricane status - Category 3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale - for the first time since 1940 and it was a phenomenon that would not occur again until 1968. One hurricane made landfall in the United States, while the two other storms with winds of at least 74 mph (119 km/h) remained at sea during their strongest intensities. Overall in the United States, the season resulted in less than $10 million in damage and no deaths. Collectively, the storms of the season left at least $5.2 million in damage. The final cyclone of the season dissipated on November 3, 12 days before the official end of the season on November 15, 1946. Tropical cyclogenesis began with the development of a tropical storm over the Gulf of Mexico on June 13\\\\. The next system formed offshore the Southeastern United States on July 5\\\\. Activity then ceased for nearly seven weeks, until August 25, when the third storm originated in the Bay of Campeche. Although September is the climatological peak of hurricane season, there was only one tropical cyclone that strengthened to tropical storm status that month. The season's most intense storm developed on September 12 and later peaked as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and a lowest known barometric pressure of . Additionally, a tropical depression briefly existed near Central America. October was the most active month of the season, with three tropical cyclones. The third storm in October, which was the last system of the season, lasted until November 3\\\\. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 20, the lowest total since 1925 and until 1983. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph (63 km/h), which is tropical storm strength. Systems =Tropical Storm One= A disturbance accompanied by a small area of convection developed into a tropical depression about 165 miles (265 km) south-southwest of Cape San Blas, Florida, at 12:00 UTC on June 13. Moving slowly northwestward, the depression intensified into a tropical storm early on the next day. The storm did not deepen beyond maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h), while historical weather maps indicated a barometric pressure of on June 15, the lowest in relation to the storm. Later that day, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression offshore Louisiana. The storm made landfall just east of the Louisiana-Texas border on June 16 and rapidly dissipated. It may have remained a tropical depression throughout its lifespan but data was inconclusive. Winds of were observed at Grand Isle, Louisiana, while winds of \\"gentle to moderate force\\" occurred in Texas. =Hurricane Two= The interaction between a frontal boundary and a tropical wave resulted in the development of an extratropical cyclone on July 5 offshore the Southeastern United States. Throughout the day, the storm acquired tropical characteristics. Around 00:00 UTC on July 6, the system transitioned into a tropical storm while located about 35 mi (55 km) south-southeast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The cyclone moved northeastward and made landfall near Oak Island, North Carolina, around 08:00 UTC with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). In the state, Carolina Beach and Wrightsville Beach observed sustained winds of and gusts of . In the Wilmington area, winds damaged plate-glass windows and caused brief disruptions to electricity and communication services. Further inland, heavy rainfall, including in less than 24 hours in Manteo, resulted in considerable loss to crops, with 15%-20% damaged in some areas. That was the heaviest 24-hour precipitation total recorded in Manteo since observations began in 1905. The storm moved northeastward and reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean near the southern end of Bodie Island early on July 7\\\\. Shortly thereafter, the cyclone began strengthening and became a Category 1 hurricane by 12:00 UTC. After slightly further intensification, the hurricane reached peak intensity at 18:00 UTC on July 7 with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). It then curved eastward and began losing tropical characteristics. At 00:00 UTC on July 9, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located about south-southeast of Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia. The extratropical remnants gradually curved northeastward and then north-northeastward while slowly weakening. Late on July 10, the extratropical storm dissipated near Cape Race, Newfoundland. =Tropical Storm Three= In late August, a disturbance was monitored moving over the western Caribbean Sea near Great Swan Island. Despite favorable conditions, further development did not occur until after the it reached the Bay of Campeche. Early on August 25, it is estimated that a tropical storm developed after a reconnaissance aircraft flight reported that the system acquired a well- defined circulation. Peaking with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h), the storm moved quickly west-northwestward and made near Tampico, Tamaulipas, at 19:00 UTC. By early the next day, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated. A wind gust of 60 mph (95 km/h) was observed in Tampico. =Tropical depression= A tropical wave over the western Caribbean Sea developed into a tropical depression about 40 mi (65 km) north of the Swan Islands on September 9\\\\. However, by the following day, historical weather maps no longer indicated a tropical depression. It is uncertain whether the system dissipated or made landfall in Central America. =Hurricane Four= Early on September 12, the northern portion of a tropical wave spawned a tropical storm about 75 mi (120 km) east Andros Island. The storm strengthened while moving northeastward into the northern Bahamas, striking Andros Island later that day with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Late on September 12, the cyclone strengthened into a hurricane before making landfall on South Abaco with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). The hurricane intensified further after entering the open Atlantic, becoming on September 13\\\\. Shortly thereafter, it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of , both of which were observed during a reconnaissance aircraft flight. The storm accelerated and weakened due to cooler sea surface temperatures, falling to tropical storm status early on September 15\\\\. Shortly thereafter, the cyclone became extratropical about south of Cape Sable Island. The extratropical remnants moved across Newfoundland and the northern Atlantic, until dissipating well north of the Azores on September 17\\\\. In the Bahamas, Hope Town observed sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and stronger gusts, as well as a barometric pressure of . The Norwegian tanker Maril II sank after splitting in two, drowning sixteen people. However, because the Maril II was over away from the storm at the time, the incident could not be directly attributed to the hurricane. Some areas of Nova Scotia experienced strong winds, with sustained winds up to observed throughout the province and a gust of recorded at Sable Island. Heavy rain was also reported, with measured in Halifax. High seas during the Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron race \\"The Hood Cup\\" forced the yachts to return to port. When the radar image was taken, it was only the third time in history that a hurricane passed close enough to a radar site to reveal its structure. =Tropical Storm Five= A low pressure area initially associated with two frontal systems developed into a tropical depression about southwest of Flores Island in the Azores at 12:00 UTC on October 1. After six hours, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. It intensified further while moving east-northeastward. On October 2, the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of , both of which were observed by ships. The storm then began losing tropical characteristics and merged with a frontal boundary around 12:00 UTC on October 3 while situated about 275 mi (445 km) south-southwest of Pico Island in the Azores. This storm was not included in HURDAT until 2014. Although the system became extratropical, it continued to deepen further, with sustained winds reaching 90 mph (150 km/h) late on October 4\\\\. Additionally, it expanded significantly in size, reaching a diameter of about 1,035 mi (1,665 km) on October 5. Around that time, the storm passed through the Azores near Faial Island, before weakening and dissipating north of the island chain on October 6\\\\. Rough seas at Santa Maria Island left 120 fishermen missing, while 12 fishing vessels, 2 tugboats, and several launches were destroyed. Four fishing boats were also missing. Strong wind gusts up to caused \\"catastrophic\\" damage on Santa Maria and S√£o Miguel islands. Homes, crops, and pineapple greenhouses were demolished, while communications were knocked out. Additionally, Lajes Field on Terceira Island was \\"practically destroyed\\". =Hurricane Six= A disturbance from the Intertropical Convergence Zone developed into a tropical storm late on October 5, while located over the western Caribbean Sea near the Belize-Mexico border. It moved northeastward and strengthened, reaching Category 1 hurricane status the next day. At 04:00 UTC on October 7, the storm made landfall in western Cuba near Boca de Galafre, Pinar del R√≠o Province, with winds of . A barometric pressure of was observed, the lowest in relation to the system. Additionally, a station recorded a wind gust of . Several sugar cane fields were flattened, with millions of tons of the crop destroyed. In many towns, telephone and telegraphic communications were cut off. Five deaths occurred in Cuba. After emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on October 7, the storm curved north-northeastward and strengthened to a Category 2, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). After becoming a Category 2 hurricane on October 7, the cyclone weakened to a Category 1 just six hours later. Around 04:00 UTC on the following day, it made another landfall near Bradenton Beach, Florida, with winds of 85 mph (135 km/h). In Florida, the gusty winds and rainfall produced by the storm inflicted damage mostly on crops. About 2% of the state's total citrus crop was lost, with damage totaling $5 million. Only about $200,000 in property damage occurred, which was mostly due to coastal flooding in cities such as Everglades, Fort Myers, and Punta Gorda. Moving inland, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm later on October 8\\\\. Early on October 9, the system became extratropical over South Carolina. However, the extratropical remnants persisted for several days, moving in a semicircular path over the eastern Atlantic until dissipating well north of Hispaniola on October 14\\\\. =Tropical Storm Seven= A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression late on October 31 over the Bahamas about halfway between Acklins and Little Inagua. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm early on November 1 and moved northwestward, striking several islands, including Acklins, Long Island, Exuma, and Andros. Late on November 1, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . The system then made landfall near Lake Worth, Florida, at the same intensity around 22:00 UTC. Early on November 2, the storm weakened to a tropical depression and recurved northeastward over Central Florida. Shortly after reemerging into the Atlantic Ocean near Ponte Vedra Beach early on November 3, the depression dissipated about 45 mi (75 km) east-northeast of Fernandina Beach. Due to the weak nature of the storm, no wind damage occurred. However, flooding occurred around Lake Okeechobee due to rainfall reaching . Along main highways, several cars stalled, while a number of canals overflowed. Between 50%-70% of early fall crops in the area were damaged, with as much as 60% of snap bean crops lost. Damage was in the several millions range.

He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1962 to 1977. Before politics Johnston was born in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba and was educated there. He served with the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1941 to 1945 and was a prisoner of war in Germany from 1943 to 1945. After the war, Johnston worked as an underwriter for Manufacturer's Life Insurance Company, then from 1948 to 1952 at the Portage la Prairie Post Office and then operated his own grocery store. Political career He was an alderman in Portage la Prairie from 1959 to 1962. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the general election of 1962, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative John Christianson by 290 votes in Portage la Prairie. In the 1966 election, he was re-elected over Christianson by 735 votes. From 1966 to 1968, Johnston was executive director of the Liberal Party of Manitoba. The once-dominant Liberal Party was the official legislative opposition for most of the 1960s, and its support dropped even lower in the election of 1969. The party won only five seats, and Johnston was re-elected over Tory candidate Harvey Carmichael by only eleven votes. After the election, he offered to serve as Speaker of the legislature to allow Edward Schreyer's New Democratic Party to form a minority government. Liberal Party leader Robert Bend was defeated in the 1969 election, and Johnston was chosen to serve as house leader until a permanent replacement could be chosen. He endorsed John Nesbitt's unsuccessful bid for the party leadership in 1970. He was one of only two opposition members who voted to amalgamate the city of Winnipeg in 1971. Johnston increased his margin of victory to 36 votes in the election of 1973, over Tory George Fairfield. His party's fortunes continued to decline in this period, and he did not seek re-election in 1977.  Later life  From 1978 to 1984, he was a citizenship court judge for Manitoba and then, from 1984 to 1998, a marriage commissioner for the province. Johnston died in Winnipeg at the age of 85.

The Ebersberger Forst (forest) is one of Germany‚Äôs largest continuous area of woodlands. Neighbouring communities are Grafing bei M√ºnchen, Kirchseeon and Steinh√∂ring. Bavaria‚Äôs capital, Munich, lies 32 km away and may be reached by Munich S-Bahn (S4). Rosenheim and Wasserburg am Inn are about the same distance away. History Ebersberg‚Äôs history is closely tied with the nearby Benedictine monastery founded in 934 by the Counts of Sempt. Beginning in the 14th century the monastery exercised local jurisdiction. In 1595, Pope Clement VIII dissolved the monastery and turned its lands over to the Jesuits. On January 18, 1634, during the Thirty Years War, Ebersberg was the site of a skirmish between Habsburg troops and local peasants. The peasants, being poorly armed, were quickly defeated by the Imperial forces and around 200 were killed. Later, the ringleaders were exonerated by local authorities and found they were acting only in self-defense.Wilson, Peter. The Thirty Years War. Belknap Press, Harvard University, 2009. Cambridge, Massachusetts. pp. 533. In 1773, the Knights of Malta took over the building. When the monastery was dissolved for good in 1808, the building went partly to government ownership and partly private. In 1954, Ebersberg was raised to the status of a 'town'. In 1972 it was connected to Munich by the S-Bahn highway. The once separate municipality of Oberndorf was combined with Ebersberg. Ebersberg is the only German town that has named a street after a cabaret group (Valtortagasse, after the Gruppo di Valtorta from Ebersberg). Ebersberg‚Äôs main cultural institution, the Alte Kino Ebersberg (Old Cinema), is today run by a non-profit governing board whose roots lie in this same Deutscher Kleinkunstpreis-winning group.

He was the creator of the \\"Ten Worst Dressed Women List\\", an annual awards presentation he unveiled in January of each year. He published the \\"Fabulous Fashion Independents\\" list and an annual Academy Awards fashion review, both of which receive somewhat less media attention. His partner of sixty years, Beverly Hills hairdresser Robert L. Spencer, was also his manager. He wrote two books, Mr. Blackwell: 30 Years of Fashion Fiascos and an autobiography, From Rags to Bitches.Blackwell (1991)Blackwell (1995) Early life Blackwell was born Richard Sylvan Selzer in the Bensonhurst section of BrooklynFrom Rags to Bitches: An Autobiography; Stoddart to Henry Selzer, a working-class printer, and Eva Selzer, who were the American-born children of Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire. He had one older brother.US Census 1930, Brooklyn, Kings Co., New York, enumeration district 24-1648, supervisor's district 32, sheet 12 A He claimed he was severely beaten by a stepfather, often sleeping in the alley beneath a fire escape with a broken bottle for protection rather than face further abuse. He told Howard Stern that as a 7-year-old boy, he had once had to beg for a quarter on the street so he could buy something to eat. His father was frequently absent or drunk, and men would take him to a nearby alley and abuse him. He was scared, hungry, and did whatever he could to stay alive. He only went as far as the third grade in school. When he was 11, he was raped by an adult at a boys' camp. Career =Acting= Blackwell began acting in theaters in his teens, appearing in the original 1935 Broadway production of Sidney Kingsley's Dead End. Relocating to the West Coast (where he studied with Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney) he adopted the professional name \\"Dick Ellis\\" and played small parts in the movies. Between acting parts, he worked as a messenger at Warner Bros. Studio in Burbank, California. Howard Hughes then signed him to RKO and changed his name to Richard Blackwell. He returned to Broadway in 1944 for Catherine Was Great, which starred Mae West, but left acting to become a Hollywood agent. He discovered his talent for fashion design while making stage costumes for his clients.Peter Anthony Holder Interview =Fashion designer= The name \\"Mr. Blackwell\\" came in the late-1950s when he launched his clothing line. As with Valentino, Versace and later Richard Tyler, he and his line became synonymous. He was an important designer and during the 1960s he became the first in history to present his line on a television broadcast, and was the first to make his line available for plus-size women. His designer dresses sold for between $800 to $1,000 and were very successful. During the nearly two decade existence of the \\"House of Blackwell\\", he was designer to Yvonne De Carlo, Jayne Mansfield, Dorothy Lamour, Jane Russell and California first lady Nancy Reagan. At the height of his prominence, he openly declared his disdain for Women's Wear Daily and its publisher, John Fairchild. During the 1980s, the emerging drift toward casual wear brought an end to The House of Blackwell. =Fashion critic= In his beginning years as a designer he was asked to do a one-time article for The American Weekly magazine of the \\"10 Best and Worst Dressed\\" people and developed the franchise from it. Although best known for his \\"Worst Dressed\\" list, he maintained a successful career as a fashion journalist. He was syndicated in The Globe tabloid and wrote features in newspapers and lifestyle magazines. His \\"Fabulous Fashion Independents\\" often featured celebrities whom in prior years have been listed in his Ten Worst- Dressed.Angelina Jolie was on \\"Worst\\" in 2000 and on the \\"Independents in 2006 =Worst-dressed lists= The first \\"Ten Worst-Dressed Women\\" list premiered in 1960, to moderate media success, but as the House of Blackwell became more successful, the list took off. By its third year every television and radio network and virtually all news services worldwide began to cover it. Forty- seven years after first release, Blackwell annually spent a week after its publication on telephone interviews to fashion magazines, radio programs and news networks.From Rags to Bitches: An Autobiography The list is a conglomeration of techniques from first letter alliteration: Martha Stewart ‚Äì \\"dull, dowdy and devastatingly dreary\\" and consonant: \\"fabulous fashion independents\\", to free verse: Cher ‚Äì \\"A million beads/And one overexposed derriere\\", and pun: Queen Elizabeth, \\"Was she the palace Christmas tree, or just a royal clown?\\" About Wynonna Judd ‚Äì \\"She looks like Hulk Hogan in sequins.\\" Often, he simply quipped: Martha Stewart ‚Äì \\"Dresses like the centerfold for Farmers' Almanac\\", and other times combines forms: Dixie Chicks ‚Äì \\"They look like a trio of truck stop fashion tragedies/ trapped in a typhoon\\". The list's popularity has waned in some segments of contemporary culture, many feeling that it is mean-spirited. However, Blackwell has displayed personal missives from many celebrities including Dolly Parton, Mariah Carey and country singer Tanya Tucker expressing their thanks for being selected.Mr. Blackwell: 30 Years of Fashion Fiascos; Pharos, 1991 Other former list alumni like \\"Hollywood Beat\\" editor, Marci Weiner ‚Äì \\"Why does Marci Weiner always dress like she's auditioning for a Fellini movie?\\" ‚Äì who was initially angered by her inclusion, now considers it an honor. Still, despite its decline in universal acceptance, it was nonetheless published each year. The list spawned a parade of imitators. Not all are lists, but virtually all include jibes and jabs similar to those that Blackwell first used to capture media attention in the early 1960s. Harry Shearer's Le Show radio program has featured \\"Blackwell on Blackwell\\". Roger Stone, himself known for his taste in fashion, has taken up Blackwell's tradition of best and worst dressed lists (albeit with a greater emphasis on the best dressed) since Blackwell's death. =Television and radio= Mr. Blackwell was a pioneer in television fashion and had been a fixture in the medium throughout his career as a designer and critic. Most recently, he appeared as himself on an episode of the ABC daytime soap, Port Charles. He hosted a daily program on Los Angeles' talk radio powerhouse KABC from 1972‚Äì74, moving to KIEV 1975‚Äì1981. In 1968 he starred in his own KCOP two-hour color television special, Mr. Blackwell Presents, with Anna Maria Alberghetti, Nick Adams and Rose Marie. It was the first telecast in history in which a designer presented his line on television. He continued to be recognized as preeminent during his years in the field.Colorado State University Historic Costume & Textile Museum Also in 1968, Mr. Blackwell released a LP album of a show titled \\"The Mr. Blackwell Show\\" on the Rob Rich Records label that was presented on stage at The Desert Inn in Las Vegas in 1967, as well as The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in early 1967 as well. The album only saw limited distribution probably due to poor sales and as such is now a sought after collectors item today. The album features Mr. Blackwell reciting fashion commentary over a musical background. He often participated in audience critique segments on daytime talk and variety shows. He appeared on The Mike Douglas Show on numerous occasions, and on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, as a guest on the first broadcast after Carson moved the show from New York to Burbank. The May 2, 1972 edition also featured Rob Reiner, George Carlin and Johnny Mathis. He appeared on a total of four additional Tonight Shows between August 1970 and January 1973 and is included in the series Best Of The Tonight Show DVD sets. In 1992 he sued Carson for $11 million after the late night host joked that he had included Mother Teresa on one of his worst-dressed lists. The suit was quickly dismissed. =Honors= In 1997, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him. Personal life Mr. Blackwell at his home in Hancock Park in March 2008 Blackwell lived in the Hancock Park enclave of Los Angeles with his partner of 60 years, Robert Spencer. In 1964, they rented their home to The Beatles for the English band's first visit to the city. It was leaked to the media, however; and the group made other arrangements. He was also an artist known for his avant-garde, and he published several editions of his work, including his \\"Mother America\\" series.ArtzDirect/ebay.com Blackwell avant-garde series serigraphs and posters \\"Mother America\\" Captured April 12, 2007. In 2001, Blackwell was diagnosed with Bell's palsy, which causes limited to severe paralysis of facial muscles and can affect eyesight as well. If treated in time, it is completely curable; however, if not treated it can have life lasting effects. Blackwell was unable to unveil the 2000 list at a live news conference for the first time in its 40-year history and remained out of the public eye for six months. He came back for the 2001 \\"Worst Dressed\\" and returned to a full, normal social life. Blackwell died in Los Angeles on October 19, 2008, of complications from an intestinal infection.Richard Blackwell, Of Mr. Blackwell's Worst Dressed List, Dies At 86 In pop culture He was played by Harry Shearer on the May 20, 1995 episode of SCTV's, The Show Formerly Known as The Martin Short Show. In the television series Two and a Half Men, Charlie sarcastically calls Jake \\"Mr Blackwell\\" after Jake makes fun of Charlies shirt.

The album was self-financed and produced by Brown, and was his first album release since the break-up of The Stone Roses in October 1996. Ex-Roses members Mani, Nigel Ipinson, Aziz Ibrahim and Robbie Maddix helped pen and perform the instruments on many of the album's tracks. \\"Ice Cold Cube\\", which premiered at The Stone Roses final concert, was first released on this album. Background and recording Much of Unfinished Monkey Business focuses on the acrimonious split between Brown and former Roses' guitarist John Squire. Brown shares his unabashed opinion of his ex-bandmate on tracks including \\"Ice Cold Cube\\", \\"Can't See Me\\", \\"What Happened To Ya\\" and \\"Deep Pile Dreams\\", focusing in particular on Squire's supposed self- centredness, two-facedness and dependence on drugs, specifically cocaine. The track \\"Intro Under The Paving Stones: The Beach\\" was inspired by a slogan from the French May 1968 protests, an event that also inspired the song \\"Bye Bye Badman\\" from The Stone Roses. A popular protest slogan at the time, \\"Sous les pav√©s, la plage!\\" is translated into English as \\"Beneath the pavement, the beach!\\", and refers to the sand found under paving stones ripped up by rioters to use as projectiles aimed at the police. The words 'I only ever wanted the one with the flag but all you ever wanted was a sixty dollar bag and a cheap limousine for your deep pile dreams on the highway' also appear in Babyshambles' second album, Shotter's Nation. As a result, Brown has songwriting credits on the track \\"French Dog Blues\\". Recording began in Brown's home studio and was completed at Chiswick Reach Studios in London.\\"ExStone Roses vocalist produces 1st solo album\\", The Vindicator, 5 September 1998, p.

His wife Fanta Singhateh was the first Gambian woman to be First Lady. When the country became a republic in 1970, the office was abolished, and the Prime Minister, Dauda (later Sir Dawda) Kairaba Jawara became an executive President. Sir Farimang Singhateh was working as a dispenser/pharmacist in the Royal Victoria Hospital. He then moved on to have his own clinics in Soma and Farafeni before going into the private sector he spend time in Basse and Mansakonko serving those communities. While working in his FARAFENI Clinic is when he was appointed as the first black Governor-General by the Queen of the Gambia. Stories have been told that horses was his form of transportation in the early 1940s and 1950s as cars were not available at that time or era. He was an Ahmadi Muslim and ameer (president) of the Gambia's Ahmadiyya community.

Snow forts are generally built by children as a playground game or winter pastime and are used as defensive structures in snowball fights. They are also built and used for make-believe games such as \\"house\\", \\"store\\", or \\"community\\", a game where multiple forts are built in a group. Along with the snowman, it is one of the two structures commonly built by children out of snow. Snow structures made for sleeping are called igloos when made from snow blocks and quinzhees when made by hollowing out a pile of snow. Little snow fort built with a plastic tub (Moscow, Russia)  Variations  A snow fort in Washington, D.C., United States A snow fort consists of walls of piled and compacted snow. They may be \\"open\\" or \\"closed\\", that is, a person in the snow fort may be completely surrounded by the walls on all sides, there may be a \\"door\\", or the person may be completely exposed on one side. The latter variation is used for snowball fights, in which opponents have forts facing each other and attack exclusively from their own fort. Existing structures such as the walls or concave corners of a building can be used as part of the snow fort, allowing for faster and easier construction. A snow fort can also be a tunneled-out burrow built in a large snowdrift. Although the most common way to pack snow for a fort is by piling, pressing, and/or carving out snow by hand, possibly with the aid of a snow shovel, other ways exist. One way is to roll out large balls of snow as if making a snowman, line them up in a protective barrier, and use loose snow as mortar to hold them together. Another way is to create cylindrical snow blocks by shovelling snow into a five-gallon bucket and then compacting it. If made out of wet snow and left to freeze overnight, these blocks become almost indestructible. They can be difficult to stack into a stable defensive structure, but they can double as unwieldy yet powerful missiles capable of punching holes in enemy snow forts, knocking over a grown man, etc. Snow forts are usually at least knee-height and one-roomed. Forts built for snowball fights may be higher, and ones built for \\"house\\" may have lower walls and multiple rooms. When used for snowball fights, snow forts often have sections where the wall is lower, through which the occupants throw snowballs. =Finland= The SnowCastle of Kemi is claimed to be the biggest snow castle in the world, first built in Kemi in 1996. Since then the world's largest snow castle has been rebuilt annually. The area has varied from 13,000 to over 20,000 square meters. Its highest towers have been over 20 meters high and its longest walls over 1,000 meters long. Sometimes there have been three-story buildings there. The SnowRestaurant has ice tables and seats covered with reindeer fur. The ecumenical SnowChapel, decorated with ice sculptures, has seen numerous weddings, with some couples coming from Japan and Hong Kong. There is also a SnowHotel in the snow castle. The hotel has double rooms and a honeymoon suite with ice decorations. There are also ice decorations in Lainio Snow Hotel (near Yll√§s and Levi, Finland). =Canada= The Snowking Winter Festival castle under construction In Kingston, Ontario, the annual FebFest snow sculpture competition in Confederation Park features snow forts by the Royal Military College of Canada and Queen's University. The snow forts must not only be pleasing to look at but also safe for children to play on. In 2008, the RMC's snow fort was modelled after Ottawa's Mackenzie Building, featuring a central tower with working clock, flanked by projecting end towers and a slide. Both teams worked through the night, filling rectangular recycling bins with snow. The Snowking Winter Festival is an annual festival held each March in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. The festival is a major winter tourist draw to Yellowknife. It features a huge snow castle with window panes of ice built on Yellowknife Bay, on Great Slave Lake. The castle is designed and the construction is supervised by Snowking, Anthony Foliot. The design evolves every year and the castle has grown to include an auditorium, cafe, courtyard, traditional igloo, slide, parapets and turrets. Once the castle is completed, it becomes the center of winter arts activity in Yellowknife. This month-long festival includes concerts, art shows, children's theatre, and fireworks shows. Carvers augment the castle with snow and ice sculptures.  Deaths and injuries  There have been numerous deaths and injuries to people relating to the collapse of a snow fort. A 12 year old girl died in 2019 whilst building a snow fort in Chicago. A 10 year old boy died in 2016 when a snow fort collapsed on him. In 2017, 3 people were trapped by a collapsed snow fort and were saved by a dog. In popular culture The Backyardigans episode \\"The Snow Fort\\" has the Royal Canadian Mounted Police defending an elaborate version of such a fort while members of the ski patrol try to get in. The Dog Who Stopped the War (1984) is a cult movie and box-office hit in Quebec. Half of this movie revolves around a very elaborate snow fort.

The operation was a continuation of the previous year's Operation Barbarossa, intended to knock the Soviet Union out of the war. It involved a two-pronged attack: one from the Axis right flank against the oil fields of Baku, known as Operation Edelweiss, and one from the left flank in the direction of Stalingrad along the Volga River, known as Operation Fischreiher.Antill (2007), p. 40. Army Group South (Heeresgruppe S√ºd) of the German Army was divided into Army Groups A and B (Heeresgruppe A and B). Army Group A was tasked with crossing the Caucasus mountains to reach the Baku oil fields, while Army Group B protected its flanks along the Volga. Supported by 2,035 Luftwaffe aircraft and 1,934 tanks and assault guns, the 1,370,287-man Army Group South attacked on 28 June, advancing 48 kilometers on the first day and easily brushing aside the 1,715,000 Red Army troops opposite, who falsely expected a German offensive on Moscow even after Blau commenced. The Soviet collapse in the south allowed the Germans to capture the western part of Voronezh on 6 July and reach and cross the Don river near Stalingrad on 26 July. Army Group B's approach toward Stalingrad slowed in late July and early August owing to constant counterattacks by newly deployed Red Army reserves and overstretched German supply lines. The Germans defeated the Soviets in the Battle of Kalach and the combat shifted to the city itself in late August. Nonstop Luftwaffe airstrikes, artillery fire and street-to-street combat completely destroyed the city and inflicted heavy casualties on the opposing forces. After three months of battle, the Germans controlled 90% of Stalingrad on 19 November. In the south, Army Group A captured Rostov on 23 July and swept south from the Don to the Caucasus, capturing the demolished oilfields at Maikop on 9 August and Elista on 13 August near the Caspian Sea coast. Heavy Soviet resistance, Polish sabotage operations in occupied Poland, and the long distances from Axis sources of supply reduced the Axis offensive to local advances only and prevented the Germans from completing their strategic objective of capturing the main Caucasus oilfield at Baku. Luftwaffe bombers destroyed the oilfields at Grozny but attacks on Baku were prevented by the insufficient range of the German fighters. The Allies were concerned about the possibility of German forces continuing to the south and east and linking up with Japanese forces (then advancing in Burma) in India. However, the Red Army defeated the Germans at Stalingrad, following Operations Uranus and Little Saturn. This defeat forced the Axis to retreat from the Caucasus. Only the Kuban region remained tentatively occupied by Axis troops. Axis strategy =Background= On 22 June 1941 the Wehrmacht had launched Operation Barbarossa with the intention of defeating the Soviets in a Blitzkrieg lasting only months. The Axis offensive had met with initial success and the Red Army had suffered some major defeats before halting the Axis units just short of Moscow (November/December 1941). Although the Germans had captured vast areas of land and important industrial centers, the Soviet Union remained in the war. In the winter of 1941‚Äì42 the Soviets struck back in a series of successful counteroffensives, pushing back the German threat to Moscow. Despite these setbacks, Hitler wanted an offensive solution, for which he required the oil resources of the Caucasus.Antill (2007), pp. 7‚Äì12. By February 1942 the German Army High Command (OKH) had begun to develop plans for a follow-up campaign to the aborted Barbarossa offensive ‚Äì with the Caucasus as its principal objective. On 5 April 1942, Hitler laid out the elements of the plan now known as \\"Case Blue\\" (Fall Blau) in F√ºhrer Directive No. 41. The directive stated the main goals of the 1942 summer campaign on Germany's Eastern Front: holding attacks for Army Group (AG) Centre, the capture of Leningrad and the link-up with Finland for AG North, and the capture of the Caucasus region for Army Group South. The main focus was to be the capture of the Caucasus region.Glantz (1995), pp. 108‚Äì110. =The oilfields= The Caucasus, a large, culturally diverse region traversed by its eponymous mountains, is bounded by the Black Sea to the west and the Caspian Sea to the east. The region north of the mountains was a production center for grain, cotton and heavy farm machinery, while its two main oilfields, at Maykop, near the Black Sea, and Grozny, about halfway between the Black and the Caspian Seas, produced about 10 percent of all Soviet oil. South of the mountains lay Transcaucasia, comprising Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia. This heavily industrialized and densely populated area contained some of the largest oilfields in the world. Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, was one of the richest, producing 80 percent of the Soviet Union's oil‚Äîabout 24 million tons in 1942 alone.Hayward (2001), p. 2. The Caucasus also possessed plentiful coal and peat, as well as nonferrous and rare metals. Manganese deposits at Chiaturi, in Transcaucasia, formed the richest single source in the world, yielding 1.5 million tons of manganese ore annually, half of the Soviet Union's total production. The Kuban region of the Caucasus also produced large amounts of wheat, corn, sunflower seeds, and sugar beets, all essential in the production of food. These resources were of immense importance to Hitler and the German war effort. Of the three million tons of oil Germany consumed per year, 85 percent was imported, mainly from the United States, Venezuela, and Iran. When war broke out in September 1939, the British naval blockade cut Germany off from the Americas and the Middle East, leaving the country reliant on oil-rich European countries such as Romania to supply the resource. An indication of German reliance on Romania is evident from its oil consumption; in 1938, just one- third of the 7,500,000 tons consumed by Germany came from domestic stocks. Oil had always been Germany's Achilles heel, and by the end of 1941, Hitler had nearly exhausted Germany's reserves, which left him with only two significant sources of oil, the country's own synthetic production and the Romanian oilfields, with the latter supplying 75% of Germany's oil imports in 1941.Axworthy (1995), p. 19. Aware of his declining oil resources, and fearful of enemy air attacks on Romania (Germany's main source of crude oil), Hitler's strategy was increasingly driven by the need to protect Romania and acquire new resources, essential if he wanted to continue waging a prolonged war against a growing list of enemies. In late 1941, the Romanians warned Hitler that their stocks were exhausted and they were unable to meet German demands. For these reasons, the Soviet oilfields were extremely important to Germany's industry and armed forces as the war became global, the power of the Allies grew, and shortages started to occur in Axis resources.Hayward (2001), pp. xvii, 2‚Äì5, 18.Bellamy 2007, p. 497. Planning =Axis forces= Waffen-SS infantry and armour advancing, Summer 1942 The offensive was to be conducted across the southern Russian (Kuban) steppe utilizing the following Army Group units:Glantz (1995), pp. 111‚Äì113. * Army Group A, under Wilhelm List (Caucasus campaign) ** First Panzer Army ** Seventeenth Army ** Third Romanian Army ** Eleventh Army * Army Group B, under Maximilian von Weichs (Volga campaign) ** Second Army ** Fourth Panzer Army ** Sixth Army ** Second Hungarian Army ** Fourth Romanian Army ** Eighth Italian Army * Luftflotte 4, under Alexander L√∂hr ** 8th Air Corps ** 4th Air Corps German air strength in the east numbered 2,644 aircraft on 20 June 1942, over 20% more than a month earlier. Whereas in 1941 most units fought on the central front supporting Army Group Centre, 1,610 aircraft (61%), supported Army Group South. Initially commanded by L√∂hr, on 20 July 1942, Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen took command of Luftflotte 4.Hayward (2001), p. 129. The German plan involved a three-staged attack:Glantz (1995), p. 110.Hayward (2001), p. 131. * Blau I: Fourth Panzer Army, commanded by Hermann Hoth (transferred from Army Group Centre) and the Second Army, supported by the Second Hungarian Army, would attack from Kursk to Voronezh and continue the advance, anchoring the northern flank of the offensive towards the Volga. * Blau II: Sixth Army, commanded by Friedrich Paulus, would attack from Kharkov and move in parallel with Fourth Panzer Army, to reach the Volga at Stalingrad (whose capture was not deemed necessary). * Blau III: First Panzer Army would then strike south towards the lower Don River, with Seventeenth Army on the western flank and Fourth Romanian Army on the eastern flank. The strategic objectives of the operation were the oilfields at Maykop, Grozny and Baku. As in Barbarossa, these movements were expected to result in a series of grand encirclements of Soviet troops.Antill (2007), pp. 31‚Äì32. =Soviet forces= The Soviet army command (Stavka) failed to discern the direction of the main German strategic offensive anticipated in 1942, even though they were in possession of the German plans. On 19 June, the chief of operations of the 23rd Panzer Division, Major Joachim Reichel, was shot down over Soviet-held territory while flying an observation aircraft over the front near Kharkov. The Soviets recovered maps from his aircraft detailing the exact German plans for Case Blue. The plans were handed over to Stavka, in Moscow. Joseph Stalin, however, believed it to be a German ruse,Bellamy (2007), p. 498. remaining convinced that the primary German strategic goal in 1942 would be Moscow, in part due to Operation Kremlin (Fall Kreml), a German deception plan aimed at the city. As a result, the majority of Red Army troops were deployed there, although the direction from which the Case Blue offensive would come was still defended by the Bryansk, Southwestern, Southern and North Caucasian Fronts. With about 1 million soldiers at the front line and another 1.7 million in reserve armies, their forces accounted for about one quarter of all Soviet troops.Antill (2007), p. 29.Glantz (1995), p. 301. Following the disastrous start of Case Blue for the Soviets, they reorganised their frontlines several times. Over the course of the campaign, the Soviets also fielded the Voronezh Front, Don Front, Stalingrad Front, Transcaucasian Front, and the Caucasian Front, though not all existed at the same time. With the German thrust expected in the north, Stavka planned several local offensives in the south to weaken the Germans. The most important of these was aimed at the city of Kharkov and would be conducted mainly by the Southwestern Front under Semyon Timoshenko, supported by the Southern Front commanded by Rodion Malinovsky. The operation was scheduled for 12 May, just prior to a planned German offensive in the area.Antill (2007), p. 34. The ensuing Second Battle of Kharkov ended in disaster for the Soviets, severely weakening their mobile forces.Antill (2007), p. 37. At the same time, the Axis clearing of the Kerch Peninsula together with the Battle of Sevastopol, which lasted until July, weakened the Soviets further and allowed the Germans to supply Army Group A across the Kerch Peninsula through the Kuban.Antill (2007), p. 49. The offensive =Opening phase= thumb300pxThe German advance from 7 May to 18 November 1942. The German offensive commenced on 28 June 1942, with Fourth Panzer Army starting its drive towards Voronezh. Due to a chaotic Soviet retreat, the Germans were able to advance rapidly, restoring Wehrmacht confidence for the upcoming major offensive.Beevor (1999), p. 75. Close air support from the Luftwaffe also played an important role in this early success. It contained the Red Air Force, through air superiority operations, and provided interdiction through attacks on airfields and Soviet defence lines. At times, the German air arm acted as a spearhead rather than a support force, ranging on ahead of the tanks and infantry to disrupt and destroy defensive positions. As many as 100 German aircraft were concentrated on a single Soviet division in the path of the spearhead during this phase. General Kazakov, the Bryansk Front's chief of staff, noted the strength and effectiveness of the Axis aviation.Hayward (2001), p. 135. Within 26 days, the Soviets lost 783 aircraft from the 2nd, 4th, 5th and 8th Air Armies, compared to a German total of 175.Bergstr√∂m 2007, pp. 60, list of Red Air Force order of battle indicates these units were mainly in combat during Blau, pp. 49‚Äì50. By 5 July, forward elements of Fourth Panzer Army had reached the Don River near Voronezh and became embroiled in the battle to capture the city. Stalin and the Soviet command still expected the main German thrust in the north against Moscow, and believed the Germans would turn north after Voronezh to threaten the capital. As a result, the Soviets rushed reinforcements into the town to hold it at all costs and counterattacked the Germans' northern flank in an effort to cut off the German spearheads. 5th Tank Army, commanded by Major General A.I. Liziukov, managed to achieve some minor successes when it began its attack on 6 July, but was forced back to its starting positions by 15 July, losing about half of its tanks in the process.Glantz (2009), pp. 149‚Äì53. Although the battle was a success, Hitler and von Bock, commander of Army Group South, argued over the next steps in the operation. The heated debate, and continuing Soviet counterattacks, which tied down Fourth Panzer Army until 13 July, caused Hitler to lose his temper and dismiss von Bock. As part of the second phase of the operation, on 9 July, Army Group South was split into Army Group A and Army Group B, with Wilhelm List appointed as commander of Army Group A in place of von Bock. Only two weeks into the operation, on 11 July, the Germans began to suffer logistical difficulties, which slowed the advance. The German Sixth Army was continually delayed by fuel shortages. Eight days later, on 20 July, shortages of fuel were still undermining operations, leaving many units unable to execute their orders. The 23rd Panzer Division and 24th Panzer Division both became stranded during the opening phase. Once again, as it had done during the Norwegian Campaign in April 1940, and Barbarossa in 1941, the Luftwaffe's Junkers Ju 52 transport fleet flew in supplies to keep the army going. The situation remained difficult with German troops forced to recover fuel from damaged or abandoned vehicles, and in some cases, leave behind tanks and vehicles with heavy fuel consumption to continue their advance. This undermined the strength of the units, which were forced to leave fighting vehicles behind. Nevertheless, the Luftwaffe flew in 200 tons of fuel per day to keep the army supplied.Hayward (2001), p. 142. Despite this impressive performance in keeping the army mobile, L√∂hr was replaced by the more impetuous and offensive-minded von Richthofen.Hayward (2001), p. 143. =Splitting of Army Group South= Believing that the main Soviet threat had been eliminated, desperately short of oil and needing to meet all the ambitious objectives of Case Blue, Hitler made a series of changes to the plan in F√ºhrer Directive No. 45 on July 23, 1942: * reorganized Army Group South into two smaller Army Groups, A and B; * directed Army Group A to advance to the Caucasus and capture the oil fields (Operation Edelwei√ü); * directed Army Group B to attack towards the Volga and Stalingrad (Operation Fischreiher). There is no evidence Hitler was opposed by, or received complaints from Franz Halder, Chief of the General Staff, or anyone else, about the directive until August 1942. The new directive created enormous logistical difficulties, with Hitler expecting both Army Groups to advance along different routes. Logistics lines were already at breaking point with ammunition and fuel shortages most apparent and it would be impossible to advance using the conservative supply rates he demanded. The divergence of the Army Groups would also open a dangerous gap between the Armies, which could be exploited by the Soviets. The Italian Alpine Corps, of the Italian Army in the Soviet Union, did not arrive in the Caucasus Mountains with Army Group A, instead remaining with Sixth Army. Army Group A was expected to operate in mountain terrain with only three mountain divisions and two infantry divisions unsuited to the task.Hayward (2001), pp. 147, 149. The splitting of Army Group South enabled the launching of Operation Edelweiss and Operation Fischreiher, the two main thrusts of the Army Groups. Both groups had to achieve their objectives simultaneously, instead of consecutively. The success of the initial advance was such that Hitler ordered the Fourth Panzer Army south to assist the First Panzer Army to cross the lower Don river.Glantz (1995), p. 119. This assistance was not needed and Kleist later complained that Fourth Panzer Army clogged the roads and that if they had carried on toward Stalingrad, they could have taken it in July. When it turned north again two weeks later, the Soviets had gathered enough forces together at Stalingrad to check its advance. =Army Group A: Caucasus= Breaking into the Caucasus German troops and a Sd.Kfz. 251 armored half-track on the Russian steppe, August 1942 With air support from the Ju 87s of Sturzkampfgeschwader 77, List's Army Group A recaptured Rostov, the \\"gate to the Caucasus\\", on 23 July 1942 relatively easily.Hayward (2001), p. 145. The Luftwaffe had air superiority in the early phase of the operation, which was of great help to the ground forces.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 67. With the Don crossing secured and Sixth Army's advance flagging on the Volga front, Hitler transferred the Fourth Panzer Army to Army Group B and sent it back to the Volga.Antill (2007), p. 41. The redeployment used enormous amounts of fuel to transfer the army by air and road.Hayward (2001), p. 156. After crossing the Don on 25 July, Army Group A fanned out on a front from the Sea of Azov to Zymlianskaya (today Zymlyansk).Hayward (2001), p. 152. The German Seventeenth Army, along with elements of the Eleventh Army and the Romanian Third Army, manoeuvred west towards the east coast of the Black Sea, while the First Panzer Army attacked to the south-east. The Seventeenth Army made a slow advance but the First Panzer Army had freedom of action. On 29 July the Germans cut the last direct railway between central Russia and the Caucasus, causing considerable panic to Stalin and Stavka, which led to the passing of Order No. 227 \\"Not a step back!\\".Glantz (1995), p. 121. Salsk was captured on 31 July and Stavropol on 5 August. Although the army group made a quick advance, by 3 August the vanguard comprised only light mobile forces and most of the tanks lagged behind, due to lack of fuel and supply breakdowns, despite the efforts of 4th Air Corps, which flew in supplies around the clock. On 9 August, the First Panzer Army reached Maikop in the foothills of the Caucasus mountains, having advanced more than in fewer than two weeks. The western oil fields near Maikop were seized in a commando operation from 8‚Äì9 August, but the oil fields had been sufficiently destroyed by the Red Army to take about a year to be repaired. Shortly afterwards Pyatigorsk was taken. On 12 August, Krasnodar was captured and German mountain troops hoisted the Nazi flag on the highest mountain of the Caucasus, Mount Elbrus.Antill (2007), p. 39. The length of the German advance created chronic supply difficulties, particularly of petrol; the Black Sea was judged too dangerous and fuel was brought by rail through Rostov or delivered by air, but panzer divisions were sometimes at a standstill for weeks. Even petrol trucks ran out of fuel and oil had to be brought up on camels. With the Soviets often retreating instead of fighting, the number of prisoners fell short of expectations and only 83,000 were taken.Hayward (2001), p. 147. As Hitler and OKH began to concentrate on Stalingrad, some of Kleist's mobile forces were diverted. Kleist lost his flak corps and most of the Luftwaffe supporting the southern front, only reconnaissance aircraft being left behind. The Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily (VVS) brought in about 800 bombers, a third of which were operational. With the transfer of air cover and flak units, Soviet bombers were free to harass the German advance. The quality of the Soviet resistance increased, with many of the forces used coming from local levies, who Kleist thought were willing to fight harder for their homeland. German units were especially bogged down by fighting Georgian alpine and mountain troops, who greatly contributed to stalling their advance. The quantity of replacements and supplies the Soviets committed increased, and faced with these difficulties, the Axis advance slowed after 28 August.Glantz (1995), p. 120.Glantz (1995), p. 122. Battle for the oilfields German Gebirgsj√§ger in the Caucasus In the south-east, the Wehrmacht headed in the direction of Grozny and Baku, the other important petroleum centres. More installations and industrial centres fell into German hands, many intact or only slightly damaged during the Russian retreat. From August‚ÄìSeptember, the Taman Peninsula and a part of the Novorossiysk naval base were captured.Antill (2007), pp. 13‚Äì14. The Germans continued towards Tuapse on the Black Sea coast and in the east Elista was taken on 13 August.Schramm (1963), p. 583. In the south, the German advance was stopped north of Grozny, after taking Mozdok on 25 August.Schramm (1963), p. 639. German paratroopers assisted an insurgency in Chechnya, operating behind Soviet lines. German mountain troops failed to secure the Black Sea ports and the advance fell short of Grozny as supply difficulties arose once more. The Soviets dug in the 9th and 44th armies of the North Transcaucasian Front along the rocky Terek River bank in front (north) of the city. The Luftwaffe was unable to support the German army that far forward and Soviet aviation attacked bridges and supply routes virtually unopposed. The Germans crossed the river on 2 September but made only slow progress.Hayward (2001), p. 167. At the beginning of September, Hitler had a major argument with the High Command and specifically List, as he perceived the advance of the German forces as too slow. As a result, Hitler dismissed List on 9 September and took direct command of Army Group A himself. Axis ships transported 30,605 men, 13,254 horses and 6,265 motor vehicles across the Black Sea from Romania, from 1‚Äì2 September. With the reinforcements, the Germans captured most of the Black Sea naval bases but were held up at Novorossiysk, where the Soviet 47th Army had prepared for a long siege.Hayward (2001), p. 169. The port fell on 10 September, after a four-day battle, the final German victory in the Caucasus. It left the heights south of the port and several coast roads in the hands of 47th Soviet Army. Attempts to push out of Novorossiysk were costly failures and the Axis also failed to break the defences on the coastal plain from Novorossiysk to Tuapse, having only the strength to stabilise the line. Romanian Army losses were particularly high and the Romanian 3rd Mountain Division was nearly wiped out by a Soviet counter-attack from 25‚Äì26 September.Hayward (2001), p. 170. Further east, the Axis enjoyed greater success and on 1 September, the Germans took Khulkhuta (–•—É–ª—Ö—É—Ç–∞ÃÅ), halfway between Elista and Astrakhan.Schramm (1963), p. 667. During August and September, German patrols raided the railway between Kizlyar, north-east of Grozny, marking the farthest advance of the German forces towards the Caspian Sea.Schramm (1963), pp. 639, 671. In the south, the First Panzer Army advance on Grozny was stopped by the Red Army and the 14th Air Army. By late September, supply failures and the resistance of the Red Army slowed the Axis advance.Hayward (2001), p. 171. German Gebirgsj√§ger operating a 2 cm anti- aircraft gun in the Central Caucasus near Teberda, September 1942 On 2 November 1942, Romanian mountain troops (V√¢nƒÉtori de munte) under the command of Brigadier General Ioan Dumitrache took Nalchik, the capital of Kabardino- Balkaria and also the farthest point of Axis advance into the Caucasus. This victory earned the Romanian General the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.Spencer C. Tucker, World War II: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection (5 volumes), ABC-CLIO, 2016, p. 1422 Up to 10,000 prisoners were captured in two days, before the advance toward Grozny was stopped again west of the city at Vladikavkaz.Schramm (1963), p. 65. and Hayward (2001), p. 174. On 5 November, Alagir was seized and the Alagir‚ÄìBeslan‚ÄìMalgobek line reached became the farthest German advance in the south.Schramm (1963), pp. 719‚Äì723. By this time, the gap between Army Groups A and B had left them vulnerable to a counter-offensive. Only the German 16th Motorized Infantry Division remained inside the gap, guarding the left flank of the First Panzer Army by securing the road towards Astrakhan.Hayward (2001), p. 172. On 22 November, after several Soviet counter-attacks, Hitler appointed Kleist as Group commander with orders to hold his position and prepare to resume the offensive if Stalingrad could be taken. Luftwaffe oil offensive In the first week of October 1942, Hitler came to recognise that the capture of the Caucasus oil fields was unlikely before winter forced the Germans to take up defensive positions. Unable to capture them, he was determined to deny them to the enemy and ordered the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL) to inflict as much damage as possible.Hayward (2001), p. 179. On 8 October, Hitler called for the air offensive to be carried out no later than 14 October, as he required air assets for a major effort at Stalingrad.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 84. As a result, on 10 October 1942, Fliegerkorps 4 of Luftflotte 4 (4th Air Corps of Fourth Air Fleet) was ordered to send every available bomber against the oilfields at Grozny. Fourth Air Fleet was in poor shape by this time ‚Äì von Richthofen had begun Case Blue with 323 serviceable bombers out of a total of 480. He was now down to 232, of which only 129 were combat ready. Nevertheless, the force could still deliver damaging blows. Attacks on the refineries reminded von Richthofen of the attacks on Sevastopol several months earlier. Thick black smoke rose from the refineries to a height of . On 12 October, further raids caused even more destruction. It had been a strategic mistake not to have made greater efforts to hit the oil refineries at Grozny and Baku sooner, as their destruction would have been a greater blow to the Soviets than the loss of Stalingrad, where most of the air fleet was deployed. On 19 November, the Soviet counter- offensive at Stalingrad compelled von Richthofen to once more withdraw his units north to the Volga and bring an end to the aerial offensive.Hayward (2001), pp. 179‚Äì180. Much damage was done at Grozny, but the remaining oilfields were beyond the logistical reach of the German Army as well as of the fighter aircraft of the Luftwaffe. Grozny was within range of German bombers from 4th Air Corps, based near the Terek River. But Grozny and the captured oilfields at Maykop produced only ten per cent of Soviet oil. The main fields at Baku were out of German fighter range. German bombers could have reached them, but it meant flying the most direct, thus most predictable route without protection. In August it may have been possible to carry out these operations owing to the weakness of Soviet air power in the region, but by October it had been considerably strengthened.Hayward 1995, pp. 94‚Äì135. =Army Group B: Volga= Don bend Advance towards Stalingrad at the Don On 23 July, the main body of Army Group B started its advance toward the Don. The Germans met with increasing Soviet resistance from the new Stalingrad Front, with the 62nd and 64th Soviet Armies. On 26 July, XIV Panzer Corps broke through and reached the Don, where the new First and Fourth Tank Armies conducted several futile counter-attacks by inexperienced troops. In the south, Fourth Panzer Army made better progress against 51st Army. After crossing the Don, the Germans advanced on Kotelnikovo, reaching the town by 2 August. Soviet resistance convinced Paulus that Sixth Army was not strong enough to cross the Don by itself, so he waited for Fourth Panzer Army to fight its way north.Antill (2007), pp. 44‚Äì45. On 4 August, the Germans were still from Stalingrad.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 62. By 10 August, the Red Army had been cleared from most of the west bank of the Don, but Soviet resistance continued in some areas, further delaying Army Group B. The Wehrmacht advance on Stalingrad was also impeded by supply shortages caused by the poor state of Soviet roads. The Luftwaffe sent an ad-hoc force of 300 Ju 52 transport aircraft, enabling the Germans to advance; some bombers were diverted from operations to supply flights under the Stalingrad Transport Region force. The Soviet defence at the Don forced the Germans to commit more and more troops to an increasingly vulnerable front, leaving few reserves to back up the Axis divisions on either flank.Antill p. 49. The Soviets made several counter- attacks on the northern flank of Army Group B, between Stalingrad and Voronezh. From 20‚Äì28 August, the 63rd Army and the 21st Army counter-attacked near Serafimovich, forcing the Italian Eighth Army to fall back. The 1st Guards Army attacked near Novo-Grigoryevskaja, extending its bridgehead. These and several other bridgeheads across the Don, opposed by the Eighth Italian and Second Hungarian armies, were a constant danger. Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber over Stalingrad On 23 August, Sixth Army crossed the Don and Army Group B established a defensive line on one of its bends. Sixth Army reached the northern suburbs of Stalingrad later that day, beginning the Battle of Stalingrad. The Hungarian, Italian and Romanian armies were from Stalingrad, which was in range of forward air bases. Luftflotte 4 attacked the city, turning much of it to rubble.Beevor (1999), p. 106. The Soviets reported that civilian casualties from 23‚Äì26 August were 955 dead and 1,181 wounded (a preliminary total; later reports of casualties in the tens of thousands were probably exaggerations).Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 73. Sixth Army advanced from the north via Kalach and Fourth Panzer Army came up from the south through Kotelnikovo. In the first few days, the XIV Panzer Corps opened a corridor between the main body of Sixth Army and the northern Stalingrad suburbs at the Volga. In the south, Soviet resistance repulsed the Fourth Panzer Army. On 29 August another attempt was made with Hoth turning his forces west directly through the center of 64th Army. The attack was unexpectedly successful and Fourth Panzer Army got behind 62nd and 64th Armies with the chance to encircle and cut off 62nd Army. Von Weichs ordered Sixth Army to complete the encirclement; a Soviet counter-attack held up the advance for three days and the Soviets escaped and retreated towards Stalingrad.Antill (2007), pp. 45‚Äì51. The rapid German advance caused a slump in morale among the Soviet troops, who retreated in chaos, abandoning the outer defences of the city.Beevor (1999), pp. 115‚Äì118. After defeating the last Soviet counter-attacks, Sixth Army resumed its offensive on 2 September, linking up with Fourth Panzer Army the following day. On 12 September, the Germans entered Stalingrad.Antill (2007), p. 55. Battle of Stalingrad Street fighting in the destroyed city The advance into Stalingrad against the 62nd Army was carried out by Sixth Army, while Fourth Panzer Army secured the southern flank. The city was a ribbon along the west bank of the Volga, which forced the Germans to conduct a frontal assault, and the ruins of the city gave the defenders an advantage. To counter Luftwaffe air superiority, the commander of the 62nd Army, General Vasily Chuikov, ordered his troops to \\"hug\\" the Germans, negating German tactical mobility. The Luftwaffe suppressed Soviet artillery on the east bank of the Volga and caused many casualties during Soviet attempts to reinforce the defenders on the west bank. From mid-September until early November the Germans made three big attacks on the city and ground forward in mutually- costly fighting. By mid-November, the Soviets were penned into four shallow bridgeheads, with the front line only from the river. Anticipating victory, substantial numbers of Luftwaffe aircraft were withdrawn to the Mediterranean in early November to support the Axis operations in Tunisia. Sixth Army had captured about 90 percent of the city.Antill (2007), pp. 51‚Äì67.Glantz (1995), pp. 122‚Äì123, 149. On 19 November, the Soviets launched Operation Uranus, a two-pronged counter-offensive against the flanks of Sixth Army. With the battle for the city and the exhaustion of Fourth Panzer Army, the flanks were mainly guarded by Romanian, Hungarian and Italian soldiers. Third Romanian Army, on the Don River west of Stalingrad, and Fourth Romanian Army, south- east of Stalingrad, had been under constant Soviet attack since September. Third Romanian Army had been transferred from Caucasus on 10 September to take over Italian positions on the Don, opposite the Soviet bridgeheads. The Romanians were understrength and had only around six modern anti-tank guns per division. The bulk of the German tank reserve, the 48th Panzer Corps, consisted of about 180 tanks, half being obsolete Panzer 35(t)s.Axworthy (1995), pp. 85‚Äì89. The two Romanian armies were routed and Sixth Army with parts of Fourth Panzer Army were encircled in Stalingrad.Antill (2007), pp. 73‚Äì75. Hitler ordered Sixth Army to remain on the defensive, rather than try to break out. It was intended the army would be supplied by air, but the quantity of supplies necessary was far beyond the ability of the Luftwaffe to carry. Sixth Army's strength diminished and the Soviets gained the upper hand inside the city.Glantz (1995), p. 134. To stabilise the situation on the Eastern Front, Army Group Don (Heeresgruppe Don) under Field Marshal Erich von Manstein was created to fill the gap between Army Groups A and B.Nipe (2000), p. 15. On 12 December, a relief operation called Operation Winter Storm was launched from the South by fresh reinforcements of the 4th Panzer Army. The offensive surprised the Soviets and the Germans were able to penetrate the Soviet line for towards Stalingrad. Despite these gains, the Sixth Army was not allowed to attempt to break out and link up, so this led to nothing.Glantz (1995), pp. 140‚Äì141. The failure was followed by a siege that lasted for almost two months, during which Sixth Army was destroyed.Antill (2007), p. 78. Aftermath =Operation Saturn= Soviet forces during Operation Little Saturn Following the success of Operation Uranus, the Red Army began Operation Saturn to cut off Army Group A and all troops east of Rostov.Nipe (2000), pp. 18‚Äì21. During the German relief operation at Stalingrad, Soviet forces had been redeployed, lesser objectives substituted, and the operation renamed \\"Little Saturn\\". The attack fell on Eighth Italian Army and the remnants of Third Romanian Army, and led to the destruction of most of Eighth Army. On the verge of collapse, Army Groups B and Don were able to prevent a Soviet breakthrough but Army Group A was ordered to withdraw from the Caucasus on 28 December.Schramm (1963), p. 1318.Nipe (2000), p. 33. The Soviets launched several follow-up offensives, later called the Voronezh-Kharkov Strategic Offensive. The Ostrogozhsk‚ÄìRossosh Offensive began on 12 January and destroyed large parts of the Second Hungarian Army and the remnants of Eighth Italian Army at the Don south-east of Voronezh. With the southern flank in danger, Second German Army was forced to withdraw from Voronezh and the Don. The operations continued until January and led Stavka to believe that they could deal a fatal blow to the Germans and decide the war in southern Russia. Operation Star, conducted by the Voronezh Front, was aimed at Kharkov, Kursk and Belgorod. Operation Gallop was conducted by the South-western Front against Voroshilovgrad, Donetsk and then towards the Sea of Azov, to cut off the German forces east of Donetsk. The operations began simultaneously at the end of January. The Soviets broke through quickly and in the north, Kursk fell on 18 February and Kharkov on 16 February after a German withdrawal, while in the south the Germans were pushed back to a line west of Voroshilovgrad. Army Groups Don, B and parts of Army Group A were renamed Army Group South, commanded by Manstein, on 12 February. The Kharkov and Donbas operations were started on 25 February by the new Central Front led by Rokossovsky, with the forces freed after the surrender of the Germans in Stalingrad on 2 February. The operations were aimed at Army Group Centre in the north and timed to coincide with the expected successes of the Soviet operations in the south. Army Group South escaped encirclement and prepared a counter-offensive, which led to the Third Battle of Kharkov and the stabilisation of the front.Glantz (1995), pp. 143‚Äì147.Nipe (2000), pp. 54‚Äì64, 100. The disaster at Stalingrad was the end of Case Blue and the territorial gains had been reversed by the end of 1943, except for the Kuban bridgehead on the Taman peninsula, retained for a possible second offensive to the Caucasus, which was held until 19 October 1943.Vego, Milan N. Naval Strategy and Operations in Narrow Seas (MPG Books Ltd, London, 2003), p. 278.Glantz (1995), p. 141. =Analysis= Due to the initial success of the German summer offensive in 1942, Hitler and the German commanders became more ambitious, putting great strain on the German army. Hitler did not expect the Soviets to be able to launch a counter- offensive as big as Operation Uranus and sent troops elsewhere, ordering the Wehrmacht to simultaneously achieve several goals. Opposition led to Hitler sacking dissenters and interfering more in command.Glantz (1995), p. 132.Antill (2007), p. 43. Overextension reduced the capabilities of the German Army and its allies to defend this territory and the Soviets mounted a decisive offensive at Stalingrad, encircling a German army. Soon both sides concentrated on the battle for the city, making the Caucasus a secondary theatre. With Army Group B unable to hold the Volga line, Soviet offensives almost cut off Army Group A in the Caucasus and it was forced to withdraw. The surrender of Sixth Army was a huge blow to German morale and it came as a great shock to Hitler. Despite the destruction of Sixth Army, the Soviets were only able to force the German Army back from the Caucasus, delaying the final decision on the Eastern Front. The Soviet command overestimated its capabilities and pushed its forces forward to the limit of its supply lines, which led to defeat at the Third Battle of Kharkov and left the Germans able to fight the Battle of Kursk in the summer of 1943.Antill (2007), pp. 87‚Äì88.

It has applications in nuclear physics, helping to conveniently express the timing of various events in a nuclear reaction, especially neutron reactions. The typical time required for one step in the chain reaction (i.e. the typical time for each neutron to cause a fission event, which releases more neutrons) is of the order of 1 shake, and the chain reaction is typically complete by 50 to 100 shakes.https://web.archive.org/web/20081206163819/http://docs.nrdc.org/nuclear/files/nuc_04109401a_122.pdf This is also applicable to circuits. Since signal progression in IC chips is very rapid, on the order of nanoseconds, a shake is good measure of how quickly a signal can progress through an IC (integrated circuit). Like many nuclear units, it is derived from top secret operations of the Manhattan Project during World War II. The word comes from the expression \\"two shakes of a lamb's tail\\", which indicates a very short time interval. For nuclear-bomb designers, 10 nanoseconds was a convenient specific interval to connect to this term. It has been discussed at length that the oldest documented usage of the phrase \\"two shakes of a lamb's tail\\" can be found within the compiled works of Richard Harris Barham called The Ingoldsby Legends (1840), but likely existed in vernacular language long before then.

It was named after the rivers Rhine and Moselle. It was formed in 1798, when the left bank of the Rhine was annexed by France. Until the French occupation, its territory was divided between the Archbishopric of Cologne, the Archbishopric of Trier, and the Electorate of the Palatinate. Its territory is now part of the German states of Rhineland- Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia. Its capital was Koblenz. After Napoleon was defeated in 1814, the department became part of Prussia. History Memorial for the German veterans of the Army of Napoleon in the main cemetery in Koblenz The D√©partement de Rhin-et-Moselle was established by the French First Republic in 1798 in the territories of the Holy Roman Empire conquered after the War of the First Coalition in 1794, after the failure of the creation of an independent Cisrhenian Republic. The annexation was legalized under international law by the Treaty of Lun√©ville on February 9, 1801. Since the French had to evacuate the right bank territories according to the peace treaty, they blew up before the old fortress of Ehrenbreitstein. Following the inauguration of the administrative division, the cities and municipalities of the d√©partement received civil administration for the first time. From 1802 all the religious foundations and monasteries in the department were secularized. In the Concordat of 1801 the state guaranteed religious tolerance to the churches. With the dissolution of the ecclesiastical rule and the change of ownership, a new social order emerged. With the adoption of the Code civil from 1804, a modern legal system was introduced, based on individual liberties, equality before the law, the rule of law, the protection of property, and the strict separation of church and state. In the areas of the left bank of the Rhine, it continued even after the French period until the introduction of the B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch in 1900. The new legal system replaced the previous secret inquisition processes and replaced them with public prosecution and jury trials. Furthermore, the male population of the conquered territories was subject to draft into the French army and thus had to participate in the French wars of conquest, including the French invasion of Russia, where many of the soldiers were killed. The French legacy of administration and justice, which was maintained during the Prussian period, allowed much greater scope for liberal aspirations. The Hambach Festival of 1832 and the German revolutions of 1848‚Äì49 would have been unimaginable without this legacy. The D√©partement de Rhin-et-Moselle existed until 1814. On New Year's Eve in 1814, Russian troops together with Bl√ºcher's Silesian army crossed the Rhine near Koblenz, Kaub and Mannheim. The French evacuated the d√©partement and left it to the Russians and Prussians without a fight. Thereafter, it was administered for a short time as part of the General Government of the Middle Rhine and was finally assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815 at the Congress of Vienna. Prussia formed the short-lived province of the Grand Duchy of Lower Rhine, the southern forerunner of the Rhine Province, from the areas that it had acquired. Prefects The prefects of the department were: * Philippe Joseph Boucqueau (1800-1803) * Mouchard de Chaban (1803-1805) * Alexandre de Lameth (1805-1806) * Adrien de Lezay- Marn√©sia (1806-1810) * Jean Marie Th√©r√®se Doazan (1810-1814) Administrative units The department was subdivided into the following arrondissements and cantons (situation in 1812):Almanach Imp√©rial an bissextil MDCCCXII, p. 456-457, accessed in Gallica 26 July 2013 * Koblenz, cantons: Koblenz, Andernach, Boppard, Cochem, Kaisersesch, Lutzerath, Mayen, M√ºnstermaifeld, Polch, R√ºbenach, Treis and Zell. * Bonn, cantons: Bonn (2 cantons), Adenau, Ahrweiler, Remagen, Rheinbach, Ulmen, Virneburg and Wehr. * Simmern, cantons: Simmern, Bacharach, Kastellaun, Kirchberg, Kirn, Kreuznach, Sankt Goar, Sobernheim, Stromberg and Trarbach.

The lyrics of Kryl's songs are highly poetic and sophisticated, with perfect rhyming and a frequent use of metaphors and historical allusions. The sparse sounds of his guitar served to underscore the natural flow of the lyrics themselves. In certain respects‚Äîespecially the complexity of his lyrics, his accompaniment by a single acoustic guitar, and also his great popularity‚ÄîKryl was similar to a young Bob Dylan. However, unlike Dylan, the Czech singer had a smooth and pure, though forceful voice, which gave a hauntingly moving quality to his mournful lyrics. Having lived for twenty years in forced exile, he was initially keen on the collapse of communism in his country, but very quickly he became bitterly and uncompromisingly critical of the new regime and its protagonists as well, including V√°clav Havel, and especially of those who were responsible for the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1992. Biography Kryl was born on April 12, 1944, in Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ, in the Nazi occupied Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, however his family had roots in Nov√Ω Jiƒç√≠n, where they later moved to. The Kryl family owned a printing business, which was confiscated from them after the communist takeover in 1948. Kryl planned to be a potter and studied at an industrial secondary school in Bechynƒõ where he specialized in ceramics. He graduated in 1962. Kryl moved to Prague in 1968 as an assistant at Czechoslovak Television. In his spare time he performed his romantic and satiric folk songs in numerous small clubs. When the Warsaw Pact armies occupied Czechoslovakia on August 21, 1968, to suppress the Prague Spring reform movement, Kryl released his first album. The title song Brat≈ô√≠ƒçku zav√≠rej vr√°tka (Keep the Gate Closed, Little Brother) was composed spontaneously on August 22, 1968 as an immediate reaction to the occupation. The album described his perception of the inhumanity of the regime and his views on life under communist rule. The album, released in early 1969, was banned and removed from shelves shortly after, but this could not prevent the songs from getting around the audience and becoming cult hits. Kryl left Czechoslovakia in 1969 to attend a music festival at Waldeck Castle in West Germany. Faced with certainty of imprisonment in his homeland, he decided to apply for political asylum and stay abroad. His second album, Rakovina (meaning \\"Cancer\\" in Czech) was banned in Czechoslovakia; however, copies were smuggled into the country and circulated widely. The title song, and other songs on the album, reflected on the paralysis that brought the nation of the Prague Spring on its knees and into a new subjugation; they reference the self-sacrifice of Jan Palach as well as the brutal suppression by the Czechoslovak police of peaceful protests on the first anniversary of the 1968 invasion. Kryl attained a second, German, graduation in 1973 and went on to study art history and journalism at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, though he never attained a title. For the majority of his time in exile, Kryl worked for Radio Free Europe and released a number of albums during this period. Though his albums were banned in Czechoslovakia and not played on government-controlled radio stations, many of his songs became iconic back in his homeland, where listening to his records or singing his songs became a major component of underground protest. Kryl went on several tours across Scandinavia, North America and Australia. During this time, he composed songs not only in his native Czech, but also in Polish and German. In the enthusiastic November days of 1989, during the Velvet Revolution, Kryl returned to Czechoslovakia to attend his mother's funeral. At first he was thrilled with the end of totalism, but he soon became openly disappointed with the course of transformation of the politics and society. He continued to write protest songs (e.g. Demokracie, \\"Democracy\\") criticising politicians and others responsible for the failure of the country's transition to an authentic democracy, especially those who left the Communist party in or after 1989 and suddenly became 'democrats'. Kryl also attacked those who sought to manipulate the Czech and Slovak citizens by nationalist catchphrases and lies about economic transformation. Due to the conditions in the country that he considered unbearable, he decided to leave for Germany again. On March 3, 1994, just a month before his fiftieth birthday, Karel Kryl died of a heart attack in a Munich hospital. = Awards = * 1989 ‚Äì the Jan Zahradn√≠ƒçek award for Czech Poetry, from the Czechoslovak Literature Club in Los Angeles in memoriam: * 1994 ‚Äì a silver memorial medal from the Charles University for contributions to the spiritual development and the moral support of the nation * 1995 ‚Äì Franti≈°ek Kriegl award * 1995 ‚Äì the Czech Grammy * 1995 ‚Äì Medal of Merit II. class from president V√°clav Havel = Bibliography = * Hraje a zp√≠v√° Karel Kryl * Kn√≠≈°ka Karla Kryla * Sedm b√°sniƒçek na zrcadlo * Pochyby * 17 kryptogram≈Ø na d√≠vƒç√≠ jm√©na * (Zpod stolu) sebran√© spisy * Slov√≠ƒçka * Amoresky * Z m√©ho pl√≠≈æivota * Zbranƒõ pro Erat√≥ * LOT * Snƒõhurka v had≈ô√≠c√≠ch * POD GRAFIKU * P≈Ølkac√≠≈ô * Texty p√≠sn√≠ * B√°snƒõ * Krylogie+P≈Ølkac√≠≈ô * Rozhovory * Demokracie, aneb s malou vadou na kr√°se‚Ä¶ Discography B≈ôevnov cemetery at St. Margharet in Prague Karel Kryl only released one album in Czechoslovakia (Brat≈ô√≠ƒçku, zav√≠rej vr√°tka), but he released many albums while in exile, a prominent example would be Tekut√© p√≠sky. * Brat≈ô√≠ƒçku, zav√≠rej vr√°tka (1969, LP, Panton, ƒåSSR) * Rakovina (1969, LP, Primaphon, Germany) * Ma≈°kary (1970, LP, Caston, Germany) * Carmina Resurrectionis (1974, EP, Caston, Germany) * Karavana mrak≈Ø (1979, LP, ≈†afr√°n 78, Sweden) * Plav√°ƒçek (1983) * Ocel√°rna (1984, EP) * Dopisy (1988, MC) * Tekut√© p√≠sky (1990, LP, MC, CD, Bonton, Czechoslovakia) * Dvƒõ p≈Øle lunety aneb rebelant o l√°sce (1992, recitation poems of Karel Kryl) * Monology (1992, LP, CD, MC Janez, Czechoslovakia) * To nejlep≈°√≠ 1 (1993, CD, MC, Bonton, Czech Republic) * Dƒõkuji (1995) * Jed≈Øfky (1996) * To nejlep≈°√≠ 2 (1998) References External links *Karel Kryl website (by his widow) 1944 births 1994 deaths People from Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ Czech composers Czech male composers Czechoslovak emigrants to Germany Czech poets Male poets Czech male writers Czech male singers Czech folk singers Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty people Czech anti-communists Czech guitarists Recipients of Medal of Merit (Czech Republic) 20th-century poets 20th- century singers 20th-century composers 20th-century guitarists 20th-century male singers ","title":"Karel Kryl"},{"id":"1387562","text":"Arthur Berry (7 February 1925 - 4 July 1994) was an English playwright, poet, teacher and artist, who was born in Smallthorne, Stoke-on-Trent. His individual creative work became deeply rooted in the culture, people and landscape of the industrial pottery town of Burslem. Life Burslem School of Art Berry was the son of a publican and grew up in the potteries city of Stoke-on-Trent during the Depression. He was born with a crippled arm; as he could not work as a miner or manual labourer, Berry was enrolled at the Burslem School of Art in the city. Despite a rebellious start there, he came under the care of Gordon Mitchell Forsyth (1879‚Äì1952), director of art education and a successful pottery designer. =Studies at Royal College of Art= Berry gained a place at the Royal College of Art, as did a number of the more talented Burslem students.Andrew Casey, Elegance with Utility, The work of Susie Cooper (1902-1995) During his time at the Royal College the institution was evacuated from Kensington to Ambleside in the Lake District, to escape the German bombing of London during the Second World War.Leslie Duxbury (2008), Bohemians in Exile: The Royal College of Art in Ambleside, 1940-1945. \\"Bohemians in Exile\\" was also the title of a 2011 exhibition at the Armitt Museum. Ambleside, where Berry studied during the War Berry, who suffered from agoraphobia, did not find the rural surroundings of Ambleside particularly to his taste. However, he appreciated the intense autumn colours which are characteristic of the locality. He spent the last year of the course in London. =Teaching career= After the war, Berry became an art teacher. He worked in London and Manchester, but as a teacher he is best known for his long association with Burslem School of Art, where he had studied. Burslem School of Art was absorbed within Stoke-on-Trent College of Art, which in turn became part of North Staffordshire Polytechnic in 1971. Berry was lecturer in painting at the Polytechnic until 1985. Berry's second wife, Cynthia, was one of his students. They married in 1966 and lived at Wolstanton, Newcastle- under-Lyme. Writing Berry's first stage play was performed in 1976. His 1979 work Lament for the Lost Pubs of Burslem was awarded the Sony/Pye Award for the best radio monologue of 1979. It was also printed as a text in The Listener magazine (Christmas edition, 20‚Äì27 December 1979) and it starts with the lines: :\\"I sat down and wept when I remembered the lost pubs of Burslem, the demolished Star that stood where the Moonglow Ballroom stands now, on the corner of the street of the Preacher and the Tote office; it was a gaunt, dark building nicknamed the Star of Bethlehem, a grimey stuccoed star the colour of years of wet smoke. From outside it looked forbidding and empty, lit only by one or two naked electric light bulbs; its doors were difficult to find, its main door on the corner of the Square had been screwed down for some reason and on the inside covered with a piece of painted plywood. Only the side-doors would let you in and these were narrow and difficult to open. One was in Queen's Street and the other in William Clowes Street, opposite the Dolphin... for all its dreary appearance, the Star was the highest drinking temple in the town; nothing has been the same since it was knocked down. No pub has been more lamented.\\" Berry wrote an autobiography titled A Three and Sevenpence Halfpenny Man. His other works include Dandelions (a volume of poems), and The Little Gold-Mine, a collection of stories about Potteries' life. In 2018 a collection of unpublished poems by Arthur Berry were discovered in papers in the estate inside an envelope postdated 1972. All were typed and named. With the help of Barewall Art Gallery who work closely with the estate of Arthur Berry, a slim book of poetry by Arthur called On the Street was published. Berry's paintings His paintings are held in numerous private and public collections. Berry has been referred to as 'the Lowry of the Potteries', being so described in the title of a 2007 exhibition of his work. The comparison was discussed in two related letters to The Sentinel: :Arthur Berry... was a good teacher and focus for art activity at the Burslem & Stoke Art School. I do not agree that he is for many the finest 20th century artist from Stoke - there are other candidates also. Mr Berry's work lies somewhere between painting and drawing - for me paint and its properties hold most attraction. Mr Berry's talent was spread over several areas - drawing, painting, writing, plays, poems and teaching. I do not think I am good enough myself to do several things well, so concentrate on one (painting). Mr Berry said he admired Lowry and once encountered him in a Manchester Gallery - said he was built and made for a particular task - as an artist recording the vanishing industrial scene of Manchester....Mr Berry was, I feel, a humorist whose interest was the people of the old working class of Stoke - a type of person who no longer exists. I mostly liked his landscapes. They seemed to convey that strange Stoke light which appeals to me and the old buildings and streets which were very much part of my own childhood and youth.Berry Helped me Value my Roots, letter, The Sentinel, 21 February 2007 :The Arthur Berry exhibition of work at Ford Green Hall...is compact but conveys the flavour of what the local writer and poet was all about. There is an earthiness and a vitality about much of his work and though abstract painting is not everyone's cup of tea, there is a power about Berry's that is probably best conveyed if you look at the pieces collectively. The Sentinel's article called him the Lowry of the Potteries, though in my opinion, the paintings of Biddulph Moor-born C W Brown, sometimes known as \\"The Potteries' Primitive\\", stand comparison. Berry was a fan of Brown, incidentally.Exhibitions well worth a Visit, letter, The Sentinel, 10 March 2007 From July 2015 to January 2016 a major show titled Lowry and Berry: Observers of Urban Life, displaying works dating from the 1960s to 1994, was held at the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke-on-Trent. Stoke-on- Trent life Berry recalls the artistic inspiration he obtained from... \\"the streets of my early childhood, the moorland landscape, pit villages, public houses, chip shops, night town and later avenue life.\\"Arthur Berry, Dandelions: poems, 1993 Lamenting change, he bemoans that, \\"the old wooden mangle rollers were replaced by rubber wringers, the iron range grate by little fancy tiled affairs, the elegant, slim paper packets of five Woodbines disappeared...\\" He felt he had been born into a tightly cohesive society, but \\"the values that had held the working class together began to slowly be eroded.\\" He loved a world that was filled with, \\"a line of shunted coal waggons...wreaths of steam and a smell of gas...youths playing cards at the back of the old knackers yard...old men cough in the betting shops and huge fat women queue in the Co-op...the chain row and pit-head gear.\\" This was a \\"place of empty chapels and aborted kilns\\", \\"the window cleaner with wild eyes and a mania for gambling\\", or indeed \\"an effeminate man who wears a ginger wig...muttering to himself all day, he pushes an old pram with a bird cage in it.\\" Touchingly, he noticed the habits of the people: \\"at weekends when you are flush and filled with drink or the prospect of drink\\", and when one might feel \\"as dry as a lime-burner's clog.\\" He loved \\"the sunken bricks of his garden path.\\" and even a visit to the gents could become an inspiring revelation: \\"as I stand piddling in the crazed urinal stall I can see the red and green tail lights of some night plane moving across this area of infinite velvet over the darkened hoop of the world.\\" Berry's love of North Staffordshire was deep and permanent; he indulged an incurable addiction to the place. He \\"had an inexplicable attraction to the place and...was attached to the area by \\"an invisible umbilical cord\\", which could never be cut.\\"Jonathan Pimm, \\"Thinker of the Working Class: Arthur Berry\\" Obituary, Evening Sentinel, Stoke-on-Trent, 6 July 1994, p.12 He said of his childhood \\"every house seemed to have an old woman, a drunken man, a gang of kids and a snarling dog.\\" Certainly then he was, \\"a thinker of the working class who developed a love of middle class pursuits.\\" He said he had \\"always worked out of one world, the working class world of which I am part\\", while declaring, \\"I am a man of habit and pattern.\\" He \\"became a cult figure following many television appearances in the Midlands.\\" His attachment to the place was a legend. For example, \\"when he obtained work as a teacher in Chelsea College of Art he commuted every day and night from Biddulph Moor.\\"Arthur Berry Obituary, Biddulph Chronicle, 15 July 1994, p.1 And indeed \\"propping up the bar at his local public house...is where he felt most comfortable.\\"Arthur Berry Obituary, The Times, 8 July 1994 Yet it was during the 1950s that the, \\"crushing black agoraphobia descended on him, virtually imprisoning him in North Staffordshire for the rest of his life.\\"Peter Cheeseman, Rich Dark Portraits of Pits and Potteries, Arthur Berry Obituary, The Guardian, 7 July 1994 But as a man, poet, playwright and artist he came into his own. Peter Cheeseman (Director, for thirty five years, of the Victoria Theatre, Stoke-on-Trent and, latterly, the New Victoria Theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme), recalls the many animated conversations they had enjoyed, and \\"the swift gestures of his good left arm, banging at the elbow of his useless right...and the rich talk that pours out of him.\\" He was \\"eloquent in every way...a vigorous and expressive poet...a writer of stories, a dramatist...grotesquely hilarious...[and] an inspiring teacher of art, loved and admired by his students.\\" He was \\"a large, ungainly and glum man, tall and remote, cloth cap sitting permanently over his expressionless face.\\" He seemed to have something of a love-hate relationship with his art, for \\"he once sent a groaning van-load off to Stoke tip: a great weight lifted off me.\\" He was really \\"a painter and poet of the cluttered and dying landscape of pits and ironworks...he writes of that world with unexpected imagery and a great roaring sense of humour, sometimes wry, often grotesque.\\" As a painter, he strained \\"to paint a world he loved passionately for its vigour and its energy and its richness before the bulldozer scraped it away.\\" He felt his paintings to be \\"the most eloquent utterances, portraits of a world seen from the bottom of my rut.\\" This was indeed \\"a world filled with images of people and landscape that have been twisted and worn into strange shapes by hard work and poverty. My Parthenon is an allotment hut knocked together out of bits of rubbish. It is the richness of poor things that I am drawn to.\\" As he told Peter Cheeseman, \\"everything I have ever drawn, every house, every man, every face has its roots in those few streets [of Smallthorne] All the things I have written, or hope to write, I am sure will have the same roots.\\" The rare and wonderfully warm observations Berry made of working people are perhaps the most enduring: \\"old women, who sat night after night, squat as frogs, drinking, watching, eating and taking all in\\",Arthur Berry, Lament for the Lost Pubs of Burslem, The Listener, 20 & 27 December 1979, pp. 853‚Äì5 \\"and the publican had got a clean collar and tie on, and all the world was ship-shape--this was happiness.\\" \\"I once saw a pot-woman dance an impromptu fertility dance...the woman sitting with him had knees the size of hams, and drank a case of bottled beer as she sat there.\\" And \\"then there are the princes of drink, men high in the hierarchy of booze, popes of the tap-room...they manage to live and live with style; to smoke and drink and back horses without ever seeming to concern themselves about money...savour the full richness of the working class who can live without work...I have known such men rear big families on the dole, and strut up the street with a rose in their buttonhole.\\" Then there are the \\"ordinary men who cannot make ends meet and are under the rule of women...lesser men, who are pestered by women and children, whooping cough and rashes of one sort or another...troubles that reduce an honest man to a worrying machine...all the bellyaching and mither and half-pint scrimping that bogs most men down...the poverty, and the poverty of just being able to make ends meet...[for it is] bosses and women and children [who] pull men down from their dignity.\\" People and places of Berry's world In Berry's autobiography A Three and Sevenpence Halfpenny Man he wrote of his childhood and of his daily life at Burslem School of Art. He tells of going down to London and meeting \\"the two Roberts\\", Robert MacBryde and Robert Colquhoun, of perusing pictures in the galleries of the capital and of boozing his way through his student life there at the Royal College of Art in Chelsea. He tells of life in Stoke as well as his trips abroad, first with his wife and then in his later years when he travelled on his own little Grand Tour through Italy and France and into Spain. His book of short stories, The Little Gold Mine depicts the people of North Staffordshire and their lives in the 1950s and 60s and includes pencil sketches of those same people. Berry describes many people and places in his poems and stories. These include \\"a dirty-faced child\\", [Dandelions, 39] a \\"chinless creature with slack stockings\\", [39] and \\"a baby with a big head and a chalk-white face who didn't look as though it was for this world long.\\" [39] All \\"her ever thinks about is her belly, she would eat a raw monkey if there was any chance.\\" [41] In a long poem, he describes lots of people one might encounter in a dole office: \\"the wives of unemployed window cleaners, threadbare dandies, part-time tatooists, ex-bin men with double ruptures, alcoholic chefs, addleheads, pinheads, honest clerks, and loud-mouthed shitheads, with hanging trouser arses, flyboys and water-headed idiots led by their mothers, and reasonable men, genuine victims with polished shoes.\\" [44] Also a man who helps poor people make claims: \\"a master of claims and benefits, a poor man's lawyer in fact\\", [57] helping \\"a poverty-stricken illiterate\\", [57] and \\"men who have put their hopes on horses - men that have lived beyond their women, and those who were always too ill-shaped to love, and so loved drink...and laughing men, who have boozed their dead wives club money, and those that sleep late and stand waiting for opening time\\", [58] for \\"drinking men often die lonely deaths, those who have forsaken women and have died in their camaraderie of booze.\\" [64] As opposed to those \\"dutiful husbands who have faced up to their responsibilities and not drunk every penny they could get their hands on.\\" [64] He describes \\"an old man in a gate hole spits into the cobbled backs and watches a young woman with a fat behind, pinning washing out, in a pair of slacks.\\" [65] He describes a pub regular called Bernard who \\"has a small stomach and has difficulty in polishing off a bag of crisps at one go\\", [67] Love, Berry suggests, \\"is also often held in silence and sometimes you don't know it's been there till it's gone.\\" [86] His advice about art can be summarised thus: \\"in painting pictures, accidents can often be fortuitous.\\" [55] Legacy In the early years of the 2000s there was an annual Arthur Berry Fellowship award for young artists, administered on behalf of his widow Cynthia Berry.BBC - Stoke and Staffordshire Culture report from 2002 on the award of the Arthur Berry Fellowship to two local artists.

Its territory is now part of Germany and Belgium. Named after the river Saar (), it was created in 1798 in the aftermath of the Treaty of Campo Formio of 18 October 1797 which ceded the left bank of the Rhine to France. Despite its name it covered a much larger area than the historical area known as the Saarland. Prior to the French occupation of the area from 1793 onward, its territory had been divided between the Electorate of Trier, Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken and the Electorate of the Palatinate (the Duchy of Zweibr√ºcken and the County of Veldenz). Its territory is now part of the German states Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland as well as a tiny adjacent section of the Belgian province of Li√®ge. Its capital was Trier.

It is the fifth book published and eighth chronologically in the Redwall series. Plot introduction Ferahgo the Assassin, a terrible weasel warlord, and his son Klitch lead their army of Corpsemakers to Salamandastron, to take over from the Badger Lord, Urthstripe the Strong. Meanwhile, at Redwall Abbey, two stoats run off with the Sword of Martin the Warrior after accidentally killing Brother Hal with a bow and arrow left out from a carnival the night before, and young Samkim, a mischievous squirrel, and his partner Arula the molemaid set off to claim back the sword. As the young squirrel and mole attempt to restore the symbolic weapon, a deadly fever ravages Redwall Abbey. The only hope to stop the disease is an otter named Thrugg and his partner, young Dumble the dormouse. At the same time, Mara the badgermaid leaves Salamandastron with Pikkle Ffolger, her friend the gluttonous hare, only to be tricked by Feragho's son Klitch and his lackey, Goffa. The two join forces with the Guerilla Union of South Stream Shrews of Mossflower (Guosssom) to take the Blackstone from the mysterious badger ghost. Plot summary The book follows the tale of the Badger Lord Urthstripe the Strong and his battle against Ferahgo the Assassin. Mara, Urthstripe's young adopted daughter, and her hare friend, Pikkle, decide to leave the great mountain stronghold, Mara having become tired of the strict ways of Salamandastron. Meanwhile, two stoats, Dingeye and Thura, have recently deserted Ferahgo's army. They manage to find their way to Redwall Abbey and are taken in by the kind beasts that reside there. While tensions mount as to their presence, the ruling beasts of the Abbey decide they may stay: the two stoats, while rude, have done no harm. Mara and Pikkle, meanwhile, have escaped Ferahgo's horde and have taken refuge in a cave. Unfortunately, the cave is inhabited by a sand lizard called Swinkee. A fight ensues, and Mara accidentally pulls off Swinkee's tail. After the fight, Mara and Pikkle ask Swinkee if he can take them to Salamandastron. To get Swinkee to do it, they promise him a large bag of live swampflies and marshworms. Swinkee double-crosses them, however, and leads them straight to a tribe of cannibal toads. They are presented to the chieftain, a large, repulsive, fat toad called King Glagweb. He throws them into a pit where 36 young shrews are kept captive as well, one of these is Nordo, son of Log-a-Log of the Guosssom. The shrews explain what the toads are going to do to them and their escape plan. Later, when they are nearing a feast day, a black acorn drops into the pit, signalling the captives to throw whatever they have at the toads. After a few minutes of hard fighting, Log-a-Logs shrews come and free the captives while fighting and killing the toads. Mara attacks Glagweb, only to be stopped by Log-a-Log, who throws Glagweb into the prison pit, along with a large, healthy, young pike. Later, Log-a-Log asks a boon of Pikkle and Mara, asking them help in retrieving the Blackstone, the symbol of leadership among the Guosssom (Guerilla Union Of South Stream Shrews of Mossflower). He explains he had been ruling only through sheer strength, and that a badger ghost had taken the stone. The trip to the island was treacherous because of the appearance of the deepcoiler, a large monster residing in the lake that terrorises the Guosssom, along with a conspiracy against Log-a-log launched by a shrew named Tubgutt. When Mara and Pikkle and the Guosssom reach the island, they delve into the islands forest, meeting the 'ghost' badger, who is really a living badger named Urthwyte, the long-lost brother of Mara's father, Urthstripe, and Urthstripes' mother and Mara's grandmother, Loambudd. US cover of Salamandastron Meanwhile, a young squirrel named Samkim and his good mole friend Arula are wreaking havoc, as will happen with youngbeasts. They start playing with bows and arrows and frighten one of the Redwall abbey dwellers. One night, a lightning bolt strikes the weathervane of Redwall, and the sword of Martin the Warrior falls from its resting place high above the Abbey grounds and falls at the feet of Samkim, who is dumbfounded by his discovery. Dingeye and Thura's stay is cut short when they are forced to flee the Abbey after accidentally killing one of the Redwallers (Brother Hal) with the same bows and arrows that Samkim and Arula had used. Dingeye and Thura head towards the countryside, with Martin's stolen sword in hand. Samkim and Arula pursue the two beasts, intent on not only rescuing the legendary sword of their Abbey Champion, but exacting vengeance upon the murdering vermin. Thura falls dead from Dryditch fever, and is left behind by Dingeye. His body is discovered by Samkin, Furgle the Hermit, and Arula. Furgle recognises the disease symptoms and goes to warn Redwall. Dingeye, however, is caught by a group of six vermin from Ferahgo's horde, and is beheaded with the Sword of Martin the Warrior. The vermin leader is Dethbrush, and he in turn takes the Sword from Dingeye's headless carcass. Back at Redwall, a terrible disease has begun ravaging the Abbey. A local woodvole hermit by the name of Furgle determines that it is Dryditch Fever. Mrs. Faith Spinney mentioned that there is an old wives' tale saying that the Flowers of Icetor from the Mountains of the North boiled in springwater can cure Dryditch Fever, so the brave otter Thrugg sets off to find them. With the dormouse babe Dumble along for the ride and an injured falcon whom they meet on the road named Rocangus, the trio eventually makes it to the pines where a group of crows terrorise any passerby. After being rescued by Laird McTalon and a group of falcons, Thrugg succeeds in securing the flowers from the ruler of the mountain: the mighty Golden Eagle, Wild King MacPhearsome. Mara and Samkin's paths eventually cross when Samkin catches up with Dethbrush in a storm and punches him overboard. He is in turn eaten by the Deepcoiler. Samkin grabs the Sword of Martin the Warrior from the body of Dethbrush before the Deepcoiler can dive. Then, after the Deepcoiler dove, it rose again, attacking Spriggat. Then, when the serpent has Spriggat in its jaws, Samkin stabs the Deepcoiler in the roof of the mouth. The serpent then vanishes. Later, Mara and the Guosim find the body of Deepcoiler and retrieve the Sword from it. Along their way, they meet each other and Mara gives Samkin the Sword. Heading back to Salamandastron, the group arrives to see Salamandastron being sieged by Ferahgo the Assassin, and soon enough in time to find Urthstripe seized by the Bloodwrath, leaping from the towering mountain with Ferahgo in his grasp. After the battle, Ferahgo's son, Klitch, is still trapped within Salamandastron. After wandering some way, he gets thirsty and thinks that it is his 'Lucky Day' when he finds some barrels of water. He has forgotten the fact that the Poisoner, hired by Ferahgo, has poisoned all the food and water he saw while on his last mission before his death. Klitch drinks the dregs, and is eventually beset by lances of pain and numbness. He wedges himself on a mountainside opening, and dies of the powerful poison. After Urthstripe's death, Mara, Pikkle, Samkin, Arula, Urthwyte and Loambudd find the badger treasure that Ferahgo was looking for and bury him there. Soon after Thrugg, Dumble and MacPhearsome return with the haversack full of the flowers of Icetor, Samkim and Arula, along with Mara and Pikkle, return to Redwall Abbey. The Abbey is cured of the fever and soon, nameday comes upon the abbey. Mara becomes the Badger Mother of Redwall. Urthwyte remains behind as Lord of Salamandastron, along with the surviving members of the Long Patrol.

A predominantly passenger line, it serves many commuter areas including suburbs of London such as around Hampton Court Palace and the conurbations based on Southampton and Bournemouth. It runs through the counties of Surrey, Hampshire and Dorset. It briefly runs alongside the Waterloo‚ÄìReading line (the \\"Windsor lines\\") which terminate also at Waterloo. The SWML has many branches, including a line to Dorking, Guildford, Portsmouth, and the West of England line which spurs off after Basingstoke in Hampshire to terminate at Exeter. Together with these, it forms the core of the network built by the London and South Western Railway, today mostly operated by South Western Railway. Network Rail refers to it as the South West Main Line. Operating speeds on much of the line are relatively high, with large stretches cleared for up to running. The London end of the line has as many as eight tracks plus the two Windsor Lines built separately, but this narrows to four by and continues this way until Worting Junction west of , from which point most of the line is two tracks. A couple of miles from the Waterloo terminus, the line runs briefly alongside the Brighton main line west branch out of , including through ‚Äì the busiest station in Europe by railway traffic. Tourist special services to a lesser frequency use the line such as the Cathedrals Express and Alton is a rail connection to a shorter heritage service, the Watercress Line. The oldest part of the line, in the London Borough of Lambeth, was used from 1994 to 2007 by Eurostar trains running out of requiring trains in this period to have a shoegear to run off the line's third rail DC electrification, following which became the central London terminus for direct European services.  Proposal  Several companies had proposed building a faster and heavy goods reliable link from London to the South Coast around Southampton, which would have provided not only a route for commodities and passengers but one for munitions and military personnel in the event of war. At the time, Southampton was smaller than the nearby port of Portsmouth, but since Portsmouth's harbour was already well-developed due to naval operations, Southampton was the priority destination for a new railway having wide scope for development. In 1831, the Southampton, London & Branch Railway and Docks Company (SL&BRDC;) was formed, a precursor to the London and South Western Railway. The company planned to build a railway line to Southampton, but were also interested in building a line from halfway down their route towards Bristol via Newbury and Devizes. In that year the Basingstoke Canal company suggested instead that a link be built between their canal, built 1794, and the Itchen Navigation. The suggestion was rejected by those working on the railway plans and the canal company agreed not to oppose the railway. The chosen route to Southampton was not direct as it adopted a compromise axis about one third of the way down for a westward Bristol line, never built. This axis terminates shortly after the conurbation on the line of Basingstoke, then an agrarian market town. The route therefore missed the towns of Guildford, Farnham and Alton which would have boosted early revenue. The railway was also forced narrowly to bypass the town of Kingston-upon- ThamesRailways South East due to the commercial justification that the railway would damage the town's importance for stagecoaches combined with the cost of furrowing a line through the town's easterly hill. The city of Winchester north of Southampton was included in the built and in the unbuilt proposal, seeing its station open in 1839. The Great Western Railway (GWR) secured its patrons for a far more direct route to Bristol, particularly influential landowners in Berkshire and Wiltshire. The GWR received Parliamentary authority and shortly afterwards the Southampton railway. The SL&BRDC; held to its chosen route including Basingstoke, though changed its name to the London and Southampton Railway, and later the London and South Western Railway (L&SWR;). Throughout the 19th century, the L&SWR; and Great Western Railway were often in competition with each other over serving destinations and frequently sought and gained permission to build railways into each other's intended \\"territory\\".  Construction  The first section to be opened was from Nine Elms, the LSWR's first London terminus, in Battersea, to Woking (then named Woking Common) on 21 May 1838. The remainder of the main line followed over the next two years: * Woking to Winchfield (Shapley Heath): 24 September 1838 * Winchfield to Basingstoke: 10 June 1839 * Winchester to Southampton: 10 June 1839 * Basingstoke to Winchester: 11 May 1840. This last section was the most difficult on the route with a long initial climb necessitating earthworks to Litchfield Tunnel and on a ten-mile descent to Winchester which lies on the River Itchen. = The Southampton and Dorchester Railway = The Southampton and Dorchester Railway was also formed and built a line from 1845 to 1847 from Southampton to Dorchester. It avoided Bournemouth, then barely a village, and ran via Ringwood and Wimborne Minster before reaching Dorchester. It took a winding route, which followed the easiest-to- construct links rather than linking settlements in a straight line. In particular, due to intervention by the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, the route between Southampton and Ringwood had to take a southward diversion through Brockenhurst, rather than the straight route through Lyndhurst that the company had envisioned. The line also bypassed Poole. Initially, Poole was served by a branch from Hamworthy (initially named Poole Junction) to a station on the opposite side of Holes Bay. The Ringwood line was nicknamed as 'Castleman's Corkscrew' after Charles Castleman, a major figure in the enterprise.Bournemouth Railway History, Lawrence Popplewell The line was originally planned to continue towards Exeter, but this never came into effect. In 1865 the railway was connected to the GWR line to Weymouth, which now forms the current terminus of the line. A branch was built in the 1870s from Broadstone to central Poole that continued eastwards to Bournemouth, a town that was now developing as a seaside resort. From 1886-88, a line was then built from Brockenhurst to Bournemouth. A causeway was also built across Holes Bay to connect Poole to Hamworthy. In time, the straighter route through Bournemouth and Poole superseded the Ringwood line. The Ringwood line was closed by the Beeching Axe. = Rival lines and services = The L&SWR;'s biggest rival was the Great Western Railway (GWR) who had originally cut the L&SWR;'s plans by building the line to Bristol. Both companies built several railways from their own networks into each other's intended territory. In 1848, the GWR built a branch from Reading to Basingstoke. At first this was a fairly quiet railway with a terminus separate from the L&SWR;'s mainline station. However, when the rival company adopted standard gauge, a link was constructed between the two lines. This later became used for a freight route from Southampton to the Midlands via Oxford. Following the closure of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, this route became used by long-distance services from Bournemouth to the Midlands. Another line was built in 1873 southward (Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway). Originally, L&SWR; ruled out allowing the line to use its own track. However the DN&SR; fell into financial difficulties, and negotiations allowed its trains to use the South Western Main Line south of Winchester. GWR also proposed building a line from Reading to Portsmouth via Basingstoke and Alton but L&SWR; found a cheaper solution for building the northern stretch from Basingstoke to Alton by using a light railway. The Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway stopped a rival's Portsmouth line from being built at the all-too-common cost of being, for most of its existence, unprofitable - it saw an eight-year resurrection but again became loss-making and closed in 1932 save for goods. In 1955 similarly the southern stretch, the Meon Valley Railway, closed to passengers.  Infrastructure  = Track = Between London Waterloo and Clapham Junction, the line has eight tracks. It runs over the Nine Elms to Waterloo Viaduct for much of its length. It crosses beneath the Chatham Main Line where the Brighton Main Line runs alongside it on the southern side. At Clapham Junction, some of these tracks leave on the Waterloo to Reading Line and the remaining tracks are reduced to four. The Brighton Line, which also has four tracks, separates from it shortly afterwards. The four tracks initially have a pair of \\"slow\\" tracks to the east with the two \\"fast\\" tracks on the western side. This arrangement continues to north of Wimbledon where a flyover transfers the northbound slow line across the fast lines, leaving the inner tracks being used for the fast services and the stopping services using the outer tracks. This arrangement continues to Worting Junction, just after Basingstoke. Many stations on this section had island platforms which have since been removed - this is evident with wide gaps between station platforms at stations such as Winchfield. The island platforms survive at New Malden, Esher and Walton-on-Thames, although mothballed and out of use. The line continues as double-track to Winchester but expands to three tracks through Shawford station with one up platform and fast and slow down platforms. There are four tracks from Shawford to Eastleigh. The line from Romsey via Chandler's Ford trails in just north of Eastleigh which is also the junction for the Fareham line. The line returns to double track until St Denys where the West Coastway Line trails in. At Northam the original route to Southampton Terminus carries on south towards Eastern Docks and the main route curves west to enter a tunnel through to Southampton Central station. The line remains double-tracked most of the way to Weymouth, but there is a single-track section between Moreton and Dorchester South which constrains capacity. = Electrification = The 'Surrey section', about half of which has become Greater London, was electrified, as far west as Pirbright Junction (for Alton) using the (750 V DC third rail) system, by the London & South Western Railway or its successor, the Southern Railway before World War II. The bulk of the line (that is from Pirbright Junction to Bournemouth/Bournemouth Depot) was electrified in 1967. From then until 1988 trains on the Bournemouth to Weymouth section operated a push-pull system. One or two BR Class 438 4-TC units would be propelled from London to Bournemouth by a BR Class 432 4-REP unit, controlled from the leading cab of the former. At Bournemouth, one or both of the Class 438 4-TCs would continue over the unelectrified line to Weymouth hauled by a BR Class 33/1 diesel locomotive. Trains from Weymouth would follow the same procedure in reverse. Electrification was extended to Weymouth in 1988 and saw the introduction of the new BR Class 442 5-WES Wessex Electric trains. These were withdrawn by February 2007; Class 444 5-DES and Class 450 4-DES trains are now used.  Services  The majority of passenger services are currently operated by South Western Railway. Other passengers services are operated by CrossCountry. =Intercity= Intercity services run as follows (Monday-Saturday off-peak): *Two trains per hour from London Waterloo to Weymouth, with: **One calling at Woking, Winchester, Southampton Airport Parkway, Southampton Central, Brockenhurst, Bournemouth, all stations to Hamworthy, Wareham, Dorchester South and Weymouth. This is the only scheduled service which passes through Basingstoke without stopping. **One calling at Clapham Junction, Basingstoke, Winchester, Southampton Airport Parkway, Southampton Central, Brockenhurst, New Milton, Christchurch, Pokesdown, Bournemouth, Poole and all stations to Weymouth. This is one of only two scheduled services per hour not to stop at Woking. *Three CrossCountry trains every two hours, most calling at Basingstoke, Winchester, Southampton Airport Parkway, Southampton Central, Brockenhurst and Bournemouth: **One between Southampton Central and Newcastle via Birmingham New Street (2-hourly) **One between Bournemouth and Manchester Piccadilly via Birmingham New Street (hourly) *Two trains per hour between London Waterloo and Salisbury (of which one per hour continues to Exeter St. David's), calling at Clapham Junction (alternate trains only), Woking and Basingstoke before branching off on the West of England Main Line. *During the Wimbledon tennis championships, some long-distance trains between Waterloo and a variety of destinations make an additional stop at Wimbledon in the morning on the up fast line from around 10am to 12.30pm and on the down fast line from 7pm until midnight. = Regional = *One train per hour to Poole (stopping service), calling at Clapham Junction, Farnborough (Main), Fleet, Basingstoke, Winchester, Shawford, Eastleigh, Southampton Airport Parkway, Southampton Central, Totton, Ashurst New Forest, Beaulieu Road, Brockenhurst and all stations to Poole. *One train per hour to Portsmouth Harbour, calling at Woking, Farnborough (Main), Basingstoke, Micheldever, Winchester and Eastleigh, before branching off to serve the Eastleigh to Fareham line. = Outer suburban = *Two trains per hour between London Waterloo and Alton, calling at Clapham Junction (alternate trains only), Surbiton, West Byfleet, Woking and Brookwood before continuing to Alton down the Alton Line. *Two trains per hour between London Waterloo and Basingstoke, calling at Clapham Junction (alternate trains only), Surbiton, Walton-on-Thames, Weybridge, Woking and all stations to Basingstoke. *On Sundays, trains on these routes additionally call at Wimbledon. = Commuter = There are also many commuter services serving London. Those of note are: *Two trains per hour between London Waterloo and Woking, calling at Vauxhall, Clapham Junction, Earlsfield, Wimbledon, Surbiton and all stations to Woking. *Two trains per hour between London Waterloo and Hampton Court, calling at Vauxhall, Clapham Junction and all stations to Surbiton before continuing down the Hampton Court Branch Line. *Two trains per hour between London Waterloo and Guildford (via Cobham), calling at Vauxhall, Clapham Junction, Earlsfield, Wimbledon, Surbiton and all stations to Guildford via the New Guildford Line. *One train per hour between Romsey and Salisbury via Southampton Central, using the Eastleigh to Romsey Line and part of the Wessex Main Line. Travelling in a 'figure of six' route, trains from Salisbury go to Romsey, then call at Redbridge and all stations to Eastleigh, where the train leaves the SWML to return to Romsey.  Future development  In July 2011, Network Rail in its London & South East Route Utilisation Strategy (RUS) recommended adding a fifth track to the four-track stretch of line between Clapham Junction and Surbiton. This was found to be feasible within the existing land (rail corridor), and was seen as the most practicable way of providing more capacity on the route. It would permit up to eight additional trains to run in the peak hour, for a maximum of 32 trains in this stretch. The scheme would also entail more flexible track use, modifying one Windsor Line track to permit use by mainline trains. Options rejected in the RUS as not viable included double-deck trains, building a flyover at Woking, and introducing 12- or 16-car trains.

It was named after the highest point in the Palatinate, the Donnersberg (\\"Thunder Mountain\\", possibly referring to Donar, god of thunder). It was the southernmost of four departments formed in 1798 when the west bank of the Rhine was annexed by France. Prior to the French occupation, its territory was divided between the Archbishopric of Mainz, the Bishopric of Speyer, the Bishopric of Worms, Nassau-Weilburg, Hesse-Darmstadt, the Electorate of the Palatinate and the imperial cities of Worms and Speyer. Its territory is now part of the German states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland. Its capital was Mainz ().

The band comprises Joel Pearce on vocals/guitars, Joe Newcombe on guitars/vocals, Dean Bowden on bass/vocals and Adam Cann on drums. In describing their music, Cann has said \\"We‚Äôve fallen into progressive rock ‚Äì soundscapy too I think.‚Äù Flights cite their primary influences as Oceansize, Radiohead, Reuben and Yourcodenameis:milo. Flights have also described their style as \\"Some big guitars, some pretty guitars, irregular time signatures, harmonised vocals and a whole lotta groove.\\" History =Formation= Joe Newcombe, Adam Cann and Joel Pearce come from Thornbury, a market town in South Gloucestershire approximately 12 miles (19 km) north of Bristol. From age 13, Newcombe and Cann had played together in various bands (Cradle Of Fluff, Alcoholic Spider). They met Pearce (then a member of Enigma Design) while playing in pubs in the Thornbury region. When Newcombe went to university he met Dean Bowden and subsequently Newcombe, Bowden and Cann went on to play together in a band called Just For Hustlers. Deciding they wanted to try something different, they then recruited Pearce (who had discussed starting a band with Cann during Friday drinking sessions) and thus completed the Flights line-up. Flights played their first gig in a small Bristol venue called The Louisiana debuting the tracks \\"Charity Calendars\\" and \\"The Mapmaker\\" among others. =2010 - 2011 (first EP)= For the majority of 2010 Flights divided their time between touring and writing sessions. In September 2010, Flights recorded their debut EP Flights at Outhouse Studios in Reading. The six tracks comprising Flights were engineered, produced and mixed by James Billinge assisted by Tom Hollister. Also present behind the desk was Outhouse Studios head John Mitchell (It Bites, Kino, Frost* and Arena). The EP's artwork was designed by Bristol freelance graphic designer Nic Bennett. On 28 January 2011 the band announced the launch of their website. On 27 April 2011 the band launched a YouTube video for \\"The Pretence\\", the lead track on Flights. The video was directed by Bristol photographer Alex Gregory. The Flights EP was released on 30 May 2011 via iTunes and the band's store. On 3 June 2011 the band announced the availability of \\"Judge\\", the second track from Flights, on YouTube. The video accompanying the song was a static shot of the EP's artwork. On 17 June 2011 the band announced the release of the free download single \\"Wires & Code\\" from Flights. The release was accompanied by a video which was again directed by Alex Gregory. The band also relaunched their website on the same day. On 18 August 2011 the band announced the availability of Flights through Bandcamp. Throughout 2011 Flights continued to tour regularly whilst also finding time for album writing sessions. On 19 December 2011 the band announced the availability of their version of the Christmas song \\"Carol Of The Bells\\".

He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1969 to 1977. Born in Arborg, Manitoba, the son of Thorkell Johannson and Gudrun Sigvaldason, Johannson was educated at the University of Manitoba, and worked as a high school history teacher before entering political life. He was a member of the Manitoba Historical Society and the Icelandic Canadian Club, among other voluntary organizations. He was the victim of a home invasion in early 1969, and was wounded in a shotgun blast.Winnipeg Free Press, 8 February 1969, p. 3. In 1970, Johannson married Cheryl Taychuk. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1969 provincial election, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative MLA and future Winnipeg mayor Robert Steen in the riding of St. Matthews. He was re- elected with an increased majority in the election of 1973. Johannson did not serve in the cabinet of Edward Schreyer. In the 1977 election, he lost his seat to Tory candidate Len Domino by 124 votes. He returned to educational work after his defeat. Johannson was initially an ally of Schreyer, but became more closely associated with leadership contender Sidney Green as the decade progressed. He attended an early meeting of Green's Progressive Party in 1981, though his loyalty to the NDP ultimately stopped him from joining.

The other two segments that compose the series are Lippy the Lion and Hardy Har Har and Touch√© Turtle and Dum Dum. The segment consisted of 52 episodes over two seasons. Wally Gator will appear in the upcoming HBO Max original series Jellystone! and he will be voiced by Rob Paulsen.  Plot  Wally Gator (voiced by Daws Butler impersonating Ed Wynn) is an anthropomorphic, happy-go-lucky alligator who wears a collar and a pork pie hat. Although his catchy theme song describes him as a \\"swingin' alligator of the swamp,\\" his home is in the city zoo. Mr. Twiddle (voiced by Don Messick) is the zookeeper who keeps a close watch on Wally, who likes to check out what life is like in the outside world. Analysis Animation historian Christopher P. Lehman noted that Wally Gator follows the formula that Hanna-Barbera established in the previous series, such as the Yogi Bear series. The set up in which of these shows placed an animal character within a human-controlled environment and had these characters deal with the social boundaries placed and enforced by humans.Lehman (2007), p. 27 An example being: Yogi lives in a park under the care of a park ranger; Wally lives in a zoo under the supervision of a zookeeper. The theme that drives the series is Wally's desire to escape the zoo, a derivative of the Top Cat series, where the titular character keeps trying to get away from life in the alley. Lehman notes a rather depressing underlying theme: the zoo and life in captivity seem to be the proper place for Wally. No matter how much he struggles to fit in the society of the outside world, Wally remains an \\"Other\\" and is doomed to fail. The status quo is following every unsuccessful attempt at change. Episodes Cast * Daws Butler as Wally Gator * Don Messick as Mr. Twiddle * Mel Blanc as additional voices, such as Colonel Zachary Gator (ep. \\"Carpet Bragger\\") Home media Episodes of Wally Gator were released on VHS many times. A DVD set release of the complete series was originally announced for 2006 from Warner Bros. for the Hanna-Barbera Classics Collection but was later canceled due to the poor condition of the masters and was delayed. In 2006, a Warner spokesperson said of the DVDs: \\"They were pulled because significant remastering work needed to be researched. We are exploring adding them back to the schedule next year.\\" The first episode is available on the DVD set Saturday Morning Cartoons 1960's Vol. 2.

Of the four terminal stations in Liverpool's city centre, Exchange station was the only station not accessed via a tunnel. The station was badly damaged during World War II and lost a large proportion of the trainshed roof, which was never rebuilt, remaining an iron frame. The station's long-distance services were switched to in the 1960s, and, as a terminus, the station became redundant in the late 1970s, when its remaining local services switched to the newly opened Merseyrail tunnels under Liverpool city centre. It was closed in 1977, being replaced by the new underground station nearby.  Station construction and opening  Tithebarn Street as it was between opening in 1850 and reconstruction in 1886‚Äì88 The grandly- appointed station opened on 13 May 1850, replacing an earlier temporary station at Great Howard Street further north up the track. The station was designed by John Hawkshaw. The station had two names because the joint owners could not agree on a name. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) named the station Liverpool Exchange Station with the East Lancashire Railway (ELR) naming the station Liverpool Tithebarn Street. From 1 October 1850 trains of the Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway (LCSR) began to run into Exchange/Tithebarn Street station with three companies using the terminus. The LCSR became part of the LYR on 14 June 1855. On 13 August 1859, the LYR absorbed the ELR, from which date the name of the station was Liverpool Exchange. The station was the terminus of the ELR's line to Preston, the LYR's route to Bolton and the LCSR routes to Crosby and Southport. The station was elevated with ramps for road vehicles to access the station. The existing station could not cope with demand by the 1880s. The approaches were widened to accommodate more tracks. The station was extensively rebuilt and enlarged between 1886 and 1888, opening on 2 July 1888. Its site expanded from the original location to cover Clarke's Basin (the original end of the Leeds- Liverpool Canal). The station continued to be the Liverpool terminus of the LYR and was also the terminus of the company's Liverpool to Manchester line. Under four extremely long glass train-shed roofs lay ten platforms, with an access roadway between platforms 3 and 4, providing long-distance services to destinations such as Manchester Victoria, Blackpool North, the Lake District, Whitehaven, Glasgow Central, Bradford Exchange and Leeds Central. Author and First World War poet Siegfried Sassoon frequently lodged in the hotel adjoining Exchange station. In 1917, after having earlier written at his London club his A Soldier's Declaration which appeared in the press and was read to the House of Commons, Sassoon was visited at the hotel by Colonel Jones Williams who reprimanded him for his actions. It was from Exchange station that Sassoon made his famous trip to Formby the next day, ripped the ribbon of his Military Cross off his tunic and flung it into the waters at the mouth of the Mersey.Egremont, Max, 2005, Siegfried Sassoon: a biography, Macmillan, p.155. World War II damage During World War II Liverpool, being a prime convoy port, was a major strategic target for German aircraft bombers. Damage was caused to the approach lines to Liverpool Exchange. In December 1940 the viaduct north of the station received a direct bomb hit and collapsed. The collapse precluded trains from running into the station. Commuter services were diverted to Southport's Lord Street station from Liverpool Central High Level. The route was much longer initially running south to Hunts Cross from Liverpool Central High Level, then circling Liverpool via the North Liverpool Extension Line to the east of the city heading north to Aintree and onto Southport. The temporary service ran from 24 December 1940 until 5 July 1941. Temporary wooden bridges were built over the collapsed section of the viaduct restoring electric services. The bridges were not strong enough to take steam-hauled trains. Steam-hauled trains and main line services were resumed on 18 August 1941 terminating at Kirkdale with passengers transferring to buses or trams to the city centre. In May 1941 the worst air raids of the war hit Liverpool. A northern section of the train-shed roof at Liverpool Exchange was badly damaged and required demolition. Other parts remained iron frames until closure in the 1970s. Train services to Liverpool Exchange returned in late 1942. Electrification From March 1904, electric trains replaced steam hauled trains in the operation of suburban passenger services to Southport Chapel Street. The journey time was significantly shorter than the route followed by the Cheshire Lines Committee's Liverpool Central to Southport Lord Street service, as the LYR's route followed a more direct route parallel with the coast, serving growing intermediate communities. The LYR route therefore proved extremely popular with passengers. The line to Ormskirk was also subsequently electrified, being completed in 1913.  Operations post-World War II  Liverpool Exchange Station in 1954 Liverpool Exchange's departures end on 4 May 1968 showing station structure and roof and the morning express to Glasgow (Central) about to leave for Preston On 3 August 1968, the last British Rail scheduled passenger train to be hauled by a standard gauge steam locomotive ended its journey at Liverpool Exchange, Stanier 'Black 5' no. 45318 having hauled from Preston the Liverpool portion of the evening Glasgow to Liverpool and Manchester train. Long-distance services from Exchange switched to Liverpool Lime Street in the 1960s, with trains to Yorkshire, Blackpool and the Lake District being withdrawn in 1969 and Glasgow trains following suit in 1970. Exchange was left with only medium-distance journeys to Wigan and Bolton, operated by diesel multiple units, plus the still-busy urban electric services to Southport and Ormskirk. Closure The programme of route closures in 1963, known as the Beeching Axe, included the closure of two of Liverpool's mainline terminal stations, and High Level in Liverpool, and also Woodside Station in Birkenhead. The Beeching Report in 1963 recommended the closure of the Liverpool Exchange to Southport electric commuter route, and the line to Wigan Wallgate via Rainford Junction. The Liverpool Exchange to Preston via Ormskirk was not recommended for closure. All routes into Liverpool Central High Level station were recommended for closure. Long- and medium-distance routes were to be concentrated on Lime Street station. Liverpool City Council took a different view, and proposed the retention of the suburban services around the city and their integration into a regional rapid-transit network. This approach was backed up by the Merseyside Area Land Use and Transportation Study, the MALTS report. Liverpool City Council's proposal was adopted and Merseyrail was born.\\"Liverpool City Centre Plan - City Centre Planning Group, 1965\\" For Exchange, Liverpool Central High Level and Birkenhead Woodside stations this meant: * Long and Medium Distance Routes - Lime Street Station in Liverpool city centre was to remain, absorbing the long- to medium-distance passenger traffic of the closed terminal stations. * Local urban routes - The local urban services served by the terminal stations would be absorbed by the new Merseyrail urban network. In the early 1970s, four of the platforms at Exchange were closed and demolished to enable tunnelling work to begin for the Merseyrail underground. Part of this ambitious scheme involved diverting the Ormskirk and Southport electric services under Exchange station and into a new tunnel running north to south under Liverpool's city centre, named the Link Tunnel, linking separate lines in the north and south of the city creating a north‚Äìsouth crossrail. Exchange station would be replaced by a station in the new tunnel named Moorfields. Trains formerly serving Exchange station call at the new nearby Moorfields underground station then continue in the tunnel to terminate at Liverpool Central underground station, or onwards to Hunts Cross in the extreme south of the city. At both Moorfields and Central stations easy interchange was possible for the first time with Wirral Line services, which until then had operated as a completely separate network. Liverpool Exchange closed on Saturday 30 April 1977. The replacement Moorfields station opened the following Monday, 2 May. Within a few years of closure the old station was demolished by Oldham Bros, a local demolition company. However, the frontage of the station building was preserved and incorporated into a new office building built behind, named Mercury Court. The station site is still largely intact used as surface car parking. The approaches to the station still exist on the old brick viaducts. The lines descend and disappear just before Leeds Street and down under the old station into the Link Tunnel of the Merseyrail Northern Line. Parts of the original station wall can still be seen when walking down Pall Mall or Bixteth Street. Reopening for high-speed rail The route of HS2 has not been fully determined. There are calls by local architects to open Exchange station extending over Leeds Street to the north and onto the approach viaduct. The proposal is to branch off the 1830 Liverpool-Manchester line at Broad Green and onto the North Liverpool Extension trackbed. The line runs to the north then curves to the south at Walton and Kirkdale. The old Exchange station site is in the heart of Liverpool's business quarter and not far from the cruise liner terminal and the proposed Liverpool Waters.

It officially began on June 16 and lasted until October 31, dates delimiting the period when a majority of storms were perceived to form in the Atlantic Ocean. A total of 11 systems were documented, including a late-season cyclone retroactively added a decade later. Five of the eleven systems intensified into hurricanes, and two further attained their peaks as major hurricanes. Activity began with the formation of a tropical storm in the Caribbean on June 20, which then made landfalls in Florida and North Carolina at hurricane intensity, causing one death and at least $75,000 in damage. In late August, a Category 3 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale struck the Texas coastline, with 3 deaths and $20.1 million in damage. The most powerful hurricane of the season, reaching Category 4 intensity, wrought severe damage throughout the Bahamas and East Coast of the United States, namely Florida, in mid-September; 26 people were killed and damage reached $60 million. A hurricane moved ashore the coastline of Belize in early October, causing one death, while the final cyclone of the year resulted in 5 deaths and $2 million in damage across Cuba and the Bahamas two weeks later. Overall, 36 people were killed and damage reached at least $82.85 million. __TOC__ Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/06/1945 till:31/10/1945 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/1945 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_‚â§39_mph_(0‚Äì62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(118‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì130_mph_(178‚Äì209_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131‚Äì155_mph_(210‚Äì249_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_‚â•156_mph_(‚â•250_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:20/06/1945 till:27/06/1945 color:C2 text:\\"One (C2)\\" from:19/07/1945 till:22/07/1945 color:TS text:\\"Two (TS)\\" from:02/08/1945 till:04/08/1945 color:TS text:\\"Three (TS)\\" from:17/08/1945 till:21/08/1945 color:TS text:\\"Four (TS)\\" from:24/08/1945 till:29/08/1945 color:C3 text:\\"Five (C3)\\" from:29/08/1945 till:01/09/1945 color:TS text:\\"Six (TS)\\" from:03/09/1945 till:06/09/1945 color:TS text:\\"Seven (TS)\\" barset:break from:09/09/1945 till:12/09/1945 color:TS text:\\"Eight (TS)\\" from:12/09/1945 till:18/09/1945 color:C4 text:\\"Nine (C4)\\" from:02/10/1945 till:07/10/1945 color:C1 text:\\"Ten (C1)\\" from:10/10/1945 till:13/10/1945 color:C2 text:\\"Eleven (C2)\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/06/1945 till:01/07/1945 text:June from:01/07/1945 till:01/08/1945 text:July from:01/08/1945 till:01/09/1945 text:August from:01/09/1945 till:01/10/1945 text:September from:01/10/1945 till:31/10/1945 text:October TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale)\\" Systems =Hurricane One= The first tropical cyclone of the 1945 season formed about 120 mi (195 km) southeast of Cozumel around 12:00 UTC on June 20\\\\. It tracked north through the Yucat√°n Channel before turning sharply northeast, simultaneously attaining hurricane intensity early on June 23\\\\. Although the crew of a reconnaissance aircraft assessed peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) around 18:00 UTC that day, modern reanalysis suggests the cyclone peaked as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h). Maximum sustained winds fell to 80 mph (130 km/h) as the system moved ashore near Spring Hill, Florida at 08:00 UTC on June 24, with continued weakening inland. After emerging into the southwestern Atlantic, it regained minimal hurricane intensity and made a second landfall along Harkers Island, North Carolina. The system continued northeast and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on June 27, persisting for several days until last documented near Iceland on July 4\\\\. Damage from the hurricane throughout Florida was relatively minor. Citrus trees were stripped of their branches, roadways were washed out, and some telephone and power lines were toppled, temporarily severing communication. Tampa recorded a record 24-hour rainfall total of 10.42 in (264.7 mm), while precipitation peaked at 13.6 in (345 mm) in Lake Alfred. Statewide, the heavy precipitation was regarded as beneficial in ending one of the worst recorded droughts there. Two tornadoes were spawned; one blew a transformer off a platform and ripped a section of railing off a causeway, while both damaged some homes. Total damage reached $75,000 throughout Miami. Farther north, telephone communications around Georgetown, South Carolina were disrupted, while winds gusted as high as 69 mph (111 km/h) and rainfall peaked at 5.58 in (142 mm) in Charleston. In Wilmington, North Carolina, 8.24 in (209 mm) of rain was observed, causing considerable damage to the city's storm sewer system. Although the core of the cyclone passed east of New England, at least 10,000 telephone lines were downed by the storm. Buildings, crops, and trees were damaged, while low visibility led to a traffic accident that killed a man in Warwick, Rhode Island. =Tropical Storm Two= A tropical wave organized into a tropical depression in the central Gulf of Mexico by 06:00 UTC on July 19\\\\. The system moved west-northwest after formation, reaching tropical storm intensity early the next day. Despite a well-established circulation as indicated by weather balloons, peak winds did not exceed 40 mph (65 km/h) throughout the storm's duration. It turned west and then west-southwest offshore the southern Texas coastline, weakening to a tropical depression early on July 22 and dissipating about 30 mi (50 km) offshore six hours later. Although cyclone warnings were issued along the Texas coastline upon the storm's formation, and boats at Aransas Pass were moved into harbors, impact was negligible; winds peaked at 30 mph (48 km/h) with medium to high tides. Squally weather and rough seas were observed along the coastline from Grand Isle, Louisiana to Port Aransas, Texas. =Tropical Storm Three= Around 00:00 UTC on August 2, the third tropical cyclone of the season formed about 85 mi (140 km) northeast of Barbados. It crossed Dominica into the Caribbean Sea, where the storm attained peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) and prompted small craft advisories. Missing Puerto Rico to the south, the cyclone then moved ashore west of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic at peak strength early on August 4. It dissipated over the island later that day and produced only scattered thundershowers across the region. =Tropical Storm Four= Two weeks after the dissipation of Tropical Storm Three, a reconnaissance aircraft confirmed the formation of a new tropical storm in the same vicinity. The cyclone moved west-northwest north of the Caribbean Sea, reaching peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) by 12:00 UTC on August 18, just shy of its originally-assessed hurricane intensity. Steady weakening occurred thereafter, and the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression while passing south of the Bahamas before dissipating north of Cuba early on August 21\\\\. =Hurricane Five= The Texas Hurricane of 1945 In late August, an area of disturbed weather persisted across the Bay of Campeche, eventually organizing into a tropical depression about 145 mi (235 km) northeast of Veracruz, Mexico by 00:00 UTC on August 24\\\\. The system gained steady strength on its north-northwest course, becoming a hurricane early the next day and attaining peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) ‚Äì the first major hurricane of the season ‚Äì southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas by 12:00 UTC on August 26\\\\. At the time, the cyclone was thought to have possessed winds as strong as a 135 mph (215 km/h), but this value was lowered in reanalysis. The hurricane made landfall along Matagorda Island, Texas at peak intensity by 12:00 UTC on August 27 and progressed inland, only slowly weakening to tropical storm intensity early the next morning. The cyclone curved northwest, ultimately dissipating southwest of the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex around 18:00 UTC on August 29\\\\. Though hundreds of miles from Florida, the developing hurricane helped boost St. Petersburg's August rainfall total to its highest in 30 years. Low-lying areas were flooded, sewer systems were backed up, and travel between the city and nearby Tampa was delayed. The storm's impacts in Texas, meanwhile, were regarded as the worst since the 1933 Cuba‚ÄìBrownsville hurricane. Up to two-thirds of the coastline experienced hurricane-force winds, with a peak gust of 135 mph (217 km/h) recorded in Collegeport. Massive storm tides, as high as 15 ft (5 m) in Port Lavaca, inundated coastal locales and eroded up to 50 ft (15 m) of the shore; this was the third largest storm surge documented along the Texas coastline at the time. Rainfall amounts exceeded 30 in (762 mm) along the coastline. Catastrophic losses to crops and livestock were sustained throughout the region. Three deaths occurred in total, including one via a tornado near Houston and two via a capsized fishing vessel offshore Port Isabel, while damage reached $20.1 million. =Tropical Storm Six= A tropical storm formed southeast of the Nicaragua‚ÄìHonduras border early on August 29 and tracked northeast. After curving north and then west, the cyclone attained peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) over the Gulf of Honduras early on August 31\\\\. It moved ashore near Belize City, Belize at peak strength, where heavy rainfall and high tides resulted in flooding of 2‚Äì3 ft (0.6‚Äì0.9 m) within the city. The system weakened quickly once inland, dissipating just northeast of Ocosingo, Chiapas by 18:00 UTC on September 1\\\\. =Tropical Storm Seven= On the heels of Tropical Storm Six, a new tropical depression formed over the western Caribbean Sea by 18:00 UTC on September 3\\\\. The fledgling cyclone moved northeast and crossed the western coastline of Cuba near Punta de Cartas before emerging into the Straits of Florida early on September 4\\\\. The depression intensified into a tropical storm and attained peak winds of 40 mph (65 km/h), maintaining such strength as it moved ashore near Sanibel, Florida by 00:00 UTC on September 5\\\\. It turned abruptly northwest into the northern Gulf of Mexico and weakened to a tropical depression before making a second landfall along the coastline of Mississippi. The weak depression dissipated about 45 mi (75 km) south-southeast of Monroe, Louisiana around 18:00 UTC on September 6\\\\. A testament to the weak nature of the storm, only scattered squally weather affected southern Florida, amounting to minor damage to boats in Miami harbors. =Tropical Storm Eight= Another short-lived tropical storm was first identified about 195 mi (315 km) east of Guadeloupe by 12:00 UTC on September 9\\\\. Data from a reconnaissance aircraft indicated the storm intensified slightly to attain winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) by early the next day, in spite of a poorly-defined circulation center. It tracked northwest and then north, passing within 130 mi (210 km) of Bermuda before dissipating around 18:00 UTC on September 12\\\\. =Hurricane Nine= The Homestead Florida Hurricane of 1945 The most powerful cyclone of the season was first noted as an intensifying hurricane east of the Leeward Islands early on September 12\\\\. It moved steadily west-northwest, passing north of Puerto Rico as a Category 2 hurricane and moving through the Turks and Caicos Islands at Category 3 intensity. The mature storm attained its peak as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) after crossing Andros, Bahamas and soon began a gradual west-northwest turn. It moved ashore the northern end of Key Largo at 19:30 UTC on September 15, progressing into mainland Florida near Homestead, and whereupon the cyclone became the third strongest hurricane to hit Miami- Dade County, Florida on record. The system then curved north throughout the central portions of the state before emerging offshore and making a second landfall near Savannah, Georgia, with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). A continued northward track brought the cyclone into the South Atlantic States, where it completed extratropical transition roughly 50 mi (85 km) east-northeast of Danville, Virginia. The post-tropical cyclone fluctuated in strength and was last noted east of Newfoundland on September 20\\\\. On Grand Turk Island, up to three quarters of the structures there were demolished and the remainder sustained at least minimal damage. Heavy damage occurred on Long Island, Bahamas as well. Reports suggested that up to 22 people may have been killed across the Turks and Caicos Islands. In Florida, the highest measured wind gust topped 138 mph (222 km/h) at Carysfort Reef Light. A total of 1,632 residences were destroyed while an additional 5,372 others received damage, particularly near the landfall point in Homestead. Naval Air Station Richmond suffered catastrophic losses when high winds ignited a fire that engulfed 25 blimps, 366 airplanes, and 150 automobiles across three hangars. Although the station's weather equipment failed, an inspection of the hurricane's damage led to the conclusion that gusts may have reached 150 mph (240 km/h) there. Throughout the remainder of the state, communications were severed by downed telephone lines, crops were ruined, thousands of livestock were killed, and 4 people perished. The overall coast of damage reached $60 million. Farther north across the Carolinas, the cyclone inundated a region affected by heavy precipitation in the days before. The Cape Fear River crested at its highest level on record, 68.9 ft (21 m), flooding large sections of crop lands and adjacent homes. In Richmond County, Virginia, broken dams led to significant flash flooding. =Hurricane Ten= Early on October 2, the tenth tropical storm of the season was noted about 150 mi (240 km) northeast of the Nicaragua‚ÄìHonduras border. It intensified into a Category 1 hurricane by 00:00 UTC the next day on a general west-northwest track and peaked with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) 24 hours later, although the crew aboard a reconnaissance aircraft originally estimated 100 mph (160 km/h) sustained winds. The cyclone tracked west-southwest and made landfall north of Punta Gorda, Belize at peak strength, quickly weakening once inland. Crossing Guatemala and Chiapas, the depression paralleled the coastline of Mexico for a time before moving ashore west of L√°zaro C√°rdenas, Michoac√°n. The wilting system dissipated over southern Durango by 12:00 UTC on October 7\\\\. Maximum gusts topped 60 mph (97 km/h) on Swan Islands, where hundreds of coconut palm trees and most of the banana trees were toppled. Upon making landfall in Belize, the hurricane flattened up to three-quarters of the homes in Punta Gorda, resulting in one death and many injuries. In Livingston, Guatemala, 40 houses were destroyed, and barges loaded with 10,000 bags of coffee were blown out to sea. =Hurricane Eleven= The final Atlantic hurricane of 1945 was not officially documented until over a decade following the end of the season. Using re- analyzed surface weather maps, as well as recounts from local residents along the storm's path, it was discovered that a tropical depression formed south of Jamaica in the southwestern Caribbean Sea by 12:00 UTC on October 10. The compact storm moved north and then north-northeast ahead of a stationary front that existed from the western Atlantic into the Bay of Campeche. It became a minimal hurricane over the Cayman Islands by 00:00 UTC on October 12 and attained its peak at Category 2 intensity with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h) while making landfall along a deserted southern stretch of Cuba. The storm emerged into the Bahamas while maintaining Category 1 strength before becoming intertwined with the frontal zone and transitioning into an extratropical cyclone southwest of Bermuda. The post-tropical storm slowly weakened but persisted until it was absorbed by a large extratropical low near the Azores on October 16\\\\. Due to the hurricane's small size, only fleeting rain and wind was experienced across the Cayman Islands. Cuba bore the brunt of the Category 2 hurricane as it moved ashore near Las Coloradas, where all the mangrove trees were destroyed and sea waters pushed inland. Significant impacts were observed in Jatibonico, where several tanks at a sugar mill were destroyed, a few railroad cars were derailed, and at least one building was demolished. Trees were toppled along the Sierra de Jatibonico, and winds of 70‚Äì75 mph (113‚Äì121 km/h) were felt in Tunas de Zaza, where the telegraph service was disabled. Four deaths and 200 injuries were documented throughout Cuba, with a damage estimate of $2 million. Tropical storm-force winds were produced throughout the Bahamas, cutting electricity to a number of homes on New Providence. Meanwhile, in Eleuthera, damage was inflicted to small vessels, a number of buildings, and telephone lines as winds reached 70‚Äì90 mph (113‚Äì145 km/h); one fatality was reported. Roadways were blocked across the island. In nearby Andros, a number of farms and thousands of coconut trees were destroyed. =Other systems= A large extratropical cyclone was first noted over the north central Atlantic on May 23\\\\. The system's temperature gradient subsided two days later, possibly indicating a brief transition into a subtropical cyclone, but it ultimately degenerated into a trough by May 26\\\\. On August 29, an area of low pressure formed in the central Gulf of Mexico; by 00:00 UTC the next day, a nearby ship recorded sustained winds of 35 mph (56 km/h) and a pressure of 1006 mb (hPa; 29.71 inHg), indicating a high likelihood of a tropical depression. The storm moved ashore in northern Mexico on August 30, producing winds just below gale force and scattered showers in Brownsville, Texas. A few days later, an extratropical cyclone drifted south and then east over the northeastern Atlantic, potentially acquiring subtropical characteristics by September 6; it dissipated two days later. On September 8, a compact low formed at the tail-end of a dissipating stationary front off the coastline of North Carolina. Within the warm sector of an approaching extratropical cyclone, it is likely the system attained tropical depression status before it was last seen east of Nantucket, Massachusetts on September 11. A small area of low pressure formed north of Honduras on September 26 and is surmised to have developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore two days later. In late September, an extratropical cyclone formed along a front west of the Azores. The low detached from the front and acquired either subtropical or fully tropical characteristics on September 27 before it was engulfed by another cold front the following day. Yet another extratropical low formed along a front in the northeastern Atlantic on October 4\\\\. With a broad circulation and minimal temperature gradient, the system may have briefly acquired subtropical qualities on October 7 before it transitioned into an extratropical low again the next day. Finally, on October 19, a closed area of low pressure developed between Miami, Florida and the Bahamas, possibly in connection with a frontal zone. Given the system's compact circulation, it is likely a tropical depression formed and progressed northeast before the low transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the north central Atlantic.

Site of the Scaffold on Tower Hill =Settlement= In one of the oldest parts of London, archaeological evidence shows that there was a settlement on the hill in the Bronze Age and much later a Roman village that was burnt down during the Boudica uprising. A nearby church, All Hallows- by-the-Tower, is known for fragments of Romanesque architecture dating back to AD 680; the church itself dates from 675. =Local government= Great Tower Hill was an extra-parochial area within the Tower Liberty, under the direct administrative control of the Tower of London and outside the jurisdiction of the City of London and the county of Middlesex. In 1855 the area became part of the district of the Metropolitan Board of Works. The \\"District of Tower\\" became part of the Whitechapel District, under the authority of the Whitechapel District Board of Works.

NLB was taken over by RNIB on 1 January 2007 and incorporated into the RNIB National Library Service. RNIB National Library Service History =Origins= The Lending Library for the Blind began its service to readers on Monday, 9 October 1882. The Library was a private charitable venture by Martha Arnold who was blind since childhood. It was accommodated in a small room of her house at 73 Fairfax Road, South Hampstead, London. Carlota Dow was Arnold's first assistant; the two ladies ran the library on a voluntary basis with the assistance of a few friends. Arnold intended that the Library should 'bring solace and light' and that it should help to 'raise the literary standard of the blind'. There were no more than fifty volumes on the shelves when the Library opened its doors to its first ten registered readers. The Library initially opened on Monday afternoons to the blind readers who were in a position to call in person. Parcels of books were sent off to 'country members' on the first and third Mondays of each month. Volumes were issued for four weeks each. The annual subscription for borrowers was 4s. 4d., which was one penny a week, but those 'in better circumstances' were expected to pay half a guinea. During the Library's first five years, the number of readers increased to about one hundred and the stock to 750 volumes (600 in Braille, 130 in Moon type, and 20 in Lucas systems of printing for the blind). Due to needing more space for book-stock, Arnold moved to 28 Boundary Road, in 1886, then to 114 Belsize Road, London, in 1887. The stocks of books in Moon type and Lucas systems had mostly been presented to the Library and some of the Braille books had been purchased on special terms from the Royal National Institute of Blind People which was known as the British and Foreign Blind Society at the time. Much of the Braille had been hand-transcribed by voluntary workers. Arnold transcribed some of the titles and trained some of her friends to write Braille. The Library and the number of its readers grew steadily during the last decade of the nineteenth century. By 1899, it was serving 300 readers with a stock of 3,200 volumes. Approximately 1,500 'boxes, parcels and hampers' were being sent out each year. =Incorporation= Towards the end of Miss Arnold's life, the Library began to experience serious growing pains. After many delays, the Library was registered as the Incorporated National Lending Library for the Blind on 15 September 1898. Mrs Dow was particularly active during this uncomfortable transition period. The annual membership fee charged to blind readers was raised in stages to two guineas. The poorest readers were allowed to pay less -- in the hardest cases very substantially less -- but only after the committee had considered individual applications for remission. The first paid staff were recruited: Miss McLaren as Secretary and Miss Lohr as Librarian. These appointments considerably eased the difficulties of day-to-day routine, but the accommodation problem became steadily acute. By 1904, the stock had grown to nearly 8,000 volumes, with yearly addition of more than 500. The Library moved to new premises -- an adapted shop and basement at 125 Queen's Road, Bayswater -- in September 1904. Miss McLaren and Miss Lohr both retired in the following year. The new officers appointed to replace them proved unsatisfactory, and in 1906, \\"Ethel\\" Winifred Austin took up the new combined post of Secretary and Librarian.K. A. Manley, ‚ÄòAustin, (Ethel) Winifred (1873‚Äì1918)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 10 July 2017 Austin proved to lead arguably the most eventful of the Library's history. Despite postage rates for embossed volumes for the blind being reduced by the Postmaster General in 1906, financial problems continued, and after World War I began, it became very difficult to retain staff. The premises at 125 Queen's Road Bayswater was gradually taken over and, by 1915, the last space in the cellar had been filled with shelving. The former premises of the Royal Architectural Museum, owned by the Architectural Association, in Tufton Street, Westminster were then acquired and remodelled, and the Library moved into its new headquarters in 1916. In 1916 it was not only rehoused; it was declared free for all blind readers. Its change of name to the National Library for the Blind was approved by the Board of Trade, and it obtained exemption from the payment of rates under the Scientific and Literary Societies Act of 1843. Lord Shaw of Dunfermline, Chairman of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, became Chairman of the Library, and Mr H. J. Wilson became Vice-Chairman, Secretary of Gardener's Trust for the Blind. Ethel Austin's earliest proposals of 1911 for the amalgamation of small libraries for the blind into one centralised system proved abortive. She gave talks at national conferences and from 1913 she wrote regularly for Librarian and Book World. By 1917, the Braille collections of the Home Teaching Society, the Girls Friendly Society and the Catholic Trust Society had been taken over. During the same year, the Library of the Manchester and Salford Blind Aid Society was generously presented to the National Library for the Blind and incorporated into NLB as its Northern Branch. =The inter-war period= By 1918, the annual expenditure of the Library had risen to ¬£6,000 and the annual circulation of volumes to nearly 100,000. Approximately eighty public libraries were receiving regular consignments of books, and the first foreign readers were in contact with the Library. Premises were found in Manchester -- in the shape of a forty-year-old fancy goods warehouse -- and these were purchased and adapted. The rebuilding of the Tufton Street portion of the Westminster premises was undertaken in 1935, reflecting a more healthy financial position. The Northern Branch proposal of the same period to move into premises on the fourth floor of the then newly completed Manchester Central Library came to nothing. =World War II= The Library's experience between 1939 and 1945 did not differ significantly from that of other large organisations with buildings in vulnerable areas. The London Headquarters and the Northern Branch buildings both suffered damage through enemy action; the damage in Manchester proved the most severe. The Headquarters basement became a 'day and night' public shelter and a 'roof spotter' watched over the safety of the building. Many members of staff were drafted into the Services and other war-time duties, and replacements were difficult to find. However, the service continued throughout the war years, albeit with severe restrictions in the supply of books to readers overseas. The annual issue of volumes which had reached 350,000 by 1938/39 fell only to 320,000 in 1943/44 and to 311,000 in 1945/46, after which it began again to increase again. =Post-war= During this period, the Library's financial basis was modified and improved and the Library was re-structured. New Articles of Association were written, and a Council instituted as the governing body. Following the report of an Advisory Committee of the Library Association appointed in 1952, the new post of Librarian and Director-General was created. In 1952, Queen Elizabeth II became Patron of the Library. In 1958, work was completed to reconstruct the Northern Branch building to enable it to function effectively as an efficient modern library. The Library's methods were revised and brought up to date. =The Move to Stockport= After a period of relative prosperity, the Library again hit financial problems in the early to mid-1970s as spiralling inflation overtook a fairly static income. As considerable cost savings could be made by combining the Westminster and Manchester operations, it was decided to concentrate operations on one site. On grounds of cost, it was decided the new building should be in the Greater Manchester area. Building a new purpose- built Library was considered but, it was decided that a modern building suitable for conversion should first be sought. A thorough search for suitable buildings was made across Greater Manchester during 1975 and 1976. The Library's essential needs were for warehouse space suitable for conversion into a book-stack providing 20,000 metres of easily accessible shelving and a large circulation and dispatch department, with offices immediately adjoining, all preferably on one floor. A suitable building was found at Bredbury in Stockport. This was approximately ten years old when found and had been the regional headquarters of Armitage Shanks, who no longer required it. The staff and resources of the Northern Branch moved in during January 1978 and those of the Head Office during the following February and March. The move freed up resources, reduced costs and increased efficiency as all the Library's book- stock was now shelved under one roof. Final years The 1980s and 1990s saw the computerisation of Braille production and stock management leading to a more efficient operation. NLB diversified into electronic library services, Giant Print books and other services for visually impaired readers. Membership of NLB continued to be free. The Library's lending stock came to total around 46,000 titles in Braille, Braille music, Moon type and Large Print formats. Typically 170,000 volumes were issued per year, posted out across the UK and overseas. NLB's last Chairman was Dr Gillian A. Burrington, OBE and its final Chief Executive was Helen Brazier. Current status The library services of NLB and RNIB were merged on 1 January 2007 to form the RNIB National Library Service. The merged service is part of RNIB and incorporates all the library services formerly provided by the two organisations. NLB continues to exist only as a 'shell charity' for the purposes of receiving donations and legacies. In November 2012, NLB's Bredbury site was closed and its braille, giant print and Moon books and braille sheet music collections were re-located to the RNIB's Peterborough site. Some former NLB staff were re-located to an office in Stockport town centre where they continue to provide advice and support to readers. The building at Far Cromwell Road, Bredbury, was sold in late 2012 to an online retailer to serve as their office/warehouse facility.

It examined government revenue, spending and the level of Greek government borrowing. Background Within the European Union, entry into the Eurozone depends on the applicant nation meeting certain economic criteria. Measures such as budget deficits and public debt levels are assessed, as well as the inflation situation and the stability of the national currency exchange rate of a European Union member state. Requirements include a budget deficit below 3% of gross domestic product (GDP), and debt below 60% of GDP, or if above, declining. Up until 1994, Greece recorded very high deficits, for some years above 10% of GDP. During the late nineties, according to the figures submitted by the Greek government to the European Union, Greece's high budget deficits were significantly lowered. In 2000, given a deficit below 3% of GDP in 1999, Greece was accepted as the 12th member of the European monetary union. =Eurostat refusal to validate Greek figures= In March 2002, Eurostat refused to validate data transmitted by the Greek government. In reaction, the NSSG (National Statistical Service of Greece) revised the debt level by several percentage points. In September 2002, Eurostat again refused to validate the data. The debt was revised upwards once again, and the government balance, which the Greek government had presented as a surplus, became a deficit. In March 2004, Eurostat refused again to validate the Greek numbers. That was shortly before Greek elections, and a new government by New Democracy was inaugurated. After the March 7 elections, the new government said that it would start an objective financial audit of the government accounts. George Papandreou, of Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), the main opposition at that time, and the other two smaller parties initially agreed with the need for an audit. The agreement lasted a very short time, and outside auditing firms and the central bank were not asked to carry out such an audit. New government audit Instead, the government produced new estimates while it investigated the years 1997 to 2003, and the resulting data was given to Eurostat, which then went on and published a report. The requirement that the 1999 budget deficit should have been below 3% of GDP was one of the key criteria for Eurozone entry. Its revision to 3.07%, according to Eurostat (AMECO), led to a controversy about Greece's admission. In the 2005 OECD report for Greece (p. 47) it was clearly stated that \\"the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of GDP; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3% in 1999, the year of EMU membership qualification\\". The above has led the Greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3% limit when it was calculated with the ESA79 methodology in force at the time of Greece's application. Since the remaining criteria had also been met, was properly accepted into the Eurozone. ESA79 was also the methodology employed to calculate the deficits of all other Eurozone members at the time of their applications. The original accounting practice for military expenses was later restored in line with Eurostat recommendations, theoretically lowering even the ESA95-calculated 1999 Greek budget deficit to below 3% (an official Eurostat calculation is still pending for 1999). An error frequently made in press reports is the confusion of the discussion regarding Greece's Eurozone entry with the controversy regarding usage of derivatives‚Äô deals with US banks by Greece and other Eurozone countries to hide their reported budget deficits. A currency swap arranged with Goldman Sachs allowed Greece to 'hide' 2.8 billion euros of debt, but that affected deficit values after 2001 (when Greece had already been admitted into the Eurozone) and is not related to Greece's Eurozone entry. =Implications= Several arguments have been expressed about the implications of the audit. Some commentators talked about data falsification. Others held a completely different viewpoint. \\"Irregularities\\" (the word falsification never officially used) in deficit reporting were also revealed for other Eurozone members, most notably Italy and Portugal, with significant revisions imposed. Also, there were arguments about massive \\"creative accounting\\" employed by many states in order to meet the deficit criterion for entry into the Eurozone. Even the practice of one- off measures by so many states has been criticised since in several cases their deficits rose back over 3% soon after the reference year, however larger economies such as Germany and France seem to defy the rules for years. Last but not least, changes in accounting method often seriously affected the deficit numbers (Spain and Portugal had, like Greece, marginally exceeded 3% in their reference year for entry, when their deficit was revised according to ESA95). It was argued that New Democracy government simply miscalculated the consequences of its actions, which brought a strong reaction by Eurostat, stronger than that for other violators.  Public finance consequences  As a result of the financial audit, Greece fell in the list of the loan creditability and paid more interest on its loans compared with other EU countries. EU Commission warned Greece about future problems if Greece, now with the new data, does not comply with the Eurozone requirements. Domestic political consequences New Democracy's government accused PASOK, and Costas Simitis, the prime minister and president of PASOK at that time, of having falsified Greece's macroeconomic statistics, on the basis of which the European institutions accepted Greece to join the Eurozone. All the opposition parties accused New Democracy's government of making a false audit. PASOK said that it never falsified any data, and that New Democracy's government just changed the way costs (mostly military expenses) were accounted for through the years and some other accounting techniques, and the way PASOK used to do it was known to the Eurostat, which never opposed it. Costas Simitis wrote in the Financial Times that Greece's deficit revision damaged the EU: \\"The Commission must design an auditing system that is the same for all EU countries and guarantees objectivity and impartiality, while ruling out domestic political interference\\". Some days later, the same newspaper published a Letter to the Editor by the Director General of Eurostat acknowledged the need for monitoring and review of government accounts independent of political cycles, outlining the changes made but taking issue with the portrayal of the Greek account revisions. In March 2006, Eurostat made changes to the system of defense expenditure calculation, which seemed to legitimize some of the practices of the previous Costas Simitis government of PASOK. This caused criticism of the Financial Audit of 2004 and the New Democracy government by PASOK and parts of the press. New Democracy responded that the defense expenditures covered by the 2006 changes constituted only a small part of much more substantial expenditures that were fraudulently concealed by the previous PASOK government.

It used the same setting which includes time-traveling historians she explored in her story Fire Watch and novels Doomsday Book (1992) and Blackout/All Clear (2010). To Say Nothing of the Dog won both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1999, and was nominated for the Nebula Award in 1998. Source of title The book's title is inspired by the subtitle of an 1889 classic work, as explained by the author in the dedication: \\"To Robert A. Heinlein, who, in Have Space Suit‚ÄîWill Travel, first introduced me to Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat, To Say Nothing of the Dog.\\" Plot Ned Henry is a time traveler in 1940 studying Coventry Cathedral after the Coventry Blitz of World War II. He is specifically searching for the location of the \\"Bishop's bird stump\\", a MacGuffin that is not defined by the narrator. The narrator shows confusion explained by \\"time- lag\\", the time-travel-induced form of jet lag. He returns unsuccessfully to his time, 2057, at Oxford University. The Bishop's bird stump is needed for a restoration of the cathedral funded by Lady Schrapnell, a wealthy American neo-aristocratic woman with a will of iron. She has conscripted most of Oxford's history department to rebuild the cathedral exactly as it was before it was destroyed. Before going on further trips Ned must recuperate from his time lag and is sent to the hospital. Mrs. Schrapnell, however insists he go back on another trip. Before he can be conscripted by Schrapnell, Professor Dunworthy (who is in charge of the time machine) decides to send him back to the Victorian Era, specifically 1888, for his rest. Dunworthy has an ulterior motive in sending him to 1888 as another time traveler appears to have violated the laws of the continuum by bringing an object back from then to 2057. Theoretically, nothing may be brought through the time machine in either direction as it might cause time to unravel, and safeguards have been put in place in order to prevent significant objects making the journey. The historians and scientists who invented the time machine believe the object may rip time itself apart if it isn't promptly returned. Ned, who only knows 20th century history, and still suffering from time lag, is given a crash course on Victorian times while simultaneously being told his mission and destination. The combination of muddled lessons, imprecise instructions, and the jump to 1888 worsening the time lag leaves him confused about where he is supposed to be, who he should meet, where he should go, and no idea at all about the out- of-time object he is carrying. Time travel has a self-correcting mechanism called slippage, moving time travelers either in time or place from their target in order to protect history. Ned arrives at the correct time, but unknown to him, he is not at the estate where another time traveler should meet him. Instead, he has slipped in destination to a railway station 30 miles away. He meets Terence St. Trewes, a besotted young Oxford undergraduate, mistaking him for his time travel contact. He agrees to share the cost of a hired boat for a trip on the River Thames from Oxford down to Muchings End, where Terence hopes to meet his love, Tocelyn \\"Tossie\\" Mering. Ned, Terence, Cyril the bulldog and Professor Peddick (an Oxford don) travel down the Thames navigating locks, beautiful scenery, crowds of languid boaters in no hurry to get anywhere, and the party of Jerome K. Jerome, a homage to the original novel from which To Say Nothing of the Dog draws its name and themes. Fortunately, Ned's contact in Muchings End recognizes him when he arrives and identifies herself: she is a young woman named Verity Kindle, who is pretending to be Tossie's cousin. Lady Schrapnell sent Verity to read Tossie's diary because Tossie (an ancestor of Lady Schrapnell) had written about a life-changing event involving the bird stump at the first Coventry Cathedral (St Michael's Cathedral), an event which had caused her to elope with a mysterious \\"Mr. C\\" to America. It is only at this point that Ned learns the nature of the object he is to return: Tossie's pet cat, Princess Arjumand. (Cats are extinct in 2057 due to a feline distemper pandemic.) Ned and Verity continually attempt to fix the time travel incongruity. They must know the histories of the characters around them, and their descendants impact on future history, and also the mystery of Mr. C. Their interloping attempts to fix the known history of the people around them cause ripple effects forward and backward through history from Waterloo to World War II, and even to 2018 (when time travel was invented). After several adventures attempting to correct things themselves, both end up, mistakenly, in different eras attempting to get back to 2057. In their absence, time itself corrects their meddling. On their return to 1888, Mr C has been identified, interrupted relationships between characters have occurred, and clues throughout their experience reveal the location of the Bishop's bird stump in 2057. Finally, in 2057, just in time for the celebration of the cathedral reconstruction, the location of the Bishop's bird stump proves to the historians and scientists that, in certain scenarios, objects can be brought forward in time which heralds a renaissance in recovery of historically lost, destroyed, or extinct objects. Characters * Ned Henry, 21st-century historian, assigned by Lady Schrapnell to search for the \\"bishop's bird stump\\" by all possible means. This includes attending every jumble sale held in Coventry in 1940. * Verity Kindle, another historian, who specializes in 1930s detective fiction. She masquerades as Verity Brown, a distant niece of Colonel and Mrs. Mering, in order to find and read their daughter's diary. By virtue of a time slippage, she brings something back to 2057, beginning the whole cascade of events. * Professor James Dunworthy, a historian who has been associated with the Time Travel program from the beginning. He also appears in the story \\"Fire Watch\\" and the novels Doomsday Book and Blackout/All Clear. * Finch, Dunworthy's clever and efficient secretary. He eventually joins the other time travelers in 1888, masquerading as the butler at the estate of the Chattisbournes, who are neighbours of the Merings. He finds the role easy to play, as he excels at organization and service. * Tocelyn \\"Tossie\\" Mering, a beautiful and intelligent \\"rose of England\\" who, through the influence of her parents, is flighty, spoiled, and ignorant. She is Lady Shrapnell's ancestor. It is her memoirs, and her account of having her life changed when she visited St. Michael's Church in Coventry, which later became Coventry Cathedral, which inspired Lady Shrapnell to begin the reconstruction. * Colonel and Mrs. Mering. The Colonel is retired from the Indian Army and now devotes his time to collecting exotic goldfish. Mrs. Mering is a hypochondriac and a fan of spiritualism. The novel credits her with inventing the \\"jumble sale\\", that is, a charity bazaar where people donate unwanted household items, instead of donating items they have made, such as cakes, scones, craft items, etc. * Terence St. Trewes, a young Oxford undergraduate whom Ned meets when he first arrives in 1888. Despite his not having any money about him, Terence is in fact a minor aristocrat and will have a considerable income, making him perfect for Tossie in the eyes of her parents. * Professor Peddick, an Oxford don, Terence's personal tutor, who accompanies Terence and Ned on their trip downriver. Professor Peddick is an authority on both exotic fish and military history - which instantly endears him to Colonel Mering, and secures the trio an invitation to stay in the Merings' house - and an outspoken defender of the Great Man Theory of history. * Professor Overforce, another Oxford don, and Professor Peddick's rival for a prestigious chair. Professor Overforce does not appear in person, but is frequently mentioned as an advocate of the Social Darwinism view of history. * Baine, the Merings' butler. It is revealed later that \\"Baine\\" is merely a nom de m√©tier he was given when working for the Merings' neighbours. According to the book, employers routinely give their servants pseudonyms for various reasons. Mrs. Chattisborne calls all her maids by the same name so as not to have to learn new ones. Mrs. Mering believes it is more refined to have English rather than Irish servants. She also uses the name \\"Jane\\" to refer to a maid named \\"Colleen.\\" Baine previously worked for the Irish peer Lord DunsanySince the literary Lord Dunsany would have been only 10 years old in 1888, Baine was most likely employed by his grandfather, the 16th Baron Dunsany - see Baron of Dunsany ¬ß Barons of Dunsany (1439) under his real name, but Mrs. Mering will not have it used in her house. Baine is like P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves, in that he is very intelligent (much more so than his employers), well-read (he reads Thomas Paine while awaiting orders) and incredibly efficient, ministering to his employers' every need, and even anticipating them. * T.J. Lewis, an undergraduate student in computer science. Since he is black, he cannot be sent back in time by Lady Schrapnell, which is fortunate because he is needed to run simulations in an attempt to discover how bad the disruption of the space-time continuum might be. * Lady Schrapnell, a rich American with a will of iron and a voice that can overcome any opposition. She has married into the Shrapnell title and is obsessed with rebuilding Coventry Cathedral exactly as it was the day before it was destroyed, in honour of her ancestor Tocelyn Mering. Everything must be completely correct, as \\"God is in the details\\". This includes the \\"bishop's bird stump\\", which was thought to be completely indestructible yet disappeared the night of the air raid. * Elizabeth Bittner, widow of the last Bishop of Coventry. Old and infirm in the 2050s, she was one of the pioneers of time travel in the early 21st century. She was also a great beauty who entranced men, including Dunworthy. Ned compares her to the fictional Zuleika Dobson for her effect on her fellow Oxonians. * Princess Arjumand, Tossie's pet cat, named after Mumtaz Mahal, whose rescue from drowning almost destroys the space-time continuum. Plays a major role throughout the narrative. * Cyril, Terence's pet bulldog. Plays a major role throughout the narrative.

History In 1997, McColgan left Dropkick Murphys \\"to pursue a lifelong dream of becoming a firefighter for the Boston Fire Department.\\" In 2002, McColgan decided he could no longer stay away from music and formed Street Dogs. They first recorded a seven song-demo, which feature McColgan along with his former Dropkick Murphys bandmate Jeff Erna on drums, Rob Guidotti on guitar and Bill Close on bass. They signed with CrossCheck Records in 2003, with Michelle Paulhus now on bass. By the time they started recording their first album, they yet again had someone else on bass, this time Johnny Rioux. Savin Hill (which was produced by former The Mighty Mighty Bosstones member Nate Albert and featured guest appearances by Al Barr and Ken Casey from Dropkick Murphys) was a success and resulted in a supporting tour with Celtic punk band Flogging Molly. The band underwent a complete shuffle in 2004 when McColgan took a leave of absence from his firefighting career to devote time to recording and promoting their second album Back to the World.The Street Dogs at this time enlisted Marcus Hollar on lead guitar, and expanded the range of their sound with the addition of rhythm guitarist Tobe Bean III. The drummer's spot was filled by Joe Sirois, formerly of The Mighty Mighty Bosstones. Their second release, Back to the World, proved to be even more of a success for the band. It was hailed critically in the United States, Europe and Japan and opened the doors to touring with the notable likes of Social Distortion, Tiger Army, Bad Religion, Millencolin (in Europe), The Bouncing Souls (US And Japan) and The Briefs. The band also toured on the Vans Warped Tour in the summer of 2005 and embarked on their first headlining tours in the US and Europe. 2006 saw more shows, both headlining and opening for the likes of Rancid, The Adolescents and The Bouncing Souls. Also in 2006, released their third album, Fading American Dream. It was recorded earlier in the year with producer Ted Hutt (Flogging Molly, Madcap, The Bouncing Souls). While on tour opening for Flogging Molly on February 27, 2007 show at the Sokol Auditorium in Omaha, NE, bass player Johnny Rioux collapsed on stage due to an apparent seizure. McColgan stopped the show and called for paramedics. At the start of the Flogging Molly set, lead singer Dave King dedicated the show to Johnny and announced that he was all right and would be well enough to play the next night in St. Louis. Following that tour, more dates came headlining as well as European shows. In February 2008, it was announced that the Street Dogs signed on to Hellcat Records. Their fourth album, State of Grace, for Hellcat, which they started recording in early February 2008, once again with Ted Hutt was released on July 8, 2008. At recent shows, Street Dogs have been promoting Oxfam America, a humanitarian organization fighting poverty and hunger. McColgan spoke to the crowd mid-set at the Bamboozle Festival in New Jersey in May 2008 about the organization while wearing an Oxfam T-shirt. In support of State of Grace, the band toured at the Vans Warped Tour 2008 as a main stage act. Following their Warped tour stint, the group set out on their successful fall State Of Grace headlining tour and then went to Europe for the European Eastpak Antidote tour. The band released their fifth album, Street Dogs, on August 31, 2010 on Hellcat Records. On February 21, 2011, the band performed at an acoustic show with Tom Morello, Tim McIlrath, Wayne Kramer, and Ike Reilly in Madison, WI in support of the ongoing protests against Gov. Scott Walker's proposed Budget Repair Bill. The Street Dogs announced in March that they will be doing a five-week stint on the 2011 Vans Warped Tour, from June 24 until July 30. This will be their third time on the tour, after 2005 and 2008. Street Dogs will follow Warped with a European festival tour in August, and then Australia and Japan in October. The band embarked on the nine date Sham Rock-N-Roll Festival in September 2011 where they were the co-headlining act for the Dropkick Murphys. Other than appearances on various Warped Tour lineups, this was the first time McColgan toured with his former band since quitting thirteen years earlier. McColgan would even join the Dropkick Murphys onstage for performances of such songs as \\"Barroom Hero\\" and \\"Far Away Coast\\" from the Do or Die album. In an interview with AMP, Johnny Rioux was asked about a new album from the street dogs. Rioux said, \\"We want to do a labor standard solo record with Mike, release the large number of B-sides with the records they were recorded for, mix our live in Boston DVD and record, prepare for our first trip to Australia, return to Japan, get back into some Celtic festivals, and just be happy and grateful people are still loyal after almost 10 years.\\" On November 26, 2012, McColgan wrote on the band's Facebook account that starting January 1, 2013, Street Dogs will be taking a break from recording and touring, but he assured fans that the band is not breaking up. Later that day, Tobe Bean announced that he would no longer be a touring member of Street Dogs, but he will \\"always be a Street Dog\\". In February 2013, it was announced that McColgan and Rioux would form a side project with original Dropkick Murphys member Rick Barton called FM359. In March, it was announced their break from touring would be ending in July when they tour Europe. In March, McColgan mentioned that the band will exclusively work with the Pirates Press Records label in the future, and they planned to release a 7-inch single, a live album, and a DVD. He also mentioned that the band is hoping to get Lenny Lashley from Darkbuster to replace Bean on guitar and on April 9 via Street Dogs Facebook page it was formally announced that Lenny Lashley had officially joined The Street Dogs. Also the previously mentioned single will be \\"Crooked Drunken Sons\\", a song named after their annual tour, which will be released on Record Store Day 2013. Another single, \\"Rustbelt Nation\\", followed a month later. Later in the year, Hollar was replaced by Matt Pruitt (Have Nots). Members Mike McColgan, Johnny Rioux and Pete Sosa started a side project called FM359 with former Dropkick Murphys guitarist Rick Barton, Street Dogs collaborator Hugh Morrison and Halston Luna. The group, which has an americana sound, released their debut album Truth, Love and Liberty in January 2014. In April, on Record Store Day 2014, they released a split EP with Noi!se. On June 22 2018, the band released their sixth album and first in eight years, Stand For Something Or Die For Nothing. McColgan said of the album, \\" ‚ÄúThe dumbing down of America is a reason to write songs in 2018. The theme is wake the fuck up and the working class needs to unite across all colors, creeds, nationalities, genders and realize that we are being pitted against each other by snake oil salesmen and autocrats.‚Äù On February 13, 2020, via the band's Facebook page, McColgan and Rioux announced the band was disbanding after 17 years. The final round of shows will include a small St. Patricks day tour with Flogging Molly and Mad Caddies as well as two headlining shows, one in Long Beach, CA on March 16, and their final show to be announced in their hometown of Boston, MA.

The Canadian government has said that the mission was completed on July 2005, although only 50,000 soldiers have been captured and integrated into civilian life. There are still an estimated 40,000 soldiers who are loyal to Mohammed Fahim.

On 4 July 2004 disarmament began in Bamiyan, and on 15 July 2004 disarmament was continuing in Bamiyan including soldiers from the 34th and 35th Divisions of the then Afghan Army, often referred to as the Afghan Military or Militia Forces. The deputy chairman of the commission responsible for the disarmament program is Afghan Urban Development Minister Yousuf Pushtun. The senior DDR advisor from the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) is Sultan Aziz.

The Weddell seal was discovered and named in the 1820s during expeditions led by British sealing captain James Weddell to the area of the Southern Ocean now known as the Weddell Sea. The life history of this species is well documented since it occupies fast ice environments close to the Antarctic continent and often adjacent to Antarctic bases. Description Weddell seals measure about 2.5‚Äì3.5 m (8 ft 2 in‚Äì11 ft 6 in) long and weigh 400‚Äì600 kg (880‚Äì1,320 lb). They are amongst the largest seals, with a rather bulky body and short fore flippers relative to their body length. Males weigh less than females, usually about 500 kg (1,100 lb) or less. Male and female Weddell seals are generally about the same length, though females can be slightly larger. However, the male seal tends to have a thicker neck and a broader head and muzzle than the female. A molecular genetic based technique has been established to confirm the sex of individuals in the laboratory. The Weddell seal face has been compared to that of a cat due to a short mouth line and similarities in the structure of the nose and whiskers. At the Neko Harbour, Antarctica The Weddell seal grows a thin fur coat around its whole body except for small areas around the flippers. The colour and pattern of the coat varies, often fading to a duller colour as the seal ages. This coat moults around the beginning of summer. Adults show a counter-shaded coloration that varies from bluish-black to dark gray dorsally and to light gray/silver ventrally. Coats may change to shades of brown before the annual molt. Adult males usually bear scars, most of them around the genital region. Weddell seal pups are born with a lanugo of similar coloration and they moult after 3‚Äì4 weeks; later, they turn a darker color similar to that of adults. The pups are around half the length of their mother at birth, and weigh 25‚Äì30 kg (55‚Äì66 lb). They gain around 2 kg (4.4 lb) a day, and by 6‚Äì7 weeks old they can weigh around 100 kg (220 lb). Behavior =Movements= Video of a reclining Weddell seal on pack ice in Ad√©lie Land A Weddell seal at a breathing hole Weddell seals are commonly found on fast ice, or ice fastened to land, and gather in small groups around cracks and holes within the ice. In the winter, they stay in the water to avoid blizzards, with only their heads poking through breathing holes in the ice. These seals are often observed lying on their sides when on land. Weddell seals are non-migratory phocids that move regionally to follow the distribution of breathing holes and exit cracks within the ice changes between seasons. The species is primarily restricted to Antarctic waters: physical factors, such as glacial movement and tidal action, may increase fluctuations in distributions. =Foraging= Weddell seals dive to forage for food, maintain breathing holes in fast ice, and explore to find more ice holes. They have been observed to dive as deep as 600 m for up to an hour. These seals exhibit a diel dive pattern, diving deeper and longer during the day than at night. After dropping away from a breathing hole in the ice, the seals become negatively buoyant in the first 30 to 50 m, allowing them to dive with little effort. Weddell seals are top predators in the Antarctic. They eat an array of fish, bottom-feeding prawns, cephalopods and crustaceans. A sedentary adult eats around 10 kg (22 lb) a day, while an active adult eats over 50 kg (110 lb) a day. Antarctic cod and silverfish constitute the majority of their diet. Cephalopods are common prey, and crustacean remains are sometimes found in Weddell seal scat, but at much lower rates than other prey species. They are opportunistic feeders that hunt in different parts of the water column depending on prey availability. Weddell seals hunt in both pelagic and benthic-demersal habitats. Although seabirds are not usually part of their diet, there have been several sightings of them chasing and killing penguins in the wild. Other Antarctic phocids are known to be seabird predators, resulting in implications that penguin hunting is a learned behavior. There are recordings of four different penguin species being attacked by Weddell seals: gentoo penguins, an emperor penguin, an Ad√©lie penguin, and a chinstrap penguin. It has not been confirmed, however, if the penguins were consumed after being killed. Scientists believe Weddell seals rely mainly on eyesight to hunt for food when there is light. However, during the Antarctic winter darkness, when there is no light under the ice where the seals forage, they rely on other senses, primarily the sense of touch from their vibrissae or whiskers, which are not just hairs, but very complicated sense organs with more than 500 nerve endings that attach to the animal's snout. The hairs allow the seals to detect the wake of swimming fish and use that to capture prey. Weddell seals have no natural predators when on fast ice. At sea or on pack ice, they are prey for killer whales and leopard seals, which prey primarily on juveniles and pups. =Breeding= Weddell seals return to fast ice colonies during the spring for birthing and breeding. Weddell seal populations will often return to the same breeding sites over consecutive breeding seasons. Depending on the latitude it inhabits, this marine mammal gives birth from early September through November, with those living at lower latitudes giving birth earlier. Weddell seals usually give birth to one pup per year, however the Weddell seal is one of the only species of seals that can give birth to twin pups. Birth of the pup only takes around one to four minutes. Newborn pups weigh about 25‚Äì30 kg and grow to two times their weight within their first week of life. The pups take their first swim around one to two weeks of age. During the first two weeks mother Weddell seals distinguish their pups through olfactory smells, specialized vocalizations, and stay in the same spatial area. After six to seven weeks, pups are weaned and begin to hunt independently. Weddell seal pup with its grey natal coat, Deception Island Baby Weddell seal Weddell seals show moderate polygyny and genetic analyses of mating success have suggested how factors such as size, diving ability, site-specific experience enhances success in male Weddell seals. Additionally, fast ice breeding grounds causes females to cluster in large aggregations, making it easier for males to take control over his own harem. The mating season occurs during austral spring between late November and December after pups are weaned and females begin ovulating. During the mating season, Weddell seals make noises loud enough to be felt through the ice. Males defend underwater territories during the breeding season and have been observed to fight. Copulation has only been observed to occur under water, where the female submits to the male as he approaches her dorsal side. The female is often bitten on the neck by her partner if she tries to escape or terminate copulation. The seals are normally around six to eight years old when they first breed, but this can be much earlier for some females. Weddell seals undergo delayed implantation. The embryo is not embedded into the uterus until the beginning of austral summer, between mid-January and mid-February, allowing for birth under more favorable environmental conditions. Juvenile Weddell seals (0‚Äì2 years old) have a high mortality probability, whereas no differences can be found between the mortality rate of animals older than 2 years and that of adults (Hastings et al., 1999). Maximum lifespan of the species is estimated at least 25 years. =Vocalization= Male and female Weddell seals communicate through a variety of sounds, specifically males sometimes use ‚Äútrills‚Äù to communicate. Weddell seals are also able to communicate to each other through different mediums. Weddell seals on ice are able to hear the calls of Weddell seals in the water as long as noise level on land is low and they are in close proximity of one another. Sound waves can be transmitted either through the ice itself or from water to breathing holes where female Weddell seals are usually breeding. There have been recordings of Weddell seal vocalizations that are described as songs. Their songs consist of repetitive sequences of the same vocal elements, and they only vary slightly over time. Individual Weddell seals can each produce their own unique song, but singing behavior is not common when observed. Vocalizations are also important in mother-pup Weddell seal interactions. Mother Weddell seals use vocalizations to call their pups from further distances when smell can no longer be used efficiently (Opzeeland et al., 2011). Pups also use higher, more urgent vocalizations when hungry to alert their mothers to feed. Taxonomy Rice noted that the scientific name was misspelled in the past as L. weddelli and this synonym is no longer accepted, although it is still found commonly in the scientific literature prior to 1988. Weddell seals can be confused with other two phocids that share the same range: Ross seal (Ommatophoca rossii) and crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophagus). Population status Weddell seals are the second most abundant species of Antarctic phocid, after the crabeater seal. The best available estimate suggests that the species greatly exceeds 1,000,000 individuals, which was considered the upper limit from previous estimations although there is large uncertainty in these figures. Because of their widespread distribution, population assessments are difficult and expensive to conduct, and are therefore infrequently undertaken. Threats During the early periods of Antarctic exploration, Weddell seals suffered dramatic declines as they were hunted for food and oil. Populations have since recovered after the elimination of commercial sealing in the 1980s. However, the effects of global climate change on Antarctic seals are still to be fully determined. Research estimates seal populations may decline as the availability of their habitat is extremely temperature sensitive thus making them potentially vulnerable. Climate changes affecting the duration and the extent of the sea ice and nutrients availability could potentially reduce pups‚Äô survival and may have important implications for population growth rates. The fact that some populations breed on land (e.g., at South Georgia), could demonstrate an ability in the species to colonize different environments, although the extent of such plasticity is uncertain. In the past, the establishment of Antarctic research bases has caused a measure of disturbance to these seals. In January 1998 the Environmental Protection Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty was ratified, implementing environmental measures such as the banning of mining and oil drilling in Antarctica for at least 50 years, along with the banning of refuse disposal and the use of pesticides in the region. However, the disturbance effects of the increasing seasonal tourism in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic on Weddell seal behavior, distribution, and foraging are still unknown. Currently there are no reports of significant fisheries interactions. Although, the development of new fisheries in Antarctic waters, particularly one targeting the Antarctic toothfish, could have an impact on Weddell seal nutrition, and potential operational interactions should be considered in the management plans. Conservation status The Weddell seal is protected by the Antarctic Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS). It is classified as being of \\"least concern\\" by the IUCN. This species is not listed by CITES.

He travelled to Afghanistan and Punjab and served in various military positions in the region. Details of his life remain obscure, though several colourful accounts have been written. Although corroborating evidence is sparse, Scottish historian John Keay wrote biographies in 1977, 1979, and, most thoroughly, The Tartan Turban: In Search of Alexander Gardner, in 2017.https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/05/the-fantastic-adventures-of-the- tartan-turbaned-colonel/ Biography By Gardner's own accounts he was born in Wisconsin to a Scottish father and Anglo-Spanish mother. Baron von H√ºgel met Gardner in 1835 and claimed he was Irish, but supporting evidence for this is lacking. Gardner went to Ireland in about 1809. He returned to America in 1812, but finding his father dead sailed for Europe and never went back to America. From Europe he traveled to Astrakhan where his brother was working. Upon his brother's death in 1817 Gardner tried to secure a position in the Russian Army. When that failed he left Russia and spent the next 13 years wandering through Central Asia. In 1823 he was captured in Afghanistan by Habib Ullah Khan, the nephew of Dost Mohammed Khan. Habib Ullah was fighting his uncle for the throne of Kabul, and he recruited Gardner to his cause as the commander of 180 horsemen. After an attack on a pilgrim caravan Gardner married one of the captives, a native woman, and went to live in a fort near Parwan where a son was born. When Habib Ullah was defeated in 1826, Gardner's wife and his baby boy were murdered by Dost Mahommed's forces. Later that year Gardner fled north with a few companions and near the River Oxus his party was attacked by fifty horsemen: they lost eight out of their thirteen men and the survivors were all wounded but able to escape. Their route now lay towards Badakhshan and the valley of the Kokcha; the Oxus was finally crossed opposite the Shakhdara to reach the valley of Shignan. From this point his narrative is fragmentary and difficult to understand, large parts being highly improbable or impossible. He claimed to have reached Yarkand on 24 September but the year is uncertain, either 1827, 1828 or 1829 are possible, certainly he was there by 1830. He returned to Afghanistan, and visited Kafiristan, possibly the first westerner to do so. In August 1831 he left Afghanistan as an outlaw for the Punjab, where he was appointed Commandant of Artillery. He served in this position for many years before he was transferred to the service of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, where he was one of between 32 and 100 Western soldiers in Ranjit's army.Heath, Ian & Perry, Michael (2005) The Sikh Army 1799‚Äì1849 p. 10, Osprey Publishing, He was later promoted to the rank of colonel by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. He remained in the Sikh army after Ranjit Singh's death in 1839, til the First Anglo-Sikh War. Gardner was involved in numerous gun and sword fights during his career. He was described as being six-foot, with a long beard, an all around warrior and fighter. Gardner was known to have saved the City of Lahore in 1841 when his comrades abandoned him and he fired the guns that killed 300 enemies. Gardner remained in the service of the Maharajas as they came and went, and witnessed the fall of the Punjab as a sovereign kingdom. This he vividly described in his book on the Fall of the Sikh Empire.Gardner, Alexander (1999), Eye Witness Account of the Fall of Sikh Empire; editor, Baldev Singh Baddan. Delhi: National Book Shop He is described as continuing to suffer the effects of fourteen wounds in later life. He is supposed to have been difficult to understand due \\"variously to his lack of teeth, his liking for alcohol, his considerable age or the sing- song lilt of his rusty English; it could equally have been caused by the gash in his throat which was the most obvious of his many wounds and which obliged him to clamp a pair of forceps to his neck whenever he ate or drank.\\" Gardner kept a journal, much of which was lost. Extracts were published in 1853, and attracted controversy. His exploits were so bizarre that the geographer Sir Henry Yule disbelieved them. In later life, Gardner related his adventures to several prospective biographers, and after his death the surviving material was published in Soldier and Traveller: memoirs of Alexander Gardner; edited by Major Hugh Pearse.A summary of 'Soldier and Traveller: memoirs of Alexander Gardner by Mike Leahan Gardner appears as a major supporting character in the novel Flashman and the Mountain of Light. Parts of his journey are added into The Man Who Would Be King, particularly his visit to Kafiristan.

They were once considered protozoans or protists, but are now known to be fungi, or a sister group to fungi. Loosely 1500 of the probably more than one million species are named. Microsporidia are restricted to animal hosts, and all major groups of animals host microsporidia. Most infect insects, but they are also responsible for common diseases of crustaceans and fish. The named species of microsporidia usually infect one host species or a group of closely related taxa. Approximately 10 percent of the species are parasites of vertebrates ‚Äîseveral species, most of which are opportunistic, can infect humans, in whom they can cause microsporidiosis. After infection they influence their hosts in various ways and all organs and tissues are invaded, though generally by different species of microsporidia. Some species are lethal, and a few are used in biological control of insect pests. Parasitic castration, gigantism, or change of host sex are all potential effects of microsporidian parasitism (in insects). In the most advanced cases of parasitism the microsporidium rules the host cell completely and controls its metabolism and reproduction, forming a xenoma.Ronny Larsson, Lund University (Department of Cell and Organism Biology) Cytology and taxonomy of the microsporidia 2004. Replication takes place within the host's cells, which are infected by means of unicellular spores. These vary from 1‚Äì40 Œºm, making them some of the smallest eukaryotes. Microsporidia that infect mammals are 1.0‚Äì4.0 Œºm. They also have the smallest eukaryotic genomes. The terms \\"microsporidium\\" (pl. \\"microsporidia\\") and \\"microsporidian\\" are used as vernacular names for members of the group. The name Microsporidium Balbiani, 1884Balbiani, G. 1884.

Xenoma on flatfish caused by Glugea stephani  Morphology  Dictyocoela diporeiae. A, meront and spore; B, spore wall; C, polar filament Microsporidia lack mitochondria, instead possessing mitosomes. They also lack motile structures, such as flagella. Microsporidia produce highly resistant spores, capable of surviving outside their host for up to several years. Spore morphology is useful in distinguishing between different species. Spores of most species are oval or pyriform, but rod-shaped or spherical spores are not unusual. A few genera produce spores of unique shape for the genus. The spore is protected by a wall, consisting of three layers: *an outer electron-dense exospore *a median, wide and seemingly structureless endospore, containing chitin *a thin internal plasma membrane In most cases there are two closely associated nuclei, forming a diplokaryon, but sometimes there is only one. The anterior half of the spore contains a harpoon-like apparatus with a long, thread-like polar filament, which is coiled up in the posterior half of the spore. The anterior part of the polar filament is surrounded by a polaroplast, a lamella of membranes. Behind the polar filament, there is a posterior vacuole.  Infection  In the gut of the host the spore germinates, it builds up osmotic pressure until its rigid wall ruptures at its thinnest point at the apex. The posterior vacuole swells, forcing the polar filament to rapidly eject the infectious content into the cytoplasm of the potential host. Simultaneously the material of the filament is rearranged to form a tube which functions as a hypodermic needle and penetrates the gut epithelium. Once inside the host cell, a sporoplasm grows, dividing or forming a multinucleate plasmodium, before producing new spores. The life cycle varies considerably. Some have a simple asexual life cycle, while others have a complex life cycle involving multiple hosts and both asexual and sexual reproduction. Different types of spores may be produced at different stages, probably with different functions including autoinfection (transmission within a single host).  Medical implications  In animals and humans, microsporidia often cause chronic, debilitating diseases rather than lethal infections. Effects on the host include reduced longevity, fertility, weight, and general vigor. Vertical transmission of microsporidia is frequently reported. In the case of insect hosts, vertical transmission often occurs as transovarial transmission, where the microsporidian parasites pass from the ovaries of the female host into eggs and eventually multiply in the infected larvae. Amblyospora salinaria n. sp. which infects the mosquito Culex salinarius Coquillett, and Amblyospora californica which infects the mosquito Culex tarsalis Coquillett, provide typical examples of transovarial transmission of microsporidia. Microsporidia, specifically the mosquito-infecting Vavraia culicis, are being explored as a possible 'evolution-proof' malaria-control method. Microsporidian infection of Anopheles gambiae (the principal vector of Plasmodium falciparum malaria) reduces malarial infection within the mosquito, and shortens the mosquito lifespan. As the majority of malaria-infected mosquitoes naturally die before the malaria parasite is mature enough to transmit, any increase in mosquito mortality through microsporidian-infection may reduce malaria transmission to humans. In May 2020, researchers reported that Microsporidia MB, a symbiont in the midgut and ovaries of An. arabiensis, significantly impaired transmisison of P. falciparum, had \\"no overt effect\\" on the fitness of host mosquitoes, and was transmitted vertically (through inheritance). =Clinical= Microsporidian infections of humans sometimes cause a disease called microsporidiosis. At least 14 microsporidian species, spread across eight genera, have been recognized as human pathogens. These include Trachipleistophora hominis. As hyperparasites A hyperparasitic microsporidian, Nosema podocotyloidis, a parasite of a digenean which is itself a parasite of a fish Microsporidia can infect a variety of hosts, including hosts which are themselves parasites. In that case, the microsporidian species is a hyperparasite, i.e. a parasite of a parasite. As an example, more than eighteen species are known which parasitize digeneans (parasitic flatworms). These digeneans are themselves parasites in various vertebrates and molluscs. Eight of these species belong to the genus Nosema. Genomes Microsporidia have the smallest known (nuclear) eukaryotic genomes. The parasitic lifestyle of microsporidia has led to a loss of many mitochondrial and Golgi genes, and even their ribosomal RNAs are reduced in size compared with those of most eukaryotes. As a consequence, the genomes of microsporidia are much smaller than those of other eukaryotes. Currently known microsporidial genomes are 2.5 to 11.6 Mb in size, encoding from 1,848 to 3,266 proteins which is in the same range as many bacteria. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) seems to have occurred many times in microsporidia. For instance, the genomes of Encephalitozoon romaleae and Trachipleistophora hominis contain genes that derive from animals and bacteria, and some even from fungi.  Classification  The first described microsporidian genus, Nosema, was initially put by N√§geli in the fungal group Schizomycetes together with some bacteria and yeasts. For some time microsporidia were considered as very primitive eukaryotes, placed in the protozoan group Cnidospora. Later, especially because of the lack of mitochondria, they were placed along with the other Protozoa such as diplomonads, parabasalids and archamoebae in the protozoan-group Archezoa. More recent research has falsified this theory of early origin (for all of these). Instead, microsporidia are proposed to be highly developed and specialized organisms, which just dispensed functions that are needed no longer, because they are supplied by the host. Furthermore, spore-forming organisms in general do have a complex system of reproduction, both sexual and asexual, which look far from primitive. Since the mid-2000s microsporidia are placed within the Fungi or as a sister-group of the Fungi with a common ancestor. Work to identify clades is largely based on habitat and host.

Overview The Paliath Achans were hereditary prime ministers to the Rajah of Kingdom of Cochin (Kerala) from 1632 to 1809 and second only to the Rajah in power and wealth in the central Cochin area during that period. The Tharavadu Palace The Paliam NaalukettuThe main family tharavadu (Naalukettu) is approximately 450 years old. The Kovilakam (palace) houses a large number of artefacts including ancient documents, religious sacraments, swords, rifles, and gifts brought by foreign dignitaries. Several other buildings, like the Paliath Achan's Kovilakam (which was built by the Dutch, and also known as the Dutch palace) exist adjacent to the tharavadu. The buildings in the area date anywhere from 60 to 300 years.Today very few paliath family members are there in thrissur. Significance in Kerala history The Zamorin invaded Cochin in 1757. Due to the diplomatic efforts of the Paliath Achan, the Kingdom of Cochin was saved. During Hyder Ali's conquest of the south of India in 1776, the Paliath Achan was able to effect a treaty between Hyder Ali and the Cochin Raja. In 1808, the British were trying to create divisions between the Raja of Kochi's men. They had succeeded in getting the support of Nadavarambu Kunhikrishna Menon. Paliath Govindan Achan was provoked by this. He took with him 600 Nair soldiers and attacked the headquarters of Colonel Macaulay, the British Resident, who was forced to flee. Following the attack, Paliath Achan and his men broke open the jails and set free prisoners. The Paliath Achan later joined the Travancore alliance of Velu Thampi Dalawa. During 1809 and 1810, Paliath Achan, allied with Velu Thampi Dalawa, fought the British on Travancore soil. However, the British Divide and Rule policy succeeded in isolating him from the rest of the alliance. His family threatened by the British, and due to his defeat, the Paliath Achan was forced to surrender, and defected to the British side. After the rebellion, the British deported him to Madras, where he was kept prisoner at Fort St. George for 12 years. He was then taken to Bombay and remained a prisoner there for 13 years, finally passing away at Benares 1832. Paliath Govindan Achan was the last Paliath Achan to occupy the position of Prime Minister in the Kingdom of Cochin. Another notable Paliath Achan includes Komi Achan I. Komi Achan I resisted the attempts by the Portuguese to impose their power on the Cochin Family. He allied himself with the Dutch, travelling to Colombo to sign a treaty with them. He also supported the Dutch against the Portuguese. In recognition of his efforts, the Dutch built him a palace (the Kovilakam) at Chendamangalam. Between 1730 and 1740 the status of the Cochin kingdom dwindled due consolidation of power in Travancore under Marthanda Varma combined with the waning influence of the Dutch and a large-scale invasion by the Zamorin from the north. Paliath Komi Achan was able to effect a treaty between the Cochin and Travancore Kingdoms. This treaty facilitated the defeat of the Zamorin.A Primer in Cochin Royal Family History, crhfs.org The Chendamangalam Jews sing \\"The Song of Paliathachan\\" in which they mention the mention \\"Nayar Noblemen\\" who bestowed upon the Jews \\"gifts and books to all those who come, and titles to foreigners\\".The Chennamangalam Synagogue: Jewish Community in a Village in Kerala, chensyn.com In the Vishnuvilasam Hamsappattu, a Malayalam poem about the life of Vishnu (as spoken by a swan), the poet (Kunjan Nambiar) makes a reference to a Paliath Achan named Kuberan: :‡¥∂‡µç‡¥∞‡µÄ ‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥¨‡µá‡¥∞‡¥æ‡¥ñ‡µç‡¥Ø‡¥ó‡¥®‡¥Ç ‡¥™‡¥æ‡¥≤‡¥ø‡¥Ø‡¥æ‡¥ß‡µÄ‡¥∑‡¥∞‡¥®‡µç‡¥±‡µá :‡¥∂‡µç‡¥∞‡µÄ ‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥≤‡¥æ‡¥°‡¥Ç‡¥¨‡¥∞‡¥Ç ‡¥ö‡µÜ‡¥Æ‡µç‡¥Æ‡µá ‡¥µ‡¥∞‡µä‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡µä‡¥®‡µç‡¥® :‡¥∂‡µç‡¥∞‡µÄ ‡¥ï‡¥æ‡¥®‡µç‡¥§‡¥¶‡µá‡¥µ‡¥®‡µç‚Äç ‡¥ú‡¥Ø‡¥®‡µç‡¥§‡¥æ‡¥≤‡¥Ø‡µá‡¥∂‡µç‡¥µ‡¥∞‡¥®‡µç‚Äç :‡¥∂‡µç‡¥∞‡µÄ ‡¥ï‡¥£‡µç‡¥†‡µç‡¥∏‡µá‡¥µ‡¥ø‡¥§‡¥®‡µç‚Äç ‡¥∂‡µç‡¥∞‡µÄ‡¥®‡µç‡¥Ø‡¥∏‡¥ø‡¥Ç‡¥π‡¥æ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥Ø‡¥§‡¥ø :‡¥∂‡µç‡¥∞‡µá‡¥Ø‡¥∏‡µç‡¥∏‡µÅ ‡¥®‡¥≤‡µç‚Äç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥Ç ‡¥®‡¥ø‡¥®‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥ø‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡µÅ ‡¥π‡¥Ç‡¥∏‡¥Æ‡µá! :SrI kubErAkhyaganam pAliyAdhIsharantE :SrI kulADambaram chemmE varoththonna :SrI kAnthadEvan jayanthAlayEaSvaran :SrEyassu nalkum ninakkinnu hamsamE!

As of March 2020, there were 213 InterContinental hotels featuring over 71,431 rooms worldwide. History In 1945, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Juan Trippe, President of Pan Am, discussed their concern for Latin America‚Äôs need for development dollars at a White House breakfast. The two men thought that one way to attract businessmen and tourists would be to offer luxury hotels in key cities. Trippe, envisioning a rise in mass international air travel, agreed that Pan Am, with the support of institutions like the Export‚ÄìImport Bank of the United States, could form a subsidiary to foster the implementation of the idea. The hotels would also serve to accommodate Pan Am crews and passengers in destinations where upscale hotels were not yet present. On April 3, 1946, Intercontinental Hotel Corporation was founded. Intercontinental Hotels purchased its first hotel that year, the Grande Hotel in Bel√©m, Brazil. The chain soon grew to include numerous hotels throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. The Phoenicia Hotel Beirut, the company's first hotel in the Middle East, opened in 1961 Intercontinental Hotels opened its first property in the Middle East in 1961, the Phoenicia Intercontinental Beirut. The chain became one of the first to operate in Eastern Europe when it signed a contract to manage the Esplanade Zagreb Hotel in 1964. The chain was officially rebranded as Inter‚Ä¢Continental Hotels in 1966, with the name commonly spelled with a hyphen as Inter-Continental when typed.http://img03.mar.cx/_images/US/722/668/72266889_specimen_2_image_5.jpg The Inter-Continental Kabul opened in 1969, but ceased operation following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. The hotel continues to operate independently using the Inter-Continental name, but unaffiliated with the chain. In 1972, Inter-Continental started a line of moderately priced hotels, called Forum Hotels. The chain opened its first hotel in the United States in 1973, when it signed a contract to manage the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco. PanAm sold Inter-Continental to Grand Metropolitan on August 19, 1981. The new owners merged their existing chain of Grand Metropolitan Hotels into Inter-Continental and its sibling chain Forum Hotels. GrandMet sold the chain to the Saison Group in 1988, which in turn sold it to Bass in 1998. Two years later, Bass divested itself of its namesake brewing business and renamed itself Six Continents, focusing on hotels. In 2003, the entire company was renamed InterContinental Hotels Group, with the original InterContinental chain one of numerous brands today within the company.

Despite its wide distribution and success (it peaked at on the UK Albums Chart), the album was released without the permission or knowledge of the band, and is thus regarded in some quarters as an unofficial bootleg live album. The album was, however, released legally by the band's former manager Patrick Meehan who owned the rights to the recording. The album was re- released with the approval of the band on 27 September 2010. The nature of the album's initial release as being without the band's approval is demonstrated by a notoriously embarrassing goof in the original version, which falsely credited the singer as \\"Ossie Osbourne\\".  Background  After dismissing manager Patrick Meehan in the late 1970s, Black Sabbath became embroiled in a long legal dispute with their former management. Later, in 1980, Meehan arranged the reissue of the Black Sabbath catalogue and the release on the NEMS label of a live album of old recordings without the band's consent. The album consisted of a 1973 concert recording the band intended to use for a live album, but shelved indefinitely after being unhappy with the recording.  Recording  The release of Live at Last, combined with Ozzy Osbourne's 1982 release of Speak of the Devil live album consisting entirely of Black Sabbath songs, prompted Black Sabbath to release their first official live album, 1982's Live Evil.  Release history  Remastered versions of the original Live at Last recording have been released since the 1990s by various record labels. In the liner notes of the reissue on CD by Castle Communications in 1996, it is stated that the recordings were taken at Manchester Free Trade Hall and at the Rainbow Theatre in North London.

It is known for its Mediterranean and sub-tropical plants; and for housing the Morrab Library in the grounds. Morrab House with its walled garden was built in 1841 for brewer Samuel Pidwell. The house is described as \\"...a large stucco villa in the Georgian manner with columned porch\\". Shortly after the Pidwell family moved to Portugal the property was purchased by Charles Campbell Ross banker, and Member of Parliament for the St Ives Constituency. In September 1881, Ross advertised Morrab House for rent. There was also, a cottage suitable for a coachman or gardener, stables for three horses, a conservatory with a hot water apparatus, a dairy, coach-house, lawn, fruit and flower gardens, lawn and meadow land. Morrab House was auctioned on 29 August 1887 and was purchased for ¬£2,800 by Mr King, who was Her Majesty's Inspector of Schools for the district. At that time a tenant was paying ¬£115 rent for the house and of gardens and meadow. On 16 July 1888 the house and walled gardens was bought by the Corporation of Penzance for ¬£3,120 and tenders for the design of the garden was advertised nationally. The winning prize was ¬£21, with ten guineas for second place plus two other prizes. Entrants came from all over the country with ten plans exhibited and four winners chosen. Reginald Upcher, a landscape gardener of Portland Place, London was commissioned, to develop the grassy fields sloping down to the sea, into a municipal park. Robert Vetch of Exeter came second. The original design is held in the County Record Office, Truro and the garden follows faithfully Upcher's plan. They opened on 27 September 1889 with a half day holiday and a procession through the streets. In the same year the Penzance Library (now known as the Morrab Library) secured a lease as tenants and moved to Morrab House from the municipal buildings.Pool, P. A. S.

Her practices, and those of the Missionaries of Charity, the order which she founded, were subject to numerous controversies. These include objections to the quality of medical care which they provided, suggestions that some deathbed baptisms constituted forced conversion, and alleged links to colonialism and racism. Media criticisms Indian author and physician Aroup Chatterjee, who briefly worked in one of Mother Teresa's homes, investigated the financial practices and other practices of Teresa's order. In 1994, two British journalists, Christopher Hitchens and Tariq Ali, produced a critical British Channel 4 documentary, Hell's Angel, based on Chatterjee's work. The next year, Hitchens published The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice, a book that repeated many of the accusations in the documentary. Chatterjee published The Final Verdict in 2003, a less polemical work than those of Hitchens and Ali, but equally critical of Teresa's operations. In 2003, after Teresa was beatified by John Paul II, Hitchens continued his criticism, calling her \\"a fanatic, a fundamentalist, and a fraud.\\" He further criticized the Catholic Church for ignoring the testimony of Dr. Ranjan Mustafi who attributed the recovery of his patient to modern medicine, rather than a miracle associated with Mother Teresa. Chatterjee and Hitchens were called by the Vatican to present evidence against Teresa during her canonisation process. In 2016, American sociologist, activist, and president of the Catholic League Bill Donohue wrote a book in response to criticism of Mother Teresa.  Quality of medical care  In 1994, Robin Fox, then editor of the British medical journal The Lancet, visited the Home for Dying Destitutes in Calcutta (now Kolkata) and described the medical care the patients received as \\"haphazard\\". He observed that sisters and volunteers, some of whom had no medical knowledge, frequently made decisions about patient care because of the lack of doctors in the hospice: \\"There are doctors that call in from time to time,\\" Fox wrote, \\"but usually the sisters and volunteers (some of whom have medical knowledge) make decisions as best they can.\\" Fox witnessed one patient with high fever being treated with paracetamol and tetracycline, an antibiotic, only to be later diagnosed with malaria by a visiting doctor, who prescribed chloroquine. Fox specifically held Teresa responsible for these conditions in the Home, writing, \\"Mother Theresa [sic] prefers providence to planning\\". Fox also observed that staff either declined to use or lacked access to blood films or \\"simple algorithms that might help the sisters distinguish\\" between curable and incurable patients: \\"Investigations, I was told, are seldom permissible\\". Fox conceded that the regimen he observed included \\"cleanliness, the tending of wounds and sores, and loving kindness\\", but critiqued the sisters' \\"spiritual approach\\" to managing pain: \\"I was disturbed to learn that the formulary includes no strong analgesics. Along with the neglect of diagnosis, the lack of good analgesia marks Mother Theresa's approach as clearly separate from the hospice movement. I know which I prefer.\\" Mary Loudon, who volunteered at the same facility, observed \\"syringes run under cold water and reused, aspirin given to those with terminal cancer, and cold baths given to everyone\\" as well as overcrowding. There have been a series of other reports documenting inattention to medical care in the order's facilities. Similar points of view have also been expressed by some former volunteers who worked for Teresa's order. Mother Teresa herself referred to the facilities as \\"Houses of the Dying\\".; cf. \\"Mother Teresa's care for the dying,\\" letters from David Jeffrey, Joseph O'Neill and Gilly Burns, The Lancet 344 (8929): 1098 In 2013, in a comprehensive review covering 96% of the literature on Mother Teresa, a group of Universit√© de Montr√©al academics reinforced the foregoing criticism, detailing, among other issues, the missionary's practice of \\"caring for the sick by glorifying their suffering instead of relieving it, ... her questionable political contacts, her suspicious management of the enormous sums of money she received, and her overly dogmatic views regarding, in particular, abortion, contraception, and divorce\\". Questioning the Vatican's motivations for ignoring the mass of criticism, the study concluded that Mother Teresa's \\"hallowed image ‚Äì which does not stand up to analysis of the facts ‚Äì was constructed, and that her beatification was orchestrated by an effective media relations campaign\\" engineered by the Catholic convert and anti-abortion BBC journalist Malcolm Muggeridge.  Baptisms of the dying  According to Christopher Hitchens, Mother Teresa encouraged members of her order to secretly baptise dying patients, without regard to the individual's religion. Susan Shields, a former member of the Missionaries of Charity, writes that \\"Sisters were to ask each person in danger of death if he wanted a 'ticket to heaven'. An affirmative reply was to mean consent to baptism. The sister was then to pretend that she was just cooling the patient's head with a wet cloth, while in fact she was baptising him, saying quietly the necessary words. Secrecy was important so that it would not come to be known that Mother Teresa's sisters were baptising Hindus and Muslims.\\" Murray Kempton has argued that patients were not provided sufficient information to make an informed decision about whether they wanted to be baptised and the theological significance of a Christian baptism. Simon Leys, defending the practice in a letter to the New York Review of Books, argued that forced conversion is either benevolent or morally neutral.  Relationships with controversial public figures  In Hell's Angel and The Missionary Position, Hitchens leveled criticism at what he perceived to be Mother Teresa's endorsement of the government of Enver Hoxha in Socialist Albania. She visited Albania in August 1989, where she was received by Hoxha's widow, Nexhmije, Foreign Minister Reis Malile, the Minister of Health, Ahmet Kamberi, the Chairman of the People's Assembly Petro Dode, and other state and party officials. She subsequently laid a bouquet on Hoxha's grave, and placed a wreath on the statue of Mother Albania. She accepted money from the British publisher Robert Maxwell, who, as was later revealed, embezzled UK¬£450 million from his employees' pension funds. There is no suggestion that she was aware of any theft before accepting the donation in either case. Criticism does focus on Teresa's character statement produced in the Charles Keating case, where Keating was charged with fraud following high-profile business failures. Keating had donated millions of dollars to Mother Teresa and had lent her his private jet when she visited the United States. Keating's convictions were thrown out on appeal, as was a summary judgement. Keating later pled guilty to four counts of wire and bankruptcy fraud and was sentenced to time served. After Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's suspension of civil liberties in 1975 (The Emergency), Mother Teresa said: \\"People are happier. There are more jobs. There are no strikes.\\" These approving comments were seen as a result of the friendship between Teresa and the Congress Party. Mother Teresa's comments were criticised by some outside India within the Catholic media. She supported Licio Gelli's nomination for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Gelli was known for being the head of the Propaganda Due masonic lodge, which was implicated in various murders and high-profile corruption cases in Italy, as well as having close connections with the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement and the Military Junta who ruled during Argentina's last dictatorship (1976-1983). In 2017, investigative journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi, in a book titled Original Sin, published accounting documents from the controversial Vatican Bank ‚Äì officially known as the Institute for the Works of Religion ‚Äì which revealed that the funds which were held in Mother Teresa's name on behalf of her charity had made her the Bank's biggest client, and they amounted to billions. Had she made substantial withdrawals, the Bank would have risked default.Gianluigi Nuzzi \\"Peccato Originale\\" Chiarelettere, 2017Nadeau, Barbie Latza \\"Mother Teresa's Secret Billions and a Vatican Seminary Rampant with Sex Abuse‚Äîa New Book Tells All\\", The Daily Beast, 11 November 2017 \\"l libro di Nuzzi: \\"Madre Teresa aveva un maxi-conto allo Ior\\", La Stampa, 9 November 2017, Curridori, Francesco \\"Madre Teresa aveva un maxi-conto allo Ior\\", il Giornale, 9 November 2017,  Motivation for charitable activities  Chatterjee stated that the public image of Mother Teresa as a \\"helper of the poor\\" was misleading, and that only a few hundred people are served by even the largest of the homes. In 1998, among the 200 charitable assistance organisations reported to operate in Calcutta, Missionaries of Charity was not ranked among the largest charity organisations ‚Äì with the Assembly of God charity notably serving a greater number of the poor at 18,000 meals daily.  translated source Chatterjee stated that many operations of the order engage in no charitable activity at all but instead use their funds for missionary work. He stated, for example, that none of the eight facilities that the Missionaries of Charity run in Papua New Guinea have any residents in them, being purely for the purpose of converting local people to Catholicism. She was sometimes accused by Hindus in her adopted country of trying to convert the poor to Catholicism by \\"stealth\\". Christopher Hitchens described Mother Teresa's organisation as a cult that promoted suffering and did not help those in need. He said that Mother Teresa's own words on poverty proved that her intention was not to help people, while he quoted her words at a 1981 press conference in which she was asked: \\"Do you teach the poor to endure their lot?\\" She replied: \\"I think it is very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot, to share it with the passion of Christ. I think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people.\\"  Relationship to colonialism and racism  Australian feminist Germaine Greer called her a \\"religious imperialist\\" who preyed on the most vulnerable in the name of harvesting souls for Jesus. In an essay in the collection White Women in Racialized Spaces, historian Vijay Prashad said of Mother Teresa:  Posthumous criticisms  Mother Teresa died in 1997. Despite her request that all of her writings and correspondences be destroyed, a collection of them was posthumously released to the public in book form. Her writings revealed that she struggled with feelings of disconnectedness, that were in contrast to the strong feelings which she had experienced as a young novice. In her letters Mother Teresa describes a decades-long sense of feeling disconnected from God and lacking the earlier zeal that had characterized her efforts to start the Missionaries of Charity. As a result of this, she was judged by some to have \\"ceased to believe\\" and was posthumously criticized for hypocrisy. Thomas C. Reeves suggests that this criticism displays a basic unfamiliarity with the concept of the \\"dark night of the soul\\". \\"Holier than Thou\\", the May 23, 2005, episode of the Showtime program Penn & Teller: Bullshit!, criticised Mother Teresa, as well as Mahatma Gandhi and the 14th Dalai Lama. Specifically, the episode pointed to Mother Teresa's relationships with Charles Keating and the Duvalier family, as well as the quality of medical care in her home for the dying. Christopher Hitchens appears in the episode, offering accounts based on his reporting on her life. According to Navin B. Chawla, the Missionaries of Charity set up a small mission in Port-au-Prince. A day after Mother Teresa visited and left, Duvalier's daughter-in-law went to Mother Teresa's mission and donated 1,000 dollars, not one million as reported.Chawla, Navin B. (August 26, 2013). Chawla, Navin B., \\"The Mother Teresa her critics choose to ignore\\". The Hindu. In 2016, when she was canonized, Dan Savage drew attention to the conflicting evidence and accused NPR of describing alleged miracles in a way that favoured the church's interpretation.  Responses to criticism  Melanie McDonagh believes that Mother Teresa is in large part \\"criticized for not being what she never set out to be, for not doing things which she never saw as her job.\\" McDonagh stated \\"What she wasn't was a head of government. She didn't address the fundamental causes of poverty because she was addressing the symptoms and she did that well,\\" nor were her sisters social workers. McDonagh commented, \\"She wasn't trying to do anything except treat people at the margins of society as if they were Christ himself.\\" Mari Marcel Thekaekara points out that after the Bangladesh War, a few million refugees poured into Calcutta from the former East Pakistan. \\"No one had ever before done anything remotely like Mother Teresa's order, namely picking up destitute and dying people off the pavements and giving them a clean place to die in dignity.\\"Thekaekara, Mari Marcel (14 September 2016). Thekaekara, Mari Marcel. \\"Reflections on the harsh criticism of Mother Teresa\\". The New Internationalist. Navin B. Chawla points out that Mother Teresa never intended to build hospitals, but to provide a place where those who had been refused admittance \\"could at least die being comforted and with some dignity.\\" He also counters critics of Mother Teresa by stating that her periodic hospitalizations were instigated by staff members against her wishes and he disputes the claim that she conducted surreptitious baptisms. \\"Those who are quick to criticise Mother Teresa and her mission, are unable or unwilling to do anything to help with their own hands.\\" According to Mark Woods, writing in Christian Today, \\"And perhaps just as significant, in terms of her public perception, is the sense among Christians that her critics don't really understand what she was doing. So to criticise her for opposing abortion and contraception, for instance, is to criticise her for not running a secular charity, which she never pretended to do.\\"  See also  *Prelest ¬ß Prelest and saints of the Roman Catholic Church (this is a general Eastern Orthodox critique of unhealthy psychology in some Catholic saints)  References   Further reading  * Doino, William Jr. \\"Mother Teresa and Her Critics\\".

He is considered a pioneer in the study of plants from the Orient, especially their use in pharmacology. Together with the apothecary Tom√© Pires and the physician Garcia de Orta he was one of the pioneers of Indo-Portuguese medicine. He published a book on the medicinal plants of the orient titled Tractado de las drogas y medicinas de la Indias Orientales in 1578.  Life  Title page from 1578 Spanish edition of Tractado de las drogas y medicinas de las Indias Orientales, by Crist√≥v√£o da Costa. Crist√≥v√£o da Costa is believed to have been born somewhere in Africa, possibly in Tangier, Ceuta (both Portuguese cities at the time), or in Portuguese Cape Verde, since in his work he claims to be African (Christophorus Acosta Africanus), but the exact place and date of his birth remain unknown. He probably studied at Salamanca and first travelled to the East Indies in 1550 as a soldier. He took part in some campaigns against the native populace, and at one point was taken prisoner and held captive in Bengal. After returning to Portugal, he joined his former captain, Lu√≠s de Ata√≠de, who had been appointed viceroy of Portuguese India. He returned to Goa in 1568, the year Garcia de Orta died. He served as personal physician to the viceroy, and in 1569 was appointed physician to the royal hospital in Cochin, where he had the opportunity of treating the king of Cochin. By 1571, he was noted as collecting botanical specimens from various parts of India. He returned to Portugal in 1572 after Ata√≠de's term ended. From 1576 to 1587 he served as surgeon and then physician in Burgos (Spain). Pineapple from Tractado de las drogas, y medicinas de las Indias Orientales, Burgos 1578 At Burgos in 1578 he published (in Spanish) his work Tractado de las drogas y medicinas de las Indias orientales (\\"Treatise of the drugs and medicines of the East Indies\\"). In this he says he was brought to India by his desire to find \\"in several regions and provinces learned and curious men from whom I could daily learn something new; and to see the diversity of plants God has created for human health\\". This work was translated into Italian in 1585 by Francesco Ziletti. Parts of this work were translated into Latin by Charles de l'Ecluse (Carolus Clusius), eventually to be included in his illustrated compendium Exoticorum libri decem. Costa's book is not considered wholly original, as it drew a great deal from the previously-published Col√≥quios dos Simples e Drogas da India by Garcia de Orta. With twenty three woodcuts, it soon became better known than Garcia's work (a rare work with only about ten copies in Europe). The last entry was a treatise on the Asian elephant, probably the first to be published in Europe. It was also among the first works to record words from the Basque language. Another work of note was Tractado de la yerbas, plantas, frutas y animales, but this treatise is now believed lost. When his wife died, Acosta retired and went to live in a hermitage. He died in 1594 in Huelva, Spain.

There is no specific treatment, other than supportive measures for the hearing loss and thyroid hormone supplementation in case of hypothyroidism. It is named after Dr Vaughan Pendred (1869‚Äì1946), the British doctor who first described the condition in an Irish family living in Durham in 1896. It accounts for 7.5% to 15% of all cases of congenital deafness. Signs and symptoms The hearing loss of Pendred syndrome is often, although not always, present from birth, and language acquisition may be a significant problem if deafness is severe in childhood. The hearing loss typically worsens over the years, and progression can be step-wise and related to minor head trauma. In some cases, language development worsens after head injury, demonstrating that the inner ear is sensitive to trauma in Pendred syndrome; this is as a consequence of the widened vestibular aqueducts usual in this syndrome. Vestibular function varies in Pendred syndrome and vertigo can be a feature of minor head trauma. A goitre is present in 75% of all cases. Genetics Pendred syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Pendred syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that one would need to inherit an abnormal gene from each parent to develop the condition. This also means that a sibling of a patient with Pendred syndrome has a 25% chance of also having the condition if the parents are unaffected carriers. It has been linked to mutations in the PDS gene, which codes for the pendrin protein (solute carrier family 26, member 4, SLC26A4). The gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q31). Mutations in the same gene also cause enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome (EVA or EVAS), another congenital cause of deafness; specific mutations are more likely to cause EVAS, while others are more linked with Pendred syndrome. Pathophysiology SLC26A4 can be found in the cochlea (part of the inner ear), thyroid and the kidney. In the kidney, it participates in the secretion of bicarbonate. However, Pendred syndrome is not known to lead to kidney problems. It functions as an iodide/chloride transporter. In the thyroid, this leads to reduced organification of iodine (i.e. its incorporation into thyroid hormone).  Diagnosis  People with Pendred syndrome present with a hearing loss either at birth or during childhood. The hearing loss is commonly progressive. In early stages it is usually a mixed hearing loss (both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss) because of a third window effect due to the inner ear malformation (widened vestibular aqueducts). A thyroid goitre may be present in the first decade and is usual towards the end of the second decade. MRI scanning of the inner ear usually shows widened or large vestibular aqueducts with enlarged endolymphatic sacs and may show abnormalities of the cochleae that are known as Mondini dysplasia. Genetic testing to identify the pendrin gene usually establishes the diagnosis. If the condition is suspected, a \\"perchlorate discharge test\\" is sometimes performed. This test is highly sensitive, but may also be abnormal in other thyroid conditions. If a goitre is present, thyroid function tests are performed to identify mild cases of thyroid dysfunction even if they are not yet causing symptoms. Treatment No specific treatment exists for Pendred syndrome. If thyroid hormone levels are decreased, thyroid hormone supplements may be required. Patients are advised to take precautions against head injury.

In communication channel testing and modelling, Gaussian noise is used as additive white noise to generate additive white Gaussian noise. In telecommunications and computer networking, communication channels can be affected by wideband Gaussian noise coming from many natural sources, such as the thermal vibrations of atoms in conductors (referred to as thermal noise or Johnson‚ÄìNyquist noise), shot noise, black-body radiation from the earth and other warm objects, and from celestial sources such as the Sun.  Gaussian noise in digital images  Principal sources of Gaussian noise in digital images arise during acquisition e.g. sensor noise caused by poor illumination and/or high temperature, and/or transmission e.g. electronic circuit noise. In digital image processing Gaussian noise can be reduced using a spatial filter, though when smoothing an image, an undesirable outcome may result in the blurring of fine-scaled image edges and details because they also correspond to blocked high frequencies.

Blayney led an amphibious assault on Sohail Castle under heavy bombardment. The defenders, fighting with the First French Empire, were men from the 4th Regiment of the Duchy of Warsaw. Under ferocious attack from sea and on land from the British and Spanish forces from the inland, about 300 Polish troops ultimately routed the assaulting forces, inflicting heavy losses on the highly reputed British 89th (The Princess Victoria's) Regiment of Foot among others and even captured Blayney himself, who was a very distinguished general. Several of the Polish officers were awarded the Legion of Honour by Napoleon himself.  Background  The town of Fuengirola has been an important trade town since the Middle Ages. To defend it against invasion from the sea, the Moors had built a stone castle on a hill between the Mediterranean and the Fuengirola River. During the Peninsular War the area of Costa del Sol was considered of secondary importance and it was seized by the French forces with little opposition and until 1810 the partisan activity in the region was close to none. That is why, after suffering losses in the fights in the interior, some Polish units of the Duchy of Warsaw were sent there in October 1810 to serve as a garrison and to rest. Sohail Castle was manned by 150 Polish soldiers from the 4th Infantry Regiment and 11 French dragoons. The unit was commanded by Captain Franciszek M≈Çokosiewicz. Similar small garrisons were placed in the nearby towns of Mijas (60 infantrymen under Lieutenant Eustachy Che≈Çmicki) and Alhaurin (200 infantrymen and 40 dragoons under Major Bronisz). All of these forces formed part of the French Corps of General Horace S√©bastiani stationed at M√°laga. The corps numbered some 10,000 men located in southern Andalusia to prevent the Spanish partisans from receiving arms from Gibraltar. In the autumn of 1810, the British Major General Lord Blayney decided to lead an expeditionary force from Gibraltar towards the port of M√°laga and seize it by surprise. The beaches near the small fortress of Fuengirola seemed a perfect landing place for his forces. The Spanish partisans informed the British about the weakness of the defenders and lack of reserves. In October 1810 Blayney gathered a field force of 2/89th Regiment of Foot, a battalion of international deserters from the French army, an artillery unit, naval gun crews and a Spanish Toledo Regiment. The initial British-Spanish expedition numbered some 1700 men, excluding naval staff and crew. They boarded a small fleet consisting of two frigates, (HMS Topaze and HMS Sparrowhawk), five gunboats, several brigs, and transport sloops.  Battle  On October 14, 1810, the British armada reached the Cala Moral Bay, about two miles southwest from Fuengirola. The British disembarked, and were joined on the beach by a small number of Spanish partisans. Blayney led his force northeast along the shore while his fleet sailed parallel toward Fuengirola. At 2:00 pm they all arrived in front of the castle and the British general sent an emissary to convince the Polish commander to surrender. M≈Çokosiewicz refused and the British ships opened fire. Despite numerical inferiority, the Poles held out. Sergeant Zakrzewski even managed to sink one of the British gunboats. The remaining gunboats withdrew out of the range of the two lightweight Polish guns. Under the cover of gunfire from his two frigates, Blayney attempted a frontal attack on the castle walls. However, after Major Grant, the commander of 2/89th Regiment of Foot had been killed, Lord Blayney ordered a retreat. Overnight he landed his guns and the British engineers built two artillery emplacements near the castle, from which they planned to destroy the walls. In the meantime, the Polish garrison of Mijas under Lieut. Che≈Çmicki, alarmed by the artillery bombardment, sneaked through the British lines and joined up with the defenders. Bronisz's garrison of Alhaurin was also alarmed and in the early morning of October 15 it marched to Mijas, where it clashed with a 450-strong Spanish-German unit sent there by Blayney and dispersed it in a bayonet charge. On the morning of October 15 the artillery bombardment became heavy and the British cannons destroyed one of the castle towers. Around 2:00 pm, HMS Rodney and a similar Spanish warship arrived at Fuengirola bringing 932 men of the 1/82nd Regiment of Foot. To counter the threat, Captain M≈Çokosiewicz decided to execute a surprise attack on the enemy artillery positions. Leaving the castle guarded mostly by the wounded, he led the remaining 130 soldiers in a sally. The besiegers were taken by surprise and, despite huge numerical superiority (approximately 10:1), the Spanish regiment protecting the hill artillery redoubt retreated in disorder. The guns were turned away from the castle and the Polish infantrymen started shelling the British positions. Although the artillery fire mostly missed its targets (there were no trained artillery officers in the Polish unit), it made the regrouping of British troops much more difficult. After about half an hour, Lord Blayney managed to reorganise his troops on the beach and ordered the assault of the artillery emplacement occupied by Polish forces. The outnumbered defenders blew up the gunpowder supplies and withdrew towards the castle. However, before the British and Spanish forces could push any further, they were attacked on their left flank by the Polish garrison of Alhaurin that had just arrived on the battlefield. Approximately 200 rested and well-equipped Poles under Bronisz distracted the British long enough to let the withdrawing Captain M≈Çokosiewicz regroup his force and strike the right flank of the British line. This near-simultaneous attack of Polish units, supported by approximately 30 French cavalrymen from the 21st Dragoon Regiment, surprised the enemy infantry, which soon began to waver. After Lord Blayney was taken prisoner by the Poles, his infantry sounded retreat and started a chaotic re-embarcation under the fire of their own, captured once more, guns.  Aftermath  The heroic defence of the castle in Fuengirola was one of the few times in history (other than Maida and Albuera), in which Polish soldiers fought against the forces of Great Britain. It was also one of the few decisive British defeats in the Peninsular War. Although, in his memoirs, Lord Blayney tried to downplay the importance of the battle of Fuengirola, he himself remained in French captivity for nearly four years, until 1814. His surrendered sabre is currently on exhibition at the Czartoryski Museum in Krak√≥w (Cracow). Some British military historians have blamed the British debacle on the timely arrival of General S√©bastiani's superior relief force from M√°laga. However, S√©bastiani's own report to Marshal Soult attests that his column reached Fuengirola on the morning of October 16, some time after the fight. That debate, nevertheless, continues.

The season officially began on June 16, 1944, and ended on November 30, 1944; however, the season only had tropical cyclones from July 13 to November 3. The strongest storm of the season was the 1944 Great Atlantic hurricane, which hit Long Island and New England, causing over 300 deaths and about $100 million worth of damage. The Great Atlantic hurricane was one of two Category 4 hurricanes in 1944, the other being the 1944 Cuba‚ÄìFlorida hurricane, which made landfall in Cuba as a Category 4 and made landfall in Florida as a Category 2. The Cuba-Florida hurricane caused roughly the same amounts of deaths and damage as the Great Atlantic hurricane. The other major hurricane of the season, the 1944 Jamaica hurricane, was a Category 3 hurricane that caused 116 deaths when it made landfall in Jamaica and Mexico. Both of its landfalls were made while it was a Category 1.

One turned northwestward and did not affect land, though low-end tropical storm-force winds were felt in Bermuda. About a week later, Tropical Storm Two hit Martinique before moving west and dissipating on July 27. Just three days later, east of the Turks and Caicos Islands a tropical storm formed and strengthened into a hurricane on August 1. Hurricane Three made landfall later that day in North Carolina, causing $2 million worth of damage. The next storm of the season came on August 16, and quickly strengthened into a hurricane. Then, on August 19, Four strengthened into the first major hurricane of the season. Four then weakened and made landfall in Jamaica at Category 2 intensity, causing over 30 deaths. Having been weakened into a Category 1, on August 22, Four made landfall in the Yucat√°n Peninsula, causing unknown damage and a high death toll. After exiting the peninsula, a highly weakened Four hit mainland Mexico on August 24 as a tropical depression, and almost instantly dissipated. While Four was intensifying on August 18, Tropical Depression Five formed off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, and scraped the coast early the next day. Five strengthened into a tropical storm late on August 19 and made landfall in Tamaulipas three days later. Causing little impact, Five dissipated the next day. On September 9, an area of low pressure quickly organized into a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico. Early on September 11, Tropical Storm Six made landfall, causing the highest daily rainfall total since 1937. Also on September 9, a tropical storm formed in the central Atlantic and moved west-northwest. Seven slowly intensified into a Category 4 hurricane, and then, very early in the morning on September 15, the hurricane made landfall in New England, causing a very high death toll and catastrophic damage. As Seven's remnants dissipated, a tropical wave developed into Tropical Storm Eight. On September 20, after strengthening into a hurricane, Eight made landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula. Later that day, Eight briefly entered the Bay of Campeche before making a second landfall in southern Mexico. Eight dissipated on September 22 due to mountains. As Eight was dissipating on September 21, a tropical storm formed in the Central Atlantic. Three days later, it intensified into Hurricane Nine. The next day, Nine briefly became a Category 2 hurricane before a cold front came and caused Nine to become extratropical early on September 26. The next two tropical storms of the season, Ten and Eleven, both lasted from September 30 to October 3 and did not affect land, though Ten had numerous ship reports on it. On October 11, a tropical storm formed in the northeast Atlantic. Early the next day, Twelve reached peak intensity as a low-end Category 1 hurricane. However, Twelve soon weakened from hurricane intensity. On October 15, as Twelve started to affect Portugal, Twelve transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. While Twelve was becoming a hurricane, a disturbance northeast of Guatemala became a tropical depression. While moving very slowly northward, the depression quickly became Tropical Storm Thirteen and was soon a hurricane. On October 15, Thirteen strengthened into the third major hurricane of the season. The next day, as Thirteen strengthened into a Category 4, it made landfall in Cuba. Then, moving faster, Thirteen moved north-northeast, making landfall in Florida as a low-end Category 3 on October 18. Quickly weakening, two days later Thirteen made landfall in South Carolina, and proceeded to turn extratropical. The remnants continued for five more days, before entirely dissipating over Greenland. On November 1, a tropical depression formed east of Costa Rica. It quickly organized into Tropical Storm Fourteen. Fourteen reached peak intensity the next day, and then weakened. It dissipated on November 3, thus ending the season. Systems =Hurricane One= A tropical wave was noted near Grenada on July 11; it organized into the season's first tropical depression two days later around 06:00 UTC while situated near Navidad Bank in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Upon designation, the Weather Bureau planned reconnaissance missions for the first time ever to intercept the newly-formed cyclone. It intensified as it moved northwest, attaining tropical storm intensity by 00:00 UTC on July 14 and further strengthening into the season's first hurricane around 06:00 UTC on July 16\\\\. After reaching peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), the hurricane recurved toward the northeast and began to weaken, though Bermuda reported winds near 40 mph (65 km/h) upon the storm's closest approach. It transitioned into an extratropical cyclone around 00:00 UTC on July 19 and continued into the northern Atlantic, where it was absorbed by a larger extratropical low southeast of Newfoundland the next day. =Tropical Storm Two= A tropical wave organized into a tropical storm east of Barbados around 06:00 UTC on July 24, although it is possible the system existed farther east in the absence of widespread observations. The system passed just south of Martinique, where Fort-de-France recorded peak winds of 55 mph (89 km/h), before continuing on a west-northwest course through the Caribbean Sea. Though it was initially believed the small storm struck Haiti, where considerable damage was reported along the coastline near Port-au- Prince, and ultimately degenerated, modern reanalysis suggests the cyclone continued south of the island. The system was then intercepted by strong wind shear that led to its demise west-southwest of Jamaica by 18:00 UTC on July 27\\\\. Its remnants continued westward and were last noted north of Honduras the following day. =Hurricane Three= A tropical wave organized into a tropical storm about 135 mi (215 km) east of Cockburn Town in the Turks and Caicos Islands around 12:00 UTC on July 30. The newly-formed system intensified on a west-northwest course parallel to the Bahamas, attaining hurricane strength by 00:00 UTC on August 1\\\\. From there, it curved toward the north before making landfall on Oak Island, North Carolina, with peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) at 23:00 UTC. The system weakened as it progressed through the Mid-Atlantic and into the northwestern Atlantic, and it was last considered a tropical depression around 06:00 UTC on August 4 about 105 mi (165 km) east of Nantucket. Despite the storm's small size, it produced wind gusts of 72 mph (116 km/h) in Wilmington, North Carolina, where many houses were unroofed, communication lines were toppled, glass windows were shattered, and hundreds of trees were uprooted. Throughout Carolina Beach and Wrightsville Beach, an unusually high tide‚Äîcombined with waves perhaps as large as 30 ft (9 m)‚Äîdemolished several cottages and homes, or otherwise swept the structures off their foundations. The former city was particularly hard hit as its famed boardwalk was smashed to pieces, while in Wrightsville Beach, local police estimated that the water reached 18 ft (5 m) by its city hall. Two fishing piers were destroyed in each city. Crops sustained catastrophic loss throughout coastal beach counties. Rainfall was generally moderate, reaching 3‚Äì5 in (76‚Äì127 mm) across eastern North Carolina, with a maximum storm-total amount of 7.7 in (195.6 mm) in Cheltenham, Maryland. Damage reached $2 million. As the cyclone exited into the Atlantic, it produced a gust of 38 mph (61 km/h) in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Though no fatalities occurred along the storm's path in the wake of mass evacuations, there were several casualties, including a few with serious injuries. =Hurricane Four= The fourth cyclone of the season was first noted as strong tropical storm east of Barbados around 18:00 UTC on August 16. The small storm passed over Grenada and into the eastern Caribbean Sea, where it quickly intensified into a hurricane. On a west-northwest course, the system organized into the season's first major hurricane around 12:00 UTC on August 19, attaining peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) six hours later. The potent hurricane grazed the northern coastline of Jamaica and continued westward in a slightly weakened state before making a second landfall south of Playa del Carmen on the Yucat√°n Peninsula with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) early on August 22\\\\. The cyclone entered the Bay of Campeche as a strong tropical storm but fell to an intensity of 40 mph (65 km/h) before moving ashore just north of Tecolutla, Veracruz. Once inland, it quickly dissipated by 12:00 UTC on August 24\\\\. As the cyclone entered the Caribbean, it intercepted a British vessel which then went missing, with all 74 passengers aboard presumed dead. Across Jamaica, numerous buildings were heavily damaged, including faulty dwellings that were blown down or crushed under fallen trees. Significant crop loss was observed, with 41% of coconut trees and 90% of banana trees destroyed; in some cases, every tree was toppled in coconut plantations. Two railway vans, each weighing 14.5 t (29,000 lbs), were overturned; as such, it was estimated that gusts reached 100‚Äì120 mph (160‚Äì195 km/h) along the northeastern coastline. At least 30 people were killed across the island. In the nearby Cayman Islands, wind gusts topped 80 mph (130 km/h), though no damage was reported. Overall, the storm killed 116 people. =Tropical Storm Five= A tropical wave was first noted passing through the Windward Islands on August 13. Trekking through the Caribbean Sea, coalescing into a tropical depression about 115 mi (185 km) east of the Isla de Cozumel by 12:00 UTC on August 18\\\\. Narrowly missing the Yucat√°n Peninsula, the system continued west-northwest into the central Gulf of Mexico, where it attained tropical storm intensity by 18:00 UTC on August 19 and reached peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) by early on August 21\\\\. The system moved ashore northeast of San Fernando, Tamaulipas with slightly weaker winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) before progressing inland and dissipating by 06:00 UTC on August 23\\\\. Little impact was noted from the cyclone, though it did produce a maximum gust of 45 mph (72 km/h) in Brownsville, Texas. =Tropical Storm Six= On September 8, a weak area of low pressure developed along the tail-end of a stationary front across the northern Gulf of Mexico. It quickly organized into a tropical depression by 00:00 UTC the next day, positioned about 170 mi (275 km) southeast of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, and further attained tropical storm intensity twelve hours later. The fledgling system moved north and then northeast, making its first landfall along the Mississippi River Delta with peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) around 19:00 UTC on September 10\\\\. The system made its second landfall along Dauphin Island, Alabama, at 23:00 UTC at a slightly reduced intensity. It lost character by 12:00 UTC on September 11 and was last documented about 40 mi (65 km) southwest of Montgomery, Alabama. As the cyclone moved ashore, Mobile, Alabama, recorded its highest 24-hour rainfall total ‚Äì 7.04 in (179 mm) ‚Äì since 1937. The streets of the city were inundated by flood waters, sustaining considerable damage alongside bridges. The Mobile River reached a height of 3.8 ft (1.2 m) above sea level, its highest crest since 1932. Pensacola, Florida, recorded peak winds of 54 mph (87 km/h) that resulted in about $500 worth of damage from damaged dwelling roofs. Tides peaked around 1 ft (0.3 m). =Hurricane Seven= The deadliest and most intense storm of the 1944 season began its endeavor as a tropical wave over the central Atlantic on September 4\\\\. The disturbance began a west-northwest track and, upon an investigation by a reconnaissance aircraft on September 9, is documented to have already become a moderate tropical storm by 06:00 UTC that day while located about 305 mi (490 km) northeast of the Leeward Islands. Steady intensification ensued as the storm continued west-northwest, and it ultimately attained its peak as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) a few hundred miles east of Florida early on September 13. A testament to its strength and size, the Weather Bureau dubbed the cyclone the \\"Great Atlantic Hurricane\\", though it is better known as the \\"Hurricane of 1944.\\" It only slowly weakened as it paralleled the East Coast of the United States, striking Long Island by 02:00 UTC on September 15 and moving ashore Rhode Island two hours later, both at Category 2 intensity. The system curved northeast, losing tropical characteristics over southern Maine later that day and dissipating northeast of Newfoundland on September 16\\\\. =Hurricane Eight= Yet another tropical wave led to the formation of a tropical storm over the northwestern Caribbean Sea around 06:00 UTC on September 19. It moved northwest after formation while steadily intensifying, attaining hurricane strength by 00:00 UTC the next day. The storm moved ashore near Canc√∫n with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) before weakening slightly once inland, simultaneously turning southwestward. After emerging into the Bay of Campeche early on September 21, it re-attained peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and made a second landfall near Para√≠so, Tabasco. The cyclone turned south over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, dissipating after 12:00 UTC on September 22\\\\. =Hurricane Nine= The ninth storm of the season formed early on September 21 via a tropical wave that departed the western coast of Africa several days prior. The cyclone only slowly organized as it tracked west-northwest and then north, attaining hurricane strength early on September 24\\\\. After reaching its peak as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h) around 12:00 UTC the next day, an approaching cold front prompted the beginning of extratropical transition, a process it completed early on September 26 well south of Newfoundland. The post-tropical cyclone curved northeast over the far northern Atlantic and was last noted south of Iceland two days later. =Tropical Storm Ten= On September 28, a broad area of low pressure developed adjacent to a dissipating warm front over the north-central Atlantic. The cyclone congealed over the next two days and attained tropical storm status by 00:00 UTC on September 30, corroborated by a nearby ship report. It slowly intensified on a north and then northeast course, peaking with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) early on October 1\\\\. The system weakened to a tropical depression the following day and was soon absorbed by an approaching extratropical cyclone by 00:00 UTC on October 3\\\\. =Tropical Storm Eleven= The eleventh tropical storm of the season began about 80 mi (130 km) north of Barbados around 06:00 UTC on September 30 as indicated by numerous ship and island observations. The short-lived cyclone moved northwest and then north ahead of an approaching trough, acquiring peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) shortly after formation before presumably dissipating on October 3\\\\. Alternatively, in the absence of widespread observations, the system may have continued into the central Atlantic unnoticed. =Hurricane Twelve= A week into October, a broad area of low pressure began to take shape along a frontal boundary across the northeastern Atlantic. The system steadily acquired tropical characteristics, and it is first recognized as a tropical storm by 00:00 UTC on October 11 while located about 570 mi (915 km) west-southwest of the Azores. It drifted east and then northeast, attaining hurricane intensity and peaking with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) by early on October 12\\\\. The cyclone resumed its eastward motion shortly thereafter and weakened below hurricane strength, passing north of the Azores before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone early on October 15\\\\. The post-tropical storm tracked east-southeast into Portugal and Spain, where sustained winds of 46 mph (74 km/h) were recorded in Seville. =Hurricane Thirteen= On October 12, a disturbance in the western Caribbean Sea organized into a tropical depression near the Swan Islands. The system quickly strengthened as it drifted towards the north, becoming a hurricane the following day. After turning towards the west, it passed south of Grand Cayman and then resumed an accelerated northward heading near the 83rd meridian west between October 16‚Äì17. The hurricane intensified significantly during this period, quickly attaining Category 4 intensity before reaching its peak strength with winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) on October 18\\\\. The storm made landfalls over Isla de la Juventud and the Cuban mainland with this intensity later that day, passing west of Havana. The storm weakened after crossing Cuba, but was unusually large given its location. Its center passed over the Dry Tortugas as a major hurricane late on October 18 before striking Sarasota, Florida, the following morning with winds of 105 mph (170 km/h). The storm's winds diminished gradually over the Florida peninsula, and eventually the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over South Carolina on October 20\\\\. This phase of the storm continued for four days before merging with the Icelandic Low near Greenland. The hurricane proved to be an important test of the American rawinsonde network, whose upper-atmosphere data were successfully incorporated into tropical cyclone track forecasting for the first time in history. Squally conditions battered the Cayman Islands for three days, destroying all crops; the of rain recorded on Grand Cayman was the highest in the island's history. At least 300 people were killed in Cuba, though the full extent of casualties remains unknown as reports from rural areas of the island were never realized. In Havana, numerous buildings were damaged. A station in the city documented 163 mph (262 km/h) wind gust, which stood as the strongest gust measured in the country until 2008. Florida's citrus crop suffered extensively, exacerbated by the hurricane's timing near optimal harvest time. Total damage in the state amounted to $63 million, with about $50 million attributed to crop damage. Eighteen deaths were reported in the state and 24 others were hospitalized. Heavy rains and gusty winds were felt throughout the Eastern Seaboard from the hurricane and its extratropical remnants, causing widespread power outages. Overall, the hurricane caused more than $100 million in damage and at least 318 fatalities. =Tropical Storm Fourteen= The final tropical cyclone of the 1944 season began as a tropical depression about 35 mi (55 km) southeast of San Andr√©s around 00:00 UTC on November 1\\\\. Executing a short counter-clockwise motion, the depression attained tropical storm intensity six hours later and further intensified to attain peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) early the next day. In the presence of minimal ship and land observations, however, it is possible the storm alternatively became a hurricane, with historical precedence in Hurricane Martha. It then weakened and dissipated on November 3 without moving ashore.

He belonged to the school known as the commentators or postglossators. The admiration of later generations of civil lawyers is shown by the adage nemo bonus √≠urista nisi bartolista -- no one is a good jurist unless he is a Bartolist (i.e. a follower of Bartolus). Life and works Bartolus was born in the village of Venatura, near Sassoferrato, in the Italian region of Marche. His father was Franciscus Severi, and his mother was of the Alfani family. He read civil law at the universities of Perugia under Cinus, and Bologna under Oldradus and Belviso, and graduated to doctor of law in 1334. In 1339 he started teaching first in Pisa, then in Perugia. He raised the character of Perugia's law school to a level with that of Bologna, and this city made him an honorary citizen in 1348. In 1355, Emperor Charles IV appointed him as his consiliarius. In Perugia Baldus de Ubaldis and his brothers Angelus and Petrus became pupils of Bartolus. Bartolus died in Perugia at the age of 43, and was interred in the church of San Francisco with a monument inscribed with \\"Ossa Bartoli\\". Consilia, quaestiones et tractatus, 1547 Despite his short life, Bartolus left an extraordinary number of works. He wrote commentaries on all parts of the Corpus Juris Civilis (except Justinian's Institutes). He is also the author of a large number of treatises on specific subjects. Among these treatises is his famous book on the law relating to rivers (De fluminibus seu Tyberiadis). There are also almost 400 legal opinions (consilia) written at the request of judges or private parties seeking legal advice. Bartolus developed many novel legal concepts, which became part of the civil law tradition. Among his most important contributions were those to the area of conflict of laws -- a field of great importance in 14th century Italy, where every city-state had its own statutes and customs. Bartolus also dealt with a variety of constitutional law issues. In his treatise De insigniis et armis he discussed not only the law of Arms but also some problems of trademark law. Bartolus also wrote on political issues, including the legitimacy of city governments, partisan divisions and the regimes of Italy's petty tyrants. His political thought balanced respect for the Empire with defense of the legitimacy of local Italian governments. Legacy Already famous at his lifetime, Bartolus was later regarded as the greatest jurist after the renaissance of Roman law. This is not only evident from the above-quoted saying, but also from the fact that statutes in Spain 1427/1433 and Portugal 1446 provided that his opinions should be followed where the Roman source texts and the Accursian gloss were silent. Lorenzo Valla was driven out of the university of Pavia in 1431 for his critique of Bartolus' Latin style. Even in England, where the civil law he had worked on was not applicable, Bartolus was held in high esteem. He influenced civilian writers such as Alberico Gentili and Richard Zouch. Due to Bartolus' fame, his name was used for the character of a lawyer in many Italian plays. A well- known example is Dr. Bartolo in Pierre Beaumarchais' The Barber of Seville (play), Gioachino Rossini's opera The Barber of Seville and in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro.

Early years Bey was born in Far Rockaway, Queens, New York, to a Jewish father and an Irish Catholic mother and attended Far Rockaway High School.Morales, Tina. \\"SCHOOL OF THE WEEK/Far Rockaway High School\\", Newsday, February 25, 1990. Accessed July 3, 2010. He is an alumnus of the University of California, Santa Barbara and the Yale School of Drama. Prior to The Richard Bey Show, Bey hosted People Are Talking (telecast in New York City and Philadelphia) and 2 On the Town for WCBS-TV. People Are Talking was a one-hour live broadcast covering topical news issues and one on one interviews with guests like Frank Zappa, Steven Spielberg, President Jimmy Carter, Sammy Davis Jr., Patricia Neal, Alexander Haig, Jerry Brown, Ross Perot and Martin and Charlie Sheen. The show was called 9 Broadcast Plaza in its early years before changing its name to The Richard Bey Show. Among his roles on stage are Hamlet (title role) As You Like It, Twelfth Night, Troilus and Cressida as well as the world premieres of new plays by Richard Nelson, Chris Durang and Jim Lapine. He was a company member of the Yale Repertory Theater and understudied the National Theatre of Great Britain on Broadway and at the Kennedy Center. His film roles include Sasha Baron Cohen's Bruno, Evocateur, Meet Wally Sparks and George Washington (the mini series). The Richard Bey Show The Richard Bey Show (1992‚Äì1996) was produced from WWOR-TV in Secaucus, New Jersey and later syndicated across the country by All American Television (known today as FreemantleMedia). It featured such competitive events as the \\"Miss Big Butt\\" contest, the \\"Mr. Puniverse\\" contest, \\"Country Drag Queens versus City Drag Queens\\", \\"Dysfunctional Family Feud\\" and \\"Blacks who think O.J. is guilty vs. Whites who think he is innocent.\\" Young women who were guests on the show were sometimes placed in a spoof of The Dating Game in which the guest interviewed three hidden \\"bachelors\\", all of whom were an obvious mismatch for the \\"bachelorette\\" (e.g., a drag queen or a dwarf). Bey's show made frequent use of sound effects like \\"uh-duh\\" for an insane response, \\"I've been framed\\" for a guest proclaiming innocence and \\"You're busted!\\" for one accused of wrongdoing. Bey would often exclaim \\"Where do they find these people?!\\" in the presence of unbelievable guests or audience members. During some shows, there would be a secret word, and if an audience member used it in a comment, he would receive $100 (an homage to a prior talk and game show, You Bet Your Life). A joking suggestion was then made on how to spend it: \\"Lobster dinner tonight!\\" The show was a precursor to reality television, featuring a variety of games incorporating guests' stories, most notoriously \\"The Wheel of Torture\\", in which a guest would be strapped to a spinning wheel while a spouse or lover poured slime on them as punishment for a misdeed. The show was executive produced by Bob Woodruff and David Sittenfeld. Richard would frequently make fun of Jerry Springer on his show, as when he lost his contact lenses and was forced to wear eyeglasses, remarking, \\"Don't worry, you're not watching Jerry Springer\\" and showing Jerry in his \\"Bad Neighbors\\" segment, a reference to Springer's show being the lead-in or lead-out to Bey on many stations in the early-to-mid 1990s. He would also make light of Ricki Lake, Rosie O'Donnell, Phil Donahue, and Oprah Winfrey's shows. Bey also hosted a prime time show called \\"Night Games\\". It was short-lived but ran around the time his daytime show was at its peak. It ran after 10 o'clock and was a little more ribald with sexually clad women engaged in contests. Bey claimed his TV show was canceled in December 1996 (despite the high ratings it maintained) as a direct result of doing a program with Gennifer Flowers, discussing her sexual relationship with then President Bill Clinton.(scroll down) A scene from the film Br√ºno depicts the filming of an episode of a fictional variation on the show called Today with Richard Bey. The production team, along with Bey, set up the program to invite an unsuspecting audience to participate in a segment where Br√ºno (Sacha Baron Cohen) appears as a guest, talking about his adopted son who is black. In response to questions from the audience, Br√ºno reveals that he gave his son the \\"traditional African name\\" O.J. and claims that he \\"swapped\\" an iPod for his son. The predominantly black audience becomes outraged over Br√ºno's responses. Radio years After the TV show was canceled, Bey was an evening and later afternoon radio co-host along with Steve Malzberg on The Buzz, which aired on New York's WABC from 2000 to 2003. According to the New York Post, he was one of only two talk hosts at the time on commercial New York radio to openly oppose the Iraq War, contesting the WMD evidence. He has since hosted on Sirius Satellite Radio, The Bill Press Show, and for the syndicated The Wall Street Journal: This Morning. Bey hosted for a week on WXRK 92.3 FM from February 5 to February 9, 2007 from 10:00pm to midnight. He regularly filled in for Lynn Samuels and Alex Bennett on the Sirius Satellite Radio channel Talk Left when they went on vacation or took a day off. In August 2007, Bey began hosting a new show on WWRL in New York City from 8 to 10pm. In November 2007, he was teamed up with Mark Riley and moved to the morning drive, replacing the team of Sam Greenfield and Armstrong Williams. In March 2008, family reasons caused Mark Riley to leave WWRL by mutual agreement to return to WLIB, and Richard was teamed up with longtime broadcaster Coz Carson. Bey later decided to leave WWRL himself, citing personal reasons (namely spending time with his son). Until December 2009, he appeared daily on internet TV station UBA-TV from noon until 1:00pm. Until 2019, he filled in on Sirius Left and hosted a blog on his now defunct website. In December 2013 he hosted the morning show in the final weeks of WWRL before it switched to Spanish language broadcasting.  Personal life  As of 2009, Richard Bey had never been married and was helping to raise the ten-year-old son of a former girlfriend.Haber, Matt, \\"Richard Bey‚Äôs Infinite Punyverse\\", The New York Observer, May 12, 2009 He lives in midtown Manhattan in New York City.

Known for most of its length as York Road, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) and US 40 Truck in Baltimore north to the Pennsylvania state line in Maryland Line, where the highway continues as State Route 3001 (SR 3001). MD 45 is the primary highway between Downtown Baltimore and Towson, the county seat of Baltimore County. North of Interstate 695, the state highway parallels I-83 and serves the suburban communities of Lutherville, Timonium, Cockeysville, and Hunt Valley. MD 45 also connects the northern Baltimore County communities of Hereford and Parkton. The state highway is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration in Baltimore County and by the Baltimore City Department of Transportation in the city, where the highway also follows Greenmount Avenue. York Road, which follows the path of an 18th- century wagon road and 19th century turnpike, was one of the original state roads marked for improvement by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. The state highway was constructed as an all-weather road in the mid-1910s from Baltimore to Hereford. The remainder of York Road to Maryland Line was built in the late 1910s and early 1920s. York Road was designated US 111 in 1927 and widened to handle the increasing traffic load in the late 1920s. York Road became a secondary route when a freeway was constructed from Baltimore to York and Harrisburg in the 1950s. US 111 was moved to this freeway as sections opened; the old road became MD 45. MD 45 fully replaced US 111 on York Road when the U.S. Highway was replaced by I-83 in the early 1960s. Route description View south along MD 45 at Glenwood Avenue in Baltimore MD 45 begins at an intersection with US 1 and US 40 Truck (North Avenue) at the northwest corner of Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore. Greenmount Avenue continues south as a city street to Forrest Street and Monument Street east of Downtown Baltimore. MD 45 heads north as a four-lane undivided street between the Barclay and East Baltimore Midway neighborhoods and crosses over CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision. The state highway continues north through Waverly, where the street passes St. John's Episcopal Church and intersects 33rd Street. MD 45 is paralleled to the east by Old York Road through Waverly and Pen Lucy. At 43rd Street, MD 45's name changes to York Road. The name change occurs where the highway exited the city limits of Baltimore between 1888 and 1917. MD 45 continues north as a five-lane road with a center left- turn lane. Between Cold Spring Lane and Northern Parkway, the state highway passes through Mid-Govans, which is home to the Senator Theater, and loses the center left-turn lane. MD 45 leaves the city limits and passes through the Baltimore County community of Rodgers Forge. The state highway passes along the eastern margin of Towson University before reaching the southern edge of downtown Towson, where MD 45 Bypass splits to the northwest along Burke Avenue. In the center of the county seat adjacent to the Towson Town Center shopping mall, MD 45 passes through the racetrack-shaped Towson Roundabout, where the state highway meets the southern end of MD 146 (Dulaney Valley Road) and east-west Joppa Road. On either side of the roundabout, the state highway narrows to two lanes for on-street parking. MD 45 heads northwest from the roundabout, becoming four lanes again, and meets the northern end of MD 45 Bypass (Bosley Avenue) before it gains a center left-turn lane and passes east of the George Washington Carver Center for Arts and Technology. The route has a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway), at which point it is a four-lane divided highway. The state highway continues north through the densely populated suburban area of Lutherville as a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane, where the highway intersects Seminary Road, which heads west as MD 131. The west side of MD 45 is lined with commercial and industrial parks as it passes through Timonium. Between Timonium Road and Padonia Road, both of which head west to interchanges with I-83, the state highway passes along the eastern edge of the Timonium Fairgrounds, home of the Maryland State Fair and the Baltimore County 4-H Fair. The industrial parks continue past Warren Road in Cockeysville, where the highway crosses Beaver Dam Run. MD 45 meets the western end of MD 145 (Ashland Road) before arriving in Hunt Valley, where the highway intersects Shawan Road at Hunt Valley Town Center. MD 45 southbound past MD 439 in Maryland Line North of Shawan Road, MD 45 becomes a two-lane undivided road that crosses Western Run and curves northeast before resuming its northward course through the community of Sparks, where the highway has an intersection with Belfast Road and passes several industrial parks. The state highway continues through the village of Hereford, which contains the western terminus of MD 138 (Monkton Road) and the eastern terminus of MD 137 (Mount Carmel Road) one block apart. North of Hereford, MD 45 passes west of Hereford High School and descends into the valley of Gunpowder Falls, where the highway closely parallels I-83. The two highways separate, with the state highway passing by the Half-Way House, a preserved toll house from the 19th century turnpike that is halfway between Baltimore and York. In Parkton, MD 45 intersects Middletown Road and passes over the Torrey C. Brown Rail Trail and Little Gunpowder Falls. North of the village, the state highway crosses to the west side of I-83 at a diamond interchange with the Interstate. The state highway intersects MD 439 (Old York Road) and Freeland Road in the community of Maryland Line before reaching its northern terminus at the Pennsylvania state line. The roadway continues north as SR 3001 (Susquehanna Trail), an unsigned quadrant route, toward the borough of Shrewsbury. MD 45 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from US 1 in Baltimore to Shawan Road in Hunt Valley except for the short stretch between MD 146 and the northern junction with MD 45 Bypass in Towson. History York Road was first constructed as a wagon road in the early 1740s to connect the new settlement of York with the port of Baltimore. In the 19th century, this road became part of the Baltimore and Yorktown Turnpike. When the Maryland State Roads Commission put together a state road system in 1909, York Road from North Avenue in Baltimore to Parkton was designated one of the original state roads to be improved. The first section of the old turnpike to be resurfaced with a wide macadam surface was from Washington Avenue just north of the center of Towson and the hamlet of Texas south of Cockeysville in 1913. The highway from the contemporary northern city limit of Baltimore near 42nd Street to Washington Avenue just north of the center of Towson was surfaced with bituminous concrete in 1914. York Road from Texas to Glencoe was resurfaced in 1914 and from there to the hamlet of Verona south of Hereford in 1915. The improved macadam road was extended to Parkton by 1919. York Road from Parkton to the Pennsylvania state line was paved in concrete in two sections completed in 1921 and 1923. Greenmount Avenue was reconstructed from 42nd Street to its southern end by 1924. In 1927, York Road and Greenmount Avenue north of North Avenue became part of US 111. MD 45 northbound in Timonium Early improvements to York Road included the construction of new bridges over Western Run and Gunpowder Falls in 1918 and 1924; these bridges remain in use. Other bridges included grade separations at the crossings of the Northern Central Railway at Cockeysville and Parkton built around 1930. US 111 was widened with concrete shoulders in much of Baltimore County in the mid- to late 1920s. York Road and Greenmount Avenue were widened and reconstructed in Baltimore in 1929 and 1930. By 1930, US 111 had a width of from inside Baltimore to Towson, from Towson to Parkton, and from Parkton to the Pennsylvania state line. By 1934, the Maryland State Roads Commission recommended widening the U.S. Highway to from Towson to Cockeysville and to from Parkton to the Pennsylvania state line. The latter stretch was widened to in 1946 and 1947. Further widening of US 111 was not planned because York Road was to be bypassed by a freeway between Baltimore and Harrisburg. Construction on the Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway got underway in 1948 between Timonium and Hunt Valley. The first portion of the freeway opened from Towson to Belfast Road north of Hunt Valley in December 1955, concurrent with the opening of the portion of the Baltimore Beltway between Falls Road and York Road. US 111 was moved to the freeway when the Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway was completed to north of Hereford in 1957; MD 45 was assigned to York Road between the Beltway and the northern end of the freeway. A second, disjoint portion of MD 45 was assigned from north of Parkton to the Pennsylvania state line when the Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway was completed between Parkton and the York area in 1959. When the final section of the US 111 freeway was completed between Hereford and Parkton in 1960, MD 45 was assigned to the stretch of York Road between those communities. US 111 and I-83 were co-signed on the freeway between Towson and Harrisburg until US 111 was decommissioned in 1963; the MD 45 designation was extended south into Baltimore to US 1 at that time.

Charles Brady was in the US Navy in World War II; he did mundane jobs after returning from war and took night classes in drawing. In 1948 he entered the Art Students League of New York and took a yearlong course. After art school he continued to paint, beginning to exhibit in the early 1950s and at the same time working to support himself, mostly in menial hotel jobs, but also for a while as guard at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He had his first solo exhibition in the Urban Gallery in 1955 but felt at this time that his life was becoming too confused; As he wrote later: ‚Ä≥I was really lost. I wasn't capable of living that way - the very late nights, the heavy drinking, the carousing, the women - I couldn't seem to get my life together.‚Ä≥John O'Regan (ed.), Works 9 - Charles Brady. Dublin: Gandon Editions, 1993. To escape, he travelled by ferry to Ireland in 1956 and began painting the Irish countryside. He returned to New York in 1958 but in 1959 he moved back to Ireland and settled there for good, first in Dublin and then D√∫n Laoghaire. Poverty forced him to paint on small pieces of cardboard and small pictures became typical; he began to value the intimacy, and affordability, of small paintings. His ambitions were modest: ‚Ä≥I had hoped, from the very beginning, to sell my paintings if possible to ordinary people and my paintings would fit into living rooms or bedrooms.‚Ä≥ In the 1960s he began painting still lives of everyday objects such as envelopes and tickets and this also became typical. These small, modest, compositions allowed him to refine a spare almost mystical style. As one critic wrote: ‚Ä≥...his speciality is the raising of an object - every day or of vague historical interest [. . .] - to the intensity of aesthetic experience by the use of subtly simplified composition and muted colours.‚Ä≥David Scott, The Modern Art Collection, Trinity College Dublin.

He rose to the rank of SS- Sturmbannf√ºhrer (major). After the war, Morgen served as witness at several anti-Nazi trials and continued his legal career in Frankfurt. Morgen was known as a Blutrichter, or 'blood judge', as a result of being one of the members of the judiciary authorised to issue the death penalty.letter to Maria Wachter, 12 December 1944, Morgen Nachlass, Fritz Bauer Institut. A mistranslation of this may also be the reason that he earned the nickname 'The Bloodhound Judge', said to be for his determination and doggedness in achieving justice.holocaustresearchproject.org: \\"Konrad Morgen, 'The Bloodhound Judge', Investigating corruption within the SS\\" Early life and war service Born to a railwayman in Frankfurt, Morgen graduated from the University of Frankfurt and The Hague Academy of International Law, before becoming a judge in Stettin. He was dismissed for acquitting a teacher who had been brought up on charges of excessive corporal punishment, probably at the instigation of the Hitler Youth.Morgen's interrogations by the American Counterintelligence Corps, U.S. National Archives, Record Group 238, Microfilm 1019, Roll 47, interrogation of 30 August 1946, pp. 2-3 At the outbreak of the war, he entered the Waffen-SS and was sent for basic military training. After the invasion of France in 1940, he was demobilized and employed as a judge in the SS Judiciary, which assigned him to its court in Krak√≥w. In Krak√≥w he investigated several highly placed SS officers for corruption, including Hermann Fegelein, a favorite of Heinrich Himmler's and the future brother-in- law of Eva Braun. He also exposed one of Fegelein's co-conspirators, Jaroslawa Mirowska, as the head of the Polish underground.Memos between Morgen, Norbert Pohl, and Martin Tondock, Nuremberg document NO-2366 After requesting a transfer, Morgen was instead dismissed by Himmler, ostensibly for acquitting an SS officer of the racial crime of sexual relations with an alien race, but also perhaps for meddling in Himmler's affairs.Morgen's CIC interrogation of 30 August 1946, pp. 18-19 He was punished by being sent to the Wiking Division on the Eastern Front. However, in mid-1943, Himmler recalled Morgen to investigate and prosecute corruption in the concentration camp system, which had become rampant, as reflected in Himmler's notorious Posen speeches. Morgen's investigations began with Karl-Otto Koch, the commandant of Buchenwald and Majdanek, Koch's wife Ilse Koch, sadistic SS NCO Martin Sommer, and Buchenwald's camp doctor Waldemar Hoven. Charges included theft, military insubordination, and murder.Morgen's Anklageschrift, in Nuremberg document NO-2366 Koch was tried, convicted, and executed shortly before the end of the war. In post-war testimony, Morgen claimed the stories of Frau Koch's fetish with lampshades made of human skin were merely a legend: he had personally searched Koch's home near Buchenwald and found nothing of the kind. He later told the American journalist John Toland that he persisted in denying the story while being threatened with beatings and while actually being beaten twice by his Allied interrogators after the war. 10 June 1947. \\"10 June.

Dr. Morgen was an investigator who came to Buchenwald to investigate Commander Koch, who was in charge at the time. As a result of Dr. Morgen's investigation Koch was arrested and executed. Dr. Morgen is also a prisoner at Dachau.\\" In addition to prosecuting concentration-camp officers, Morgen sought an arrest warrant for Adolf Eichmann,IMT (Blue Volume Series), Vol XX, 514. as Eichmann himself confirmed at his trial in Jerusalem,The Trial of Adolf Eichmann (1992), Session 39, 15 May 1961, Volume II, p. 712; also accessible at: http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ but Morgen's request was rejected. During the late summer and fall of 1943, Morgen looked into rumors that Christian Wirth ‚Äì who was, unbeknownst to Morgen, supervisor of the extermination centers of Operation Reinhard ‚Äì had permitted SS officers to participate in a drunken Jewish wedding near Lublin.IMT (Blue Volume Series), Vol XX, 492-93 Investigating, he found Wirth presiding over a collection center for vast quantities of clothing and valuables from the victims. On one visit to Lublin, Morgen became an accidental witness to the aftermath of Operation Harvest Festival: the liquidation of three large (Majdanek, Poniatowa, and Trawniki) and several smaller Jewish labor camps in the Lublin area. The operation, ostensibly a preemptive security measure, was said to have been ordered by Himmler on the grounds that the inmates had obtained weapons and made contact with communist partisans active in the surrounding forests.Report by Jakob Sporrenberg, Historische Mitteilungen 6 (1993): 250‚Äì277. In fact the Jews in each camp were disarmed with negligible resistance and no casualties; and during the mass executions which followed, carried out on the spot over a two-day span, some 43,000 male and female prisoners were shot. Morgen arrived the day after the massacre had ended.Morgen's affidavit to the Majdanek-Prozess, dated D√ºsseldorf 19 September 1973. Landgericht D√ºsseldorf I 4/71. Bundesarchiv Ludwigsburg B162/2359 He compiled a report from the testimony of eyewitnesses, a portion of which was read out in the pre-trial interrogation of Ernst Kaltenbrunner at Nuremberg: \\"the men went first, filing into one trench, and later the nude women had their own separate trenches....all passed silently and methodically through the trenches, so the executions went very quickly.\\"IMT (Red Volume series), Supplement Vol. B, pp. 1309-11 (Claims that Morgen was present at the massacre itself, and tried to prevent the industrialist Walter Toebbens from intervening, are unfounded.)The claim appears in Dan Kurzman (1976), The Bravest Battle - the Twenty-Eight days of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, p. 345. Two packages of dental gold, sent by an Auschwitz dental technician to his wife, had been confiscated by postal inspectors and passed on to Morgen for investigation.Morgen's testimony at the Frankfurt Auschwitz Prozess, Published as Der Auschwitz-Prozess : Tonbandmitschnitte, Protokolle, Dokumente, 25. Verhandlungstag 9.3.1964 (Berlin: Direct Media Publishing, 2004), pp. 5550‚Äì5693. Realizing that the gold must have been collected from Holocaust victims, Morgen sent an investigative team to Auschwitz and later visited himself, receiving a thorough tour of the killing center at Birkenau. His investigation was not welcomed though; his assistant SS-Stabsscharf√ºhrer Gerhard Putsch disappeared and the building where evidence files were stored was burned down. Although he could not prosecute the mass extermination of Jews ‚Äì which, as he explained after the war, was legalized by order of Hitler ‚Äì he still went on to prosecute the camp commandant Rudolf H√∂ss and the Chief of the camp Gestapo, Maximilian Grabner, for crimes including murder. Post- war After the war, Morgen was a witness at the trial of Nazi war criminals at the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, the trial of SS WVHA members, and the 1965 Auschwitz trial in Frankfurt‚Äìam‚ÄìMain. Morgen claimed after the war that the prosecutions were an attempt to impede the mass extermination, and two scholars who wrote a biography about Morgen found this explanation credible in light of the evidence. However, the reason for Morgen's opposition can be questioned, and the scholars noted that Morgen \\"deplored the concentration camp system not in principle but for its corrupting effects on individuals who went on to commit individual crimes.\\" After the Nuremberg trials, he continued his legal career in Frankfurt. Morgen appeared in the TV series \\"World at War\\", including in the programme \\"Hitler's Germany : Total War 1939 - 1945\\" (Part 5 DVD 1 in the DVD boxed set).

That is, they break faith with the candidate they were pledged to and vote for another candidate, or fail to vote. A pledged elector is only considered a faithless elector by breaking their pledge; unpledged electors have no pledge to break. Electors are typically chosen and nominated by a political party or the party's presidential nominee: they are usually party members with a reputation for high loyalty to the party and its chosen candidate. Thus, a faithless elector runs the risk of party censure and political retaliation from their party, as well as potential legal penalties in some states. Candidates for elector are nominated by state political parties in the months prior to Election Day. In some states, such as Indiana, the electors are nominated in primaries, the same way other candidates are nominated. In other states, such as Oklahoma, Virginia, and North Carolina, electors are nominated in party conventions. In Pennsylvania, the campaign committee of each candidate names their candidates for elector (an attempt to discourage faithless electors). In some states, high-ranking and/or well-known state officials up to and including governors often serve as electors whenever possible (the Constitution prohibits federal officials from acting as electors, but does not restrict state officials from doing so). The parties have generally been successful in keeping their electors faithful, leaving out the rare cases in which a candidate died before the elector was able to cast a vote. There have been a total of 165 instances of faithlessness , 63 of which occurred in 1872 when Horace Greeley died after Election Day but before the Electoral College convened. Nearly all have voted for third party candidates or non-candidates, as opposed to switching their support to a major opposing candidate. During the 1836 election, Virginia's entire 23-man electoral delegation faithlessly abstained from voting for victorious Democratic vice presidential nominee Richard M. Johnson. The loss of Virginia's support caused Johnson to fall one electoral vote short of a majority, causing the vice presidential election to be thrown into the U.S. Senate for the only time in American history. The presidential election itself was not in dispute because Virginia's electors voted for Democratic presidential nominee Martin Van Buren as pledged. The U.S. Senate ultimately elected Johnson as vice president after a party-line vote. The United States Constitution does not specify a notion of pledging; no federal law or constitutional statute binds an elector's vote to anything. All pledging laws originate at the state level; the U.S. Supreme Court upheld these state laws in its 1952 ruling Ray v. Blair. In 2020, the Supreme Court also ruled in Chiafalo v. Washington that states are free to enforce laws that bind electors to voting for the winner of the popular vote in their state. Legal rulings = Ray v. Blair = The constitutionality of state pledge laws was confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1952 in Ray v. BlairRay v. Blair in a 5‚Äì2 vote. The court ruled states have the right to require electors to pledge to vote for the candidate whom their party supports, and the right to remove potential electors who refuse to pledge prior to the election. The court also wrote: The ruling only held that requiring a pledge, not a vote, was constitutional and Justice Jackson, joined by Justice Douglas, wrote in his dissent: One recent legal scholar believes \\"a state law that would thwart a federal elector‚Äôs discretion at an extraordinary time when it reasonably must be exercised would clearly violate Article II and the Twelfth Amendment\\". = Chiafalo v. Washington and Colorado Department of State v. Baca = , 33 states plus the District of Columbia have laws against faithless electors, though the laws in half of these jurisdictions have no enforcement mechanism. Washington became the first state to fine faithless electors after the 2016 election. In lieu of penalizing a faithless elector, some states such as Colorado, Michigan, and Minnesota specify a faithless elector's vote be voided. Colorado was the first state to void an elector's attempted faithless vote during the 2016 electoral college vote. Minnesota also invoked this law for the first time in 2016 when an elector pledged to Hillary Clinton attempted to vote for Bernie Sanders instead. Until 2008, Minnesota's electors cast secret ballots. Although the final count would reveal the occurrence of faithless votes (except in the unlikely case of two or more changes canceling out), it was impossible to determine which elector(s) were faithless. After an unknown elector was faithless in 2004, Minnesota amended its law to require public balloting of the electors' votes and invalidate any vote cast for someone other than the candidate to whom the elector was pledged. After the 2016 election, electors who attempted to switch their votes in Washington and Colorado were subjected to enforcement of their state's faithless elector laws. The electors received legal assistance from the non-profit advocacy group Equal Citizens founded by Lawrence Lessig. The Colorado case, Baca v. Colorado Department of State, was initially dismissed by the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. On appeal, the 10th Circuit ruled in August 2019 that Colorado's faithless elector law is unconstitutional. Specifically, the opinion held that electors have a constitutional right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice and are not bound by any prior pledges they may have made. The opinion said the act of voting for president in the electoral college is a federal function not subject to state law and state laws requiring electors to vote only for the candidates they pledged are unconstitutional and unenforceable. On October 16, 2019, Colorado appealed the 10th Circuit's decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The decision conflicted with an earlier May 2019 decision by the Washington Supreme Court In re Guerra, in which three electors who had $1000 fines imposed on them for violating their pledges appealed the fines, which were upheld. In contrast to the Colorado case, the Washington court held that presidential electors are state officials under the control of state law and can be criminally punished by a state if they do not vote as they pledged. On October 7, 2019, these electors also appealed their case to the U.S. Supreme Court. On July 6, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously in both Chiafalo v. Washington and Colorado Department of State v. Baca that states may enforce laws to punish faithless electors. History Over 58 elections, 165 electors have not cast their votes for president or vice president as prescribed by the legislature of the state they represented. Of those: * 71 electors changed their votes because the candidate to whom they were pledged died before the electoral ballot (in 1872 and 1912). * 1 elector chose to abstain from voting for any candidate (in 2000). * 93 were changed typically by the elector's personal preference, although there have been some instances where the change may have been caused by an honest mistake. Usually, faithless electors act alone, although on occasion a faithless elector has attempted to induce other electors to change their votes in concert, usually with little if any success. One exception was the 1836 election, in which all 23 Virginia electors acted together, altering the outcome of the electoral college vote but failing to change the outcome of the overall election. The Democratic ticket won states with 170 of the 294 electoral votes, but the 23 Virginia electors abstained in the vote for vice president, meaning the Democratic nominee, Richard M. Johnson, got only 147 votes, exactly half of the electoral college (one short of being elected). Johnson was subsequently elected vice president by the U.S. Senate. List of faithless electors The following is a list of all faithless electors (in reverse chronological order). The number preceding each entry is the number of faithless electors for the given year. =2016= 10 ‚Äì 2016 election: In Washington, Democratic party electors gave three presidential votes to Colin Powell and one to Faith Spotted Eagle and these electors cast vice-presidential votes for Elizabeth Warren, Maria Cantwell, Susan Collins, and Winona LaDuke. In Hawaii, Bernie Sanders received one presidential vote and Elizabeth Warren received one vice-presidential vote. In Texas, Christopher Suprun voted for John Kasich for president and another elector voted for Ron Paul, giving each one presidential vote. Suprun also voted for Carly Fiorina as vice president while the other elector voted for Mike Pence as pledged. In addition, three other electors attempted to vote against their pledges, but had their votes invalidated. In Colorado, Kasich received one vote for president, which was invalidated. Two additional electors, one in Maine and one in Minnesota, cast votes for Sanders for president but had their votes invalidated; the elector in Maine was forced to cast a vote for Clinton, while the elector in Minnesota was replaced by one who cast a vote for Clinton. The same Minnesota elector voted for Tulsi Gabbard for vice president, but had that vote invalidated and given to Tim Kaine. =2000 to 2004= 1 ‚Äì 2004 election: An anonymous Minnesota elector, pledged for Democrats John Kerry and John Edwards, cast his or her presidential vote for , rather than Kerry, presumably by accident. All of Minnesota's electors cast their vice presidential ballots for John Edwards, including the elector who cast the anomalous presidential vote. Minnesota's electors cast secret ballots, so the identity of the faithless elector is not known. As a result of this incident, Minnesota statutes were amended to provide for public balloting of the electors' votes and invalidation of a vote cast for someone other than the candidate to whom the elector is pledged. 1 ‚Äì 2000 election: Washington, D.C. Elector Barbara Lett-Simmons, pledged for Democrats Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, cast no electoral votes as a protest of Washington D.C.'s lack of voting congressional representation. Lett-Simmons's electoral college abstention, the first since 1864, was intended to protest what Lett-Simmons referred to as the federal district's \\"colonial status\\". Lett-Simmons described her blank ballot as an act of civil disobedience, not an act of a faithless elector; Lett-Simmons supported Gore and would have voted for Gore if she had thought he had a chance to win. =1968 to 1996= 1 ‚Äì 1988 election: West Virginia Elector Margarette Leach, pledged for Democrats Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, instead cast her votes for the candidates in the reverse of their positions on the national ticket as a form of protest against the winner-take-all custom of the Electoral College; her presidential vote went to Bentsen and her vice-presidential vote to Dukakis. 1 ‚Äì 1976 election: Washington Elector Mike Padden, pledged for Republicans Gerald Ford and Bob Dole, cast his presidential electoral vote for Ronald Reagan, who had challenged Ford for the Republican nomination. He cast his vice presidential vote, as pledged, for Dole. 1 ‚Äì 1972 election: Virginia Elector Roger MacBride, pledged for Republicans Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew, cast his electoral votes for Libertarian candidates John Hospers and Tonie Nathan. MacBride's vice-presidential vote for Nathan was the first electoral vote cast for a woman in U.S. history. 1 ‚Äì 1968 election: North Carolina Elector Lloyd W. Bailey, pledged for Republicans Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew, cast his votes for American Independent Party candidates George Wallace and Curtis LeMay. Bailey later stated at a Senate hearing that he would have voted for Nixon and Agnew if his vote would have altered the outcome of the election. =1912 to 1960= 1 ‚Äì 1960 election: Oklahoma Elector Henry D. Irwin, pledged for Republicans Richard Nixon and Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., contacted the other 218 Republican electors to convince them to cast presidential electoral votes for Democratic non-candidate Harry F. Byrd and vice-presidential electoral votes for Republican Barry Goldwater. Most replied they had a moral obligation to vote for Nixon, while Irwin voted for Byrd and Goldwater. Fourteen unpledged electors (eight from Mississippi and six from Alabama) also voted for Byrd for president, but supported Strom Thurmond for vice president ‚Äì since they were not pledged to anyone, their action was not faithless. 1 ‚Äì 1956 election: Alabama Elector W. F. Turner, pledged for Democrats Adlai Stevenson and Estes Kefauver, cast his votes for Judge Walter Burgwyn Jones and Herman Talmadge, the former Governor of Georgia. 1 ‚Äì 1948 election: Tennessee Elector Preston Parks was a candidate to be an elector for both the Democratic Party candidate, Harry S. Truman, and the States' Rights Democratic Party candidate, Strom Thurmond. Though the national Democratic Party won the election, Parks had actively campaigned for Thurmond and he voted for Thurmond and Fielding L. Wright. 8 ‚Äì 1912 election: the Republican vice-presidential candidate, James S. Sherman, died six days before the popular election. The Republicans had won only two states, Utah and Vermont, and Nicholas M. Butler was hastily designated to receive the eight electoral votes that were pledged to Sherman. All eight Republican electors accordingly voted for Butler for vice president. =1872 to 1896= 27 ‚Äì 1896 election: The Democratic Party and the People's Party both ran William Jennings Bryan as their presidential candidate, but ran different candidates for vice president: the Democratic Party nominated Arthur Sewall and the People‚Äôs Party nominated Thomas E. Watson. Although the Populist ticket did not win the popular vote in any state, 27 Democratic electors cast their vice-presidential vote for Watson instead of Sewall. 1 ‚Äì 1892 election: An elector from Oregon pledged to vote for Benjamin Harrison voted for the third-party Populist candidate James B. Weaver. 63 ‚Äì 1872 election: Horace Greeley, the Liberal Republican/Democrat nominee, died on November 29 shortly before the Electoral College vote in December. Three electors voted for the deceased Greeley as pledged, while the other 63 electors pledged to Greeley voted for other persons, with 18 of them casting their presidential votes for Greeley's running mate, Benjamin Gratz Brown, and the remaining 45 scattering their presidential votes among three non-candidates. The three posthumous presidential votes cast for Greeley were rejected by Congress. =1812 to 1840= 1 ‚Äì 1840 election: One elector from Virginia, Arthur Smith of Isle of Wight County, was pledged to vote for Democratic candidates Martin Van Buren for president and Richard M. Johnson for vice president; however, he voted for James K. Polk for vice president.Niles National Register, Vol. LIX, December 5, 1840, page 217 23 ‚Äì 1836 election: The 23 electors from Virginia were pledged to vote for Democratic candidates Martin Van Buren for president and Richard M. Johnson for vice president. However, they refused to vote for Johnson because of his open liaison with a slave mistress and voted instead for Senator William Smith of South Carolina, which left Johnson with 147 electoral votes, one short of a majority. Johnson was subsequently elected vice president after a contingent election in the Senate. 30 ‚Äì 1832 election: All 30 electors from Pennsylvania refused to vote for the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Martin Van Buren, voting instead for William Wilkins. 7 ‚Äì 1828 election: Seven of the nine electors from Georgia refused to vote for vice-presidential candidate John C. Calhoun; they instead cast their vice-presidential votes for William Smith. 1 ‚Äì 1820 election: William Plumer was pledged to vote for Democratic- Republican presidential candidate James Monroe, who was not contested for re- election, but he instead cast his vote for John Quincy Adams, who was not a candidate in the election. Some historians contend Plumer wanted George Washington to be the only unanimous selection, or that he wanted to draw attention to his friend Adams as a potential candidate. These claims are disputed. Plumer also cast his vice-presidential vote for Richard Rush, not Daniel D. Tompkins as pledged. 3 ‚Äì 1812 election: Three electors pledged to vote for Federalist vice-presidential candidate Jared Ingersoll instead voted for Elbridge Gerry. =Before 1812= 6 ‚Äì 1808 election: Six electors from New York were pledged to vote for Democratic-Republican James Madison for president and former New York governor George Clinton for vice president. Instead, they voted for Clinton for president, with three voting for Madison for vice president and the other three voting for James Monroe for vice president. 19 ‚Äì 1796 election: Samuel Miles, an elector from Pennsylvania, was pledged to vote for Federalist presidential candidate John Adams, but voted for Democratic-Republican candidate Thomas Jefferson. He cast his other vote as pledged for Thomas Pinckney; there was no provision at the time for specifying president or vice president. An additional 18 electors voted for Adams as pledged, but refused to vote for Pinckney.Chernow, Ron. Alexander Hamilton. New York: Penguin, 2004. p. 514. This was an attempt to foil Alexander Hamilton's rumored plan to elect Pinckney as president, and this resulted in the unintended outcome that Adams' opponent, Jefferson, was elected vice president instead of Adams' running mate, Pinckney. This was the only time in U.S. history that the president and vice president have been from different parties, except for 1864 (although in that year, while the president and vice president were from different parties, they ran on one ticket from the same third party), and the only time the winners were from different tickets. After the 1800 election resulted in a deadlock, the Twelfth Amendment was ratified in 1804. It changed the election procedure so that instead of casting two votes of the same type, electors would make an explicit choice for president and vice president.

It is the sixth highest mountain in the United States and the third highest volcano behind Mount Bona and Mount Blackburn. The south face of the volcano, at the head of the Sanford Glacier, rises in resulting in one of the steepest gradients in North America.  Geology  Mount Sanford is mainly composed of andesite, and is an ancient peak, being mostly Pleistocene, although some of the upper parts of the mountain may be Holocene. The mountain first began developing 900,000 years ago, when it began growing on top of three smaller shield volcanoes that had coalesced. Although obscured by icefields, the uppermost of the mountain appear to be a lava dome filling a larger summit crater. Two notable events in the mountain's history include a large rhyolite flow which traveled some to the north east of the peak and has a volume of about , and another flow which erupted from a rift zone on the flank of the volcano some 320,000 years ago. The second flow was basaltic in nature and marks the most recent activity of the volcano. The flow was dated using radiometric methods. Observers have reported minor activity at Sanford, primarily vapor clouds or plumes from ice and rockfalls. Some reported incidents may have been orographic clouds, while others have been interpreted as avalanches. The majority of Mount Sanford above is covered by icefields, merging to the south with that surrounding Mount Wrangell. The largest glacier on Sanford is the Sanford Glacier, whose source lies at the steep cirque that cuts into the south side of the mountain.  History  The mountain was named in 1885 by Lieutenant Henry T. Allen of the U.S. Army, a descendant of Reuben Sanford. Mount Sanford was first climbed on July 21, 1938 by noted mountaineers Terris Moore and Bradford Washburn, via the still standard North Ramp route up the Sheep Glacier. This route \\"offers little technical difficulty\\" and \\"is a glacier hike all the way to the summit\\" but is still a serious mountaineering challenge (Alaska Grade 2) due to the altitude and latitude of the peak. The base of the route is usually accessed by air, but landing near the mountain is not straightforward. On March 12, 1948, Northwest Airlines Flight 4422 crashed into Mount Sanford. All 24 passengers and 6 crew members were killed. The wreckage was quickly covered by snow and was not found again until 1999. The first solo ascent of Sanford was achieved on September 19, 1968, by Japanese mountaineer Naomi Uemura, who later died just after making the first solo winter ascent of Denali.

Japan invaded and conquered the island in a few days, facing Dutch, American and Australian forces. The chaotic and sometimes bloody fighting was followed by a series of major Japanese war crimes. Background During 1941, as the Allies perceived the possibility of war with Japan, the island of Ambon was seen to be a strategic location, because of its potential as a major air base. The Australian government and military commanders saw that it could be used in raids on northern Australia and decided to reinforce the Dutch forces on the island. On 14 December 1941, a convoy composed of escorts and with the Dutch ships Both, Valentijn, and Patras carrying 1,090 troops of \\"Gull Force\\" departed Darwin and arrived at Ambon on 17 December. escorting Bantam arrived with reinforcements on 12 January 1942, remaining through raids on 15‚Äì16 December until 18 December. =Geography= Ambon is located in the Maluku (Moluccas) islands, just south of the much larger island of Seram (Ceram). Ambon has what might be described as a \\"figure eight\\" or \\"hourglass\\" shape, and consists of two peninsulas separated by a narrow isthmus, with long narrow bays on either side of the isthmus. The key airport at Laha is in the west of the Hitu Peninsula ‚Äì northern part of the island ‚Äì facing Ambon Bay. The town of Ambon is at the opposite side of the bay, on the southern part of the island, Laitimor Peninsula. Opposing Forces =Allies= Infantry At the outbreak of war on 8 December, Ambon was garrisoned by the 2,800-strong Molukken Brigade of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) garrison, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Kapitz and consisting of Indonesian colonial troops, under European officers. The garrison was poorly equipped and trained, partly as a result of the Netherlands having been defeated and occupied by Nazi Germany. The KNIL units were not equipped with radios and relied on landlines and written communications. They included 300 partly trained reservists. The Australian Army's 1,100-strong Gull Force, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Leonard Roach, arrived on 17 December. The force consisted of the 2/21st Battalion from the Australian 8th Division, as well as some divisional artillery and support units. Kapitz was appointed Allied commander on Ambon. Roach had visited the island before Gull Force's deployment and requested that more artillery and machine gun units be sent from Australia. On 6 January, after Dutch and British territories to the north fell to Japan, Ambon came under attack from Japanese aircraft. Roach complained about the lack of response to his suggestions, and as a result he was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel John Scott on 14 January. Kapitz's headquarters was at Halong, between Paso and the town of Ambon. It included four armoured cars, an anti-aircraft machine gun detachment and four 40 mm AA guns. In the belief that the terrain on the south coast of Laitimor was too inhospitable for landings and that any attack was likely to be in the east, around the Bay of Baguala, the KNIL forces were concentrated at Paso, near the isthmus, under Major H. H. L. Tieland. There were small KNIL detachments at likely landing places in the north of Hitu. Two companies of the 2/21st Battalion and 300 Dutch troops were at Laha Airfield, under the command of Major Mark Newbury. They were accompanied by Dutch artillery: four 75 mm field artillery pieces, four 37 mm anti-tank guns, four 75 mm anti-aircraft (AA) guns, four 40 mm AA guns, an AA machine gun platoon and an AA machine gun battery. However, Lieutenant Colonel Scott, Gull Force HQ and the remainder of the Australian troops were concentrated in the western part of Laitimor Peninsula, in case of an attack from the Bay of Ambon. \\"A\\" Company of the 2/21st and one KNIL company were stationed at Eri, on the south west side of the bay. The 2/21st Battalion's pioneer platoon was on the plateau around Mt Nona (the highest point on Laitimor), with a Dutch anti-aircraft machine gun detachment. Smaller Australian detachments were at: Latuhalat, near the south western tip of Laitimor and at Cape Batuanjut, just north of Eri. Gull Force HQ and a strategic reserve, \\"D\\" Company, were located on a line from the Nona plateau to Amahusu beach, between Eri and the town of Ambon. Air Forces The Allies had few aircraft to spare. The KNIL Air Service sent No. 2 Flight, Group IV (2-Vl. G.IV) from Java to Laha. Of an original four Brewster Buffalos, two crashed en route to Ambon. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) sent two flights, comprising 12 Lockheed Hudson Mk 2 light bombers, from No. 13 and No. 2 Squadrons, to the area, under Wing Commander Ernest Scott (who was not related to Lieutenant Colonel John Scott). One flight was based at Laha, and another was sent to Namlea on the neighbouring island of Buru. The U.S. Navy's Patrol Wing 10, with Consolidated PBY Catalinas, was based at the Halong seaplane station from 23 December. Wing Headquarters moved to Java on 9 January, but American Catalinas mounted patrols from Halong until 15 January when an air raid destroyed three patrol aircraft and damaged several others. The Allies then abandoned the base as it was too exposed. The Wing's seaplane tenders supported patrols, but left after 8 January. Tender-based patrols from and at anchorages further south continued until 5 February. The Royal Netherlands Naval Air Service (Marineluchtvaartdienst) flew patrols from Ambon/Halong; GVT 17 with Catalina flying boats continued from the start of war through 14 January, when it was ordered to Java. U.S. Navy and RAAF aircraft made several very dangerous evacuation flights into Ambon/Laha in the last days of January. Naval forces , a Royal Netherlands Navy minelayer, left Ambon in early January, after mining approaches to the island. By mid-January, the minesweeper USS Heron was the only Allied combat ship at Ambon. =Japan= Naval forces The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) task force for the invasion of Ambon, commanded by Rear Admiral Ib≈ç Takahashi consisted of: *2 heavy cruisers (, ) *1 light cruiser () *15 destroyers (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , ) *2 seaplane tenders (, ) *5 minesweepers (W-7, W-8, W-9, W-11, W-12) *3 submarine chasers (CH-1, CH-2, CH-3) *2 patrol boats (P-34, P-39) *1 aircraft transport (Katsuragi Maru) *10 transports (Africa Maru, Hino Maru No. 5, Kirishima Maru, Lyons Maru, Miike Maru, Ryoyo Maru, ', Yamagiri Maru, Yamaura Maru, Zenyo Maru) *1 oiler (Shinkoku Maru) ‚Äì provided fuel and then left the area. The 2nd Carrier Division was assigned to support the operation: *2 aircraft carriers (, ) ‚Äì attacked Ambon on 24 January 1942 ‚Äì launched 54 aircraft (18 B5N2 \\"Kate\\" torpedo bombers, 18 D3A1 \\"Val\\" dive bombers, and 18 A6M2 \\"Zero\\" fighters) and bombed port facilities and buildings on Ambon. No losses were sustained. The carrier fleet returned to Davao, Philippines on 25 January 1942 prior to the invasion on 30 January 1942. Infantry The Japanese ground forces were made up of about 5,300 personnel: the It≈ç Detachment of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA), under Major General Takeo It≈ç, comprising the 38th Division HQ and the 228th Infantry Regiment, along with marines from the 1st Kure Special Naval Landing Force (part of the China Area Fleet), and two platoons of the Sasebo SNLF under Rear Admiral Koichiro Hatakeyama. Battle =30 January= From 6 January onward, Ambon was attacked by Japanese aircraft. Allied aircraft made some sorties against the approaching Japanese fleet, with little success. On 13 January, the two Brewster Buffalo fighters, piloted by Lt Broers and Sgt Blans, attacked a flight of 10 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters.Paul Andriessen, 2006, \\"Brewster 339/439 in the East Indies\\" (synopsis of Hugo Hooftman, c. 1966, Van Glenn Martins en Mustangs, Alle vliegtuigen die hebben gevlogen bij het KNIL, de Indische militaire luchtvaart, Dutch Maritime Archives). Access date: 30 October 2007. Broers' aircraft was hit and caught fire, but he continued to attack until it became uncontrollable, at which point he abandoned the Buffalo, using his parachute and landed in the sea. Blans was also shot down but also managed to use his parachute, landing in trees on Ambon. Both men were rescued. Broers suffered severe burns and Blans had 17 different wounds. The naval aviation base at Halong was soon rendered unusable by Japanese air raids, and was abandoned by the Dutch and U.S. navies in mid-January. On 30 January, about 1,000 Japanese marines and IJA personnel landed at Hitu-lama on the north coast. Other elements of the 228th Regiment landed on the southern coast of the Laitimor Peninsula. Although the Japanese ground forces were numerically not much bigger than the Allies, the Japanese had overwhelming superiority in air support, naval and field artillery, and tanks. The remaining Allied aircraft were withdrawn that day, although RAAF ground staff remained. Within a day of the Japanese landings, the Dutch detachments in their vicinity were overrun and/or had withdrawn towards Paso. The destruction of bridges on Hitu was not carried out as ordered, hastening the Japanese advance. There was a second wave of landings, at Hutumori in south-eastern Laitimor, and at Batugong, near Paso. An Australian infantry platoon was detached to reinforce the pioneers on Nona plateau. The defences at Paso had been designed to repel attacks from the north and west, and now faced assault from the south. A KNIL platoon was detached from Paso to resist the attack on Batugong, causing a gap in the Dutch lines. The Japanese took advantage of this, and were assisted by the failure of a KNIL telephone line. =31 January= Batugong fell in the early hours of 31 January, enabling the Japanese to encircle the eastern flank of the Passo positions. Meanwhile, Kapitz ordered the Ambonese KNIL company at Eri to take up a position at Kudamati, which appeared prone to attack. At noon on 31 January, Kapitz moved his headquarters from Halong to , closer to . Telephone communications between Kapitz and his subordinates, including Lieutenant Colonel Scott, ceased when the Japanese cut the lines. The Japanese force which had landed at Hitu-Lama then attacked the Passo defences from the north-east. Then, in the words of the Australian official historian: :[a]t 6 p.m. a motor-cycle with sidecar was seen on the road to the west of the Passo position showing white flags and travelling towards the Japanese. Firing on the Passo perimeter was suspended on the orders of the Dutch company commanders, and the troops were allowed to rest and eat. It is not clear who authorised the surrender. There was no immediate response from the Japanese, and ‚Äì in a meeting with company commanders ‚Äì Kapitz and Tieland ordered the Dutch troops to recommence fighting. However, when Tieland and the company commanders returned to their positions, they found that their troops had been taken prisoner, and they were forced to surrender. The first land attack on Laha occurred on the afternoon of 31 January. An Australian platoon north-east of the airfield was attacked by a stronger Japanese force, which it repelled. Japanese forces were also approaching the town of Ambon from the south west. At about 04:00pm on 31 January, the Japanese captured the town, including an Australian casualty clearing unit. =1 February= Several Japanese attacks were launched simultaneously on 1 February: *Kapitz and his headquarters staff were taken prisoner in the early hours. Kapitz surrendered the remaining forces in the Paso area and sent a note to Lieutenant Colonel Scott urging him to do the same. (The message did not reach Scott for two days.) *an Australian transport unit and KNIL positions at Kudamati were attacked by infantry *mountain guns in high ground were shelling a Dutch artillery battery on the coast at Benteng, which was forced to withdraw, putting further pressure on Kudamati. *infantry attacked the eastern flank of Australian positions at Amahusu. *on Nona plateau, a foothold was established in spite of fierce Australian opposition. *Japanese aircraft and naval artillery attacks on the positions at Eri. The Australian positions were also receiving large numbers of Dutch personnel fleeing from Paso. At 22:30, Scott ordered a withdrawal of the Allied forces at Amahusu and the south-west, to Eri. The position at Kudamati was effectively encircled. =2‚Äì3 February= On 2 February (some sources say 1 February), the Japanese W-7-class minesweeper W-9 struck a mine laid by the Dutch minelayer HNLMS Gouden Leeuw in the Ambon Bay and sank. Two other Japanese minesweepers were also damaged by mines. After dawn on 2 February, the main Australian force on Nona plateau, commanded by Lieutenant Bill Jinkins, was in danger of encirclement. Jinkins ordered a withdrawal to Amahusu, where he became aware that the Dutch had surrendered. Unable to ascertain the disposition of Lieutenant Colonel Scott's force, Jinkins decided to meet senior Japanese officers under truce at the town of Ambon. They allowed him to speak to Kapitz, who wrote another note advising the Australian commander to surrender. Jinkins set off to find Lieutenant Colonel Scott. Meanwhile, the Japanese forces attacking Laha were reinforced and a concentrated assault on the Allies began, including naval artillery, dive bombers, fighter planes and probing attacks by infantry. A Japanese night attack in high grass near the beach, between two Allied positions, was beaten back by an Australian platoon. However, a massive Japanese offensive commenced at dawn on 2 February. By 10:00am, only about 150 Australians and several KNIL personnel were still able to fight at Laha, and Newbury ordered them to surrender. By the morning of 3 February, the Australians around Eri were struggling to cope with increasing air and naval attacks, wounded Australians, the influx of Dutch personnel, diminishing supplies and widespread fatigue. A Japanese flag had been seen flying on the other side of the bay, at Laha. By the time Jinkins reached Lieutenant Colonel Scott, the latter had himself met the Japanese and decided to surrender. The Allied position at Kudamati was surrendered separately at midday. Aftermath =Laha massacre= Ambon War Cemetery currently holds the graves of 1,956 servicemen, mostly Australian, Dutch and British. Allied casualties in the battle were relatively light. However, at intervals for a fortnight after the surrender, IJN personnel chose more than 300 Australian and Dutch prisoners of war at random and summarily executed them, at or near Laha airfield. In part, this was revenge for the sinking of the Japanese minesweeper, as some surviving crew of the minesweeper took part. Those killed included Wing Commander Scott and Major Newbury. According to an Australian War Memorial principal historian, Dr Peter Stanley, over the following three and a half years, the surviving POWs: :...suffered an ordeal and a death rate second only to the horrors of Sandakan, first on Ambon and then after many were sent to the island of Hainan [China] late in 1942. Three-quarters of the Australians captured on Ambon had died before the war's end. Of the 582 who remained on Ambon, 405 died. They died of overwork, malnutrition, disease and one of the most brutal regimes among camps in which bashings were routine.Peter Stanley, 2002, \\"Remembering 1942: The defence of the 'Malay barrier': Rabaul and Ambon, January 1942\\". Access date: 21 October 2007. In 1946, incidents which followed the fall of Ambon became the subject of one of the largest ever war crimes trials: 93 Japanese personnel were tried by an Australian military tribunal at Ambon. Rear Admiral Hatakeyama was found to have ordered the Laha massacres, however he had died before he could be tried.Department of Veterans' Affairs (Australia), 2006, \\"Fall of Ambon: Massacred at Laha\\" . Access date: 21 October 2007. Commander Kunito Hatakeyama, who was in direct command of the massacres, was sentenced to execution by hanging. Lieutenant Kenichi Nakagawa was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. Three other Japanese officers were executed for mistreatment of POWs and/or civilians on other occasions, during 1942‚Äì45. (The trials were the basis for the feature film Blood Oath, released in 1990.) General It≈ç was sentenced to death that same year for war crimes committed in other parts of the Pacific. =Other subsequent events= Approximately 30 Australian soldiers, including Jinkins, escaped from Ambon, in the space of several weeks after the surrender, often by rowing prahus (canoes) to Seram. Another result of the capture of Ambon was the realisation of Australian fears of air attacks, when Japanese planes based at Ambon took part in major air raids on Darwin, Australia on 19 February.

The unincorporated community of Prudenville is at the southeastern end of the lake, while the unincorporated communities of Houghton Lake and Houghton Lake Heights are on the southwest and west shores. It is the largest inland lake in the state of Michigan, and one of the largest natural inland lakes in the United States (many man-made impoundments are much larger). The lake is approximately north to south, and about at it widest point. Houghton Lake has c. of total shoreline and its waters cover . It is an extremely popular resort and fishing area year round. Houghton Lake is the site of Tip-Up-Town USA, a large ice fishing and winter sports festival with several events on the frozen waters of the lake itself. Houghton Lake is named after the first state geologist, Douglass Houghton who explored the area. Houghton County, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is also named after Douglass Houghton. The name of the lake is pronounced by Michigan citizens as \\"HOTE'n\\" (/Ààho ä înÃ©/). The lake receives the waters of spring-fed Higgins Lake through the Cut River and, in turn, is the headwaters for the Muskegon River, which flows out of the North Bay in the northwest corner of the lake. The lake is partially within four townships: Markey Township on the northeast, Denton Township on the southeast, Roscommon Township on the southwest, and Lake Township on the northwest. The lake is mid to late mesotrophic in profile, and is considered to be a warm water, shallow lake, with the average depth being 7¬Ω feet. The deepest spot is a small hole in East Bay that has been sounded to , but it is rare to encounter depths of greater than in the lake. The lake offers almost every species of game and panfish found in Michigan with the exception of the trout/salmon families, the sturgeon, the muskellunge, and white bass. Common catches include northern pike, bluegill, walleye, crappie, yellow perch and both largemouth bass and smallmouth bass. M-55 follows the southern shore, while U.S. Highway 127 passes just to the west. M-18 and Interstate 75 pass just to the east. Houghton Lake is notable for the annual winter carnival, Tip Up Town USA, which is held during two consecutive weekends in January. The name for the festival originated from the flag-like devices - \\"tip-ups\\", used for ice fishing. The USA was added later. Tip Up Town Badges, required for entry to the Tip Up Town site on the south shore of Houghton Lake, are sold annually at local businesses.

The drawl is often perceived as a method of speaking more slowly and may be erroneously attributed to laziness or fatigue. That particular speech pattern exists primarily in varieties of English and is most noticeable of which are Southern American English, Broad Australian English, and Broad New Zealand English. It is believed to have its origin in the 1590-1600s Dutch or Low German word \\"dralen\\" /ÀàdraÀêl…ô(n)/, meaning \\"to linger.\\"\\"drawl.\\" Merriam-Webster.com. 2018. https://www.merriam-webster.com (8 May 2011). The most commonly-recognized Southern Drawl features the diphthongization or triphthongization of the traditional short front vowels, as in the words pat, pet, and pit, especially at the end of sentences. They develop a glide up from their original starting position to and, in some cases, back down to schwa.  Southern drawl  The Southern American English drawl, or \\"Southern drawl,\\" involves vowel diphthongization of the front pure vowels, or the \\"prolongation of the most heavily stressed syllables, with the corresponding weakening of the less stressed ones, so that there is an illusion of slowness even though the tempo may be fast.\\" = Characteristics = One characteristic of southern drawl is vowel breaking. A monophthong changes into a diphthong or triphthong (monophthongization). The southern drawl has the short front vowels [√¶], […õ], and […™] become accompanied by an off-glide […ô], also known as a schwa, such as in the words pat [p√¶(…ô)t], pet [p…õ(…ô)t], and pit [p…™(…ô)t]. Thar is accompanied in older Southern American English by a second very noticeable characteristic, known as the loss of postvocalic /r/, or r-dropping. Along with the elongation of the vowels, in words with /r/ immediately after a laxed vowel or appearing at the end of an utterance, the /r/ is dropped altogether and is usually replaced by a schwa, or velar glide. That is the most easily recognizable form of drawl among English-speakers. : sat [s√¶t] > [s√¶iÃØ…ôt] : set [s…õt] > [s…õiÃØ…ôt] : sit [s…™t] > [s…™iÃØ…ôt] * Glide (schwa): pitch lowers, stretches in central vowels, and becomes lax * Monophthongs, Diphthongs, and Triphthongs: singular, doublet, and triplet vowel sounds in an utterance: \\"Ha,\\" \\"Heya,\\" \\"Greetings!\\" = History = With their settlement of the Americas by immigrants from southern England and Scotland, where r-dropping dialects had become popularized by prestige and adopted by the majority of speakers, drawling speech already had some root in the English language. As agriculture became more relevant, Southern European settlers slowly migrated south towards the prime farmlands of tidewater zones along the southern coast. Scottish immigrants, meanwhile, moved west and then south, following the major waterways. The already-popular r-dropping speaking patterns became more and more pronounced over time by the drawing out of vowels, which is familiar today. Meanwhile, as slavery took hold in the economy of southern plantations, more and more blacks were introduced to the r-dropping drawl pattern of English through their captors. Meanwhile, the Northern European drawl moved south from the midwest, bringing its own r-retaining speech patterns to the mix. Rather than dropping postvocalic /r/, the Northern speech emphasized it. In the 1900s, well after the different speech patterns had established themselves to some degree in both the white and black populations of the Southern United States, the Great Migration (African American) drew large swathes of blacks and their mixed form of drawling speech to the areas along the Sun Belt and west coast. That speech pattern had already become somewhat established as today's African American Vernacular English, and is by far the most common form of r-dropping southern speech.  Social perceptions  A drawl in Southern English is often associated with social stereotypes, both positive and negative. Studies have shown that American adults tend to attribute Southern English with friendliness and Northern English with intelligence. Many people consider Northern English a neutral, unmarked variety and do not even realize that it is an accent. The Southern drawl is associated with negative stereotypes with regard to intelligence and work ethic, with a drawl coming across as lazy or unintelligent. A study in 2011 by Rakic and others showed evidence that when people categorize others, a person's accent mattered more than apparent ethnicity. In 2014, the US Department of Energy at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee offered a voluntary \\"Southern Accent Reduction\\" classes so that employees could be \\"remembered for what they said rather than their accents.\\" The course offered accent neutralization through codeswitching. The class was canceled because of the resulting controversy and complaints from Southern employees, who were offended by the class since it stigmatized Southern accents. That event demonstrated that a bias exists against Southern American English, with Northern varieties being favored by some employers. In a study of children's attitudes about accents, Tennessee children from 5 to 6 were indifferent about the qualities of persons with different accents, but children from Chicago were not. Chicago children from 5 to 6, who spoke Northern English, were much more likely to attach positive traits to Northern-speakers. The study's results suggest that social perceptions of Southern English are taught by parents to children and exist for no biological reason.Katherine D. Kinzler & Jasmine M. DeJesus (2012): Northern = smart and Southern = nice: The development of accent attitudes in the United States, The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, DOI:10.1080/17470218.2012.731695  Broad Australian  Broad Australian likely emerged from New South Wales, in southeastern Australia, in the early 1800s, when the population was significantly increasing by the importation of convicts. Many of the convicts came from Britain and Ireland, the origin of Broad Australian. However, the area was relatively isolated from outside influences which fostered the growth of a new dialect. In the late 1800s, people from New South Wales began to move to other parts of the continent because of increased overseas immigration, gold rushes, and other factors. = Vowel changes = /o ä/ has a lowered first target and a lowered and fronted second target /u/ is lowered /i/ significant onglide - The degree of this onglide is affected by age and is less marked by younger speakers than older speakers /…ú/ is fronted /a ä/ has a fronted and raised first target /e…™/ has a retracted first target /a…™/ has a retracted and raised first target /…™…ô/ has a diminished offglide /…õ…ô/ has a diminished offglide The \\"cavalry drawl\\" was a phenomenon of English-speaking officers of England, which was noted around 1840.

Broad New Zealand  Broad New Zealand, much like Broad Australian, began taking hold in the late 1800s when people from the British Isles brought their varieties of English to New Zealand.

Early life and career Kent was born in Newchwang, Manchuria, where his father was the US Consul. He was educated at St. Albans School in Washington, D.C., followed by Princeton University where he studied history, George Washington University, the Sorbonne (where he studied Russian) and the University of Madrid. Through his father's connections, he joined the State Department and was posted to Moscow under William C. Bullitt, the first American ambassador to the Soviet Union. There he was promoted to cipher clerk. By 1939 he was suspected of engaging in espionage for the Soviet Union, but lacking any solid evidence, the Diplomatic Service decided to transfer him to the embassy in London, where he began working on October 5, 1939. In London As soon as Kent arrived in London, he was seen in the company of Ludwig Matthias, a suspected German agent who was being tailed by detectives of Scotland Yard's Special Branch. He was observed being a frequent guest of the Russian Tea Room in South Kensington, a resort of White Russians led by Admiral Nikolai Wolkoff, the former naval attach√© for Imperial Russia in London, and his wife, a former maid of honor to the Tsarina. Through one of their daughters, Anna Wolkoff, Kent met Irene Danishewsky, wife of a British merchant who was a frequent visitor to the Soviet Union. She became Kent's mistress. Because of their background, Irene and her husband were placed under surveillance by MI5 as possible Soviet spies. With a position that required him to encode and decode sensitive telegrams, Kent had access to a wide range of secret documents. Kent was also becoming active in politics. His views are uncertain, but many have assumed that he took an isolationist line and that he was prepared to help British anti-war campaigns. Early in 1940, through Anna Wolkoff, he met Archibald Maule Ramsay, an anti-semitic Conservative Member of Parliament, and joined Ramsay's group The Right Club. Ramsay gave Kent, who had diplomatic immunity, the Right Club's membership list for safekeeping. Kent later invited Wolkoff and Ramsay to his flat and showed them the stolen documents. He would later claim that he showed them to Ramsay in the hope that the latter would pass them to politicians hostile to Roosevelt. Anna Wolkoff made copies of some of these documents on April 13 and sent them to Berlin through an intermediary from the Italian Embassy. It was subsequently found, through interception of wireless messages by MI8, that they then came into the possession of Vice Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of the Abwehr. Wolkoff approached fellow Right Club member Joan Miller and asked her if she could pass a coded letter to William Joyce (later 'Lord Haw-Haw'), through her contacts at the Italian embassy, not knowing that Miller was an undercover agent for MI5 and directly under the supervision of its head of counter- subversion, Maxwell Knight. Miller agreed to take the letter, but instead of taking it to the Italian embassy showed it to Knight. Arrest, trial and conviction On May 18, 1940, the US ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. was informed of this development and agreed to waive Kent's diplomatic immunity. On May 20, Kent was arrested under the Official Secrets Act in a dawn raid at his flat. Officers of MI5 found 1,929 official documents there, and besides Churchill's cables was a book containing the names of people under surveillance by Special Branch and MI5. Searchers also found keys to the US embassy code room. Anna Wolkoff was arrested on the same day and charged with violating the same Act. On May 31, after 11 days of secret detention, the US State Department announced that Kent had been fired and \\"detained by order of the Home Secretary\\" but not that he had been arrested under the Official Secrets Act. On October 23, Kent was tried in camera at the Old Bailey. Brown paper was pasted on the windows and glass door panels. He was specifically charged with obtaining documents that \\"might be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy\\" and letting Wolkoff have them in her possession. He was also accused of stealing documents that were the property of Ambassador Kennedy. The only spectators allowed at the trial were official observers, including Malcolm Muggeridge, representing MI6. Two of the witnesses against Kent were Maxwell Knight and Archibald Ramsay, who was interned on the Isle of Man under Defence Regulation 18B because he had seen the documents. British officials who had knowledge of the documents believed that if they had come to light at that time, Anglo-American relations would have been seriously damaged, for they showed that Roosevelt was looking at ways to evade the Neutrality Acts to help Britain survive a German onslaught. This would also have damaged Roosevelt's re-election bid for the presidency that year.Phelps, Steven [2010] The Tizard Mission: The Top-Secret Operation That Changed the Course of World War II, Westholme, Yardley, Pennsylvania. (p.124-5) At his trial Kent also admitted that he had taken documents from the US Embassy in Moscow, with the vague notion of someday showing them to US senators who shared his isolationist, anti-semitic views. He said that he burned the Moscow documents before being assigned to London. It was learned later that he had fallen in love with an interpreter who worked for the NKVD, thus fueling speculations that he had Soviet contacts. On November 7, 1940, he was convicted and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. Isolationist groups in the United States claimed that he had been framed and that the trial was an attempted cover-up of an attempt to get the US to join the war. The documents, finally released in 1972, did not support this claim. The papers that Kent had purloined indicated British-American naval co-operation, but they also showed that Roosevelt was not prepared to go further without support from the US Congress or the public. Later years At the end of the war, Kent was released and deported to the United States. He never changed his beliefs: he insisted that he had always been a staunch anti-communist. After marrying a wealthy woman, he became a publisher of a pro-segregation Florida newspaper with links to the Ku Klux Klan. He condemned President John F. Kennedy as a communist, and charged that Kennedy was killed by communists because he was abandoning his communist leanings. According to Ray Bearse and Anthony Read, despite Kent's anti-communist beliefs, officials in the FBI believed him to be a secret Soviet sympathizer. He was the subject of six FBI investigations from 1952 to 1963, all ending inconclusively. He died in poverty in a Mission, Texas trailer park in 1988.

The name refers to Pac-Man, a video game in which the protagonist is at first chased around a maze of dots by 4 ghosts. However, after eating a \\"Power Pellet\\" dot, he is able to chase and devour the ghosts. The term (though not the technique) was coined by buyout guru Bruce Wasserstein. Wasserstein, Opinion Lex from ft.com  Examples  = United States = A major example in U.S. corporate history is the attempted hostile takeover of Martin Marietta by Bendix Corporation in 1982. In response, Martin Marietta started buying Bendix stock with the aim of assuming control over the company. Bendix persuaded Allied Corporation to act as a \\"white knight,\\" and the company was sold to Allied the same year. In 1984, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission commissioners said that the Pac-Man defense was cause for ‚Äúserious concern,‚Äù but balked at endorsing any federal prohibition against the tactic. The commissioners acknowledged a Pac-Man defense can benefit shareholders under certain circumstances, but emphasized that management, in resorting to this tactic, must bear the burden of proving it isn‚Äôt acting solely out of its desire to stay in office. One concern is that the money spent to gain control of the intruding company, which includes payment for the services of lawyers and other professionals needed to mount that defense, represents substantial funds that could have otherwise been used to improve the company‚Äôs business or increase its profits. The next Pac-Man defense occurred in 1988, when American Brands, fighting a hostile takeover attempt by E-II Holdings, announced a cash tender offer for E-II. In 2007, British mining giant Rio Tinto PLC, fighting off an unsolicited $131.57 billion takeover bid from Australian rival BHP Billiton Limited, considered turning the tables on its rival and launching a counterbid for BHP. In 2009, Cadbury plc considered trying a Pac-Man defense if no bid emerged to challenge Kraft Foods' hostile offer. = International = Internationally, perhaps the best-known case was that of Porsche and the Volkswagen Group, in which Porsche, under the leadership of Wendelin Wiedeking, led a hostile takeover of the much-larger Volkswagen Group by slowly acquiring a large stake in Volkswagen, eventually to the point of owning over 75% of the company in 2008. By October 2008, Porsche, who was enjoying record profitability, suddenly ran out of money during the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 and banks were reluctant to lend any more money to Porsche; in fact, they wanted their loans paid back immediately. Ferdinand Pi√´ch, the chairman of Volkswagen and a board member of Porsche, who was in fact the grandson of Ferdinand Porsche, founder of Porsche and a co-founder of what became Volkswagen, loaned Porsche enough money to cover their debts, and Volkswagen, which Porsche tried to acquire, became the white knight and Volkswagen effectively took over Porsche. The unique situation had much to do with the historical closeness of the Volkswagen Group to Porsche, and the battle between the Porsche and Pi√´ch families (both descended from Ferdinand Porsche) for control of Porsche. However, later that year when the two companies announced an official merger, Volkswagen was announced as the surviving partner.

Its name was derived from Star (representing the newspaper which would provide the content) and Text (representing the computer company which would provide the technology). StarText was an \\"information on demand\\" online computer service created by Joe Donth, offered for the first time in 1982 by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram to subscribers in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. On May 3, 1982, StarText officially started providing its news and all-text content online, updated from 5am to midnight. There were no graphics, pictures or colors. Subscribers were called StarTexans. The content within StarText was written by subscribers of the service as well as employees of the newspaper. Initially, the service charged $5.00 a month to subscribers who received updated news each day from 5am until midnight daily. At first subscribers had to call StarText using a 300 baud modem and enter four requests out of a choice of 50. StarText then delivered the information without further interactivity. To receive more information the subscriber had to repeat the same process. The first StarText system was provided by a Tandy Model II. The subsequent multi-user version of StarText, developed by Serge Stein, was written in DIBOL and ran on Digital Equipment VAX 11/750s connected to banks of 1200 & 2400 baud modems. This version provided a menu of content including the Star-Telegram's news and classified advertising, and provided messaging between subscribers (early email), Grolier's encyclopedia, American Airlines Sabre flight schedules and home banking to a group of over four thousand dedicated computer users. Users could define their screen size to the system which would then deliver only as much text as would fit on the screen giving the user the opportunity to read the content before 'paging' on to the next screen of text. At one point billing for this service was based on the number of words sent to the user. In May 1996 an additional Internet service, StarText Net, was introduced, and the earlier service was rebranded as StarText Classic. The original service finally closed down on March 3, 1997, and in June 1998, StarText Net changed into Star-Telegram Online Services, which eventually became a conventional online Internet service of the Knight- Ridder group. Subscription history Six months following start-up, the service only had 50 customers because many computers then on the market could not connect to StarText. Some of the early subscribers accessed the service using the Timex 1000 with its 16k RAM and 300 baud modem. At its height the service attracted about 2,000 subscribers. StarTexans StarText benefitted from a loyal group of columnists who acted as unpaid content producers who were also subscribers. Their columns were in text only and originally without color, but the content of the columns were original, varied and of a sufficiently reasonable standard to maintain their own readership. Because these columns were basically under the control of their creators the originality, scope and depth of the information presented was both unique and extensive. In the 1990s, these columnists enjoyed meeting with each other at functions arranged by the StarText service of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. StarText Ink The StarText service also produced a printed newsletter, StarText Ink, published for subscribers. This newsletter carried logs of the subscriber columns, and it also featured its own articles. StarText Net and GEnie Three years after the start of the original StarText service, General Electric's Information Services division launched its ASCII-based online service, GEnie, in October 1985. The main difference between the original StarText and GEnie was that StarText offered online news from the newspaper that owned the service, plus the electronic magazine whose content was created by the subscriber-writers. GEnie was a collection of RoundTable forums, but it did not offer news or individual features written by subscriber-writers. However, the one advantage that GEnie had was its nationwide scope via its General Electric servers, in contrast to the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex coverage offered by the Tandy system. Ten years after start-up, the nationwide appeal of GEnie became attractive to many StarText subscribers, and a word-of- mouth membership migration began to take place. In response to this competition and in an attempt to retain its own membership base, a decision was made by the owners of StarText to rebrand the original service as StarText Classic and to create the new StarText Net, offering access to the early Internet, including an email address. In late 1995 StarText Net began its beta version. The service was offered to the public in May, 1996. Termination of StarText Classic The demise of the original StarText service came with the growth of the Internet. StarText Classic service closed March 3, 1997 at 5:12pm CST with only three users still logged on. Star-Telegram Online Services In June 1998 the name StarText Net was changed to Star-Telegram Online Services. Because of competition from other Internet service providers, the original theme of original featured content that once made StarText into a unique home for StarTexans was not promoted. When the newspaper was bought by the Knight-Ridder group, the online service was then transformed to mirror the more conventional services offered by other newspapers over the Internet, and all but a few references to the StarText trademark disappeared.

It was used by George Mackey as the basis for his theory of induced unitary representations of locally compact groups. The simplest case, and the context in which the idea was first noticed, is that of finite groups (see primitive permutation group). Consider a group G and subgroups H and K, with K contained in H. Then the left cosets of H in G are each the union of left cosets of K. Not only that, but translation (on one side) by any element g of G respects this decomposition. The connection with induced representations is that the permutation representation on cosets is the special case of induced representation, in which a representation is induced from a trivial representation. The structure, combinatorial in this case, respected by translation shows that either K is a maximal subgroup of G, or there is a system of imprimitivity (roughly, a lack of full 'mixing'). In order to generalise this to other cases, the concept is re-expressed: first in terms of functions on G constant on K-cosets, and then in terms of projection operators (for example the averaging over K-cosets of elements of the group algebra). Mackey also used the idea for his explication of quantization theory based on preservation of relativity groups acting on configuration space. This generalized work of Eugene Wigner and others and is often considered to be one of the pioneering ideas in canonical quantization.  Illustrative Example  To motivate the general definitions, we first formulate a definition in the case of finite groups and their representations on finite-dimensional vector spaces. Suppose G is a finite group and U a representation of G on a finite- dimensional complex vector space H. The action of G on elements of H induces an action of G on the vector subspaces W of H in an obvious way: : U_g W = \\\\\\\\{ U_{g} w: w \\\\in W \\\\\\\\}. Suppose X is a set of subspaces of H such that # the elements of X are permuted by the action of G on subspaces and # H is the (internal) algebraic direct sum of the elements of X, i.e., : H = \\\\bigoplus_{W \\\\in X} W. Then (U,X) is a system of imprimitivity for G. Two assertions must hold in the definition above: # the spaces W for W ‚àà X must span H, and # the spaces W ‚àà X must be linearly independent, that is, : \\\\sum_{W \\\\in X} c_W v_W=0, \\\\quad v_{W} \\\\in W \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{ 0 \\\\\\\\} holds only when all the coefficients cW are zero. If the action of G on the elements of X is transitive, then we say this is a transitive system of imprimitivity. Suppose G is a finite group, G0 a subgroup of G. A representation U of G is induced from a representation V of G0 if and only if there exist the following: * a transitive system of imprimitivity (U, X) and * a subspace W0 ‚àà X such that G0 is the fixed point subgroup of W under the action of G, i.e. : G_0 = \\\\\\\\{g \\\\in G: U_g W_0\\\\subseteq W_0\\\\\\\\}. and V is equivalent to the representation of G0 on W0 given by Uh  W0 for h ‚àà G0. Note that by this definition, induced by is a relation between representations. We would like to show that there is actually a mapping on representations which corresponds to this relation. For finite groups one can easily show that a well-defined inducing construction exists on equivalence of representations by considering the character of a representation U defined by : \\\\chi_U(g) = \\\\operatorname{tr}(U_g). In fact if a representation U of G is induced from a representation V of G0, then : \\\\chi_U(g) = \\\\frac{1}{G_0} \\\\sum_{\\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in G : {x}^{-1} \\\\, g \\\\, x \\\\in G_0\\\\\\\\}} \\\\chi_V({x}^{-1} \\\\ g \\\\ x), \\\\quad \\\\forall g \\\\in G. Thus the character function œáU (and therefore U itself) is completely determined by œáV. = Example = Let G be a finite group and consider the space H of complex-valued functions on G. The left regular representation of G on H is defined by : [\\\\operatorname{L}_g \\\\psi](h) = \\\\psi(g^{-1} h). Now H can be considered as the algebraic direct sum of the one-dimensional spaces Wx, for x ‚àà G, where : W_x = \\\\\\\\{\\\\psi \\\\in H: \\\\psi(g) = 0, \\\\quad \\\\forall g eq x\\\\\\\\}. The spaces Wx are permuted by Lg.  Infinite dimensional systems of imprimitivity  To generalize the finite dimensional definition given in the preceding section, a suitable replacement for the set X of vector subspaces of H which is permuted by the representation U is needed. As it turns out, a na√Øve approach based on subspaces of H will not work; for example the translation representation of R on L2(R) has no system of imprimitivity in this sense. The right formulation of direct sum decomposition is formulated in terms of projection-valued measures. Mackey's original formulation was expressed in terms of a locally compact second countable (lcsc) group G, a standard Borel space X and a Borel group action : G \\\\times X \\\\rightarrow X, \\\\quad (g,x) \\\\mapsto g \\\\cdot x. We will refer to this as a standard Borel G-space. The definitions can be given in a much more general context, but the original setup used by Mackey is still quite general and requires fewer technicalities. Definition. Let G be a lcsc group acting on a standard Borel space X. A system of imprimitivity based on (G, X) consists of a separable Hilbert space H and a pair consisting of * A strongly-continuous unitary representation U: g ‚Üí Ug of G on H. * A projection-valued measure œÄ on the Borel sets of X with values in the projections of H; which satisfy : U_g \\\\pi(A) U_{g^{-1}} = \\\\pi(g \\\\cdot A). =Example = Let X be a standard G space and Œº a œÉ-finite countably additive invariant measure on X. This means : \\\\mu(g^{-1} A) = \\\\mu(A) \\\\quad for all g ‚àà G and Borel subsets A of G. Let œÄ(A) be multiplication by the indicator function of A and Ug be the operator : [U_g \\\\psi] (x) =\\\\psi(g^{-1} x).\\\\quad Then (U, œÄ) is a system of imprimitivity of (G, X) on L2Œº(X). This system of imprimitivity is sometimes called the Koopman system of imprimitivity. Homogeneous systems of imprimitivity  A system of imprimitivity is homogeneous of multiplicity n, where 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ œâ if and only if the corresponding projection-valued measure œÄ on X is homogeneous of multiplicity n. In fact, X breaks up into a countable disjoint family {Xn} 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ œâ of Borel sets such that œÄ is homogeneous of multiplicity n on Xn. It is also easy to show Xn is G invariant. Lemma. Any system of imprimitivity is an orthogonal direct sum of homogeneous ones. It can be shown that if the action of G on X is transitive, then any system of imprimitivity on X is homogeneous. More generally, if the action of G on X is ergodic (meaning that X cannot be reduced by invariant proper Borel sets of X) then any system of imprimitivity on X is homogeneous. We now discuss how the structure of homogeneous systems of imprimitivity can be expressed in a form which generalizes the Koopman representation given in the example above. In the following, we assume that Œº is a œÉ-finite measure on a standard Borel G-space X such that the action of G respects the measure class of Œº. This condition is weaker than invariance, but it suffices to construct a unitary translation operator similar to the Koopman operator in the example above. G respects the measure class of Œº means that the Radon-Nikodym derivative : s(g,x) = \\\\bigg[\\\\frac{d \\\\mu}{d g^{-1}\\\\mu}\\\\bigg](x) \\\\in [0, \\\\infty) is well-defined for every g ‚àà G, where : g^{-1}\\\\mu(A) = \\\\mu(g A). \\\\quad It can be shown that there is a version of s which is jointly Borel measurable, that is : s : G \\\\times X \\\\rightarrow [0, \\\\infty) is Borel measurable and satisfies : s(g,x) = \\\\bigg[\\\\frac{d \\\\mu}{d g^{-1}\\\\mu}\\\\bigg](x) \\\\in [0, \\\\infty) for almost all values of (g, x) ‚àà G √ó X. Suppose H is a separable Hilbert space, U(H) the unitary operators on H. A unitary cocycle is a Borel mapping : \\\\Phi: G \\\\times X \\\\rightarrow \\\\operatorname{U}(H) such that : \\\\Phi(e, x) = I \\\\quad for almost all x ‚àà X : \\\\Phi(g h, x) = \\\\Phi(g, h \\\\cdot x) \\\\Phi(h, x) for almost all (g, h, x). A unitary cocycle is strict if and only if the above relations hold for all (g, h, x). It can be shown that for any unitary cocycle there is a strict unitary cocycle which is equal almost everywhere to it (Varadarajan, 1985). Theorem. Define : [U_g \\\\psi](x) = \\\\sqrt{s(g,g^{-1}x)}\\\\ \\\\Phi(g, g^{-1} x) \\\\ \\\\psi(g^{-1} x). Then U is a unitary representation of G on the Hilbert space : \\\\int_X^\\\\oplus H d \\\\mu(x). Moreover, if for any Borel set A, œÄ(A) is the projection operator : \\\\pi(A) \\\\psi = 1_A \\\\psi, \\\\quad \\\\int_X^\\\\oplus H d \\\\mu(x) \\\\rightarrow \\\\int_X^\\\\oplus H d \\\\mu(x), then (U, œÄ) is a system of imprimitivity of (G,X). Conversely, any homogeneous system of imprimitivity is of this form, for some measure œÉ-finite measure Œº. This measure is unique up to measure equivalence, that is to say, two such measures have the same sets of measure 0. Much more can be said about the correspondence between homogeneous systems of imprimitivity and cocycles. When the action of G on X is transitive however, the correspondence takes a particularly explicit form based on the representation obtained by restricting the cocycle Œ¶ to a fixed point subgroup of the action. We consider this case in the next section. =Example = A system of imprimitivity (U, œÄ) of (G,X) on a separable Hilbert space H is irreducible if and only if the only closed subspaces invariant under all the operators Ug and œÄ(A) for g and element of G and A a Borel subset of X are H or {0}. If (U, œÄ) is irreducible, then œÄ is homogeneous. Moreover, the corresponding measure on X as per the previous theorem is ergodic.  Induced representations  If X is a Borel G space and x ‚àà X, then the fixed point subgroup : G_x = \\\\\\\\{g \\\\in G: g \\\\cdot x = x \\\\\\\\} is a closed subgroup of G. Since we are only assuming the action of G on X is Borel, this fact is non-trivial. To prove it, one can use the fact that a standard Borel G-space can be imbedded into a compact G-space in which the action is continuous. Theorem. Suppose G acts on X transitively. Then there is a œÉ-finite quasi-invariant measure Œº on X which is unique up to measure equivalence (that is any two such measures have the same sets of measure zero). If Œ¶ is a strict unitary cocycle : \\\\Phi: G \\\\times X \\\\rightarrow \\\\operatorname{U}(H) then the restriction of Œ¶ to the fixed point subgroup Gx is a Borel measurable unitary representation U of Gx on H (Here U(H) has the strong operator topology). However, it is known that a Borel measurable unitary representation is equal almost everywhere (with respect to Haar measure) to a strongly continuous unitary representation. This restriction mapping sets up a fundamental correspondence: Theorem. Suppose G acts on X transitively with quasi-invariant measure Œº. There is a bijection from unitary equivalence classes of systems of imprimitivity of (G, X) and unitary equivalence classes of representation of Gx. Moreover, this bijection preserves irreducibility, that is a system of imprimitivity of (G, X) is irreducible if and only if the corresponding representation of Gx is irreducible. Given a representation V of Gx the corresponding representation of G is called the representation induced by V. See Theorem 6.2 of (Varadarajan, 1985).  Applications to the theory of group representations  Systems of imprimitivity arise naturally in the determination of the representations of a group G which is the semi-direct product of an abelian group N by a group H that acts by automorphisms of N. This means N is a normal subgroup of G and H a subgroup of G such that G = N H and N ‚à© H = {e} (with e being the identity element of G). An important example of this is the inhomogeneous Lorentz group. Fix G, H and N as above and let X be the character space of N. In particular, H acts on X by : [ h \\\\cdot \\\\chi](n) = \\\\chi(h^{-1} n h). Theorem. There is a bijection between unitary equivalence classes of representations of G and unitary equivalence classes of systems of imprimitivity based on (H, X). This correspondence preserves intertwining operators. In particular, a representation of G is irreducible if and only if the corresponding system of imprimitivity is irreducible. This result is of particular interest when the action of H on X is such that every ergodic quasi-invariant measure on X is transitive. In that case, each such measure is the image of (a totally finite version) of Haar measure on X by the map : g \\\\mapsto g \\\\cdot x_0. A necessary condition for this to be the case is that there is a countable set of H invariant Borel sets which separate the orbits of H. This is the case for instance for the action of the Lorentz group on the character space of R4. =Example: the Heisenberg group = The Heisenberg group is the group of 3 √ó 3 real matrices of the form: : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & x & z \\\\\\\\\\\\0 & 1 & y \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. This group is the semi-direct product of : H = \\\\bigg\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & w & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\\\end{bmatrix}: w \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\bigg\\\\\\\\} and the abelian normal subgroup : N = \\\\bigg\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & t \\\\\\\\\\\\0 & 1 & s \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\\\end{bmatrix}: s,t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\bigg\\\\\\\\}. Denote the typical matrix in H by [w] and the typical one in N by [s,t]. Then : [w]^{-1} \\\\begin{bmatrix}s \\\\\\\\\\\\ t \\\\end{bmatrix} [w] = \\\\begin{bmatrix}s \\\\\\\\\\\\ - w s + t \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -w & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} s \\\\\\\\\\\\ t \\\\end{bmatrix} w acts on the dual of R2 by multiplication by the transpose matrix : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -w \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. This allows us to completely determine the orbits and the representation theory. Orbit structure: The orbits fall into two classes: #A horizontal line which intersects the y-axis at a non-zero value y0. In this case, we can take the quasi-invariant measure on this line to be Lebesgue measure. # A single point (x0,0) on the x-axis. Orbit structure on dual space Fixed point subgroups: These also fall into two classes depending on the orbit: # The trivial subgroup {0}. # The group H itself. Classification: This allows us to completely classify all irreducible representations of the Heisenberg group. These are parametrized by the set consisting of # R ‚àí {0}. These are infinite- dimensional. # Pairs (x0, Œª) ‚àà R √ó R. x0 is the abscissa of the single point orbit on the x-axis and Œª is an element of the dual of H These are one- dimensional. We can write down explicit formulas for these representations by describing the restrictions to N and H. Case (1). The corresponding representation œÄ is of the form: It acts on L2(R) with respect to Lebesgue measure and : (\\\\pi [s,t] \\\\psi)(x) = e^{i t y_0} e^{i s x} \\\\psi (x). \\\\quad : (\\\\pi[w] \\\\psi)(x) = \\\\psi(x+w y_0).\\\\quad Case (2). The corresponding representation is given by the 1-dimensional character : \\\\pi [s,t] = e^{i s x_0}. \\\\quad : \\\\pi[w] = e^{i \\\\lambda w}. \\\\quad  References  * G. W.

His hard studies led to ill- health and he spent several winters recuperating in Switzerland where he learnt skating and became quite expert. He became a lecturer at Trinity College from 1895. Career Henry Francis Blanford, the founding director of the Indian Meteorological Department, had noticed the pattern that the summer monsoon in India and Burma was correlated with the spring snow cover in the Himalayas and it became a routine to use this to make predictions on the Indian monsoons. By 1892 however, these predictions began to fail and the second director John Eliot began to use several other correlations including strength of the trade winds, anticyclones, Nile floods and date from Australia and Africa. Eliot's forecasts from 1899 to 1901 failed so badly, with a drought and famine when he predicted higher than normal rains, that he was criticized severely by the newspapers leading to forecasts being made confidential from 1902 to 1905. A growing interest in the work of Lockyer on cycles led him to choose a mathematically inclined successor who would be Walker, despite the lack of experience in meteorology. Eliot himself was an able mathematician, a Second Wrangler at Cambridge, while Walker had been a Senior Wrangler. Walker was an established applied mathematician at the University of Cambridge and gave up a Fellowship at Trinity to take up a position as assistant to the meteorological reporter in 1903. He was elevated to the position of director general of observatories in India in 1904. Walker developed Blanford's idea with quantitative rigour and came up with correlation measures (with a lag) and regression equations (in time-series terminology, autoregression). He set up a group of Indian clerks to calculate correlations between weather parameters. The methods he introduced for time- series regression are now partly named after him (the other contributor was Udny Yule who studied sun-spot cycles) as the Yule-Walker equations. Analyzing vast amounts of weather data from India and lands beyond, over the next fifteen years he published the first descriptions of the great seesaw oscillation of atmospheric pressure between the Indian and Pacific Ocean, and its correlation to temperature and rainfall patterns across much of the Earth's tropical regions, including India. This is now called the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Star of India in 1911. Walker took an interest in several other fields. He made mathematical studies on bird flight and boomerangs. An interest in boomerangs as an undergraduate had earned him the nickname of \\"Boomerang Walker\\". In Shimla, he used to throw a boomerang on the grounds of Annandale attracting the attention even of the Viceroy of India. He found faults in the ideas on bird flight by Ernest Hanbury Hankin, fellow Cambridge scientist at Simla, and pointed out that ascending thermals had enough energy to support the soaring of birds and also pointed out the role of turbulent eddies in providing lift. He published a summary of his ten years of research in Nature in 1901. He was an accomplished flute player and took an interest in the physics of the flute. He was also an expert on the history and evolution of the flute. He made some design changes to flutes and these went into manufacture. He was also a watercolour artist and while at Simla, held an exhibition of his works. Retirement to England Walker continued his studies of yearly weather and climate change even after his retirement from India (in 1924 when he was knighted) and acceptance of a professorship in meteorology at Imperial College London. He had only mixed success in his original goal, the prediction of monsoonal failures; however, his theories and broad body of supporting research represented an invaluable step forward, allowing his successors in climate study to move beyond local observation and forecasting toward comprehensive models of climate worldwide. He served as president of the Royal Meteorological Society from 1926 to 1927. Walker was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1904, long before his work on meteorology on the strength of his work in applied mathematics and applications to electromagnetism. Walker, with his talent for mathematics, was among the first to recognize the abilities of the Indian mathematical prodigy Srinivasa Ramanujan and wrote a letter to the University of Madras to support a scholarship. Walker's interest in a wide range of subjects made him note the growing insularity of specialists: Walker married Mary Constance Carter in 1908 and they had a son, Michael Ashley, and a daughter, Verity Micheline. He died at Coulsdon, Surrey on 4 November 1958. He was 90 years old. The Walker Institute in the United Kingdom, established to study climate, is named in his honour.

She was the daughter of the scientist Galileo Galilei and Marina Gamba.  Biography  Virginia was the eldest of three siblings, with a sister Livia and a brother Vincenzio. All three were born out of wedlock, and the daughters were considered unworthy for marriage. Troubled by monetary problems, Galileo placed them in the San Matteo convent shortly after Virginia's thirteenth birthday. When she took the veil in 1616, Virginia chose her religious name, Maria Celeste, in honour of the Virgin Mary and her father's love of astronomy. From her cloister, Maria Celeste was a source of support not only for her Poor Clares sisters, but also for her father. Maria Celeste served as San Matteo's apothecary (herself being of frail health). She sent her father herbal treatments for his maladies while additionally managing the convent's finances and staging plays inside the convent. There is evidence she prepared the manuscripts for some of Galileo's books. Maria Celeste was also a mediator between her father and her brother. Maria Celeste frequently asked her father for help for the convent, and kept it afloat through his influence. Galileo helped repair its windows and made sure its clock was in order. In 1633, the Inquisition tried Galileo for heresy. He was forced to recant his views on heliocentrism, and was sentenced to house arrest for life. Shortly after Galileo returned to Arcetri in disgrace, Maria Celeste contracted dysentery and died on 2 April 1634, aged 33. Galileo described Maria Celeste as \\"a woman of exquisite mind, singular goodness, and most tenderly attached to me\\".  Work  After Galileo's death, 124 letters from Maria Celeste written between 1623 and 1633 were discovered among his papers. Galileo's responses have been lost.

His political views later shifted to the right, and he ran for re-election to the Manitoba legislature in 2011 as a candidate of the Manitoba Liberal Party.Election 2011 candidates: Thompson: Ken Dillen , Manitoba Liberal Party, accessed 12 September 2011. Early life and career Dillen was born at the Serpent River Indian Reserve in Cutler, Ontario, and was educated in Ontario schools and at the Canadian Army Apprentice Training School in Camp Borden. He trained as an ironworker and became president of United Steel Workers local 6166 after moving to Manitoba. He was also a member of the Manitoba M√©tis Federation in the 1970s. Legislator He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1973 provincial election, narrowly defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Anna Derby in the northern riding of Thompson. He was the province's first Member of the Legislative Assembly of Indigenous background in several years. The New Democratic Party won a majority government in this election under Edward Schreyer's leadership. Dillen entered the legislature as a government backbencher, serving as Schreyer's legislative assistant. He lost to Progressive Conservative candidate Ken MacMaster by 916 votes in the 1977 provincial election. Dillen later moved to Saskatchewan and held several positions, including field staff coordinator for the Key Lake Board of Inquiry, overseeing uranium mining operations. He was also a member of the Interprovincial Association on Native Employment, the Interprovincial Inland Fisherman's Association, and the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. Despite his background in the labour movement and New Democratic Party, Dillen became a supporter of the \\"right-to-work\\" movement and an opponent of closed shop unionization. In late 2004, he referred to the Saskatchewan NDP as communistic for its efforts to unionize part-time workers. He also dismissed the right-wing Saskatchewan Party as \\"nothing more than disaffected socialists\\" and cited Milton Friedman's Capitalism and Freedom as representative of his own beliefs. Dillen also opposed gun control, the Canadian Wheat Board and the Kyoto Accord, and spoke against efforts by the Ontario government to ban pit bulls. In the late 2000s, he was secretary of the Prairie Centre Policy Institute. He returned to Manitoba after spending some years in Saskatchewan, and ran for re-election as a Liberal for the Thompson electoral division in 2011, finishing third to New Democratic MLA Steve Ashton and Tory Anita Campbell.

It operated scheduled passenger services throughout Queensland from major regional locations, as well as regular and ad hoc charters for the minerals industry in Queensland. Its main operations base was Townsville International Airport, with hubs at Cairns International Airport, Brisbane Airport and Mount Isa Airport. In January 2009, the airline was placed in receivership. History MacAir Airlines was established and started charter operations in 1992 as McKinlay Air Charters, adding scheduled services in 1998. In May 2000 the Collings family sold the airline to Transjet, owner of Transtate Airlines. The two brands were merged and operated under the MacAir name. In November 2003 MacAir acquired Horizon Airlines. MacAir Airlines grew to become a major player in Australia's regional aviation network and played an important role in providing transport to both passengers and freight throughout regional Queensland. Fairchild SA227-AC Metro III at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport MacAir Airlines was based in Townsville. Staff were based in Townsville, Cairns, Mount Isa and Brisbane. In 1998, the growth of the mining industry and MacAir Airlines' fly-in fly-out operations led to the expansion of the carrier and the introduction of passenger services in North Queensland. The year 2000 saw further expansion for MacAir when it merged with passenger airline Transtate Airlines and incorporated their Gulf of Carpentaria services under the MacAir banner. The link between Townsville and Mount Isa was one of the busiest. Passenger volumes on this route serving the mining industry saw the company introduce its ATR 42-500 into service. MacAir Airlines was a Qantas commercial partner. As such, the airline had worldwide distribution through the Qantas reservation system. This agreement between the two carriers gave passengers the ability to choose several options for booking tickets along with the ability to accrue and utilise frequent flyer points on a number of services. On 29 January 2009, MacAir placed itself into voluntary administration; the following day major creditor Suncorp-Metway appointed Ernst & Young as receivers and the airline ceased operations. MacAir had previously asked the Queensland government for a $7 million one-off ex gratia payment, but the government refused, saying that MacAir had \\"systemic issues.\\" On 6 February, the business was closed by the receiver and its 200 employees dismissed. The administrator wound up the business and sold off the company's assets; however the airline only owned a single aircraft as the others were all leased, as were the ground installations.

It was initially formed in 1920 as the Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation as an amalgamation of five chemical companies. In 1958, it was renamed Allied Chemical Corporation when it diversified into oil and gas exploration. Allied Chemical then became Allied Corporation in 1981. In 1985, Allied merged with the Signal Companies to become AlliedSignal. AlliedSignal would eventually acquire Honeywell in 1999 and then adopt its name. History During World War I, Imperial Germany controlled much of the world's chemical production. This resulted in critical shortages of certain dyes, drugs and especially ammonia, a vital compound used to make fertilizers and explosives. =Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation= Schoellkopf, Hartford & Hanna Co. works in Buffalo, New York, formerly the Schoellkopf Aniline and Chemical Works, ca. 1908. In 1920, publisher Eugene Meyer and noted chemist William Ripley Nichols founded Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation in order to address this shortcoming in American industrial production. Allied was an amalgamation of five existing companies with a total capitalization of $175,000,000, including Barrett Chemical Company (est. 1858), General Chemical Company (est. 1899), National Aniline & Chemical Company (est. 1917), Semet-Solvay Company (est. 1895), and the Solvay Process Company (est. 1881)..National Anline at Colorant History.org retrieved 08-05-2012 All manufacturing was consolidated in Buffalo, and much attention was given to improving the processes hastily introduced during World War I. Allied's first venture into new markets was the construction of a synthetic ammonia plant near Hopewell, Virginia in 1928. This would soon become the world's largest producer of ammonia.History of Allied Corporation at the Honeywell, Inc. website retrieved 08-05-2012 National Aniline and Chemical Works had been formed in 1917 by the merger of Schoellkopf Aniline and Chemical, Beckers Aniline and Chemical of Brooklyn, and the Benzol Products Company. Included also were certain facilities of Semet-Solvay, the Barrett Company, and the General Chemical company that made coal tar intermediates. The executives were Jacob F. Schoellkopf Jr., C. P. Hugo Schoellkopf, I. F. Stone, and Dr. William G. Beckers. =Allied Chemical Corporation= After World War II, Allied began manufacturing other products, including Nylon 6, refrigerants and plastic dinnerware. The company name was simplified to reflect this diversification, becoming Allied Chemical Corporation in 1958. It also moved its headquarters to Morristown, New Jersey. In 1962, Allied bought Union Texas Natural Gas. Allied initially regarded Union as a vertical integration supplier of raw materials for its chemical products. However, CEO John T. Connor, secretary of commerce under president Lyndon Johnson, sold many of Allied's unprofitable businesses in the 1970s and invested more heavily in oil and gas exploration. By 1979, Union Texas was generating 80% of Allied's revenue. Between 1978 and 1979, Allied funded The MacNeil/Lehrer Report on public television. =Allied Corp.= As the company sought to further diversify its operations, it was renamed Allied Corporation in 1981. Its next acquisition, in 1983, was Bendix Corporation, an aerospace and automotive firm. By 1984, Bendix was generating 50% of Allied's income, while oil and gas generated 38%.

I-787 is the main highway for those traveling into and out of downtown Albany. The southern terminus is, per New York traffic data, at the toll plaza for New York State Thruway (I-87) exit 23 southwest of downtown Albany. However, current signage indicates the terminus as along I-787's ramp to US 9W. The northern terminus of the route is unclear, with some sources placing the terminus at 8th Street in Troy, creating an overlap with New York State Route 7 (NY 7) between Green Island and Troy. Other documents show I-787 as terminating at its interchange with NY 7 and NY 787 in the town of Colonie. Regardless, the route is long if extended to Troy, or excluding the NY 7 overlap. North of NY 7, I-787 continues north as NY 787 to the city of Cohoes. Route description View from just past the toll barriers at the south end of I-787, looking north at Exit 1. I-787 officially begins at the toll barrier for I-87/Thruway exit 23; however, a short spur between U.S. Route 9W (US 9W) and the interchange connecting I-787 to the Thruway, designated as New York State Route 912S (NY 912S), an unsigned reference route, is signed as I-787. At the east end of the interchange (exit 1) with I-87, I-787 northbound merges with NY 912S, progressing due east for a short distance before curving to the northeast ahead of the Delaware and Hudson Railway mainline near exit 2 (NY 32). Past NY 32, I-787 parallels the Hudson River as it heads northward into the heart of downtown Albany, featuring a pair of exits with US 9 and US 20 at a massive interchange southeast of the Empire State Plaza on the west bank of the Hudson. North of downtown Albany, I-787 interchanges with I-90 at exit 5 prior to crossing into Menands and meeting NY 32 once more at exit 6 by way of a trumpet interchange. The ramp from the trumpet to NY 32, a long roadway, is designated as unsigned NY 913T. Farther north in Menands, I-787 intersects NY 378 (exit 7) by way of a near-cloverleaf interchange. In Watervliet, I-787 has one interchange with 23rd Street (exit 8) before reaching another near- cloverleaf interchange with NY 7 and NY 787 (exit 9) in Green Island. I-787 southbound at exit 4B (US 9 north). I-787's alignment after exit 9 is unclear. Appendix E of the 2008 New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) Traffic Data Report places the terminus at 8th Street in Troy, creating an overlap with NY 7 across the Hudson River via the Collar City Bridge. Additionally, there are shields for I-787 on the Collar City Bridge east of the Hudson River. Other sources, including the National Highway System map of Albany published by the Federal Highway Administration and NYSDOT's official description of signed routes in New York State, identifies the terminus as the NY 7 / NY 787 interchange near Green Island. Contemporary maps of the Albany area also lack I-787 shields on the Collar City Bridge, signing the roadway only as NY 7. According to the NYSDOT traffic counts, I-787 is long; by limiting I-787 to the section between the Thruway and NY 7, the length is reduced to . History Collar City Bridge traveling west (south on I-787) Construction began in the early 1960s on the first segment of I-787 from I-87 to Bassett Street. It was completed and opened to traffic in the mid-1960s. By 1968, construction had begun on the remainder of I-787 south of Watervliet. The portion of the highway between I-90 and NY 378 was completed by 1971; the rest of I-787 south of 23rd Street in Watervliet was built and open to traffic by 1973. The ramps from the South Mall Arterial were opened in 1974. An extension of the freeway north to Arch Street near Green Island was completed by 1977. By 1980, the majority of modern exit 9 was completed even though the Collar City Bridge and the \\"Alternate Route 7\\" freeway had yet to be constructed. The Collar City Bridge over the Hudson River was built in 1981, connecting the pre-existing ramps at exit 9 to downtown Troy. When I-787 was first planned, its northern terminus was at US 4 in Troy. On January 1, 1970, the I-787 designation was truncated westward to what is now exit 9 near Green Island while the then-proposed Collar City Bridge became (albeit on paper) part of I-88, a new highway extending from Binghamton to Troy by way of the Susquehanna Expressway and Alternate Route 7. The extension of I-88 never materialized as Alternate Route 7 ended up becoming a realignment of NY 7 when it was completed in the 1980s. Northbound ramp that slipped off its supports, supported by temporary tower In 2005, an elevated section of the northbound exit 3 off ramp slipped off its supports, causing temporary closure of the ramp and causing disruption of the flow of traffic into the Empire State Plaza. The ramp connects I-787 with the South Mall Arterial. Initially, most roads and ramps near or under the elevated highway were closed, but once temporary piers were in place, most roads reopened. A detour was set up to allow northbound traffic to enter the Plaza, but it required crossing the Hudson River over the Dunn Memorial Bridge and traveling through the city of Rensselaer to get back on the bridge, allowing access into the Plaza. The slip caused the south end of a simple span of the overpass to drop about . The pier stands tall at the slippage point. Nobody was seriously injured by the slipped ramp.  Future  In 2016, New York Assemblymember Patricia Fahy advocated for I-787 to be demolished and to be replaced with an at-grade highway to improve traffic and access to the waterfront. In December 2019, Fahy ‚Äúannounced plans to introduce legislation calling for the state Department of Transportation to conduct an engineering feasibility study that would assess the replacement or modification of I-787 to provide ‚Äògreater access to Albany‚Äôs waterfront and revitalize working class communities located along its route‚Äù. According to Fahy, \\"'The Capital Region's greatest asset‚Äîaccess to the Hudson River waterfront‚Äîhas been more or less absent from communities including downtown Albany since the late 1960s and early 1970s when I-787 went up‚Ä¶ Following announcements of the removal of several similar highways in cities throughout the state, conducting an engineering feasibility study will provide a blueprint and cost estimates for either removing or transforming I-787 into a boulevard-style roadway'\\". In March 2018, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that his administration had awarded $3.1 million toward the conversion of a little-used I-787 exit ramp into a park called the Albany Skyway. The park, which would connect downtown Albany to the Hudson River waterfront, is expected to be completed in 2020. Also in March 2018, a draft report was released regarding the findings of an I-787/Hudson Waterfront Corridor Study. The study was prepared for the Capital District Transportation Committee. The draft report set forth various recommendations for improvements to I-787, including \\"reconfiguring some interchanges, making the waterfront more accessible to bicyclists and pedestrians, converting from an expressway to a more traditional roadway, and pursuing strategies to reduce travel demand\\". The draft report noted that 88,000 vehicles per day travel into downtown Albany on I-787. It also noted that the report did not recommend significant changes, such as making I-787 into an underground highway or removing it altogether; such ideas would be complicated by railroad tracks in the I-787 median and by the fact that I-787 is located in a flood plain. Released in May 2019, the final report detailed various possible future plans for I-787. Those potential future plans included the conversion of the entirety of the interstate to an at-grade urban arterial.

Simple Simon is a patience or solitaire card game played with a regular 52 cards deck (4 suits of 13 cards each without Jokers). It is a close relative of the well-known Spider Solitaire. It became somewhat popular being featured in some computerized collections of Solitaire card games, but its origins possibly predate its implementation as a computerized game.  Rules  At the beginning of the play the cards are dealt all facing the player, starting from 3 columns of 8 cards each, and then 7 columns with 7, 6, and so forth cards until 1. A card can be placed on any card on the top of a column whose rank is greater than it by one (with no cards that can be placed above an Ace). A sequence of cards, decrementing in rank and of the same suit, can be moved as one. An empty column can be filled by any card. A sequence of cards from the king down to the Ace - all of the same suit - can be moved to the foundations. The object of the game is to place all four suits in the foundations.  Strategy  A mixed-suit sequence of cards can be moved to a different location, given enough empty columns or parent cards to place intermediate components and sub-sequences of cards on. This is similar to FreeCell only with the individual components of the sequence being the same-suit sub- sequences rather than individual cards as in FreeCell. Note that some implementations of Simple Simon, require the player to do all the moving of the individual components by himself.  Statistics and analysis  In September 2001, Shlomi Fish adapted Freecell Solver, an automated solver for various solitaire card games, to solve Simple Simon. The statistics presented by the solver when run over a range of 4000 random games showed that about 85% of the games were solvable. Another programmer added another type of move which reportedly increased the percentage of games that were solvable by the solver to well over 90%. In 2009 a more up-to-date version of Freecell Solver produced the result that the solver was able to solve 4,533 (or 90%) of the deals, and generally reached a conclusion within 100 moves. The comment has been made that this is \\"what makes the game a joy: either it's impossible to solve and you see it in the first moves or it's solvable and you only have to find the best route.\\"https://groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve- discuss/message/119  References  See also * Spider Solitaire * List of solitaire games * Glossary of solitaire terms Spider patience card games Single-deck patience card games Card game video games Year of introduction missing ","title":"Simple Simon (solitaire)"},{"id":"1388188","text":"Sir Joseph Andrew Chisholm (January 9, 1863 ‚Äì January 22, 1950) was Mayor of Halifax and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.

It premiered in Kuwait on September 14, 1979 and was broadcast in 22 Arabic-speaking countries, running until June 23, 1989. The program continued to be well-known decades after it went off the air. In 1978, educators, mass media officers, and social planners agreed to adopt Sesame Street as a feasible and economical solution for the low attendance in preschools and illiteracy that plagued the region. They approached the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), the producers of the American show, and purchased the rights to create an Arab version for US$2.5 million. A few months after its premiere, Iftah Ya Simsim became one of the most popular and successful programs for children in many Arab states. Critics called it \\"one of the most successful pan-Arab collaborations of educators, creators, writers and artists from the Middle East\\". The show inspired many studies, which demonstrated that children benefited from watching it. In 2010, efforts began to revive the show for a new generation of young viewers in the Arab world. In late 2013, fifteen writers and producers from Bidaya Media attended training about its educational methodology and production techniques from the staff of the American show in New York. Iftah Ya Simsim was in pre-production in March 2014, and the first phase of auditions took place in April 2014. The new series debuted on September 1, 2015. The present show is a collaboration between the Abu Dhabi Education Council, Twofour54, Arab Bureau of Education for the Gulf States and Bidaya Media.  Background  A few months after the 1969 debut of Sesame Street on PBS in the US, producers from several countries all around the world approached the Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later the Sesame Workshop, or \\"the Workshop\\"), the organization responsible for the show's production, to create and produce versions of Sesame Street in their countries.Cole et al. p. 148 Co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney was approached by German public television officials about a year after the US version debuted. Many years later, Cooney recalled, \\"To be frank, I was really surprised, because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created\\". She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann, who left commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president. One of Dann's tasks was to field offers to produce versions of Sesame Street in other countries. By summer 1970, he had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to call \\"co- productions\\".Davis, pp. 209‚Äî210 Sesame Street co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney, in 1985. Cooney was surprised that other countries were interested in producing their own versions of the American show. As of 2006, there were 20 active co- productions. In 2001, CTW vice-president Charlotte Cole estimated that there were over 120 million viewers of all international versions of Sesame Street,Cole et al., p. 147 and by the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, they were seen in more than 140 countries.Gikow, p. 263 Doreen Carvajal of The New York Times reported that income from the co-productions accounted for US$96 million in 1994. Cole stated, \\"Children's Television Workshop (CTW) can be regarded as the single largest informal educator of young children in the world\\".Cole et al., pp. 169‚Äî172 Studies conducted on the effects of several co-productions found that viewers of these shows gain basic skills from watching them.Gikow, pp. 252‚Äî253 Kuwait's 1980 census, conducted shortly after the original show's premiere, showed that 48% of its citizens were \\"either totally illiterate or ... barely [able to] read or write\\".Al-Khulaifi, p. 2 Several studies in Kuwait showed that parents' illiteracy adversely affected their children's educational and social development. Half of Kuwaitis who lived in the rural areas of the country were illiterate.Al-Khulaifi, p. 3 Literacy rates for women and girls were worse: UNESCO reported in 2005 that they \\"account for two thirds of the region's illiterates\\".Hammoud, p. 4 In 2000, before the revived show aired, the Arab region had some of the world's lowest adult literacy rates, at a little over 62%, which was well below the world average of 84% and in developing countries (almost 76.5%).Hammoud, pp. 3‚Äì4 The Kuwaiti 1980 census also showed that even though Kindergarten was free for its citizens, 30% of children aged 3 to 5 attended; the number was much lower for the 12 million preschoolers in the Arab world, at about 2%. Girls attended school less commonly than boys in Arab countries. In 1976, the Arab fund for Social and Economic Development held a series of workshops and seminars, attended by educators, mass media officers, and social planners, about preschool education in the region. The participants agreed to adopt Sesame Street as a feasible and economical solution for the low attendance in preschools and illiteracyAl-Khulaifi, p. 6 and, with funding from the Arab Gulf States Joint Program Production Institution, movement was made to create a co-production for the children of Kuwait and for the Arab world. This program, called Iftah Ya Simsim (\\"Open Sesame\\") premiered in Kuwait in 1979 and ran until 1989, when the Gulf War stopped production. It was broadcast in 22 Arab countries, and continued to be well-known decades after it went off the air.Gikow, p. 259 In June 2010, the Sesame Workshop and the Arab Bureau of Education for the Gulf States (ABEGS), a regional Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) organization dedicated to education, research, and development, agreed to bring back the show. Original production Iftah Ya Simsim was the first children's educational TV program of its kind in the Arab world and the first Sesame Street co-production in the region. It was the first co-production to use Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Its development was similar to that of the American version of Sesame Street in the late 1960s. The GCC considered creating a co-production for many years, so consultations were held among its member countries regarding how to do so. Many of the early co-productions were simple, dubbed versions with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways, but the GCC wanted to create their own original version. They established the Joint Program Production Institute (JPPI) to work with the CTW to create a Sesame Street co-production in addition to creating several children's TV shows. The JPPI formed a team, which visited the CTW in New York to negotiate the production of 130 30-minute programs,Al-Khayr & Al-Samira'i, p. 464 purchasing the rights to create an Arab version for US$2.5 million, and bringing in experts from throughout the Arab world \\"to introduce an all encompassing Arabic curriculum that would teach and cultivate Arab values and culture\\". According to researcher Ibrahim Al-Khulaifi, there were three stages in the production of the show. The first stage was pre-production research, which identified basic education needs for children under the age of six. The second stage involved the creation of a pilot reel to test children on the show's effects and for review by educators, sociologists, psychologists, and other experts, who were invited to a seminar. Finally, the series was filmed and aired. Research began in August 1977; the team was led by an educator and included a linguist and a psychologist, all of whom were on the faculty of Kuwait University. The show was tested on different socioeconomic groups of children, between the ages of three and six, in kindergartens and preschools in four representative cities from Arab countries. The team proposed curriculum goals based upon the research and, during a seminar, Arab and CTW educators agreed on ten final goals.Al-Khulaifi, pp. 7‚Äî8 Iftah Ya Simsim emphasized scientific thinking and the effects of technology on society. It sought to provide children with experiences that enriched their knowledge about their environment and improved their reasoning, through teaching them mathematical and geometric concepts. The show introduced its viewers to Arab history by citing important events, such as showing castles that were the center of historic battles.Al-Khayr & Al-Samira'i, p. 466 Geography was highlighted, especially the location of countries and their cities and capitals, which had the secondary effect of helping children increase their feelings of belonging and feeling proud of their Arab heritage. Children's social awareness, especially their comprehension of social roles and their functions, was also emphasized.Al-Khayr & Al-Samira'i, p. 467 Unlike the American show, Iftah Ya Simsim covered the topic of spirituality because of the importance of religion in Arab culture,Al-Khulaifi, p. 42 so the producers' goals included teaching children about Islamic principles, positive social behavior, personal manners, and the importance of traits like honesty, respect for parents, loyalty, and social interaction. According to researchers Misbah Al-Khayr and Hashim Al-Samira'i, the program reinforced \\"the values and ethics that are derived from the teaching of orthodox Islam ... to help children develop a sound moral vision on the basis of which they will build their family relationships, and which will reinforce the values of cooperation, love, and justice\\".Al-Khayr & Al-Samira'i, p. 468 The producers wanted to present the characteristics of the Arabic language and its alphabet. Because pre-production research showed that, although many dialects are spoken in the region, 90% of Arab children were able to understand Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), it was chosen as the show's language.Al-Khayr & Al-Samira'i, p. 465 Linguist Kees Versteegh stated that the language used in Iftah Ya Simsim was \\"based on an explicit didactic and linguistic concept\\". The show's developers decided to use specific aspects of the language. Despite the absence of case endings in the dialects spoken by many of its users, the producers used them and other indispensable features of MSA. They also spelled out what features should be used sparingly, like passive verb forms, and what features they wanted to completely avoid, such as some prepositions. According to Versteegh, \\"These principles have been followed rather closely\\". Children who appeared on the show made few grammatical errors in MSA, and although colloquialisms were used rarely, there was an informal quality in their conversations and speech patterns. Versteegh postulated that it was due to the use of intonation patterns and interjections, instead of the use of grammatical and lexical items from the vernacular use of the language. He also said that Iftah Ya Simsim proved that it was \\"possible to use an informal register of Modern Standard Arabic\\". Versteegh reported that although the show was criticized in some Arab countries, Egypt in particular, for containing too many colloquialisms, he thought the criticism was biased and that \\"the selection of lexical items in any pan-Arabic programme will probably never satisfy everybody\\". New Muppets were created, inspired by cultural traditions in the Arab world, from the shadow puppets of Syria to the puppets of Egypt, some of the oldest puppets in the world. Characters from the American show, like the Cookie Monster, Bert and Ernie, Grover, and Kermit, were transposed into Arabic versions: Kaaki, Bader and Anees, Gharghour, and Kamil. The show's version of the Count kept his distinctive laugh and accent when speaking MSA. New characters were created, including a camel named Nu'man (ŸÜŸèÿπŸÖÿßŸÜ) drawn from Arabic history and tradition, the green and yellow parrot Malsoon (ŸéŸíŸÖŸéŸÑŸíÿ≥ŸàŸÜ), a lavender-colored monster with a long nose named Yagut, and a large purple ribbon-wearing cat called Abla. The show focused on Arab heritage, like the wedding rituals of countries in the region, and included Arab poems and songs. Iftah Ya Simsim premiered in Kuwait in September 1979, and was broadcast in all Arabic-speaking countries excluding Egypt. The show's opening consisted of a catchy tune that became beloved of its young viewers. As the song played, the opening footage showed children across the Arab world running past familiar landmarks like the Pyramids and playing in playgrounds and ancient alleyways before running into a white fort that had its gates open wide. The show's set consisted of an intricately traditional Arabian neighborhood called Sharee Eshreen (20th Street). = Legacy and influence = According to researcher Ibrahim Al-Khulaifi, \\"In a few months, Iftah Ya Simsim became one of the most popular and successful programs for children in many Arab states\\".Al-Khulaifi, p. 8 Critics called it \\"one of the most successful pan-Arab collaborations of educators, creators, writers and artists from the Middle East\\". The show continued to trigger nostalgia in its fans, some of whom watched its reruns well into the 1990s. Rym Ghazal of The National asserts that other co-productions made in the region could not compare to Iftah Ya Simsim, which used actors and children from the region, known as Khaleeji, in their roles. Ghazal also stated, \\"No Arabic children's television show was as popular and influential in the Middle East in the 1980s as Iftah Ya Sim Sim ... That's because it offered an alternative way of learning that hardly existed in the Arab world at the time, just as Sesame Street had previously done in the West\\". Iftah Ya Simsim inspired \\"a flood of studies\\", from scientific research to doctoral or masters theses submitted to Arab, European, and American universities. No studies were conducted during the show's first five years, largely due to lack of government cooperation and unsuccessful attempts marred by subjects dropping out of the studies.Al- Khulafi, pp. 9‚Äî10 In 1981, however, the JPPI invited children from Arab countries to Kuwait to access how they assimilated the program. Their attitudes about the show were assessed by education, social, and media specialists, who found that most viewers had benefited from watching it. Parents reported that their children's language use and ability improved, and the JPPI received many letters of appreciation and was commended for their efforts in producing the show. In 1984, in one of the first studies conducted researching the show's effects on its young viewers, Ibrahim Al-Khulaifi compared the relationship between the viewing behavior by the Kuwaiti preschooler of Iftah Ya Simsim and certain developmental and environmental variables. He found that variables such as socioeconomic status, parental education (especially that of the mother), sex, age, year in school, birth order, and family attitudes about the show influenced the frequency of viewing.Al-Khulaifi, p. 108 Misbah Al-Khayr and Hashim Al-Samira'i, in an article from the 1995 book Children in the Muslim Middle East, reported on a study that sought to evaluate the influence of Iftah Ya Simsim on its Baghdad viewers' knowledge about language, general information, mathematics, science, and moral principles. The study found that 85% of all children residing in Baghdad had watched it and that they interacted with and were attached to many of its characters, who exposed viewers to the accents of the region. The most popular segments were those that contained cartoons, songs, and puppets. The show's viewers demonstrated an increase in their understanding and knowledge in all areas, especially information about their social and natural environment.Al-Khayr & Al-Samira'i, pp. 465‚Äî468  Revival  In 2010, the Sesame Workshop and the Arab Bureau of Education for the Gulf States (ABEGS), which recognized \\"the deep love for the program\\" felt throughout the Arab world, started talks about relaunching Iftah Ya Simsim. Pre-production research and preparation, like the process it took to bring the American version and the original Arab co-production, took two years. The ABEGS and the Sesame Workshop signed an agreement to bring it back to Arab television, with content suitable for a new generation of children. The show was the first educational initiative sponsored by the Mubadala Development Company, the investment vehicle of the Abu Dhabi government. The initiative sought to relaunch the old series \\"with a new vision and content suitable for children of today\\". Abdel-Mohsen Al Bannai, CEO of the joint production program for GCC-JPPI and who produced other co-productions in the region during the 1980s, considered Iftah Ya Simsim as more than a TV show, but as an educational initiative. The production company Bidaya Media was chosen to produce the show; in 2013, the company was housed at Twofour54, the United Arab Emirates version of public television. The show was supported by organizations all over the world; Feras Al-Maddah, Iftah Ya Simsim's representative at the GCC, stated, \\"It is a public/private sector partnership and we will need the support of all to extend the communication channels and continue producing more educational products\\". Map of the Middle East, where the original and revived versions of Iftah Ya Simsim were broadcast A seminar was held in 2011 to design the show's curriculum and educational framework, and was attended by over 80 education and media experts. The seminar, also attended by ABEGS representatives, was sponsored by the GCC Joint Program Production Institution (GCC-JPPI) and Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), a manufacturing company based in Riyadh and one of the private corporations that sponsored the new show. The participants took into consideration the educational changes that had occurred in the region in the previous 20 years, including a more diverse and complicated world and a need for more creativity to educate young children. The seminar focused on the education needs of children throughout the Arab world, the possible effects of the show's return, and how to provide educational resources and technology to children in the 21st century. The seminar participants recommended the creation of an advisory council, consisting of education experts and media professionals, as well as expanding to new media forms other than TV, and including important Arab celebrities as guests on the show, all components that the American show used. Other curriculum topics chosen during the seminar included Arabic culture and heritage, school readiness, health and wellness, and female education. The seminar participants decided to use MSA, like the producers had done for the original show, citing an even greater need to expose children to the Arabic language. The National, for example, stated, \\" At a time when Arab children are increasingly deviating from their language and culture because of programming from nations like the United States and India, initiatives like this will help to reverse the trend\\". Abdulla Al Sharhan, the new show's creative director, agreed: \\"We are losing our language, and so through Iftah Ya Simsim, we can revive the language in such a way that a child learns proper Arabic in a fun way\\". As with the original, outreach was an important part of the new show. Even before the show aired, four characters from the original toured the region, educating young children and their families about road and car safety. The cast and crew took a break from filming for a few months for \\"constant live events\\" to interact with their young viewers. Books, DVDs, CDs, online material and outreach programs for children, parents, and teachers were produced. In late 2013, fifteen writers and producers from Bidaya Media attended training about its education methodology and production techniques from the staff of the American show in New York. The Saudi Gazette reported that Iftah Ya Simsim was in pre-production in March 2014, and that the first phase of auditions took place in April 2014, after, according to Al-Sharhan, a year of designing the show, \\"with input from child development experts, educators and cultural consultants\\". A casting call for a competitive search of performers specializing in puppeteering, voice, singing, and movement was sent to universities, theaters, and cultural centers in Abu Dhabi, where it was filmed, and through social media. They cast Arabic-speaking performers, although no prior acting experience was required. Dina al Saleh, a puppeteer from Alam Simsim, the Egyptian co-production, screened the first group of candidates, and then the final cast of seven puppeteers were chosen after ten days of workshops, which the Saudi Gazette called \\"\\"master level training\\" with Marty Robinson and other Sesame Workshop puppeteers from New York. According to an editorial in The National, the new version of the show was significant because it encouraged Emiratis and other Arabs to become more involved in filmmaking and, more importantly, it focused on \\"locally relevant Arabic-language content that will seek to educate present and future generations\\". =Relaunch= After a 25-year hiatus, the show was relaunched in September 2015 appearing on nine regional stations with Abu Dhabi Al Emarat TV and Sharjah TV among them but they only use Numberkids 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. At the time of the re-launch the show was expected to reach 45 million viewers. The production is a collaboration between the Abu Dhabi Education Council, twofour54, the Arab Bureau of Education for the Gulf States and Bedia Media. Along with live shows at schools, the show interacts with fans by means of Facebook, a YouTube channel, and Instagram accounts. The show announced its focus on regional traditions, culture, values, customs, and manners with the characters speaking in classical Arabic. It was also announced that the much loved character No'man the camel and the bird muppet Melsoon were returning to the new run. They were to be joined by new muppets that would \\"include Shams, a quick witted 6-year-old girl who is full of energy and loves to express herself, as well as cute Gargour, a special resident on Iftah Ya Simsim who provides his trademark zaniness, comic chaos and a unique perspective on the world.\\" It was announced that season one Muppet performers included six puppeteers: Abdullah Kassem, Asma Alshamsi, Natheer Khawaldeh, Maher Mozawak, Noura Sadaka, and Michel Jabali. Also announced were actors appearing on the show with the muppets; Abdulla Rafa (in the role of Rashid) and Fatma Al Taei (as Amal). The educational content of the show is directed by the Educational Advisory Committee and the representatives of the Arab Bureau of Education for the Gulf States (ABEGS). In 2017, the show launched a special, 12-minute version of the show for the month of Ramadan. Thirty episodes were produced and regularly feature Super Grover 2.0, Elmo's Game Show, Cookie's Crumby Pictures, and segments from the Dream, Save, Do campaign, as well as interviews with children. On February 2017 Bidaya Media started production on season two of the relaunch of Iftah Ya Simsim, Noura Sadaka and Natheer Khawaldeh didn't come back for the new season. In addition, two new Muppets were introduced to the cast, Ka'aki (Cookie Monster) and Elmo. Puppeteer and Voice actor Ammar Sabban was hired to replace Natheer Khawaldeh as Gargour and was also chosen to play Ka'aki, Abdullah Rafa also joined the puppeteer team to play Elmo. The third and final season premiered in May 2019 with 52 episodes. = Ahlan Simsim = Ahlan Simsim (translating to \\"Welcome Sesame\\") is an Arabic co-production of Sesame Street that premiered on 2 February 2020 on MBC 3.

It was followed by the sequel Pigs in Heaven. The protagonist of the novel is named Taylor Greer, a native of Kentucky. She sets out to leave home and travel west, and finds herself in Oklahoma near Cherokee territory. As Taylor stops in the town, a woman suddenly approaches, deposits a small child, and leaves with no further explanation. Not knowing what else to do, Taylor decides to care for the child. The novel traces the experiences of Taylor and the child, who Taylor names Turtle. Covering Turtle's early childhood, the story includes a colorful cast of characters: Lou Ann, her roommate; Esperanza and Estevan, a Guatemalan couple; and Mattie, the owner of \\"Jesus Is Lord Used Tires\\".  Themes  The novel makes reference to the issue of Native American parental rights. At least one reader, familiar with Native American adoption rights, thought that the sequel, Pigs in Heaven, was written to correct misconceptions in the first book by Barbara Kingsolver. Themes of love and nurturing emerge from the violence and poverty that the characters face. The book conveys multiple symbolic meanings about shared motherhood, life and death, and beauty. The underlying themes not always recognized include those about mockery toward the judicial system, the flawed coping strategies of current day issues, and the strength of friendship.  Reception  The novel was well received by critics and has become commonly assigned reading in high school literature classes. Jack Butler wrote for the New York Times, \\"The Bean Trees is as richly connected as a fine poem, but reads like realism.\\" References  External links  * Free Study Guide for \\"The Bean Trees at TheBestNotes.com * CliffsNotes: The Bean Trees * The Bean Trees: A Novel (Mass Market Paperback) 1988 American novels Novels by Barbara Kingsolver Novels set in Tucson, Arizona Novels set in Oklahoma 1988 debut novels ","title":"The Bean Trees"},{"id":"1388214","title":"1 fille &amp; 4 types"},{"id":"1388216","text":"List of hospitals in Ohio (U.S. state), sorted by county and name of hospital or medical center.

It quickly became the most popular children's show in Norway after its d√©but in 1991, and 198 episodes were made until 1998. Unlike their predecessors from all over the world it is set in a railway station near a town instead of the traditional Sesame Street neighbourhood. Each episode is 30 minutes, of which 15‚Äì20 are from the Norwegian production and 10‚Äì15 are dubbed from Sesame Street. History In 1987, NRK approached Children's Television Workshop about the possibility to make a Norwegian co-production of Sesame Street. In 1989, an agreement was reached between NRK and CTW, and the production of Sesam Stasjon began in September 1990. As part of the preparation for the show, Kermit Love traveled to Norway in June 1990 to teach the Norwegian puppeteers. The first episode aired on NRK on 4 February 1991. In the beginning, the plan was to produce 77 episodes all written by Eyvind Skeie. In 1992, Skeie left the production after finishing his contract of 77 episodes. At the same time, NRK told that they wanted to make another 250 episodes to run through 2006. However, the series would not survive that long. NRK decided that the resources used to produce Sesam Stasjon could be used better elsewhere, so NRK decided to pay CTW to get out of the contract, that would end in 2001. The last scene was recorded on 28 April 1999, bringing the total to 198 episodes. However, Sesam Stasjon stayed on the air in reruns until 2004. The exterior set was built around L√∏renskog Train Station, that was provided from the Norwegian railroads (NSB). The station was built in 1901 by architect Paul Due. A tower was added to the building. The station was modified again in August 1991. This time, the inside of the station was changed and opened for the public, so that kids could walk around inside the station. There were also live appearances by the cast and walk-around characters. In 2003 it was decided to change the station back to the original look. NSB provided two modified train engines from 1940 of the type EL.10. (El10.2504 and El10.2508), these engines were used on the show. Two other and more powerful train engines (Di2.827 and DI2.839) were also painted with the Sesam Stasjon colors. These trains were not used on the show but was used as passenger trains around Norway. The passenger cars were painted BFV1 cars, restored Donnerb√ºchse (Thunderbox) cars that had been abandoned in Norway by the German army after the second world war. There were also some open passenger cars that were used during the summers, these cars were made out of cargo cars also called Gs cars. Some of the episodes were like mini-series; the storyline would continue where the last episode left off. One of these longer stories was about how Alfa entered a contest to write a television show. She wrote about her life at Sesam Stasjon, and she won the contest. The entire station was invited to NRK, so they could talk about the show. In a later episode, a TV crew from NRK arrived to shoot the TV show using actors to play Alfa and her friends. These \\"actors\\" were the walk-around suits, that were built for live appearances. Characters * Max Mekker: a big blue animal-like guy who works at the train station called \\"Sesam Stasjon\\". Good at fixing things, hence the name \\"Mekker\\" (about the same as \\"handyman\\"). Max Mekker always talks in rhyme. Played by Geir B√∏rresen. *Alfa: a female yellow muppet resident of the train station and likes to play the guitar. Played by Hanne Dahle. * Bjarne: a male pink muppet who owns a ticket booth. Very fond of numbers and having system in his stuff. Suffers from allergies, and therefore doesn't like summer. Played by √Ösmund Huser. * Py: a red muppet with yellow and red hair and the youngest at the station. She was seen hatched from a humongous blue egg that appeared with a train. Played by Christine Stoesen. * Stasjonsmester O. Tidemann: station master. Played by Sverre Holm. * Leonora Dorothea Dahl: a lady working at the train station. Likes to sing and cook. Played by Sidsel Ryen. The whole production went to New York to observe the American production of Sesame Street. By co-operating with the American production, they got the rights to make their own version of the show. It came out as \\"Sesam Stasjon\\". The special puppets used for the show had to be sent to the Children's Television Workshop (CTW) whenever they had to be rinsed, because the mechanism used to operate them was confidential. Only Geir B√∏rresen was allowed inside Max Mekker. The Norwegian producers were Herman Gran and Grete H√∏ien. Eyvind Skeie and Lena Seimler wrote the teleplays, the costumes were designed by NRK's Costume Designer Ellen Andreassen Jensen while Sigvald Tveit wrote the music for the songs from the show. Harald M√¶le was responsible for the voiceovers for the American cuts. (The Cookie Monster etc.) Although not a character, the animated Pinball Number Count segments were also dubbed and used in the show regularly, and the melody is well recognized amongst Norwegians who have watched the show, despite most of them not having seen Sesame Street. Voices * Magnus Nielsen as Ernie (Erling) * Harald M√¶le as Bert (Bernt), Grover (Gunnar) and Cookie Monster (Kakemonsteret) End of the show Although NRK had written in a contract with CTW that they were going to produce the show until 2001, as well as retaining a right to show reruns the first five years following, they decided to opt out of the production deal prematurely according to an interview with Kalle F√ºrst in NRK's Department for Children in 1998. F√ºrst made it clear that NRK had decided to end production due to lowered ratings, and they wanted to free the resources in order to make new and better shows. F√ºrst stated that the network had to pay CTW a large sum of money to break the contract when he was asked if they were having economical issues. When asked if there was anyone had opposed the decision, the people who had worked on the show were mentioned as the main force, and F√ºrst showed understanding of their love for the show and the relationship they had developed between each other while making it. Train and station The outdoor scenes for the show were filmed at L√∏renskog Station, which was repainted for the series. Only the station side was repainted in a colourful manner characteristic for Sesame Street, while its back was yellow and green. The original building was raised in 1901 after drawings by architect Paul Due, and the architecture is in the direction of Art Nouveau. A postmodern clock tower, also painted for the show, was built alongside the station in the 1980s. The station is located on the Trunk Line and is served by the Oslo Commuter Rail. By 2006, after a decision made three years earlier, the clock tower had been taken down and the main building was repainted in its old colours, yellow with brown lists. The actual station has not been operated since 14 June 2000. Sesamtoget (The Sesame Train) that was used in the show consisted of four parts. Norwegian State Railways (NSB) converted two old shunters, El 10 no. 2504 and no. 2508, and two Di 2 no. 827 and no. 839. The three carriages used were two earlier German BFV1 carriages, which NSB had taken ownership of after the war, and a modified goods van. All of the train parts were painted in the same colourful scheme as the station. El 10 no. 2504 is currently being kept in Grorud and no. 2508 is stationed in Hamar, both old and not in regular use. While the Di 2 no. 839 has been repainted, no. 827 is being kept intact by the Norwegian Railway Club in H√∏nefoss.

Electromagnetic forming (EM forming or magneforming) is a type of high-velocity, cold forming process for electrically conductive metals, most commonly copper and aluminium. The workpiece is reshaped by high-intensity pulsed magnetic fields that induce a current in the workpiece and a corresponding repulsive magnetic field, rapidly repelling portions of the workpiece. The workpiece can be reshaped without any contact from a tool, although in some instances the piece may be pressed against a die or former. The technique is sometimes called high-velocity forming or electromagnetic pulse technology.  Explanation  A special coil is placed near the metallic workpiece, replacing the pusher in traditional forming. When the system releases its intense magnetic pulse, the coil generates a magnetic field which in turn accelerates the workpiece to hyper speed and onto the die. The magnetic pulse and the extreme deformation speed transforms the metal into a visco-plastic state ‚Äì increasing formability without affecting the native strength of the material. See the magnetic pulse forming illustration for a visualization. A rapidly changing magnetic field induces a circulating electric current within a nearby conductor through electromagnetic induction. The induced current creates a corresponding magnetic field around the conductor (see Pinch (plasma physics)). Because of Lenz's Law, the magnetic fields created within the conductor and work coil strongly repel each other. When the switch is closed, electrical energy stored in the capacitor bank (left) is discharged through the forming coil (orange) producing a rapidly changing magnetic field which induces a current to flow in the metallic workpiece (pink). The current flowing the workpiece produces a corresponding opposite magnetic field which rapidly repels the workpiece from the forming coil, reshaping the workpiece ‚Äî in this case, compressing the diameter of the cylindrical tube. The reciprocal forces acting against the forming coil are resisted by the 'supportive coil casing (green). In practice the metal workpiece to be fabricated is placed in proximity to a heavily constructed coil of wire (called the work coil). A huge pulse of current is forced through the work coil by rapidly discharging a high-voltage capacitor bank using an ignitron or a spark gap as a switch. This creates a rapidly oscillating, ultrastrong electromagnetic field around the work coil. The high work coil current (typically tens or hundreds of thousands of amperes) creates ultrastrong magnetic forces that easily overcome the yield strength of the metal work piece, causing permanent deformation. The metal forming process occurs extremely quickly (typically tens of microseconds) and, because of the large forces, portions of the workpiece undergo high acceleration reaching velocities of up to 300 m/s.  Applications  The forming process is most often used to shrink or expand cylindrical tubing, but it can also form sheet metal by repelling the work piece onto a shaped die at a high velocity. High- quality joints can be formed, either by electromagnetic pulse crimping with a mechanical interlock or by electromagnetic pulse welding with a true metallurgical weld. Since the forming operation involves high acceleration and deceleration, mass of the work piece plays a critical role during the forming process. The process works best with good electrical conductors such as copper or aluminum, but it can be adapted to work with poorer conductors such as steel. Comparison with Mechanical Forming Electromagnetic forming has a number of advantages and disadvantages compared to conventional mechanical forming techniques. Some of the advantages are; *Improved formability (the amount of stretch available without tearing) *Wrinkling can be greatly suppressed *Forming can be combined with joining and assembling with dissimilar components including glass, plastic, composites and other metals. *Close tolerances are possible as springback can be significantly reduced. *Single-sided dies are sufficient, which can reduce tooling costs *Lubricants are reduced or are unnecessary, so forming can be used in clean-room conditions *Mechanical contact with the workpiece is not required; this avoids surface contamination and tooling marks. As a result, a surface finish can be applied to the workpiece before forming. The principle disadvantages are; *Non-conductive materials cannot be formed directly, but can be formed using a conductive drive plate *The high voltages and currents involved require careful safety considerations References  * External links Electromagnetic radiation Metal forming Pulsed power ","title":"Electromagnetic forming"},{"id":"1388230","text":"Philip Markus Petursson (October 21, 1902 in Pinecreek, Minnesota ‚Äì May 12, 1988) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1966 to 1977, and briefly served as a cabinet minister in the government of Edward Schreyer. The son of Olafar Petursson, he moved to Foam Lake, Saskatchewan with his family during his first year of life and then moved to Winnipeg nine years later. He was educated at the University of Manitoba, the University of Chicago, the Meadville Theological School. He was an ordained Unitarian minister, and served as an executive member of the Western Canadian Unitarian Council; in the 1930s, he studied at the University of Iceland so as to be able to conduct services in that language. He also served on the Winnipeg School Board from 1942 to 1951, and was a member of the Canadian Mental Health Association, the Winnipeg Municipal Hospital Commission, and the Welfare Council of Winnipeg. He married Thorey Gislason in 1926. In 1953, Petursson gained attention in Winnipeg's religious community for speaking out against the concept of hell. He ran for the House of Commons of Canada in the federal election of 1949 in the riding of Norquay, but lost to Liberal Robert James Wood by almost 4000 votes. He ran again the federal election of 1965, this time placing third in Winnipeg South Centre against Progressive Conservative Gordon Churchill and Liberal Fred Douglas. Petursson was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1966 provincial election, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Richard Seaborn in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Wellington. In 1968-69, he supported Edward Schreyer to replace Russell Paulley as leader of the provincial NDP. He was re-elected by an increased margin in the 1969 election, in which the NDP formed a minority government under Schreyer. On July 17, 1969, Petursson was named Minister of Cultural Affairs. It was always intended that he would return to the backbenches after a brief period in office, and he was indeed dropped from cabinet on November 4, 1970. Petursson remained an active parliamentarian, and was re-elected in the election of 1973. He did not seek re-election in 1977. He died in Winnipeg at the age of 85.

In Rinzai-Zen, inka sh≈çmei is ideally \\"the formal recognition of Zen's deepest realisation\\", but practically it is being used for the transmission of the \\"true lineage\\" of the masters (shike) of the training halls. There are only about fifty to eighty of such inka sh≈çmei-bearers in Japan. In S≈çt≈ç-Zen, dharma transmission (shiho) provides access to only a relatively low grade. It is listed as a requirement for the very lowest ecclesiastical status, that of an instructor third class (sant≈ç ky≈çshi) and further training is required to become an osh≈ç. History The notion and practice of Dharma Transmission developed early in the history of Ch√°n, as a means to gain credibility and to foster institutional ties among the members of the Ch√°n-community. Charts of dharma-lineages were developed, which represented the continuity of the Buddhist dharma. Originally these lineages only included the Chinese Patriarchs, but they were later extended to twenty-eight Indian Patriarchs and seven Buddhas. =Ch√°n lineage= The Ch√°n- tradition developed from the established tradition of \\"Canonical Buddhism\\", which \\"remained normative for all later Chinese Buddhism\\". It was established by the end of the sixth century, as a result of the Chinese developing understanding of Buddhism in the previous centuries. One of the inventions of this Canonical Buddhism were transmission lists, a literary device to establish a lineage. Both T'ien Tai and Ch√°n took over this literary device, to lend authority to those developing traditions, and guarantee its authenticity: The concept of dharma transmission took shape during the Tang period, when establishing the right teachings became important, to safeguard the authority of specific schools. The emerging Zen-tradition developed the Transmission of the Lamp-genre, in which lineages from Shakyamuni Buddha up to their own times were described. Another literary device for establishing those traditions was given by the Kao-seng-chuan (Biographies of Eminent Monks), compiled around 530. The Ch√°n-tradition developed its own corpus in this genre, with works such as Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall (952) and the Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp (published 1004). McRae considers Dumoulin's A History of Zen to be a modern example of this genre, disguised as scientific history. =Chinese Patriarchs= The Ch√°n-lineages picture the Indian monk Bodhidharma as the patriarch who brought Ch√°n to China. Only scarce historical information is available about him, but his hagiography developed when the Chan tradition grew stronger and gained prominence in the early 8th century. Six Chinese Patriarchs By this time a lineage of the six ancestral founders of Ch√°n in China was developed. In the late 8th century, under the influence of Huineng's student Shenhui, the traditional form of this lineage had been established: # Bodhidharma () ca. 440 ‚Äì ca. 528 # Huike () 487‚Äì593 # Sengcan () ?‚Äì606 # Daoxin () 580‚Äì651 # Hongren () 601‚Äì674 # Huineng () 638‚Äì713 Shenhui and Huineng Huineng tearing sutras According to tradition, the sixth and last ancestral founder, Huineng (ÊÉ†ËÉΩ; 638‚Äì713), was one of the giants of Ch√°n history, and all surviving schools regard him as their ancestor. The dramatic story of Huineng's life tells that there was a controversy over his claim to the title of patriarch. After being chosen by Hongren, the fifth ancestral founder, Huineng had to flee by night to Nanhua Temple in the south to avoid the wrath of Hongren's jealous senior disciples. Modern scholarship, however, has questioned this narrative. Historic research reveals that this story was created around the middle of the 8th century, beginning in 731 by Shenhui, a successor to Huineng, to win influence at the Imperial Court. He claimed Huineng to be the successor of Hongren's, instead of the then publicly recognized successor Shenxiu. In 745 Shen-hui was invited to take up residence in the Ho-tse temple in Lo-yang. In 753 he fell out of grace, and had to leave the capital to go into exile. The most prominent of the successors of his lineage was Guifeng Zongmi According to Tsung-mi, Shen-hui's approach was officially sanctioned in 796, when \\"an imperial commission determined that the Southern line of Ch'an represented the orthodox transmission and established Shen-hui as the seventh patriarch, placing an inscription to that effect in the shen-lung temple\\". Doctrinally the Southern School is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is sudden, while the Northern School is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is gradual. This was a polemical exaggeration, since both schools were derived from the same tradition, and the so-called Southern School incorporated many teachings of the more influential Northern School. Eventually both schools died out, but the influence of Shenhui was so immense that all later Chan schools traced their origin to Huineng, and \\"sudden enlightenment\\" became a standard doctrine of Chan. =Indian Patriarchs= In later writings this lineage was extended to include twenty-eight Indian patriarchs. In the Song of Enlightenment (Ë≠âÈÅìÊ≠å Zh√®ngd√†o gƒì) of Yongjia Xuanjue (Ê∞∏ÂòâÁéÑË¶∫, 665‚Äì713), one of the chief disciples of Hu√¨n√©ng, it is written that Bodhidharma was the 28th patriarch in a line of descent from MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, a disciple of ≈öƒÅkyamuni Buddha, and the first patriarch of Ch√°n Buddhism. Twenty-eight Indian Patriarchs Keizan's Transmission of the Light gives twenty-eight patriarchs up to and including Bodhidharma in this transmission: MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa According to the traditional Ch√°n accounts, the first Dharma transmission occurred as described in the Flower Sermon. The Buddha held up a golden lotus flower before an assembly of \\"gods and men\\". None who were in attendance showed any sign of understanding except his disciple MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, who offered only a smile. The Buddha then said, Function Though dharma transmission implies the acknowledgement of insight into the teachings of Buddhism as understood by the Zen tradition, especially seeing into one's true nature, dharma transmission is also a means to establish a person into the Zen tradition: The dharma lineage reflects the importance of family-structures in ancient China, and forms a symbolic and ritual recreation of this system for the monastical \\"family\\". =Esoteric and exoteric transmission= According to Borup the emphasis on 'mind to mind transmission' is a form of esoteric transmission, in which \\"the tradition and the enlightened mind is transmitted face to face\\". Metaphorically this can be described as the transmission of a flame from one candle to another candle, or the transmission from one vein to another. In exoteric transmission the requirement is \\"direct access to the teaching through a personal discovery of one's self. This type of transmission and identification is symbolized by the discovery of a shining lantern, or a mirror.\\" This polarity is recognizable in the emphasis that the Zen-tradition puts on maintaining the correct Dharma transmission, while simultaneously stressing seeing into one's nature: Nevertheless, while the Zen tradition has always stressed the importance of formal Dharma transmission, there are well known examples of Mushi dokugo, such as N≈çnin, Jinul and Suzuki Sh≈çsan who attained awakening on their own, though all of them were familiair with the Zen-teachings. =Family structure= According to Bodiford, \\"Zen is the predominant form of Buddhism because of dharma transmission\\": Bodiford distinguishes seven dimensions which are discernible in both family relationships and in dharma lineages: # Ancestral dimension: \\"Ancestors (so) constitute a fundamental source of power\\". Performing rituals in honour of the ancestors keeps them in high regard \\"among the living\\". # Biological dimension: the dharma lineage creates (spiritual) offspring, just as the family creates new life. # Linguistic dimension: dharma heirs receive new names, which reflect their tie to the dharma 'family'. # Ritual dimension: rituals confirm the family relationships. One's teacher is honored in rituals, as are deceased teachers. # Legal dimension: teachers have the obligation to discipline their students, just as students have the obligation to obey their teachers. # Institutional and financial dimension: dharma heirs have an obligation to support their home temple, both financially and ritually. # Temporal dimension: long-term relationships foster the previous dimensions. The family-model is easier recognized when East Asian languages are being used, because the same terminology is used to describe both earthly and spiritual family relations. Dharma transmission is both concrete and abstract: This feature gives dharma transmission a great flexibility: Contemporary use in the Zen-traditions Within the various Zen traditions dharma transmission got various meanings. A difference is made in most schools between =Chinese Ch√°n= Traditional Chinese Ch√°n still exists in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, though it is less known in the west than Japanese Zen. In the Chinese Buddhist tradition, there are 3 systems of transmission:Ven Huei Guang Facebook photo album with dharma transmission explanation # Tonsure system: a person becomes tonsured as a novice monastic under the Master's school. He/she is given a Dharma name Ê≥ïËôü at the time of tonsure based on the Master's lineage. This name is also called \\"the outer name Â§ñËôü\\" because it is used by all people to address you. This name is used for life. At the same time, the Master will give the novice sramanera (or sramanerika) ten precepts. # Ordination system: a novice will become fully ordained as a Bhik·π£u monk/ Bhik·π£uni nun with the Triple Platform Ordination (Observing the ≈örƒÅmanera, Bhik·π£u and Bodhisattva precepts). This ordination must be presided by 10 monks with at least 10 years of seniority with a pure practice in upholding the monastic precepts. In this ceremony, the 10 Masters represent the Triple Gem accepting the novice into the Sangha. At this time, another Dharma name Ê≥ïÂêç is given. This name is also called \\"precept name ÊàíÂêç or inner name ÂÖßËôü\\" because it is used only by one's Master. This name represents your precept lineage transmission. # Dharma transmission system: This system upholds the Treasury of the True Dharma Eye through the generations of transmission. This is the Mind to Mind seal of the Dharma that is beyond the scriptures. At this time, another Dharma name Ê≥ïÂêç is given. This is also called \\"the inner name ÂÖßËôü\\" and use only by one's Master. This name represents your Dharma lineage transmission. After receiving this name, one will use this name instead of the name received during precept ordination to write one's Dharma name (Inner Name)(Outer Name). It is customary to refer to one's own tonsure Master as \\"Gracious Master\\", precept Master as \\"Root Master\\" and Dharma transmission Master as \\"Venerable Master\\". In Chinese Buddhism, these 3 systems are separate and are not performed by the same Masters. Moreover, due to the strong emphasis on the Dharma, when a person receives the Dharma transmission, he/she is recognized as that Ch'an Master's Dharma son/daughter. Of course lay Buddhists may also receive this Dharma transmission, but there are very few incidences. Most of the monk/nun who received the transmission has already been tonsured and ordained by other Masters. =Rinzai= All Rinzai lineages pass through Hakuin Ekaku, the 18th century revivalist, who considered himself to be an heir of Shoju Rojin (Shoju Ronin, Dokyu Etan, 1642‚Äì1721), though Hakuin never received formal dharma transmission from Shoju Rojin, nor from any other teacher.James Ford (2009), Teaching Credentials in Zen When he was installed as head priest of Sh≈çin-ji in 1718, he had the title of Dai-ichiza, \\"First Monk\\": All contemporary Rinzai-lineages stem from Inzan Ien (1751‚Äì1814) and Takuju Kosen (1760‚Äì1833), both students of Gasan Jito (1727‚Äì1797). Gasan is considered to be a dharma heir of Hakuin, though \\"he did not belong to the close circle of disciples and was probably not even one of Hakuin's dharma heirs\\". Through Hakuin, all contemporary Japanese Rinzai- lineages are part of the ≈åt≈çkan lineage, brought to Japan in 1267 by Nanpo Jomyo, who received dharma transmission in China in 1265.Rinzai-Obaku Zen - What is Zen? - History Insight and succession In the Rinzai school, a difference is made between acknowledgement of insight and succession in the organisation: According to Mohr, The most common form of transmission in Rinzai Zen is the acknowledgement that one has stayed in the monastery for a certain amount of time, and may later become a temple priest. Further practice After finishing the koan-study, further practice is necessary: Inka sh≈çmei The common transmission does not include inka sh≈çmei. Ideally inka sh≈çmei is \\"the formal recognition of Zen's deepest realisation\\", but practically it is being used for the transmission of the \\"true lineage\\" of the masters (shike) of the training halls. Training halls are temples which are authorised for further training after being qualified as a temple priest. There are only about fifty to eighty of such inka sh≈çmei-bearers in Japan: According to roshi Sokun Tsushimoto, the title of roshi is equivalent to Zen master and shike: A qualified Zen master bestows inka only upon \\"those select few\\" who have successfully completed the entire Rinzai koan curriculum,Matthiessen, 277 and \\"are eligible to serve as s≈çd≈ç roshi, that is, master of a training hall, in distinction from a common temple: According to roshi Sokun Tsushimoto, (Korean: Inga) literally means \\"the legitimate seal of clearly furnished proof\\": The right-hand portion of the seal was given to an individual who would then work by authority of the emperor, while the emperor himself would retain the left-hand portion. In ancient times inka usually came in the form of an actual document, but this practice is no longer commonplace.Hori, 674 =S≈çt≈ç= In S≈çt≈ç, dharma transmission is the acknowledgement of the ties between teacher and student. It has been subject to changes over the history of the S≈çt≈ç-school. Though D≈çgen emphasized the importance of the purity of the teachings, and highly valued lineage and dharma transmission, the S≈çt≈ç-school has its origins in various lineages and dharma transmissions. Dogen received dharma transmission from his Chinese teacher Rujing, with whom he studied two years, but in medieval S≈çt≈ç he was also considered to be a dharma heir of My≈çzen, a Rinzai-teacher, with whom he studied eight years. And Tetts≈´ Gikai, the dharma-grandson of Dogen, was also lineage-holder of N≈çnin, the founder of the Dharuma-shu, also a Rinzai-school. Gikai passed this lineage over to Keizan, who thereby was also lineage-holder in at least two lineages. To make the history of S≈çt≈ç even more complicated, the Caodong-lineage that Dogen inherited through Rujing was passed on previously from the Caodong-master Dayang Jingxuan to Touzi Yiqing via the Rinzai-master Fushan Fayuan. Fushan Fayuan had once studied under Dayang Jingxuan. When Jingxuan died Fayuan had received Jingxuan's \\"portrait, robe, and a verse that expressed his teaching\\", promising \\"to pass them on to a suitable successor\\". Fayuan chose his student Touzi Yiqing to inherit this lineage, a fact that was acknowledged in Keizan's Denkoroku, but \\"[i]n the standard versions of Dogen's writings, however, all direct references to Yiqing's indirect succession have been eliminated\\". Criteria Manzan Dokahu (1636‚Äì1714), a S≈çt≈ç reformer, According to Manzan, even an unenlightened student could receive dharma transmission: In S≈çt≈ç-zen, since Manzan Dokahu, two criteria are applied for dharma transmission: # Isshi insh≈ç ‚Äì \\"Exclusive authentication from no more than one teacher\\". This criterion \\"prohibits clerics inheriting more than one lineage\\" # Menju shih≈ç ‚Äì \\"Face-to- face bestowal of succession\\". This criterion \\"prohibits conferral by proxy, conferral at a distance to strangers, or posthumous conferral\\". Status In contrast to the status that dharma transmission has begotten in the west, in S≈çt≈ç it has a relatively low status: To supervise the training of monks, further qualifications are necessary: The duties which come with this full qualification were not always appreciated. In the medieval organisation of the S≈çt≈ç-shu, when rotation of abbotship was the norm. Dharma transmission at a branch temple obliged one to serve at least one term as abbot at the main temple. Abbotship gave severe duties, and financial burdens, for which reason many tried to avoid the responsibility of abbotship: Spiritual realization The S≈çt≈ç-shu also confers inka sh≈çmy≈ç (or insh≈ç) \\"[granting] the seal of approval to a realization of enlightenment\\", upon students. This is an Dharma transmission is part of the maintenance of the S≈çt≈ç-institutions. Authority and temple-property are handed down, often from father to son. It is not a guarantee for spiritual attainment: Shiho Dharma transmission is also called shiho. In the S≈çt≈ç school a student receives Dharma transmission during a denb≈ç ceremony, which is the last ceremony of their shiho ceremony: Shiho is... Shiho is done \\"one-to-one in the abbot's quarters (hojo)\\". Three handwritten documents certify the dharma transmission; The procedure has to take place only once in one's life, and binds the student to the teacher forever: If a students does not have the feeling he wants to be tied to this teacher for the rest of his life, he may refuse to take dharma transmission from this particular teacher. Since the time of Manzan Dokahu (1636‚Äì1714), multiple dharma transmissions are impossible in S≈çt≈ç Zen. Further study According to Muho Noelke, dharma transmission marks the beginning of the real learning: After Dharma transmission one has become a member of the \\"blood line\\" of Zen, but is not yet qualified as an Osh≈ç. After the ten-e and zuise ceremonies, one is qualified as an osh≈ç. There-after one has to practice for some time, at least six months, in an s√¥d√¥-ango, an officially recognized S≈çt≈ç-shu training centre.Muho Noelke, Part 5: Sessa-takuma - ango as life in a rock grinder After that one can start to work in a temple. The newly acquired status is confirmed in the kyoshi-honin ceremony. There-after follows the first practice-period in one's own temple, with the aid of a susho (head monk). This is followed by the Jushoku-himei ceremony, which confirms one's status as dai-osh≈ç. =Sanbo Kyodan= The Sanbo Kyodan mixes S≈çt≈ç and Rinzai- elements. Students in this school follow the Harada-Yasutani koan curriculum, in which great emphasis is placed on kensho, the initial insight into one's true nature. Having attained kensho is publicly acknowledged in a jahai- ceremony. After working through the Harada-Yasutani koan curriculum, which may take as short as five years, the student receives a calligraphy testifying that het or she \\"has finished the great matter\\". This is publicly acknowledged in the hasansai-ceremony, giving the status of hasan. The Sanbo Kyodan has two levels of teaching authority, namely junshike (\\"associate zen master\\"), and sh≈çshike (\\"authentic zen master\\"). Junshikes can give dokusan, authorize kensho, and supervise part of the koan-study. Shoshikes can supervise the advanced koan-study, and perform religious ceremonies, such as the precept- ceremony and wedding ceremonies. The process toward gaining these titles has seen some variations within the Sanbo Kyodan. Hasansai may be preparatory to the junshike-title, but may also be the promotion to this title. And promotion to shoshike may be preparatory to dharma transmission, but may also be equivalent to it. In dharma transmission, the student receives the sanmotsu, akin to the S≈çt≈ç shiho ceremony. This is coupled with the Rinzai notion on inka. In Rinzai, only students who have completed the complete Rinzai koan curriculum and \\"are eligible to serve as s≈çd≈ç roshi, that is, master of a training hall, in distinction from a common temple, receive inka. In the Sanbo Kyodan, inka is derived from Harada's Rinzai master Dokutan S≈çsan. =White Plum Asanga= Michel Genko Dubois (left) and Dennis Genpo Merzel performing \\"mind to mind\\" in Dubois's shiho ceremony. In the White Plum Asanga, Dharma transmission comes first, and qualifies one as a sensei. This may be followed by inka, the final acknowledgemment:Aitken, 25-26 =Korean Soen= In Korean Soen, Inka (In'ga) typically refers to the private acknowledgement of dharma transmission from a teacher to their student. \\"Transmission\\" is used to refer to the public ceremonial version of the same acknowledgement. Both are considered equal in authority and \\"realization\\". A monk with either In'ga or the public \\"transmission\\" is qualified to hold the post of Soen Sa, or \\"Zen Master\\" for a temple, and give transmission to their own students (either, In'ga or public \\"transmission\\"). The majority of Zen Masters in Korea have only received, and only give In'ga, with the formal transmission ceremony being far more rare.Buswell In the Western Kwan Um School of Zen created by the Korean Zen Master Seung Sahn, \\"Inka\\" is granted to an individual who has completed their koan training and is granted the title Ji Do Poep Sa Nim. Dharma transmission in the Kwan Um School of Zen comes after inka, denoting the individual is now a Soen Sa Nim.Ford, 93; 220 Seung Sahn himself is quoted saying in reference to the administration of his Western organization, =Vietnamese Thi·ªÅn= Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh has created a ritual known as \\"Lamp Transmission\\", making a teacher a dharmƒÅcƒÅrya‚Äîan individual with \\"limited teaching authority.\\" According to author James Ishmael Ford, Criticism In the western understanding, dharma transmission stands solely for recognition of authentic insight, whereas in the Japanese monastery system dharma transmission is a formal notification that someone is fully qualified to take a leading role in this system. In the USA and Europe dharma transmission is linked to the unofficial title roshi, older teacher. In the Western understanding roshis are \\"part of a tradition that imputes to them quasi- divine qualities\\", someone who \\"is defined by simplicity, innocence, and lack of self-interest or desire\\". Nevertheless, the authorisation of teachers through dharma transmission does not mean that teachers are infallible, as is clear from the repeated appearance of scandals: According to Lachs, those scandals have also been possible because of the status given to roshis by dharma transmission, and \\"a desire for the master‚Äôs aura, recognition, and approval\\": See also * Mushi dokugo * Lineage (Buddhism) * Zen ranks and hierarchy ;In other religions * Apostolic succession * Guru-shishya tradition * Isnad * Parampara * Silsila Notes References Web-references Sources           Further reading  =Historiography= =Contemporary practice=   External links  * Roshi and His Teachers, Dharma Transmission,and the Rochester Zen Center Lineage Roshi Bodhin Kjolhede discusses lineage and Dharma transmission. * Coming Down from the Zen Clouds:A Critique of the Current State of American Zen Stuart Lachs criticizes Dharma transmission in Zen * Dharma Transmission & Succession, A Sweeping Zen Roundtable Discussion (Podcast) Erik Storlie, Myoan Grace Schireson and Eshu Martin discuss Dharma transmission & succession * Sweeping Zen: Inka shomei * Married monks? * Erik Fraser Storlie: Lineage Delusions: Eido Shimano Roshi, Dharma Transmission, and American Zen * Muho Noelke: What does it take to become a full-fledged S≈çt≈ç-shu priest and is it really worth the whole deal?

It can then be used in DNA or RNA samples to detect the presence of nucleotide substances (the RNA target) that are complementary to the sequence in the probe. The probe thereby hybridizes to single-stranded nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) whose base sequence allows probe‚Äìtarget base pairing due to complementarity between the probe and target. The labeled probe is first denatured (by heating or under alkaline conditions such as exposure to sodium hydroxide) into single stranded DNA (ssDNA) and then hybridized to the target ssDNA (Southern blotting) or RNA (northern blotting) immobilized on a membrane or in situ. To detect hybridization of the probe to its target sequence, the probe is tagged (or \\"labeled\\") with a molecular marker of either radioactive or (more recently) fluorescent molecules; commonly used markers are 32P (a radioactive isotope of phosphorus incorporated into the phosphodiester bond in the probe DNA) or digoxigenin, which is a non- radioactive, antibody-based marker. DNA sequences or RNA transcripts that have moderate to high sequence similarity to the probe are then detected by visualizing the hybridized probe via autoradiography or other imaging techniques. Normally, either X-ray pictures are taken of the filter, or the filter is placed under UV light. Detection of sequences with moderate or high similarity depends on how stringent the hybridization conditions were applied‚Äîhigh stringency, such as high hybridization temperature and low salt in hybridization buffers, permits only hybridization between nucleic acid sequences that are highly similar, whereas low stringency, such as lower temperature and high salt, allows hybridization when the sequences are less similar. Hybridization probes used in DNA microarrays refer to DNA covalently attached to an inert surface, such as coated glass slides or gene chips, to which a mobile cDNA target is hybridized. Depending on the method, the probe may be synthesized using the phosphoramidite method, or it can be generated and labeled by PCR amplification or cloning (both are older methods). In order to increase the in vivo stability of the probe RNA is not used. Instead, RNA analogues may be used, in particular morpholino- derivatives. Molecular DNA- or RNA-based probes are now routinely used in screening gene libraries, detecting nucleotide sequences with blotting methods, and in other gene technologies, such as nucleic acid and tissue microarrays.  Examples of probes  *Scorpion¬Æ probes *Molecular Beacon probes *TaqMan¬Æ probes *LNA¬Æ (Locked Nucleic Acid) probes *Cycling Probe Technology (CPT)  Uses in microbial ecology  Within the field of microbial ecology, oligonucleotide probes are used in order to determine the presence of microbial species, genera, or microorganisms classified on a more broad level, such as bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). rRNA probes have enabled scientists to visualize microorganisms, yet to be cultured in laboratory settings, by retrieval of rRNA sequences directly from the environment. Examples of these types of microorganisms include: *Nevskia ramosa: N. ramosa is a neuston bacterium that forms typical, dichotomically- branching rosettes on the surface of shallow freshwater habitats. *Achromatium oxaliferum: This huge bacterium (cell length up to >100 ¬µm, diameter up to 50 ¬µm) contains sulfur globules and massive calcite inclusions and inhabits the upper layers of freshwater sediments. It is visible to the naked eye and has, by its resistance to cultivation, puzzled generations of microbiologists. = Limitations = In some instances, differentiation between species may be problematic when using 16S rRNA sequences due to similarity. In such instances, 23S rRNA may be a better alternative. The global standard library of rRNA sequences is constantly becoming larger and continuously being updated, and thus the possibility of a random hybridization event between a specifically-designed probe (based on complete and current data from a range of test organisms) and an undesired/unknown target organism cannot be easily dismissed. On the contrary, it is plausible that there exist microorganisms, yet to be identified, which are phylogenetically members of a probe target group, but have partial or near-perfect target sites. usually applies when designing group-specific probes. Probably the greatest practical limitation to this technique is the lack of available automation.  Use in forensic science  In forensic science, hybridization probes are used, for example, for detection of short tandem repeats (microsatellite) regions and in restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methods, all of which are widely used as part of DNA profiling analysis.

WiBro is the South Korean service name for IEEE 802.16e (mobile WiMAX) international standard. By the end of 2012, the Korean Communications Commission intends to increase WiBro broadband connection speeds to 10Mbit/s, around ten times the 2009 speed, which will complement their 1Gbit/s fibre-optic network. The WiBro networks were shut down at the end of 2018. WiBro adopts TDD for duplexing, OFDMA for multiple access and 8.75/10.00 MHz as a channel bandwidth. WiBro was devised to overcome the data rate limitation of mobile phones (for example CDMA 1x) and to add mobility to broadband Internet access (for example ADSL or Wireless LAN). In February 2002, the Korean government allocated 100 MHz of electromagnetic spectrum in the 2.3‚Äì2.4 GHz band, and in late 2004 WiBro Phase 1 was standardized by the TTA of Korea and in late 2005 ITU reflected WiBro as IEEE 802.16e (mobile WiMAX). Two South Korean telecom companies (KT, SKT) launched commercial service in June 2006, and the tariff is around US$30. WiBro base stations offer an aggregate data throughput of 30 to 50 Mbit/s per carrier and cover a radius of 1‚Äì5 km allowing for the use of portable internet usage. In detail, it provides mobility for moving devices up to 120 km/h (74.5 mi/h) compared to Wireless LAN having mobility up to walking speed and mobile phone technologies having mobility up to 250 km/h. From testing during the APEC Summit in Busan in late 2005, the actual range and bandwidth were quite a bit lower than these numbers. The technology will also offer Quality of Service. The inclusion of QoS allows for WiBro to stream video content and other loss-sensitive data in a reliable manner. These all appear to be (and may be) the stronger advantages over the fixed WiMAX standard (802.16a). Some Telcos in many countries were trying to commercialize this Mobile WiMAX (or WiBro). For example, TI (Italy), TVA (Brazil), Omnivision (Venezuela), PORTUS (Croatia), and Arialink (Michigan) provided commercial service at some stage. While WiBro is quite precise in its requirements from spectrum use to equipment design, WiMAX leaves much of this up to the equipment provider while providing enough detail to ensure interoperability between designs. WiBro has a Peak Download speed of 128 Mbit/s and a Peak Upload speed of 56 Mbit/s. Current service In Korea, KT (Korea Telecom) offers Wave 2 (18.4 Mbit/s, 4 Mbit/s) for 10000 KRW/mo (around $11 or ‚Ç¨6.50) with 10 GB data usage to 40000 KRW/mo with 50 GB data usage plus free access to their own WiFi hotspots, ollehWiFi. The service coverage is advertised as nationwide, but actual coverage is restricted to every city, some railroad station, airports, and major highways. SK Telecom also offers Wave 2 WiBro Service for $18.87 a month with 30 GB data usage. Actual service coverage is limited mostly to major cities and highways. For short term visitors, KT rents WiBro modem and bridge at KT Roaming Center in Incheon International Airport. As of October 2012, WiBro-only USB modem costs 5,000 KRW per day plus 100,000 KRW deposit, WiBro- HSPA USB modem and WiBro Egg cost 8,000 KRW per day plus 150,000 KRW deposit. One-day rent is free at KT Roaming Center, and requires credit card and passport. In India, Tikona Digital Networks (Independent services provider) offers WiBro service for up to 2 Mbit/s and 4 Mbit/s in many cities. The 2 Mbit/s unlimited monthly plan costs Rs. 999.00 (roughly $21). Coverage As of January 2013, KT covers all 80+ cities while SK covers Seoul and a few other major cities in South Korea.

The film depicts the struggle of a dog trainer named Keys (Paul Winfield), who is black, trying to retrain a stray dog found by a young actress (Kristy McNichol), that is a \\"white dog\\"‚Äîa dog trained to make vicious attacks upon, and to kill, any black person. Fuller uses the film as a platform to deliver an anti-racist message as it examines the question of whether racism is a treatable problem or an incurable condition. The film's theatrical release was suppressed for a week in the United States by Paramount Pictures out of concern over negative press after rumors began circulating that the film was racist. Prior to the date, it was released internationally in France in July 1982. Its first official American home video release came in December 2008 when The Criterion Collection released the original uncut film to DVD. Critics praised the film's hard-line look at racism and Fuller's use of melodrama and metaphors to present his argument, and its somewhat disheartening ending that leaves the impression that while racism is learned, it cannot be cured. Reviewers consistently questioned the film's lack of wide release in the United States when it was completed and applauded its belated release by Criterion. Plot During the American civil rights movement, white actress Julie Sawyer accidentally runs over a stray White Shepherd dog. After the veterinarian treats him, Julie takes him home while trying to find his owners. A rapist breaks into her house and tries to attack her, but the dog protects her. She decides to adopt him, against the wishes of her boyfriend Roland Graele. Unbeknown to her, the dog was trained by a white racist to attack black people on sight. The dog sneaks out of the house, and kills a black truck driver. Later, Julie takes the dog to work with her, and he mauls a black actress on the set. Julie takes the dog to a trainer, Carruthers, who tells her to euthanize the dog. Another dog trainer, Keys, who is black, decides to try to retrain the dog. He dons protective gear and keeps the dog in a large enclosure, taking him out on a chain and exposing himself to the dog each day and making sure he is the only one to feed or care for the dog. The dog escapes and kills an elderly black man in a church. Keys recovers him, and opts not to turn him over to authorities to continue the training, over Julie's protests. He warns her that the training has reached a tipping point, where the dog might be cured or go insane. He believes that curing the dog will discourage white racists from training dogs like this. Eventually, the dog becomes friendly towards Keys. Julie confronts the dog's original owner, who has come to claim him. She angrily tells him the dog has been cured by a black person in front of his grandchildren who knew the dog to be a loving pet. Just as Julie and Keys celebrate their victory, the dog, without warning, turns its attention to Carruthers and attacks him. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to shoot and kill the dog. Themes White Dog is a \\"blunt, highly cinematic parable about race relations\\" that questions whether racism is a curable mental illness or learned behavior, or if it is an untreatable disease. The unnamed white German Shepherd is the metaphor of racism, with his radically contrasting moments of innocent, typical dog behavior when not around black persons, and his snarling viciousness when he sees a target. Paul Winfield's character Keys, who believes he can help the dog unlearn this behavior, represents the view that racism can be unlearned. Keys's attempts to reprogram the dog become a \\"bold literalization of the race war,\\" and as the film progresses Keys becomes obsessed with the idea that he can cure the dog. Much like Captain Ahab, he declares that if he fails with this dog, he will find another and another until he succeeds. Keys's counterpart, Carruthers, a white trainer, believes the dog is irredeemable and should be killed, representing the view that racism cannot be cured. Scenes showing Kristy McNichol innocently burying her hands in the dog's fur and his normal loving behavior when alone with her provides a stark image of \\"how hatred can be familiar, reassuringly close.\\" J. Hoberman argues that the film \\"naturalizes racism in an unnatural way\\" in the contrasting depictions of white characters horrified by the dog's behavior, and black characters who grimly accept it as a fact of life. The film's ending has been argued to emphasize Fuller's own view that racism is something that is learned, but that once learned is a \\"poison\\" that can never truly \\"be banished from those it infects.\\" But on the other hand, the dog is actually cured of attacking blacks, but not cured of his own hatred since the last thing he does is to attack a white man, and without being provoked into doing so at that. The ending implies therefore that it is hatred (and not racism) that cannot be banished from those it infects. In Romain Gary's original novel, this was not the story that was told‚Äîthe dog started to attack white people because a black man embittered by white racism deliberately retrained him to do so. Production White Dog's roots lie with a 1970 autobiographical novel written by Romain Gary of the same name. The story was purchased for use by Paramount in 1975, with Curtis Hanson selected to write the screenplay and Roman Polanski hired to direct. Before shooting commenced, Polanski was charged with rape and fled the country, leaving the production in limbo. Over a span of six years, the project was given to various writers and producers, who all focused on the stray dog story from Gary's original work. Gary's activist wife was replaced in the script with a young, unmarried actress because Paramount wanted to contrast the dog's random attacks with a loving relationship between the protagonist and the dog. Paramount executives noted that they wanted a \\"Jaws with paws\\" and indicated that they wanted any racial elements to be downplayed. In one memo, the company noted: \\"Given the organic elements of this story, it is imperative that we never overtly address through attitude or statement the issue of racism per se.\\" By 1981, Gary's wife, and then Gary himself, had both committed suicide. At the same time, Hollywood was under threat of strikes by both the Writers' and Directors' Guilds. Needing enough films to carry the studio through in case the strikes happened, White Dog was one of 13 films considered to be far enough along to be completable in a short time frame. With a push from Michael Eisner, White Dog was one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production. Eisner pushed for the film to be one of the selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned. Producer Jon Davison was less certain and, early on, he questioned how the film was being marketed. Hanson, back on board as the film's screenwriter, suggested that Samuel Fuller be named the film's director as he felt Fuller was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget, while still doing so responsibly with regard to the sensitive material. Davison agreed after visiting Fuller and seeing Fuller act out how he would shoot the film. Fuller readily agreed, having focused much of his own career on racial issues. Already familiar with the novel and with the concept of \\"white dogs\\", he was tasked with \\"reconceptualizing\\" the film to have the conflict depicted in the book occur within the dog rather than the people. In an earlier Variety magazine interview, Fuller stated that viewers would \\"see a dog slowly go insane and then come back to sanity.\\" Before filming began, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Black Anti-Defamation Coalition (BADC), and other civil-rights leaders began voicing concerns that the film would spur racial violence. In an editorial in the Los Angeles Times, Robert Price, executive director of the BADC, criticized the studio for producing the film based on a book by a white man and using a primarily white cast and crew, rather than producing the film with African Americans in key positions. He also considered Gary's work to be a \\"second-rate novel\\" and questioned its use when \\"bookshelves are laden with quality novels by black writers who explore the same social and psychological areas with far more subtlety?\\" Fuller, however, was confident in his work and the idea that the film would be strongly anti-racist, particularly with the changes he had made to the original work. The original novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer, who had deliberately retrained the dog to attack white people, was converted into the character of Keys, who genuinely wished to cure the animal. Fuller also changed the novel's original ending into a more pessimistic film ending. The film was shot in only forty-five days at a cost of $7 million. Five white German Shepherd Dogs played the unnamed central character. After filming commenced, Paramount Pictures brought in two African-American consultants to review and approve the depiction of the black characters: Willis Edwards, vice president of the local NAACP chapter, and David L. Crippens, the vice president and stage manager of the local PBS affiliate. In the end, they walked away with different views of the film. Crippens did not find the film to have any racist connotations, while Edwards found it inflammatory and felt it should not have been made, particularly not during that year, when a series of murders of black children was occurring in Atlanta. The two men provided a write-up of their views for the studio executives, which were passed to Davison along with warnings that the studio feared a film boycott. But Fuller was neither told of these discussions, nor given the notes, until two weeks before filming was slated to conclude. Known for being a staunch integrationist and for his regularly giving black actors non-stereotypical roles, Fuller was furious, finding the studio's actions insulting. He reportedly had both representatives banned from the set afterwards, though he did integrate some of the suggested changes into the film. The film was completed in 1981, but Paramount was hesitant to release the film out of continuing concerns that the film would be misconstrued. Though no one from the organization had viewed the completed film, the NAACP threatened boycotts. In early 1982, the studio finally held a preview screening in Seattle and later, in August, in Denver, with mixed responses. Retrieved June 10, 2020. It was finally released in the US at five Detroit theatres on November 12, 1982 for just one week, with no trailer, no poster and no promotion at all. It did no business and was shelved as uncommercial by Paramount. Dumbfounded and hurt by the film's shelving, Fuller moved to France and never directed another American film. Later in April 1987, during an interview held in Milan, Fuller stated that Paramount shelved the film also because they feared negative reactions from the KKK. Distribution Paramount felt the film was too controversial for release, giving it only a few preview showings and a one- week run in Detroit before shelving it. The film's first theatrical release occurred in France on July 7, 1982. In the United Kingdom, it was part of the 37th Edinburgh International Film Festival and the 27th London Film Festival in 1983, and was released late that year by United International Pictures. It received positive reviews in both countries. Lisa Dombrowski of Film Comment notes, \\"In the end, Sam Fuller's White Dog was muzzled by a collision of historically specific economic and political interests, as support for freedom of expression took a back seat to Paramount's bottom line and the NAACP's ongoing battles with Hollywood over representation and employment. A Sam Fuller thriller was simply not the kind of antiracist picture that a major studio knew how to market in 1981 or that African-American organizations wanted Hollywood to make at the time.\\" In 1983, White Dog was edited for a direct-to-television broadcast and made available for purchase by cable channels. The following year, NBC bought broadcast rights for $2.5 million and slated the film to air during the February sweeps, then canceled the broadcast two days later due to pressure from the continuing NAACP campaign and concerns of a negative reaction by both viewers and advertisers. The film was eventually aired on other cable channels such as HBO, Showtime, and The Movie Channel sporadically and without fanfare. It was also infrequently screened at independent film houses and film festivals. In 1991, Michael Schlesinger, then head of Paramount's repertory division, convinced his bosses to let him book the film as part of a complete Fuller retrospective at New York's Film Forum. He did not tell them that it would be a full one-week booking, instead of the usual single day, and billed as its New York premiere. The film received rave reviews and crowds packed the theatre; at year's end, The Village Voice called it the best film of the year. Demands to play the film increased. After some deliberation, Paramount said he could continue to accept dates provided that there would be no \\"racial\\" outcry; if there were, he would have to stop. He accepted the deal, and it successfully played revival houses in the rest of the country without incident. Its first official American home video release came on December 2, 2008, when The Criterion Collection released the film to DVD. The DVD has the uncut version of the film, video interviews from the original producer and writer, an interview with the trainer of the dog used in the film, and a booklet of critical essays. The National Society of Film Critics bestowed the distributor with a special film heritage award for releasing the film. Reception Because of its limited release, it only grossed $46,509. The film was praised by critics upon its release, particularly for its treatment of racism and Fuller's directorial talents. Dave Kehr, of the Chicago Tribune, praised Fuller for \\"pulling no punches\\" in the film and for his use of metaphors to present racism \\"as a mental disease, for which there may or may not be a cure.\\" Kehr considered the film less melodramatic or bizarre than Fuller's earlier works, which was also positive since it left the film \\"clean and uncluttered with a single, concentrated line of development mounting toward a single, crushingly pessimistic moral insight.\\" Entertainment Weekly's Kim Moran called it a \\"uncompromising, poignant examination of racism\\" and felt it was one of Fuller's most inspired films and a \\"gripping, meditative, and ultimately beautiful achievement.\\" Video Business reviewer Cyril Pearl called it \\"bombastic, odd and quite chilling\\" and felt the film was an antiracist work that \\"deserve[d] an audience.\\" Charles Taylor, writing for The New York Times, lambasted the film's original suppression due to \\"the stupidity of pressure groups\\" that wrongly labeled the film as racist when it is, in his words, \\"a profoundly antiracist film, though a despairing one.\\" He praised Winfield's tense performance and Fuller's use of melodrama to create one of his \\"most potent\\" films. Lisa Dombrowski, the author of The Films of Samuel Fuller: If You Die, I'll Kill You! and an associate professor of film studies at Wesleyan University, referred to the film as \\"an impassioned attack on racial hatred.\\" Another New York Times reviewer, Janet Maslin, praised Fuller's \\"command of stark, spooky imagery,\\" \\"B-style bluntness,\\" and the way the cinematography, scene setting, and soundtrack combine to give the film \\"the blunt, unnerving power of a horror story.\\" She also commended Paul Winfield's performance as Keys, feeling the actor turned what might have been a boring character into one audiences would find interesting. Slant Magazine's Fernando F. Croce felt the film was \\"part marauding-animal horror movie, part Afterschool Special, [and] part tragic-sardonic agitprop\\" B-movie that is \\"searing confrontation of the irrationality of prejudice.\\" In The Magic Hour: Film at Fin de Si√®cle, J. Hoberman referred to the film as an \\"unusually blunt and suggestive metaphoric account of American racism\\". Though he felt the film was a \\"sad waste\\" of Fuller's talent, he praised the director's treatment of the work, including the changes made to the source material, noting that \\"filmed in headlines, framed as allegory, White Dog combines hard-boiled sentimentality and hysterical violence.\\" He praised the musical score used in the film for lending dignity to the \\"iconic visuals and cartoon dialogue.\\" See also *List of films about animals References External links White Dog: Fuller Vs.

He rose to fame with the progressive metal band Queensr√øche, who had commercial success with their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime and 1990 album Empire. Tate is ranked fourteenth on Hit Paraders list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. He was voted No. 2 on That Metal Show's top 5 hard rock vocalists of the 1980s. In 2012, he won the Vegas Rocks! Magazine Music Award for \\"Voice in Progressive Heavy Metal\\". In 2015, he placed ninth on OC Weekly's list of the 10 Best High-Pitched Metal Singers. After his farewell tour as Queensr√øche, he renamed his band Operation: Mindcrime, after the Queensr√øche album of the same name. Early years Tate was born in Stuttgart, which was then part of West Germany, to American parents. His mother's side of the family is from New Orleans. Shortly after his birth, his family relocated to Tacoma, Washington. Tate had an interest in music from an early age. He was especially interested in symphonic works. Tate wanted to be a football player until a knee injury put an end to that. He enrolled in Tacoma Community College after graduating High School in 1977. He dropped out after a year. Career =Queensr√øche (1982‚Äì2012)= Tate first started out in the local cover band Tyrant, with Adam Bomb and future Culprit/TKO member Scott Earl. At the time, Tate was using the name \\"Jeff Waterfall\\" and performing Van Halen and Rainbow covers. After losing a local \\"Battle of the Bands\\" to a band that would later change its name to Fifth Angel, Tyrant split up and Tate moved on to progressive band Babylon. While Tate was in Babylon, he was asked to sing with the cover band The Mob (who would later start writing original material and become Queensr√øche) at a local rock festival.Miller, Brett. \\"Before the Storm ‚Äì The Early Days of Queensr√øche\\". www.queensrychehistory.com. Retrieved 24 April 2006. After Babylon broke up, Tate performed a few shows with The Mob, but left because he was not interested in performing heavy metal cover songs. Tate then joined the progressive metal band Myth as lead vocalist and keyboardist. Other band members of Myth included Kelly Gray, who was later one of the replacements for Queensr√øche guitarist Chris DeGarmo, and Randy Gane, both of whom joined Tate's version of Queensr√øche in 2012. The Mob again called on Tate in 1981, this time to record a demo tape, which he accepted, convincing his bandmates in Myth that getting professional recording experience would benefit all of them in the future. Meanwhile, The Mob already had a set of songs, but one song was still left without lyrics. Tate was asked to write lyrics to this song, which would become the song \\"The Lady Wore Black\\", Tate's first penned song with the band. The demo tape was widely circulated, and was released as an EP in 1982 on the 206 Records label. Around this time, the name The Mob was changed to Queensr√øche, and Tate left Myth to become Queensr√øche's permanent lead singer. Myth went on to record the album Arabia after Tate had left. Queensr√øche was signed to EMI in the summer of 1983, with a contract spanning 15 years and encompassing seven albums. EMI re-released the EP, Queensr√øche, to moderate success, peaking at No. 81 on the Billboard charts. With Queensr√øche, Tate had great successes, especially with the concept album Operation: Mindcrime, which was released in 1988, and 1990's Empire. The band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide. On 20 June 2012, it was announced that Queensr√øche had fired Tate, replacing him with Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre. Soon after, Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band's manager from 2005 to 2012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, saying that he was wrongfully terminated from the group. They also filed a preliminary injunction in an attempt to prevent either side from using the band's name and likeness until the lawsuit was settled, but this was denied by a judge who decided that both parties can use the name Queensr√øche until a settlement or a court verdict determines who gets the name. It was revealed to the public on 28 April 2014 that Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson were given the exclusive rights to the Queensr√øche trademark and that Tate received the rights to Operation: Mindcrime. =Firing from Queensr√øche, case and settlement (2012‚Äì2014)=  Confrontation  Drummer Scott Rockenfield and singer Geoff Tate performing with Queensr√øche in S√£o Paulo, Brazil on 14 April 2012. Tate would repeatedly spit at Rockenfield during this show. In a band meeting on 12 April 2012, which Tate did not attend, the band fired both Tate's stepdaughter, Miranda, from running the fan club, and his wife Susan, their band manager since 2005. According to Wilton, the reasons were that \\"the last 3 years, basically it just came to a point that we didn‚Äôt have a voice in the band anymore. It was all run by the singer and his manager, the wife.\\" On 14 April 2012, before the soundcheck for a show in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, Tate had an argument with the other members about the firing of his family. This confrontation became heated, leading to Tate retaliating by throwing over the drum kit, throwing several punches and physically assaultingQueensr√øche Drummer: We Had 'No Choice But To Move On Without' Geoff Tate.

They called a band meeting on 5 June (some sources say 6 June). Tate withdrew from this conference call, after which the other band members voted to \\"consider Geoff Tate expelled from the band\\" and \\"continue to use the Queensr√øche name with a new lead singer\\". (Exhibit E.)  Lawsuit  On 12 June, Tate and his wife filed a lawsuit in a Seattle court against his former bandmates, claiming that he was illegally fired from the band. They also sought a preliminary injunction to prevent both the plaintiffs and the defendants from using the Queensr√øche name. On 13 July 2012, the Washington state superior court denied this motion, as well as a motion for a preliminary summary judgment filed by the defendants. The court ruled that both parties may use the brand Queensr√øche until a court ruling or settlement would arrange otherwise. As a result of the judge's preliminary verdict, both parties had a band that used the name and brand of Queensr√øche from 2012 to April 2014; the lineup fronted by La Torre, and with Tate announcing his own lineup.  Settlement  A settlement was reached on 17 April 2014, and a statement from both parties was released on 28 April 2014. The statement announced that Tate lost the brand Queensr√øche to Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson, who together with La Torre and Lundgren are to be \\"the sole band recording and touring as Queensryche\\", while former vocalist Tate solely has the right to play Operation: Mindcrime and Operation: Mindcrime II in their entirety \\"in unique performances\\".

He started making wine at age 14, explaining: \\"I was a boy scout and you could get a merit badge if you created a beverage or a food product and I made dandelion wine, which wasn't very good but definitely sparked my interest and got me started on that passion.\\" The passion for wine further developed when Tate was in Queensr√øche: \\"I have been collecting wine seriously since the band first got signed back in 1983 and we were touring the world. I‚Äôd make special arrangements to leave at certain point of the tour and take off and head into the wine regions. I started to become even more interested in how it was made and how grapes were grown and which grapes grew best where and that type of thing.\\" Tate has given several interviews to the magazine Wine Spectator. In 2010, Geoff and Susan Tate launched their own brand of wine, \\"Insania\\". Controversy Since 2012, Geoff Tate has attracted some controversy, mostly in part to the circumstances surrounding the split with Queensr√øche (when his bandmates, guitarist Michael Wilton, bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield fired him from the band and replaced him with then-Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre). Tate attracted negative attention for spitting on and physically assaulting Wilton and Rockenfield before and during a show in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, on 14 April 2012. Then, during a later show the Rocklahoma Festival on 26 May, Tate commented to an unresponsive crowd \\"You guys suck,\\" which his bandmates, as well as some fans, felt was an insult, but Tate would later defend his actions by stating in a court declaration \\"I was not insulting the audience. I was trying to motivate or excite them.\\" He finds that this was used against him in the lawsuit: \\"It‚Äôs just something that the other guys [in the band] and their team of people are trying to twist into a 'Geoff doesn't respect the fans' type of thing.\\" He elaborated on that in an interview, saying: \\"I say that stuff all the time, you know. It's part of being a front man, you know. You got to motivate the audience, you know. And I say things to get people motivated. I think... I say things to push people's buttons to get them to react. It's part of a performance. But if you're in a lawsuit, of course, these things get taken out of context and put into a new format. I guess the objective is to make me look like I don't care about the fans. Which is unfortunate.\\" During the \\"Operation: Mindcrime Anniversary Tour\\", ten minutes into a show in St. Charles, Illinois on 17 May 2013, Tate grabbed an audience member's smartphone, turned around, and threw it over his shoulder into the crowd. On the subject, Tate commented: \\"Some actions that I have become very normal with as a performer are getting scrutinized and manipulated to paint a picture of me [to make me look like a bad guy].\\" He accused the uploader of the video showing this footage to have manipulated the footage to make it appear as though he threw it, as he insists that he accidentally dropped it while trying to take pictures of the fan and of himself. Tate has commented on these controversies in relation to the Queensr√øche lawsuits, saying: \\"I guess that's the nature of being in a lawsuit. Now you have to watch what you say, and trust that who you are talking to does the right thing, you know, and push the information out in the way that it happened. And not try to construct something different, you know?\\" Personal life Tate's first wife was named Sandy. Tate was married to Sue (Suzanne) from 1990 until 1996. She inspired the lyrics to \\"Jet City Woman.\\"http://ink19.com/issues/january2002/eventReviews/queensrChe.html In 1996, he married his current wife, Susan. She and Geoff used to be vegans. Tate has three daughters: Sabra, Bella, and Emily, along with one stepdaughter, Miranda. Tate was never married to Sabra's mother. In 2011, Miranda gave Geoff his first grandchild, giving birth to Riot Danger. Tate is known for involving family members with his musical endeavors. His wife Susan worked for Queensr√øche's fan club since 1997, served as the band's assistant manager since 2001, and was band manager from 2005 to 2012. She is also the manager for Tate's solo career. Stepdaughter Miranda has also run Queensr√øche's fanclub. Guitarist Parker Lundgren joined the band of Tate's solo project in the summer of 2008, while dating Miranda. In February 2009 he joined Queensr√øche, and on 18 July married Miranda, but they divorced about half a year later. Late 2009 and early 2010, Miranda was a go-go dancer with the Queensr√øche Cabaret. Daughter Emily sang a duet with her father on the song \\"Home Again\\" on the 2009 Queensr√øche album American Soldier and the ensuing tour, at age 12. In 2013, Miranda and Emily sang backing vocals on a re-recording of \\"Silent Lucidity\\" for the album Frequency Unknown. Tate has an interest in acting and enjoys motorcycling and sailing. Tate is also a libertarian and socialist.

Diego Laynez, S.J. Diego Laynez, S.J. (sometimes spelled La√≠nez) (Spanish: Diego Laynez), born in 1512 (Almaz√°n, Spain) and died on 19 January 1565 (Rome), was a Spanish Jesuit priest and theologian of Jewish descent, and the second Superior General of the Society of Jesus. Early life Diego Laynez was born in Almaz√°n in Castile. He graduated from the University of Alcal√°, and then continued his studies in Paris, where he came under the influence of Ignatius of Loyola. He was one of the seven men who,Michael Servetus Research Website that includes graphical documents in the University of Paris of: Ignations of Loyola, Francis Xavier, Alfonso Salmer√≥n, Nicholas Bobadilla, Peter Faber and Simao Rodrigues, as well as Michael de Villanueva (\\"Servetus\\") with Ignatius, formed the original group of Friends in the Lord, later Society of Jesus, taking, in the Montmartre church, the vows of personal poverty and chastity in the footsteps of Christ, and committing themselves to going to Jerusalem. Because of unfavourable circumstances (no ship going to Holy Land) the pilgrimage to Jerusalem fell through, and Laynez with Ignatius of Loyola and the other Friends in the Lord (by then they were ten) offered their services to the Pope. After the Order had been definitely established (1540) Laynez, among other missions visited Germany. Laynez was a papal theologian during each of the three periods of the Council of Trent. At one point he was also professor of scholastic theology at La Sapienza. Involvement with the Council of Trent =First Period= Pope Paul III sent Laynez to Trent to act as the Pope's theologian at the Ecumenical Council. Laynez arrived at Trent on May 18, 1546, five months after the Council opened, with Alfonso Salmeron. Before long, Laynez was recognized as exceptional ‚Äì one of the first practical consequences was that he was allowed to preach in Trent when not on Council business, whereas the general rule forbade preaching by conciliar theologians. Another exception was the three-hour time limit accorded to Laynez in the council debates, while the standard allotment was an hour. Laynez's famous speech on imputed and inherent justification (Seripando's ‚Äúdouble justice‚Äù theory) on October 26, 1546 was subsequently written out and incorporated into the Acta of the Council under the title Disputatio de justitia imputata. By the time Laynez spoke, 37 theologians had spoken on the issue, and 28 had rejected duplex justitia. In his three-hour-long speech, which was widely regarded as the most thorough on the topic, Laynez gave 12 reasons that the proposed ‚Äúdouble justice‚Äù must be rejected by the Church, including its relatively recent origin and its implied denial of merit. His arguments were consistent with Council's January 13, 1547 Decree on Justification, which taught in Chapter 16, ‚Äúwe must believe that nothing further is wanting to those justified to prevent them from being considered to have, by those very works which have been done in God, fully satisfied the divine law according to the state of this life and to have truly merited eternal life.‚Äù Laynez did not participate directly in the several months of discussions between his speech and the issuing of the Decree because immediately after his speech on justification, Cardinal Del Monte assigned him ‚Äì along with Salmeron ‚Äì to prepare a list of Protestant errors regarding the sacraments, as well as a summary of the relevant Church documents and patristic writings on sacraments. The first part of this research was presented to the Council on January 17, 1547 by Cardinal Cervini under the headings of ‚Äúsacraments in general,‚Äù ‚Äúbaptism‚Äù and ‚Äúconfirmation.‚Äù This research set the terms of debate, which was somewhat less contentious than that concerning justification. The seventh session of the Council promulgated its canons on sacraments in general, baptism and confirmation on March 3, 1547. Laynez moved with the Council to Bologna after the seventh session, where he continued his preparatory work on the sacraments of the Eucharist and penance. He grew frustrated with the slow pace of the work done in Bologna, and left in June 1547. He spent the time between the first and second period of the Council contributing to the reform of prostitutes, convents and dioceses, preaching in Florence, Venice and then in Sicily. From there, he accompanied John de Vaga's fleet on a successful raid of Tripoli, which had been a base for Muslim pirates and was still in Africa on October 5, 1550 when he was called to Rome. =Second Period= By November 22, 1550, Laynez arrived in Rome to prepare for the second period of the Council of Trent, which eventually opened on May 1, 1551. He attended to a number of projects on his way from Rome to Trent, finally arriving on July 27, almost three months after the opening, but in plenty of time to contribute, on September 8, his arguments on the Eucharist leading up to the important 13th session, October 11, at which the Decree on the Sacrament of the Eucharist was promulgated. Immediately after his speech, he began the preliminary work for the Council's consideration of penance and extreme unction, which he, with Salmeron, presented on October 20. Laynez often fell ill during this period, but after a period of convalescence he was able to speak on December 7 for three hours on the Mass as sacrifice. The Council was suspended for the second time in April 1552, and Laynez went to Bassano to recover his health and then to Padua. Before leaving Trent, however, he met with Melchior Cano, the influential Spanish Dominican, who was embarrassed by his countryman's threadbare cassock and was suspicious of the new religious order. The meeting did not go at all well. When Ignatius of Loyola died in 1556 Diego Laynez acted as Vicar General of the Society. Because of an internal crisis and difficult relations with Pope Paul IV, the Society's General Congregation was delayed by two years. When it was finally convened and opened on July 2, 1558, Laynez was elected at the first ballot and became the second Superior-General of the Society of Jesus. =Third Period= In 1560 Diego Laynez, now the Jesuit General, was instrumental in arguing that the Council should continue to its close, against Ferdinand I who wished to see a new Council opened and the prior decrees of the Council of Trent forgotten. Pius IV subsequently ordered the Council to meet again in the carefully worded Ad ecclesiae regimen of November 29, 1560; the Council was eventually opened on January 18, 1562. Upon Laynez's arrival at Trent in August 1562, he defended the practice of distributing Communion under only one species. Among Laynez's other speeches during the third period of the Council are (1) against the Gallican theory that general councils are superior to the Pope, against bishops who wanted to extend episcopal authority at the expense of that of the Pope, in which he argued that the power of the bishop was received through the mediation of the pope and not directly from God (October 20, 1562), and (2) a speech in which he committed a rare theological error ‚Äì he doubted the ability of the Church to invalidate clandestine marriages (August 23, 1563), a position rejected by the 24th Session of the Council in Chapter 1 of its Decree on the Reformation of Marriage. On the death of Pope Paul IV, many cardinals wished to elect Laynez pope, but he fled from them in order to avoid this fate.

The latter use is generally applied to prevent dust or other particles entering the beaker; the watch glass does not completely seal the beaker, so gas exchanges still occur. When used as an evaporation surface, a watch glass allows closer observation of precipitates or crystallization, and can be placed on a surface of contrasting color to improve the visibility overall. Watch glasses are also sometimes used to cover a glass of whisky, to concentrate the aromas in the glass, and to prevent spills when the whisky is swirled. Watch glasses are named so because they are similar to the glass used for the front of old-fashioned pocket watches. In reference to this, large watch glasses are occasionally known as clock glasses.  Uses  Crystal solids on a watch glass with folded paper above Drying crystal solids using a watch glass and passing a stream of dry air from an inverted funnel One of the generic uses of a watch glass as mentioned previously includes as a lid for beakers. In this case a watch glass is placed above the container, which makes it easier to control and alter vapour saturation conditions. Moreover, a watch glass is often used to house solids being weighed on the scale. Prior to weighing desired amount of solid, a watch glass is placed on the scale, followed by taring or zeroing the scale so that only the weight of the sample substance is obtained. Not only can a watch glass be used for observing precipitation patterns and crystals, it can also be used for drying solids. When further drying is required, a watch glass is often used in cases where a particular type of solid needs to be separated from its comparatively volatile solvent. The solid is spread on a watch glass and, often time, a folded filter paper is placed above to keep out airborne particles from contaminating the product. To maximize the drying rate, a watch glass can be placed inside a fume hood to provide good air circulation for an adequate amount of time. Another technique used in chemistry laboratories to increase the drying rate is passing a gentle stream of dry air or nitrogen gas over the watch glass from an inverted funnel clamped above it.

Comparisons to \\"Norwegian Wood\\" \\"4th Time Around\\" was commonly speculated to be a response to the Beatles' song \\"Norwegian Wood\\" ‚Äì written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney for the 1965 album Rubber Soul ‚Äì as the two tracks share a reasonably similar melody, lyrical premise, and 3/4 time signature. \\"4th Time Around\\" has been seen as either a playful homage, or a satirical warning to Lennon about co-opting Dylan's well-known songwriting devices. Lennon expressed a range of opinions on this topic in interviews between 1970 and 1980. He initially felt it to be a somewhat pointed parody of \\"Norwegian Wood\\", but later he considered Dylan's effort to be more a playful homage. Still, the last line of \\"4th Time Around\\" (\\"I never asked for your crutch / Now don't ask for mine.\\") played into Lennon's apparent paranoia about Dylan in 1966‚Äì67, when he interpreted this line as a warning not to use Dylan's songs as a \\"crutch\\" for Lennon's songwriting.

Career Izm√©ry, who was of Palestinian descent, was among the wealthiest people in Haiti. He was one of the most prominent backers of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and helped finance his election campaign. On the eve of the 1990 elections (which Aristide eventually won), Izm√©ry accused former President of the United States Jimmy Carter of attempting to ensure the victory of Aristide's rival, Marc Bazin. He reportedly caused some consternation in the American camp when he told former US Secretary of State Robert S. McNamara, who was also in attendance, \\"that [McNamara] would have to take charge of the bloodbath\\" if Bazin came to power through a rigged election. When Aristide, having been elected President, was toppled and forced into exile by the 1991 Haitian coup d'√©tat on September 30, 1991, Izm√©ry founded the KOMEVEB (Komite Mete men pou Verite Blayi) organisation, which attempted to discover and publicise the events surrounding the coup and see the return of democratic government. In 1992, Izm√©ry's brother, Georges, was assassinated by a paramilitary death squad associated with the new regime. Antoine Izm√©ry subsequently lodged a complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights over the death, which sparked a sharply critical resolution from the commission. Murder On September 11, 1993, Antoine Izm√©ry attended a mass that had been organised by KOMEVEB to commemorate the 1988 St Jean Bosco massacre, where numerous people had been killed in an attempt on Aristide's life, when he had been a parish priest. Few journalists or human rights advocates dared attend, as there was a strong chance at the time that such a gathering would be attacked by paramilitaries. Izm√©ry told Michael Norton of the Associated Press that he had been warned by the police that there would be bloodshed if the event went ahead. At around 6:00 am, the church was surrounded by armed men in civilian clothing. Numerous journalists were beaten and detained, and placed under the charge of Jackson Joanis, who headed the Port-au-Prince police's feared \\"Anti-Gang Unit\\". While this was ongoing, a group of 10 men forced Izm√©ry outside, and made him kneel before shooting him dead with a single bullet to the head. =Trial= In September 1995, after Aristide had been returned to power, fourteen people, including former paramilitary leader Louis-Jodel Chamblain, and police officers Jackson Joanis and Michel Fran√ßois, were convicted in absentia and sentenced to forced labour for life over Izm√©ry's death. Chamblain soon fled into exile in the Dominican Republic, and Joanis to the United States. Joanis was subsequently deported back to Haiti in 2002, but escaped during the 2004 Haiti rebellion that preceded Aristide's second fall from power. In early 2004, both Chamblain and Joanis turned themselves in to the new regime, which they were both supporters of, and on August 17, 2004, they were both retried. In a trial lasting only one night, the pair were acquitted. Only one witness testified for the prosecution, and the conduct of the trial came in for sharp international criticism from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and Amnesty International. Amnesty International claimed that key witnesses remained in hiding for fear of their lives, that evidence against the men from the first trial had disappeared, and that no attempt had been made to arrest the other twelve men from the original trial. Izmery is survived by five children, three girls and two boys. =Film= ‚Ä¢ Rezistans ‚Äì a documentary about Antoine Izm√©ry and the resistance against the 1991 coup d‚Äô etat ‚Äì 1997, in English, 158 min, by Katherine Kean External links *National Human Rights Defense Network : Press release on murder trial *Amnesty International Library : Ha√Øti : Perpetrators of past abuses threaten human rights and the reestablishment of the rule of law. *GreenTit Blog : Ha√Øti's brutal history largely of our making *IJDH : Ha√Øti Assassination Trial An Affront to All Those Who Have Worked and Died for Justice References 1993 deaths Deaths by firearm in Haiti Year of birth missing Assassinated Haitian people Haitian people of Palestinian descent People murdered in Haiti ","title":"Antoine Izm√©ry"},{"id":"1388400","text":"Astros (Greek: ŒÜœÉœÑœÅŒøœÇ or ŒúŒµœÉœåŒ≥ŒµŒπŒø ŒÜœÉœÑœÅŒøœÇ, \\"Inland Astros\\") is a town near the Argolic Gulf in the northeast Peloponnese in eastern Arcadia.

It premiered in London in 1998 at the National Theatre, running for more than 300 performances, starring David Burke (Niels Bohr), Sara Kestelman (Margrethe Bohr), and Matthew Marsh (Werner Heisenberg). It opened on Broadway at the Royale Theatre on 11 April 2000 and ran for 326 performances. Directed by Michael Blakemore, it starred Philip Bosco (Niels Bohr), Michael Cumpsty (Werner Heisenberg), and Blair Brown (Margrethe Bohr). It won the Tony Award for Best Play, Best Featured Actress in a Play, Blair Brown, and Best Direction of a Play (Michael Blakemore). In 2002, the play was adapted as a film by Howard Davies, produced by the BBC and presented on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the United States. Summary The spirits of Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr and Bohr's wife Margrethe, meet after their deaths to attempt to answer the question that Margrethe poses in the first line of the play, \\"Why did he [Heisenberg] come to Copenhagen?\\" They spend the remainder of the two-act drama reliving the experience and presenting, debating and rejecting theories that may answer that question. Heisenberg ‚Äì \\"No one understands my trip to Copenhagen. Time and time again I‚Äôve explained it. To Bohr himself, and Margrethe. To interrogators and intelligence officers, to journalists and historians. The more I've explained, the deeper the uncertainty has become. Well, I shall be happy to make one more attempt.\\" Along the way, Heisenberg and Bohr \\"draft\\" several versions of their 1941 exchange, arguing about the ramifications of each potential version of their meeting and the motives behind it. They discuss the idea of nuclear power and its control, the rationale behind building or not building an atomic bomb, the uncertainty of the past and the inevitability of the future as embodiments of themselves acting as particles drifting through the atom that is Copenhagen. Characters In most dramas in which the characters are based on real people, there is a point at which the character deviates from the real person. Michael Frayn works to keep that distinction as small as possible. Having studied memoirs and letters and other historical records of the two physicists, Frayn feels confident in claiming that \\"The actual words spoken by [the] characters are entirely their own.\\" With that in mind, the character descriptions apply to both the representative characters as well as the physicists themselves. There is a great amount known about all of the primary characters presented in Copenhagen; the following includes those bits of information which are directly relevant and referenced in the work itself.Much of the above is based on Biographies of Persons in Copenhagen, compiled by Harry Lustig *Werner Heisenberg was born in 1901 in W√ºrzburg, Germany. The son of a university professor, Heisenberg grew up in an environment with an intense emphasis on academics, but was exposed to the destruction that World War I dealt to Germany at a rather young age. He married Elisabeth Schumacher, also the child of a professor, and they had seven children. He received his doctorate in 1923 from the physicist Arnold Sommerfeld, and went to Copenhagen to study quantum mechanics with Niels Bohr in 1924, when he was 22, and replaced Bohr's assistant, H. A. Kramers. In 1926, The University of Leipzig offered him the opportunity to become Germany's youngest full professor. Heisenberg is best known for his \\"Uncertainty Principle,\\" (translated from the German Ungenauigkeit [inexactness] or Unsch√§rfe [lack of sharpness] Relation, which was later changed to Unbestimmtheit meaning \\"indeterminate.\\") In 1927, he and Bohr presented the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. During the Second World War, Heisenberg worked for Germany, researching atomic technology and heading their nuclear reactor program. After the war, his involvement with the Nazis earned him certain notoriety in the world of physicists, mainly due to the fact that he could have given Hitler the means to produce and use nuclear arms. He continued his research until his death in 1976 in Munich. *Niels Bohr was born in 1885, making him 38 when Heisenberg first came to work with him. He married Margrethe Norlund in 1912 in Copenhagen and together they had six sons, two of whom died. Biographer Harry Lustig notes that \\"Most of the world's great theoretical physicists... spent periods of their lives at Bohr's Institute.\\" Before the war, his research was instrumental in nuclear research, some of which led to the building of the bomb. During the war, however, Bohr was living in occupied Denmark and somewhat restricted in his research; he escaped to Sweden in 1943, just before an SS sweep which would have incriminated him through his Jewish heritage. In America, he worked in Los Alamos on the atomic bomb until the end of the war. He died in 1962 and was survived by his wife, Margrethe. *Margrethe Bohr, known later in her life as Dronning or \\"Queen\\" Margrethe, was born in 1890 in Denmark. She was closely involved in her husband's work; he would commonly bounce ideas off of her, trying to explain them in \\"plain language.\\" She died in 1984, survived by several of her children. Her son Hans wrote, \\"My mother was the natural and indispensable centre. Father knew how much mother meant to him and never missed an opportunity to show his gratitude and love.... Her opinions were his guidelines in daily affairs,\\" and that relationship shows in Michael Frayn's dialogue. Style The construction of the plot is non- linear, seeing as it does not exist in time and space. Sometimes one character will not notice that there are other people in the space, and speak as if to no one. The world that Frayn presents is outside of our conceptions as audience members, simply by virtue of the fact that no one attending the play has ever died. So the world in which Copenhagen is based is somewhere between heaven and an atom. It can also be thought to exist \\"inside the heads\\" of the characters present. It is a subjective world, taking and manipulating history, picking apart some events and mashing others together to better compare them. The characters are all plagued by some form of guilt or another, particularly in reference to the atomic bomb, and they are trapped in this world, doomed to forever speculate on that evening in Copenhagen in 1941 to determine how the world might have been changed. These are all traits of the artistic style known as Expressionism. In his preface to A Dream Play, August Strindberg notes that in these worlds, \\"everything is possible and probable. Time and space do not exist. Working with... real events as a background, the imagination spins out its threads of thoughts and weaves them into new patterns.\\" Copenhagen is an embodiment of these principles. Recurring images and motifs Because the concepts in physics and politics are at times very complicated or very abstract, Frayn uses several controlling images to better relate certain ideas to his audience. ‚Ä¢ Skiing and Table-Tennis ‚Äì These two activities are referred to as a pastime of Bohr and Heisenberg's, and both demonstrate the competition between the two (representative of national competition.) They are also used to suggest Heisenberg's speed and recklessness which contrasts with Bohr's caution and tediousness. ‚Ä¢ Invisible Straight ‚Äì An anecdote in which Bohr managed to bluff himself in a game of poker by betting on a straight that he thought he had, but he really did not. That principle is applied to nuclear weaponry, suggesting that nations will act differently when they think that an opponent can produce nuclear arms, whether or not the opponent can. ‚Ä¢ Cap-Pistols, Land Mines and Nuclear Reactors ‚Äì These fall into the Toy vs. Weapon theme and once again presents anecdotes of Bohr and Heisenberg's lives. Their fascination in playing with the new toy blinds them to the danger that it poses. ‚Ä¢ Bomb ‚Äì The term \\"bomb\\" appears as a literal looming image in many cases, but it is used figuratively in a couple of instances, as if it should be a joke, but with such grave implications that it cannot be found funny. (For example, Heisenberg refers to a \\"bomb having gone off\\" in Bohr's head.) ‚Ä¢ Christian Reaching for the Life- Buoy ‚Äì Christian was one of Bohr's sons, who tragically drowned while he and Bohr were out sailing. The phrase \\"Christian reaches for the life-buoy\\" appears several times during the play, and every time, the characters seem to hold their breath in the hope that this time, Christian will survive. Bohr had concluded that they would have both drowned had he jumped in to save his son, which presents an idea of futile heroics, particularly with reference to Heisenberg and what should happen if he were to resist Hitler's rule. ‚Ä¢ \\"Another Draft\\" ‚Äì Whenever the characters conclude that an interpretation of their 1941 meeting is incorrect, they call for \\"another draft.\\" Language Though the dialogue does not contradict logic, it cannot be called realistic in the strictest sense. One character's line might fade into the next as though the second person knew exactly what he was going to say; sometimes a character will slip into a memory and partially relive a former or younger self in a monologue; and over the course of the show, there is a definite ambiguity as to whether they are speaking to one another or to the audience. The play was originally written in English, but the real people in the exchange may have had the conversation in Danish or German, but even with translation in mind, Frayn defends that the words in the script are those that the characters would actually say. In his post-script, he writes, \\"If this needs any justification, I can only appeal to Heisenberg himself.\\" Understandably, Frayn needs to present the characters in an interesting and dramatic light, as well as depicting a setting that no living person has visited, so the accuracy of such dialogue is subject to dwindle by degrees. Plain language and scientific language both operate in the play. There are several instances when the two physicists start speaking too scientifically for many people to understand, and one of them will remark that they must revert to plain language, to explain it in a way that Margrethe will understand. Even for that effort, criticism arose about the complexity of the play and the difficulty for viewers to comprehend. A writer for The Commonweal commented on the Broadway premiere, saying that \\"the play's relentless cerebral forays can... be frustrating.\\" Production history London Premiere ‚Äì 1998 Copenhagen opened in the National Theatre in London and ran for more than 300 performances, starring David Burke as Niels Bohr, Sara Kestelman as Margrethe Bohr, and Matthew Marsh as Werner Heisenberg. It was directed by Michael Blakemore. \\"Copenhagen\\" transferred to the Duchess Theatre in London's West End, where it ran from 8 February 1999, for more than 750 performances. It had a \\"second\\" cast when it opened in the West End, who were responsible for performing at least one of the matinee shows each week. The second cast consisted of David Baron as Niels Bohr, Corinna Marlowe as Margarethe Bohr, and William Brand as Werner Heisenberg, and after six months, they replaced the original cast for the rest of the West End run. Broadway Opening ‚Äì April 2000 Continuing under the direction of Michael Blakemore, it opened on Broadway at the Royale Theatre on 11 April and ran for 326 performances. Starring Philip Bosco as Bohr, Michael Cumpsty as Heisenberg and Blair Brown as Margrethe, it went on to win the Tony Award for Best Play, along with two others for Best Featured Actress in a Play (Blair Brown), and Best Direction of a Play (Michael Blakemore). But even for its success, Frayn admitted in an article that \\"A number of commentators expressed misgivings about the whole enterprise.\\" Several critics noted that it was heavy with scientific dialogue, a little too heavy for the common audience. Though a writer from Physics World hailed it as \\"brilliant theatre ,\\" a Charles Spencer, of the Daily Telegraph, wrote, \\"I felt that my brain was being stretched to breaking point‚Äîwell beyond breaking point, in fact.\\" International Productions 1999 - France * At the Th√©√¢tre Montparnasse (Paris).

TV Movie ‚Äì 2002 The play was adapted as a television movie in 2002, with Daniel Craig as Heisenberg, Stephen Rea as Niels Bohr, and Francesca Annis as Margrethe Bohr. The movie substantially cuts down the script of the play, eliminating several recurring themes, and most of the material that established the community of scientists in Copenhagen. It also abandons the abstract staging of the theatrical version in favour of being set in the city of Copenhagen, in Bohr's old house.

Heisenberg had worked with Bohr in Copenhagen for several years starting in 1924. Heisenberg historians remain divided over their own interpretations of the event. Frayn's 1998 play brought more attention to what previously had been a primarily scholarly discussion. A collection of historical essays provoked by the play was published in English in 2005. Much of the initial controversy stemmed from a 1956 letter Heisenberg sent to the journalist Robert Jungk after reading the German edition of Jungk's book, Brighter than a Thousand Suns (1956). In the letter, Heisenberg described how he had come to Copenhagen to discuss with Bohr his moral objections toward scientists working on nuclear weapons but how he had failed to say that clearly before the conversation came to a halt. Jungk published an extract from the letter in the Danish edition of the book in 1956 that, out of context, made it look as if Heisenberg was claiming to have sabotaged the German bomb project on moral grounds. (The letter's whole text shows Heisenberg was careful not to claim that.) Bohr was outraged after reading the extract in his copy of the book, feeling that it was false and that the 1941 meeting had proven to him that Heisenberg was quite happy to produce nuclear weapons for Germany. After the play inspired numerous scholarly and media debates over the 1941 meeting, the Niels Bohr Archive* in Copenhagen released to the public all sealed documents related to the meeting, a move intended mostly to settle historical arguments over what they contained. Among the documents were the unsent letters Bohr drafted to Heisenberg in 1957 about Jungk's book and other topics. These drafts proved to be significant in several respects. First, they proved to be relatively consistent with Heisenberg's recollections of the meeting given to Jungk in 1956, meaning that the course of the conversation can now be fairly well established. Bohr and Heisenberg agree that Heisenberg started the visit by stating to Bohr that nuclear weapons were now conceivable. As Heisenberg wrote to Jungk, > This talk probably started with my question as to whether or not it was > right for physicists to devote themselves in wartime to the uranium problem > ‚Äì as there was the possibility that progress in this sphere could lead to > grave consequences in the technique of the war. Bohr confirms that by writing, > It had to make a very strong impression on me that at the very outset you > stated that you felt certain that the war, if it lasted sufficiently long, > would be decided with atomic weapons. Heisenberg repeated his convictions on the technical feasibility of building nuclear weapons. As Heisenberg recalled: > He [Bohr] replied as far as I can remember with a counter-question, \\"Do you > really think that uranium fission could be utilized for the construction of > weapons?\\" I may have replied: \\"I know that this is in principle possible, > but it would require a terrific technical effort, which, one can only hope, > cannot be realized in this war.\\" Bohr was shocked by my reply. Bohr's draft letters are consistent with this: > I did not respond to this at all, but as you perhaps regarded this as an > expression of doubt, you related how in the preceding years you had devoted > yourself almost exclusively to the question and were quite certain that it > could be done... That point is of interest because it is at odds with the suggestion by critics that miscalculations by Heisenberg had led him to conclude erroneously that atomic weapons were not feasible.Rose, Paul Lawrence Heisenberg and the Nazi atomic bomb project: a study in German culture (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998)Heisenberg in Copenhagen , Paul Lawrence Rose, reply by Thomas Powers, 19 October 2000, The New York Review of Books According to Bohr's later notes, Heisenberg then told Bohr that he had not come to discuss the technical aspects of the potential weapons: > Heisenberg said explicitly that he did not wish to enter into technical > details but that Bohr should understand that he knew what he was talking > about as he had spent 2 years working exclusively on this question. Unfortunately, because of Heisenberg's concerns about being monitored, his discussion of any details of Germany's nuclear efforts with someone in an occupied country would have been illegal, his remarks were cryptic. Indeed, Bohr's letters note that Heisenberg spoke \\"in vague terms\\", from which Bohr was able to form only an \\"impression\\" about Heisenberg's efforts. Bohr wrote: > I listened to this without speaking since [a] great matter for mankind was > at issue in which, despite our personal friendship, we had to be regarded as > representatives of two sides engaged in mortal combat. That my silence and > gravity, as you write in the letter, could be taken as an expression of > shock at your reports that it was possible to make an atomic bomb is a quite > peculiar misunderstanding, which must be due to the great tension in your > own mind. From the day three years earlier when I realized that slow > neutrons could only cause fission in Uranium 235 and not 238, it was of > course obvious to me that a bomb with certain effect could be produced by > separating the uraniums. In June 1939 I had even given a public lecture in > Birmingham about uranium fission, where I talked about the effects of such a > bomb but of course added that the technical preparations would be so large > that one did not know how soon they could be overcome. If anything in my > behaviour could be interpreted as shock, it did not derive from such reports > but rather from the news, as I had to understand it, that Germany was > participating vigorously in a race to be the first with atomic weapons. That circumspect discussion, combined with Bohr's shocked reaction to it, apparently cut off the discussion between them. Thus, the Bohr letters cannot resolve the question, posed by the Copenhagen play, of what Heisenberg had tried to convey to Bohr. Heisenberg's comment that he knew about the potential for weaponizing uranium fission, appears to counter the arguments of critics such as Rosehttp://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2000/oct/19/heisenberg- in-copenhagen/ and BernsteinJ. Bernstein, \\"Heisenberg and the Critical Mass,\\" Am. J. Phys. 70, 911 (2002) that calculation errors in 1940 about feasibility, rather than moral scruples, led Heisenberg not to pursue building nuclear weapons. Finally, the 1957 Bohr draft letters, written 16 years after the meeting, suggest a conflict between Bohr and Heisenberg. Heisenberg's letter to his wife, written on the eve of his departure from Copenhagen, provides no hint of a fracture. In it, he related his final evening with Bohr as very pleasant and unremarkable: \\"Today I was once more, with Weizs√§cker, at Bohr's. In many ways this was especially nice, the conversation revolved for a large part of the evening around purely human concerns, Bohr was reading aloud, I played a Mozart Sonata (a-Major).\\" In a March 2006 interview Ivan Supek, one of Heisenberg's students and friends, commented that \\"Copenhagen is a bad play\\" and that \\"Frayn mixed up some things\\". Supek also claimed that Weizs√§cker was the main figure of the meeting. Allegedly, \\"Heisenberg and Weizs√§cker came to Bohr wearing German army uniforms. Weizs√§cker tried to persuade Bohr to mediate for peace between Great Britain and Germany and Heisenberg practically completely relied on his political judgement\\". Supek received these details in a confidential conversation with Margrethe, who thought he would never make them public. Supek however felt it was \\"his duty to announce these facts so that future generations can know the truth about the Bohr ‚Äì Heisenberg meeting\\". Supek's statements about Bohr's recollection of \\"the Bohr ‚Äì Heisenberg meeting\\" mixes up the visit. Because Heisenberg could only visit Bohr in occupied Denmark on behalf of the German government, Heisenberg was obliged to make public lectures on behalf of the Government which were monitored by German government officials. Heisenberg tried to convey his opinions later during private discussions with Bohr. Heisenberg's letters to his wife and later to Jungk place his conversation with Bohr on Wednesday evening. Either he talked with Bohr on a walk, or at his residence. Bohr, Supek, and Heisenberg describe the meeting differently Physicists referenced Over the course of the play, a number of renowned physicists are mentioned.

History J.V. \\"Pinky\\" Wilson, one of many Aggies who fought in World War I, is attributed as the primary author of the song. Wilson combined several Aggie yells into a song called \\"Good-bye to Texas University.\\" He wrote the lyrics in 1918 on the back of a letter from home while holed up in a trench during a battle in France. He later put the words to music after Armistice was signed and before he returned to the United States. Upon returning to Texas A&M; in 1919, the song was frequently performed by a quartet that Wilson organized, called the \\"Cast-Iron Quartet.\\" According to Aggie tradition, on one night in 1920, several of the Aggie Yell Leaders heard Wilson's quartet singing the song at a Bryan, TX theater during the intermission of a movie. The Yell Leaders were so impressed by the tune, they waited until after the regular show to meet him. During the meeting, they asked him to let them submit his work (the War Hymn) into a contest for a new fight song held in the fall. Wilson and his quartet quickly agreed to perform the Aggie War Hymn in the contest. They honed their skills for the contest over the summer where they met after working cattle in the evenings. While unofficial ceremonies were held before games during this time, they were still not University sanctioned activities. The contest for the fight song occurred during one of these unofficial midnight yells. It was held outside Sbisa Hall after the evening meal . It became such a success that the song was officially adopted that fall under its current title. A group of Aggie soldiers in Camp Victory, Iraq doing the \\"Saw Varsity's Horns Off\\" portion of the war hymn The song is noted for beginning with Recall, an old bugle call, in the two different keys of the bugles in use by the US Army during World War I. It starts with the M1892 Field Trumpet in G, which is the \\"bugle\\" still in use today, and ends with the M1894 Field Trumpet in B-flat (aka, the \\"Trench Bugle\\"). This is a nod to Texas A&M;'s past as a military school. Indeed, for many years, the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band's halftime show has begun with the drum major shouting \\"Recall! Step off on 'Hullabaloo!'\\" The starting phrase of the song, \\"Hullabaloo, Caneck! Caneck!\\" is widely thought to originate from an Old Army Aggie yell written in 1907, Texas A&M; University president Jack K. Williams jokingly defined the phrase as Chickasaw Indian for \\"Beat the hell out of the University of Texas\\". The original song is actually the second verse of the hymn; in 1938, Wilson wrote another verse at the request of several Aggie students who thought the original was too focused on the Aggies' rivalry with the University of Texas. The additional lyrics comprise what is now the first verse of the song. However, the first verse has never caught on, in part because many felt it sounded too much like an Ivy League song. Thus, in practice, the second (original) verse is usually sung twice. The second verse opens with \\"Goodbye to texas university\\"; these words were chosen since Aggies refer to their principal athletic rival, Texas, as \\"texas university\\", or \\"t.u.\\", rather than \\"U.T.\\". Also, in practice, the phrase \\"sounds like hell\\" is inserted after the line \\"that is the song they sing so well\\"; however, the phrase is not officially part of the song. After the second verse is sung twice, Aggie fans link their arms and legs, and sway left and right to replicate the motion of a saw blade; this is called \\"sawing Varsity's horns off\\" (before the Texas football team adopting the Longhorn as the official mascot, the team was simply known as \\"Varsity\\"). For years, when this happened during football games at Kyle Field, this caused the entire west upper deck, including the press box, to sway. This often unnerved sportswriters who hadn't covered an Aggie game before, even though a sign in the press box warned that \\"the press box will move during the Aggie War Hymn.\\" Renovations after the 2014 season lessened the swaying effect somewhat. The song concludes with the chorus of \\"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight\\". In 1997, the song was rated as the No. 1 college fight song by USA Today. It was also used by NASA Flight Director Gerry Griffin to wake up astronauts in space from 1983 to 1995. The song was also used as a wakeup call on Day 11 of space mission STS-121 for Texas A&M; former student and mission specialist Mike Fossum. During a ceremony on Kyle Field to honor the 100th anniversary of the writing of the hymn, family members of Pinky Wilson were honored at the 50-yard line in front of the combined band.https://www.theeagle.com/news/local/family-of- the-aggie-war-hymn-author-james-pinky- wilson/article_4679b9d8-b137-5863-b609-c2bc682f00d1.amp.html References External links Video (Texas A&M; Official Video) *Sound file (from Association of Former Students web site) *description in Kingman Daily Miner *ESPN column on the wording War hymn War hymn American college songs Southeastern Conference fight songs Songs about Texas ","title":"Aggie War Hymn"},{"id":"1388432","text":"Sven B√∏mw√∏llen is the first instalment of a series of humorous German computer games released in the 2000s, all concerning the sexual behaviour of the titular character, a black sheep named Sven B√∏mw√∏llen, 'Baumwolle' is the German word for cotton. The game =Objective= The game is set in Northern Europe, presumably in a country where a North Germanic language is spoken. The player controls Sven, the only black sheep, and, at the same time, apparently the only male sheep of a flock owned by a shepherd called Lars Einnicken. It is Sven's task to mate with the white sheep, which will disappear after reaching a state of happiness resulting in points being awarded to the player. To clear a level, Sven must make all the white sheep disappear. As in many computer games, there are various enemies whom Sven has to avoid and various extras he can pick up to gain special powers. Sven can always avoid enemies by jumping into a river, lake or puddle, which will not cost a life, but results in him reappearing elsewhere on the screen. The humour in the game and hence its popularity stems from its funny content, the cartoon-style graphics and the funny names of the characters. =Characters beside Sven= The white sheep The female white sheep are entirely passive most of the time and await Sven's attention. Their current \\"happiness\\" status is shown by a sun and cloud symbol above their head. If that symbol turns into a lightning symbol (due to Sven's lack of attention, or because he ate a foul-smelling mushroom), they turn red, grow horns, run around and electrocute Sven, which, in itself, merely causes a loss of points, but will also paralyze him for a short while which may allow an enemy to capture him. Before they turn red, Sven can whistle to them to cheer them up. Also, when the clock showing the time within which Sven is supposed to finish the current level reaches zero, the sheep will turn angry, or a UFO will start abducting them. From Sven II onwards, one of the sheep, known as Frigidia, needs Sven's attention for a particularly long time before she becomes happy and disappears. In Sven XXX and Sven 004, these Sheep unlock new poses if engaged without interruption. In some levels, there are also mer-sheep, which will appear on the shore for a moment (in Sven I after he jumped into the river). Lars Einnicken Lars Einnicken (meaning Lars Nod-off), the shepherd, appears to be very old and sleepy, which is why he dozes most of the time and walks around only slowly. He objects to Sven's behaviour, but will not attack him unless Sven is presently engaging in lewd conduct with a sheep. Of all Sven's enemies, Lars is probably the least dangerous. From game 2 onwards, Lars will drink any wine bottles he finds, falling asleep immediately. Given his short range of sight and slow speed, they are the most unreliable distraction. W√∏tan W√∏tan, whose name is apparently a pun on the Nordic god Wotan, is the shepherd's dog. He walks around the flock at moderate speed, but starts to run when he sees Sven. He is the most important enemy Sven needs to avoid, as being caught will result in the loss of a life. Occasionally, W√∏tan will fall asleep, which gives Sven time to take care of the sheep. From game 2 onward, W√∏tan will be distracted if he finds a bone. In the first game of the series, Sven can also mate with the dog while the latter is asleep, but only on higher levels (from level 3 upwards in the free version, later in the full version). This is particularly dangerous as the player has to estimate when the dog will wake up, unless he wishes to risk a life. However, it will also result in the player getting many points (Just watch the icon or else Sven will be turned into the female in the encounter.). Aliens Occasionally, an alien flying saucer will appear and try to capture sheep with a tractor beam, apparently for purposes of experiments. In game 1, Sven will temporarily gain superpowers if captured. In later games of the series, the aliens serve mainly to get rid of enemies, especially the dog. In some of the games, there are also levels set in the flying saucer, where Sven has to avoid the aliens. Br√∏mse From game 2 onward, Br√∏mse, Lars's granddaughter, will sometimes walk around the flock and try to catch Sven. While this will not result in the loss of a life, it costs twenty seconds of the time available to finish the level, and may increase the risk of the dog catching Sven. Br√∏mse will be distracted if she finds a teddy bear. Clever players can direct Br√∏mse so she catches the dog instead. In Sven 004, the player can also decide to start the game as Br√∏mse, in which case the task is to get rid of the white sheep by cuddling them. Short-sighted hunters In Sven 004, there are also short-sighted hunters on some levels, who will sometimes fire their guns at random. Being hit will cost a life. If a white sheep is shot she's killed on the spot (A real pain if you're trying to score with every one of them.) Games of the Sven series =Sven B√∏mw√∏llen= Sven B√∏mw√∏llen (2002) is the first game of the series and the simplest one. The game is set on a simple meadow with some trees, bushes, puddles and a river. All levels look the same and only differ in the number of sheep, the possibility of mating with the dog (on higher levels) and the occasional presence of the flying saucer (on even higher levels). There is also an Easter or √òster- Editi√∏n version of the game which replaces all mushroom pickups with Easter eggs. =Sven Zwo= In the second game (2003), there are different-looking and larger levels for the first time. The game offers many new animals such as pigs and chickens as Sven's potential love interests. In this game, Br√∏mse appears for the first time. There are also some levels set inside a flying saucer. =Sven XXX= Sven XXX (2004) adds multiplayer and bonus levels where you play as an Alien or Lars. =Sven 004= Sven 004 (2004) offers new features, such as levels spanning multiple screens, new enemies such as the short-sighted hunters, cars that Sven needs to avoid when crossing a road, and a lawnmower he can use as transport. You can also play as Br√∏mse, W√∏tan, Lars or Aliens, each of them (except for W√∏tan) having their own vehicle. =Sven Kommt= Sven Kommt (2005) is a departure from the other games in the fact that the game is more of a platformer than a normal Sven game (despite the fact that the objective is still the same: giving the white sheep plenty of happiness) and replaces the 2-D sprites with 3-D characters and scenery. =Sven: Gut zu V√∂geln= Sven: Gut zu V√∂geln is a direct sequel to Sven Kommt and also a platformer. It contains much more distinct levels and an additional objective: to free the birds that are locked in cages. =Mach‚Äôs noch einmal, Sven= Mach's noch einmal, Sven returns to the original Sven premise, but with a twist: there are specific missions to complete, e.g. mate with a given number of sheep under the influence of a slowdown mushroom or have sex with Wotan a given number of times. Failure to complete an objective will leave the player stranded on an uncompletable level. =iOS version - Sven B√∏mw√∏llen Forplay= The iOS version of Sven B√∏mw√∏llen Forplay is developed by SIS software d.o.o.

In Jerusalem, the shtreimel is also worn by Litvak Jews (non-Hasidim who belong to the original Ashkenazi community of Jerusalem, also known as Perushim). The shtreimel is generally worn only after marriage, except in some Jewish Jerusalem communities, where boys wear it from the age of bar mitzvah. Origins There is much speculation surrounding the origin of the shtreimel. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, it is of Tatar origin.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1963) Volume 23 page 113 Different theories hold that it is of Tatar, Turkish or Russian origin, but it is not possible to establish a clear chronology. Some legends say that the initial reason for adopting the shtreimel was that the Russian tsar of the time decreed that the Jews must dress like the Gentiles. The shtreimel is comparable in construction to fur hats historically worn by nobles or gentiles across Europe, Scandinavia and Russia.http://www.jewishtreats.org/2009/06/shtreimels-and- spodiks.htmlhttp://www.jhi.pl/psj/sztrajmel According to the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw, the shtreimel could come from a period in the 17th century when Oriental costumes were considered fashionable by the nobility of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (Sarmatism). Types of shtreimels Portrait of the Tzemach Tzedek wearing his unique shtreimel Chortkov dynasty wearing the unique shtreimel of the Ruzhin dynasty The most widely seen shtreimel is typically worn by the Hasidim of Galicia, Romania, and Hungary, and was worn by Lithuanian Jews up until the 20th century. It comprises a large circular piece of black velvet surrounded by fur. The shtreimel of Menachem Mendel Schneersohn (the Tzemach Tzedek) was from white velvet. Hasidim originating from Congress Poland wear a high shtreimel (often called a spodik). The shtreimel of the Rebbes of the Ruzhin and Skolye dynasties is pointed upward. Symbolism While there is strong religious custom for Jewish males to cover their heads, from the standpoint of Jewish law there is no religious significance to the use of the shtreimel as the head covering. However, the wearing of two head coverings (the shtreimel is always worn over a yarmulke) is considered to add additional spiritual merit, plus the presence of beautiful craftsmanship adds beautification and honour to the custom. Such headgear is worn on special occasions (such as Shabbat), in the synagogue, or by office-holders such as rabbis. According to Rabbi Aaron Wertheim, Rabbi Pinchas of Koretz (1726‚Äì1791) stated that \\"[t]he acronym for Shabbos is: Shtreimel Bimkom Tefillin - the shtreimel takes the place of tefillin.\\"Halachos V'halichos B'chasidus, p. 196 Since wearing special clothing on Shabbat is a form of sanctification, among the Hasidim of Galicia and Hungary the shtreimel is associated with the holiness of Shabbat, a crown such as that worn by royalty, which enhances and beautifies Shabbat. Arnon asserts that the number of furs used in the manufacture of the shtreimel has some significance. Common numbers are 13, 18, and 26, corresponding respectively to the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy, the numerical value (gematria) of the word for life (), and the numerical value of the Tetragrammaton.Arnon, p.88 Contemporary shtreimlach may include higher numbers of tails. At least one maker creates shtreimelach with 42 tails, symbolizing the 42-letter Divine Name. Male Orthodox Jews can be highly conservative regarding headgear, and some traditional Jews still wear fedoras or homburgs. Although the traditional Jewish headgear is of Gentile origin and has specific historical and geographical roots, it continues being worn by traditional Jews even when non-Jews in the country of origin have long stopped wearing it. Manufacture The shtreimel is typically custom-made for the intended wearer, of fur from the tips of the tails typically of Canadian or Russian sable, beech marten, baum marten (European pine marten), or American gray fox. The shtreimel is almost always the most costly article of Hasidic clothing. It is possible to buy a shtreimel made of synthetic fur, which is more common in Israel. Usually the bride's father purchases the shtreimel for the groom upon his wedding. Nowadays, it is customary in America to purchase two shtreimels: a cheaper version, called the regen shtreimel (\\"rain shtreimel\\"), is for occasions when the expensive one may get damaged. In Israel, due to the economic circumstances of most members of the Hasidic community in that country, the vast majority of shtreimel-wearers own only one shtreimel. The shtreimel manufacturers (shtreimel machers) keep their trade a closely guarded secret.Arnon p.208 Occasions for wearing shtreimels The shtreimel is only worn in conjunction with other articles of clothing that comprise \\"Shabbos wear\\". It is never worn with weekday clothing. While there are no official rules as to when the shtreimel is to be worn, it is usually worn on the following occasions: * Shabbat * Jewish holidays, including Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Simchat Torah, Shemini Atzeret, Purim, Shushan Purim, Passover, Shavuot * (Chol HaMoed) of Pesach and Sukkot * the evenings following the end of the above-mentioned days * Isru Chag (the day after Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot) * at one's own wedding, or those of family members or of members of one's Rebbe's family. In some communities, it is customary to wear the shtreimel at all weddings, if the groom does so as well; similarly at formal engagement parties (Vort)Consultation with various rabbis in the U.S. and Israel elicited that, since both vorts and weddings take place only on weekdays, guests may attend in either weekday clothing or \\"Shabbos wear\\" including the shtreimel. * during the seven days following one's wedding, or of the wedding of a close family member (Sheva Brachot) * at a brit milah of direct family. * at Bar Mitzvah of one's own son in most, but not all, communities Some Hasidic Rebbes wear a shtreimel on occasions when their Hasidim will not, such as when lighting the menorah or when conducting a tish on Tu BiShvat and Lag BaOmer, whereas other rebbes may wear a kolpik on those occasions, and still others simply wear their weekday hat.

The first creation came in 1652 in favour of the Royalist soldier Henry Wilmot, 2nd Viscount Wilmot. He had already been created Baron Wilmot, of Adderbury in the County of Oxford, in 1643, also in the Peerage of England. He was the son of Charles Wilmot, who had been elevated to the Peerage of Ireland as Viscount Wilmot, of Athlone, in 1622. Lord Rochester died in 1658 and was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was a poet, a friend of King Charles II, and the writer of satirical and bawdy poetry. He married the heiress Elizabeth Malet. He was succeeded on his death in 1680 by his only son, the third Earl. He died at a young age the following year, when the titles became extinct. The second creation came in 1682 in favour of the statesman and writer the Honourable Laurence Hyde. He was made Baron Wotton Basset and Viscount Hyde, of Kenilworth in the County of Warwick, at the same time, also in the Peerage of England. Hyde was the second son of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon. He was succeeded by his only son Henry, the second Earl. He notably served as Lord- Lieutenant of Cornwall. In 1723 he succeeded his cousin as fourth Earl of Clarendon. His only surviving son Henry Hyde, Viscount Cornbury, was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Hyde in 1750.

The 2nd Battalion spent most the first 30 years of its existence overseas, while the 3rd Battalion was embodied specifically for service in the Second Boer War. In addition, the 1st and 2nd Volunteer Battalions raised a service company to reinforce the 1st Battalion in the field.Mullaly, p. 146. Following the end of the war in South Africa in 1902, the 1st battalion was sent to British India, where they replaced the 2nd battalion in Jubbulpore in Bengal. The 2nd battalion returned home, for the first times since 1884. In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had one Reserve battalion and two Territorial battalions.These were the 3rd Battalion (Special Reserve), with the 4th Battalion at Bath Street in Warrington and the 5th Battalion at Mill Street in St Helen's (both Territorial Force).Mullaly, p. 154. =The First World War= Grave of 31097 Private W. Jaundrell buried at Locre No.10 Cemetery, Loker Regular Army The 1st Battalion spent the war on garrison duty in Quetta, Baluchistan, on the North-West Frontier. The 2nd Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 7th Brigade in the 3rd Division in August 1914 and spent the entire war on the Western Front. The 3rd (Reserve) Battalion was a depot and training battalion stationed in Lancashire throughout the war. Territorial Force The 1/4th Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 7th Brigade in the 3rd Division in February 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 1/5th Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 12th Brigade in the 4th Division in February 1915 also for service on the Western Front. The 2/4th and 2/5th Battalions landed at Boulogne as part of the 172nd (2/1st South Lancashire) Brigade in the 57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division in February 1917 also for service on the Western Front. New Army Battalions The 6th (Service) Battalion landed at Cape Helles in Gallipoli as part of the 38th Brigade in 13th (Western) Division in July 1915; a detachment from the battalion was commanded by Captain Clement Attlee, who fell ill with dysentery during the campaign but went on to become prime minister. The battalion was evacuated from Gallipoli and went to Egypt in December 1915 before moving on to Mesopotamia in February 1916. The 7th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne as part of the 56th Brigade in the 19th (Western) Division in July 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 8th (Service) Battalion landed in France as part of the 75th Brigade in the 25th Division in September 1915 also for service on the Western Front. The 9th (Service) Battalion landed in France as part of the 66th Brigade in the 22nd Division in September 1915 for service on the Western Front but transferred to Salonika in November 1915. The 11th (Service) Battalion (St Helens Pioneers) landed at Le Havre as pioneer battalion to the 30th Division in November 1915 for service on the Western Front. =Between the world wars= The 1st Battalion saw action on the North West Frontier in May 1919 and then took part in Third Anglo-Afghan War in July 1919. =Second World War= Regular Army The 1st Battalion, a Regular Army battalion, was shipped to France on the outbreak of war in 1939 as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, British Expeditionary Force, returning to England via Dunkirk. After returning to the United Kingdom, it was transferred to the 8th Infantry Brigade (which included the 1st Suffolk Regiment and 2nd East Yorkshire Regiment) attached to the 3rd Infantry Division, nicknamed Monty's Ironsides. With this division, it landed at Sword Beach on D-Day and fought its way through the Normandy, the Netherlands and later the invasion of Germany. Men of the 1st Battalion in action in the Netherlands, November 1944 The 2nd Battalion was in Bombay in 1939, being transported back to Britain in July 1940 to defend the home front against the expected German invasion. In 1942, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Michael West, later to become a full general, attached to the 29th Independent Infantry Brigade, it was part of Force 121, which invaded Madagascar in order to prevent use of the island by the Japanese. From April 1944 until the end of the war, it fought in the recapture of Burma, initially with the 36th Infantry Division alongside the 2nd Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment. The 2nd battalion was then transferred to the 114th Indian Infantry Brigade, 7th Indian Infantry Division, serving with them until July 1945, when the Battalion came under command of the 20th Indian Division. Territorial Army The 2/4th Battalion was raised in 1939 as a 2nd Line Territorial Army battalion duplicate of the 1st Line 4th Battalion, later redesignated the 1/4th Battalion. Both the 1/4th and 2/4th battalions served in the 164th Infantry Brigade, part of the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division. In 1943, the 2/4th Battalion was transferred to the British Army's airborne forces and converted to become the 13th Parachute Battalion of the Parachute Regiment, part of the 5th Parachute Brigade, which itself was part of the newly raised 6th Airborne Division.Gregory, p.53 The 13th Parachute Battalion saw combat during Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in the early hours of 6 June 1944, D-Day.Otway, p. 179 The battalion served as normal infantrymen for the duration of the Battle of Normandy until being withdrawn, with the rest of the division, to England in September 1944. The 6th Airborne Division was then sent to Belgium in December 1944 to fight in the Ardennes offensive, the Battle of the Bulge. They were then involved in the largest airborne drop of the entire war with over 16,000 airborne troops taking part, known as Operation Varsity, with the US 17th Airborne Division.Otway, p. 308 British paratroopers of the 13th Parachute Battalion in Normandy The 5th Territorial Battalion of the regiment was transferred to the Royal Artillery before the war and converted into the 61st (South Lancashire) Searchlight Regiment. It served in North West England, in the Orkneys, and in Kent against V-1 flying bombs.Mullaly, p. 376. In late 1944, it became the 61st (South Lancashire Regiment) Garrison Regiment, Royal Artillery. In early 1945, due to a severe shortage of infantrymen in the 21st Army Group, the regiment was converted into the 612th (South Lancashire Regiment) Infantry Regiment, Royal Artillery and joined the 306th Infantry Brigade, thereby releasing trained infantrymen for frontline service. Hostilities-only The regiment raised many other battalions for service before and during the war but most were disbanded before the war's end. The 6th (Home Defence) Battalion was raised in 1939 and, in 1941, was redesignated the 30th Battalion. It was disbanded in January 1943. The 7th and 8th battalions were both raised in 1940 and joined the 204th Infantry Brigade. On 1 September 1942, the brigade was redesignated the 185th Infantry Brigade and the 7th Battalion was sent to India, where it remained until disbandment in 1946, as a training battalion with the 52nd Brigade. The battalion's role was training British infantry replacements in jungle warfare for the British Fourteenth Army. The 50th (Holding) Battalion was raised in 1940. That October, it was redesignated as the 9th Battalion and joined the 225th Infantry Brigade and then the 207th Infantry Brigade. The battalion remained in the United Kingdom for the war and was later transferred to the 164th Infantry Brigade, alongside the 1/4th Battalion, and supplied replacements to units overseas. It was apparently disbanded in July 1944, but another source claims it was disbanded in 1946. =Peace and amalgamation= Immediately after the war, the 1st Battalion served in Egypt and Palestine before being reduced to a cadre and amalgamated with the 2nd Battalion at Trieste in 1948. The surviving 1st Battalion saw further service in the Sudan, Britain, Berlin and Hong Kong where, in 1958, it was amalgamated with 1st Battalion, the East Lancashire Regiment, to form 1st Battalion, the Lancashire Regiment (Prince of Wales's Volunteers) which was later amalgamated with the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) to form the Queen's Lancashire Regiment which was, however, merged with the King's Regiment (Liverpool and Manchester), the King's Own Royal Border Regiment, in 2007, to form the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border).

Biography McCawley was born James Quillan McCawley, Jr. to Dr. Monica Bateman McCawley (b. 1901), a physician and surgeon, and James Quillan McCawley (b. 1899), a businessman. In 1939 his father and two brothers moved to Toronto and founded a roofing company, but his mother remained in Glasgow with the children until after World War II. James Sr. moved to New York City and finally Chicago, where the family joined him. It was on his arrival in America that young McCawley changed his name to James David McCawley, dropping the \\"Junior.\\" He skipped several grades in school, entered the University of Chicago in 1954 at the age of 16, and soon gained early admission to the graduate school, from which he received an M.S. in mathematics in 1958. He then received a Fulbright fellowship to study mathematics and logic in 1959-60 at Westf√§lische Wilhelms-Universit√§t in M√ºnster. During this time he became disillusioned with mathematics, and after sitting in on a linguistics course taught by Eric Hamp, he became more and more interested in the subject and began taking language courses; on his return to America, he applied to the new linguistics graduate program at MIT and was accepted, spending the next three years as a member of the first Ph.D. class there. He worked as a research assistant with the Mechanical Translation group in 1962 and 1963, and in 1965 he received his doctorate for a dissertation under Noam Chomsky on The accentual system of modern standard Japanese. By this time he had already returned to the University of Chicago as Assistant Professor of Linguistics. He worked at the Department of Linguistics at the University of Chicago from 1964 until his sudden and unexpected death. At the time of his passing, he was working on two books, a collection of his recent articles and a text on the relation of philosophy of science to linguistics. His interests encompassed syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and phonology. He is perhaps best known within linguistics for his work in generative semantics. Outside academia he is noted for The Eater's Guide to Chinese Characters, his guidebook to deciphering Chinese restaurant menus. He had an interest in libertarian politics and once ran (unsuccessfully) for election to state office on the Libertarian ticket. Under the pseudonym \\"Quang Ph√∫c ƒê√¥ng\\" (supposedly a linguist at the fictitious South Hanoi Institute of Technology), McCawley wrote a paper on \\"English sentences without overt grammatical subject.\\"  References  Books *The Phonological Component of a Grammar of Japanese.

The immigration was the initiative of the Lieutenant Governor of the colony, Michael Francklin. The first settlers arrived in 1772 aboard the ship Duke of York. Between 1773 and 1775 several additional ships arrived, peaking in 1774 with the arrival of 9 vessels. Cemetery in Point de Bute, New Brunswick, near where the first Methodist church stood. Many of the Yorkshire pioneers were Wesleyan Methodists and were responsible for establishing the earliest Methodist chapels in Canada (1790). The immigrants were mostly tenant farmers in Yorkshire, although a few also came from Northumberland. They left for Nova Scotia \\"in order to seek a better livelihood\\". Rather than receiving land grants from the government, as had the previous immigrants, the New England Planters, the new arrivals came with money and purchased their lands from the government or from Planters who were at the time beginning to leave. It has been argued that these pioneers were instrumental in preventing victory by American sympathisers during the Eddy Rebellion of 1776. Named for Jonathan Eddy, the Rebellion was an attempt to wrestle Nova Scotia from the British in order for it join the thirteen colonies in the newly created United States.

The medal was created on May 12, 1964 during the Vietnam War. The Civil Actions Medal was awarded to the South Vietnamese military and its allies' military personnel or units that performed outstanding achievements in the field of civil affairs. The medal was awarded in two classes, with the first-class intended for commissioned officers and the second class for enlisted personnel. Individuals who were cited received the medal, ribbon, and a citation. The South Vietnamese government authorized members of a unit awarded the Civil Actions Medal to wear the Civil Actions Unit Citation Emblem with Palm and Frame (Civil Actions Medal, First Class color). Only one unit citation emblem with palm and frame could be worn on the service uniform. The ribbon with palm and frame (no medal or citation) is authorized for the unit award of the medal.  Medal  = Description = The Civil Actions Medal, occasionally referred to as the Civic Actions Medal, is a bronze eight-pointed star with alternating points of the star lined, superimposed by a disk with a figure of a soldier, a child, and a farmer with a shovel, all enclosed by a white enamel designation band inscribed D√¢n V·ª• (Civil Action) at the top and B·ªôi Tinh (Medal) at the bottom. The Republic of Vietnam made some revisions pertaining to the Civil Actions Medal in 1965 and 1967. = Ribbons = The Civil Action Medal, First and Second Class, has a suspension ribbon and service ribbon that is Bottle Green and Scarlet. The first-class color is distinguished from the second class color by the first- class medal having two narrow red stripes in the center of the medal's ribbon. The Civil Actions Unit Citation Emblem is in the first-class color only. = Ribbon devices = The first Civil Action Medal was awarded without a ribbon device. Each additional award of the medal had one of four devices representing four levels an individual was cited from; a large palm indicated a citation from the Armed Forces level. Subsequent award devices were attached on service and suspension ribbons of the medal. The unit citation emblem has a small palm and thin gold frame for the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force, and thick gold frame for the U.S. Army: *Palm - Armed Forces level *Gold Star - Corps level *Silver Star - Division level *Bronze Star - Brigade or Regiment level  Unit Award  The unit citation was referred to as the Vietnam Civil Actions Unit Citation with Palm or as the Vietnam Meritorious Unit Citation with Civil Actions Colors by the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard. The unit citation was awarded to US Army units during the Vietnam War as the Civil Actions Honor Medal, FC. The award does not have a medal, it is a ribbon award. The Civil Actions Unit Citation Emblem was awarded to all members of military command or unit who had participated in civic actions to such a degree as would warrant an individual Vietnam Civil Actions Medal. The unit citation ribbon uses the Vietnam Civil Actions Medal design (First Class with two thin red stripes in center) service ribbon with a bronze palm enclosed in a thin gold frame for the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Air Force, and a thick gold frame for U.S. Army personnel.  Separate awards  Regulations of the U.S. various military branches pertaining to the wearing of medals, awards, and decorations permits the display of both the Civil Actions Medal and service ribbon signifying an individual award of the medal (if authorized) and/or the gold-framed ribbon signifying a member's unit award of the medal as the Civil Actions Medal Unit Citation (if authorized). The Civil Actions Medal and the Civil Actions Unit Citation with Palm and Frame ribbon were awards bestowed by the Republic of Vietnam to foreign military personnel. The Civil Actions Unit Citation was awarded to members of cited units of the United States Army and United States Marine Corps which had participated in local police actions to suppress civil unrest in certain areas of South Vietnam, and all United States Coast Guard members for providing medical care to the South Vietnamese population (Medical Civic Action Program Medical or \\"MEDCAPS\\"). = Other awards = Other Republic of Vietnam awards includes the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal.

Description  Chagan was the first and largest of the 124 detonations in the Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy program, designed to produce peaceful nuclear explosions (PNEs) for earth-moving purposes. The concept of using PNEs to create artificial lakes, harbors and canals was modeled after a United States program, Project Plowshare, which conducted the first peaceful nuclear explosion (the 104 kt Sedan shallow cratering test) at the Nevada Test Site in July 1962. Described as a \\"near clone\\" of the Sedan shot, Chagan's yield was the equivalent of 140 kilotons of TNT and sought to produce a large conical crater suitable for a lake. The site was a dry bed of the Chagan River (tributary of Irtysh River) at the edge of the Semipalatinsk Test Site, and was chosen such that the lip of the crater would dam the river during its high spring flow. The resultant lake has a diameter of and is deep. Shallow subsurface (open) cratering explosions such as Sedan or Chagan release a great deal of steam and pulverized rock along with approximately 20% of the bomb's normal fission products into the atmosphere. Although the vast majority of this fallout was deposited in the general area of the test, it also produced a small but measurable radioactive plume, which in Chagan's case was detected over Japan and initially prompted complaints from the US that the Soviets were violating the provisions of the October 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty, which banned atmospheric tests and any vented (or \\"open\\") subsurface detonation which caused \\"radioactive debris to be present outside the territorial limits of the State under whose jurisdiction or control such explosion is conducted\\". The matter was eventually abandoned, and in any case all subsequent Soviet shots were smaller. The photo of the Chagan shot is occasionally confused with that of the Soviet Joe 1 test. The correct image shows a squat, ground-level cloud similar to the Sedan shot rather than the tall mushroom cloud of the tower- detonated Joe-1.Richard Rhodes's 1995 Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen BombDavid Holloway's 1994 Stalin and the Bomb Lake Chagan Lake Chagan or Lake Balapan, Kazakhstan, a lake created by the Chagan nuclear test roughly in size, is still radioactive, and has been called the \\"Atomic Lake\\".

Life  Born at Oettingen in Bayern, Germany, he was one of nine children. His father, allegedly of noble origin, was an office clerk and much impoverished. Hieronymus himself for years worked as a scribe, although he was formally educated as an attorney. He studied, on and off, in Wittenberg and was very impressed with Melanchthon and directly exposed to Lutheran teaching. Allegedly, he saved money out of his meager income to purchase a Latin-Greek dictionary and taught himself Greek. Upon acquiring some mastery of Greek, he plunged into translation in German of the speeches of Demosthenes. His translation was published in 1549 by well-known publishing house Oporinus, which made his name known to the Fugger family in Augsburg. Wolf got a position as a secretary and librarian of Fugger Library in 1551. A student of Philipp Melanchthon and Joachim Camerarius,Rudolf Dekker, Egodocuments and History: Autobiographical writing in its social context since the Middle Ages, (Verloren Publishing, 2002), 29. he managed to secure the position of secretary and librarian in the newly established public library of Augsburg in 1537, where he was given the chance to study and translate numerous ancient and medieval Greek authors, making them accessible to German academics. He made his reputation as a scholar of Isocrates and first published an edition of him at Paris in 1551. The library became famous for its contents and in particular for 100 Greek manuscripts that were transferred from Venice. Later on, under the scholarly direction of Hieronymus Wolf and others, the library became a research center of both respect and quality throughout Europe. Six years later, Wolf was appointed first rector of Gelehrtenschule in the building of St Anne Carmelite cloister, subsequently known as St Anne Gymnasium. The Protestant College was established there to counterbalance the Jesuit college created more or less at the same time. Hieronymus Wolf was, however, a sick man throughout his life. He never married. Intellectually brilliant and very renowned as a teacher, he was also very egocentric and secluded. As a result, the outstanding faculty he brought to St Anne was often left to fend for themselves and ran the school independently. He died at age of 64. His initiative led to the hiring of two outstanding faculty: Georg Henisch and Simon Fabricius. They added a Protestant College to the Gymnasium in the early 1580s. The initiative to establish an institution of learning open to adults was an ethos of Protestant teaching. Soon, the college ran into difficulties due to the rapidly emerging Counter-Reformation. Publications Hieronymus continued to work in Augsburg's library, but his life's work was outside the traditional fields proposed by humanism. Until his time, no distinction was made between ancient and medieval Greek works, and indeed the latter was shadowed by the interest shown for classical authors. Rather, interest was stirred from a different direction, that of discovering and explaining the history that led to the conquest of much of eastern Europe by the Ottomans, whom Wolf lived to see during their Siege of Vienna. He focused primarily on Greek history, and published his work in 1557 under the title Corpus Historiae Byzantinae, which was more a collection of Byzantine sources than a comprehensive history. Nevertheless, the impact of his work on the long term was massive, as it would set the foundations for upcoming medieval Greek histories. This reference to \\"Byzantinae\\" has since spread through western European scholars and gradually replaced the name Roman as used in the Eastern Roman Empire by the term Byzantine, to denote medieval Greek-speaking literature from the Eastern Roman Empire. This replacement reflects the feud between east and west over the title of Emperor of the Romans, that began already with Konstantinos the Great transferring the capital to Bosphorus. In the 17th century, Louis XIV of France prompted for the assemblage of all Roman works and called several renowned scholars from around the world to participate in this effort. Hieronymus' Corpus would be used to build upon. The result was the immense Corpus Historiae Byzantinae in 34 volumes, with paralleled Greek text and Latin translation. This edition popularized the term \\"Byzantine Empire\\" (never used by that empire itself during the centuries of its existence) and established it in historical studies.

Solaris was created by Grant Morrison, and first appeared in the DC One Million crossover, although it also subsequently appeared in Grant Morrison's All-Star Superman series, set outside DC continuity. Fictional character biography =DC One Million= In the 853rd century Solaris is a secondary artificial sun, a sentient machine in the orbit of Uranus that helps to warm the outer parts of the solar system and relay communications and information. His caretaker is the future Starman. Solaris was created in the 20th century section of the DC One Million storyline in an apparent predestination paradox, as his abilities were required to counteract an organic computer virus his 853rd century self had sent back, concealed in the android Hourman. Unbeknownst to those constructing him, Solaris' core programming was contained in the computer virus, resulting in the tyrant sun's creation being the result of a time loop, although he was swiftly defeated and banished to the outskirts of the galaxy by the Starman of the 853rd century before he could organise himself enough to take offensive action after his creation. =All-Star Superman= According to the future timeline established in DC One Million, after Solaris was originally created in the late 20th century, he will fight many battles against \\"the progenitor of the dynasty\\" (a.k.a. the original Superman) between that time and the departure of the original Superman from Earth at the end of the 21st century. As yet, no such battles have been published. Solaris is still technically at large within the DC universe. Morrison used the character in his out-of-continuity All-Star Superman series, which began in 2005 and concluded in 2008. Solaris was referenced in issue #2 of that series, in the form of a report from Kal Kent, the Superman of the 853rd century. The report was viewed via Superman's prototype Time Telescope. Kal Kent appeared identical to his appearance in DC One Million. The Tyrant Sun appears as a distinct character in issue #11, where Superman reveals that he knows that Solaris will continue to exist into the distant future, again similar to the events in DC One Million. =The future= After that point, Solaris will be a recurrent villain plaguing Superman's descendants, until he is considered the greatest enemy of the Superman dynasty. This will continue until the 505th century Superman sacrifices his life in order to reprogram the artificial sun. At that point, Solaris will recant its villainous ways and work for the betterment of humanity, becoming an ally of the Superman dynasty. At that time Solaris is never able to rise to the high standard set by the Supermen, and also part of his service never seems entirely altruistic. These suspicions will gradually be confirmed as Solaris rises to lead a group called the Pancosmic Justice Jihad, which will take advantage of the paranoia of a dark age to justify an aggressive agenda of preemptive strikes and be venerated by the fearful population. The return of Superman Prime (Kal-El, the original Superman) from his long wandering at the boundaries of existence in the 701st century will trigger a great spiritual revival, during which humanity will look to develop its own ultimate mental potential and turn its back on artificial computers (cf. Frank Herbert's Butlerian Jihad), including Solaris. Solaris will then be relegated to the role he occupies at the dawn of the 853rd century, that of the secondary sun of Earth's solar system, forever considered inferior to the yellow primary Sun which serves as Superman's current Fortress of Solitude. The resentment that festers in Solaris as a result of this situation will lead him to plot with the 853rd century Starman and the immortal Vandal Savage to destroy Superman Prime upon his return from his 15,270 year stay in the heart of the sun. Their intention was to trap and kill the original Justice League‚ÄîSuperman's oldest friends‚Äîin a world they could not comprehend, and subsequently Solaris would replace the Sun after the original Superman was assassinated using the last known piece of Kryptonite in the universe. However, this plan was thwarted by the Justice League back in the past (consisting of Steel, Plastic Man, Big Barda, Huntress and Zauriel), who destroyed the Kryptonite fragment and secretly replaced it with a Green Lantern power ring, while in the 853rd century Kyle Rayner triggered a supernova in the core of Solaris and then contained it using his own power ring. Solaris was subsequently crushed by Superman Prime upon his emergence from the Sun using his newly-acquired Green Lantern ring. In other media * Solaris appears in All-Star Superman, voiced by Robin Atkin Downes.http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php/news.php?action=fullnews&id;=966 Reception Solaris was praised as one of those major storyline villains that didn't need to be tied to the story that introduced them and reused often unlike Bane or Doomsday.

Appearing as the series' lead character, Shinn is a member from the military organization ZAFT composed of genetically advanced humans known as Coordinators. Shinn joined ZAFT after his family had been killed during the previous war between ZAFT and the Earth Alliance, and bears an enormous hatred towards his home country Orb for not protecting them. Across the series, Shinn starts questioning his motives to fight for ZAFT. He is voiced in the Japanese series by Kenichi Suzumura and by Matthew Erickson in the English dub. Shinn has also been featured in the films and manga adaptations, reprising his role from the Gundam SEED Destiny. He is also featured in various video games from the franchise as well as crossover titles. Shinn was developed as the opposite from Kira Yamato, the protagonist from the series' prequel Mobile Suit Gundam SEED with director Mitsuo Fukuda stating that nevertheless both would go through similar developments. Shinn's character has been well received by anime fans, appearing in Anime Grand Prix polls and Sunrise polls, being ranked as one of the most popular anime characters. On the other hand, critical reception for Shinn has been mixed due to his antagonistic personality as well as his actions across the series' second half. Appearances =In Mobile Suit Gundam SEED = Shinn is first spotted in Gundam Seed Episode 41 \\"Trembling World\\" where he is seen registering for ZAFT and listening to an announcement by Patrick Zala. Rey Za Burrel is also seen standing behind him. =In Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny= Shinn is introduced in the series as a member of the military organization ZAFT from the colony PLANT, working as the pilot of the mobile suit under the command of Talia Gladys, captain of the battleship Minerva. While Shinn is often seen as a friendly person, he bears an enormous hatred towards the rulers of the country of Orb, where he lived alongside his parents and his younger sister. Shinn's family was killed in a crossfire between mobile suits from the Earth Alliance and Orb during the Bloody Valentine war. When Athrun Zala becomes Shinn's commander, he is initially angered by his appointment, but eventually comes to respect him. Upon the start of a new war between ZAFT and the Earth Alliance, Shinn saves a girl named Stella Loussier from drowning. The two befriend each other, without realizing that they were actually fighting each other in the war. Shinn discovers she is an Earth Alliance's soldier only after he defeats her mobile suit in a battle. Because of Stella being an Extended, a person injected with drugs from a young age to fight at the same level of the Coordinators, the Minerva staff can not do anything to stop her health from deteriorating. Shinn takes the dying Stella to her superior Neo Roanoke knowing he is the only one who can save her. However, Shinn once again battles Stella who is attacking Berlin in an enormous transformable mobile suit. Stella had gone berserk due to her fear of dying and her mobile suit is then destroyed by Kira Yamato, a pilot from the Archangel ship that is trying to stop the war. Stella dies in Shinn's arms due to the injuries received from her suit's destruction. Angered with Stella's death, Shinn starts training with his friend Rey Za Burrel to defeat Kira in an upcoming battle. Following his victory, PLANT Chairman Gilbert Durandal gives him the mobile suit to pilot as a reward for his actions. When Athrun is deemed to be a traitor by ZAFT, Shinn follows his superiors orders to kill him when he escapes with a mobile suit alongside Shinn's comrade Meyrin Hawke. While shocked about his actions, Shinn is comforted by Meyrin's older sister, Lunamaria Hawke, who he starts growing closer to as she feels Shinn is not to blame for her sister's apparent death. In following battles against the Earth Alliance, Shinn learns that both Kira and Athrun are alive, with the latter joining the former and is questioned about his motives to fight. Rey convinces Shinn to continue following Durandal's will and he defeats most of Earth Alliance's forces. When the Minerva is confronted by the Archangel again, Shinn is defeated by Athrun in battle with the all the other Minerva forces also being defeated. =In other media= Shinn has also appeared in the original video animation Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Final Plus, that remakes the events from series' last episode. After ZAFT's defeat, Shinn meets the Kira Yamato in person and both decide to join forces for a peaceful future. He also stars in the Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: Special Edition films series that retell the events from the Gundam SEED Destiny television series. He remains in ZAFT after the war's ending, alongside Kira and Lunamaria. He has also been featured in the two manga adaptations from the series, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: The Edge. Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: The Edge Desire deals with both Shinn's backstory and aftermath after the events of the Second Bloody Valentine War. Shinn also appears in the manga Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Astray when ZAFT presents the Impulse for the first time. There is also a character CD based on Shinn's character with tracks performed by his Japanese voice actor, Kenichi Suzumura. Shinn is a pilot in the video game Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny: Rengou vs. Z.A.F.T. and its sequel Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny: Rengou vs. Z.A.F.T. II with his two mobile suits. He is also featured in the Gundam crossover games Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2 and Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 3 with Destiny as a playable mobile suit. Shinn is playable in both Mobile Suit Gundam: Gundam vs. Gundam and Gundam vs. Gundam Next, with the Impulse and Destiny though the latter was not added until PlayStation Portable version of the first game. He is an unlockable in the third game, Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme Vs.. Shinn also appears in the Super Robot Wars series starting on Super Robot Wars Z and Super Robot Wars K. Shinn is also playable with the Destiny mobile suit in Another Century's Episode: R. Creation and conception During initial episodes from Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, director Mitsuo Fukuda did not want to talk too much about Shinn's character. However, he defined him as Kira's opposite in regards to their personalities when comparing the two lead characters. Shinn is defined as a civilian whose character could already go through a large development in contrast to Kira who was forced to become a soldier in the prequel Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. In comparison with Kira, Shinn was stated to be character harder to predict his role in the TV series. As with Kira in Gundam SEED, Fukuda mentioned Shinn's character would also change across the series. Kenichi Suzumura was especially hired to work as Shinn's Japanese voice actor with Fukuda stating he was not a character difficult to play. Fukuda also anticipated Suzumura's work as Shinn's voice actor in an optimistic way. Before the series' premiere, staff member Kabashima Yousuke gave hints about Shinn's character, telling that the Gundam SEED Destinys protagonist would be a character not seen in the prequel, and he would have a thin appearance. Reception Shinn's character has become popular within fans, appearing various times in the Anime Grand Prix popularity polls for favorite male characters. He first appeared in sixth place in 2004, dropping to seventh place in 2005, and twelfth place in 2006. In a Newtype poll, Shinn was voted as the seventeenth most popular male anime character from the 2000s. In an official Gundam poll by Sunrise, Shinn was voted as the third character with the strongest family bonds. In another poll from the same site regarding who was most childish hero within the Gundam franchise, Shinn was at the top. In another poll in which fans were asked who was the most memorable characters from Gundam SEED Destiny, Shinn was second. Publications for manga, anime and other media have commented on Shinn's character, giving him mainly mixed critics. His introduction to the series was noted to lack impact by Paul Fargo from Anime News Network owing to his limited screentime in the first episodes. Additionally, his hostility shown towards other popular characters from Gundam SEED led Fargo to find him more as an \\"antagonistic and obnoxious\\" person much to the viewers. A similar response was made by Luis Cruz from Mania Entertainment who stated that Shinn's debut was overshadowed by Athrun Zala's role in the first episodes. Nevertheless, Cruz wanted to know his character would be developed to learn his motivations to fight. DVDTalk's Don Houston found his hatred for Orb because of his family's death being uncommon as he did not blame \\"the attackers like most sane people would do\\". His personality was also found reminiscent to the one of Kira Yamato by Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network who also expected such two characters to engage in battle in following episodes. Maria Lin from Animefringe stated that Shinn's relative younger age from the ones of Gundam SEEDs returning characters was meant to emphasize the frustration to the beginning of another major conflict. Shinn's and Stella's relationship was praised by Cruz for the friendship mainly they made because both of them were unaware they are enemies. However, although in following reviews from Gundam SEED Destiny, Liversidge liked how Shinn's and Stella Loussier's relationship concluded ending in a tragic way due to their battles, he found Kira's role in the series to be more likable. Moreover, in the series finale, he wondered whether Shinn would do an action appreciated by the viewers, but ended favoriting the scene in which an angered Athrun defeats him with a \\"much deserved kicking\\" as at the same time Shinn's attitude was teased. Shinn's role in the OVA Final Plus that remade the last episode was noted to have made his defeat more satisfying to the viewers, as well as giving a last chance for viewers to like him.

Along with Margaret Cheyne, wife of Sir John Bulmer, who was similarly tortured and executed after the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1537, she is the only woman on record known to have been both tortured in the Tower of London and burnt at the stake. She is also one of the earliest known female poets to compose in the English language and the first Englishwoman to demand a divorce (especially as an innocent party on scriptural grounds). Life Anne Askew was born in 1521 in Lincolnshire, England. Sir William Askew, a wealthy landowner, was her father. William was a gentleman in the court of King Henry VIII, as well as a juror in the trial of Anne Boleyn's co-accused. Her mother was Elizabeth Wrotessley, of Reading, Berkshire. Askew was the fourth of their five children, which included her brothers Francis and Edward, and sisters Martha and Jane. She also had two stepbrothers, Christopher and Thomas, by her father's second wife Elizabeth Hutton. She was also related to Robert Aske who led the Pilgrimage of Grace. William Askew had arranged that his eldest daughter, Martha, be married to Thomas Kyme. When Anne was 15 years old, Martha died. Her father decided Anne would take Martha's place in the marriage to Thomas to save money. Askew was a devout Protestant, studying the Bible and memorizing verses, and remained true to her belief for the entirety of her life. Her reading convinced her of the falsity of the doctrine of transubstantiation, and her pronouncements created some controversy in Lincoln. Her husband was a Catholic, and the resultant marriage was brutal. Askew had two children with Kyme before he threw her out for being Protestant. It is alleged that Askew was seeking to divorce Kyme, so this did not upset her. Upon being thrown out, Askew moved to London. Here she met other Protestants, including the Anabaptist Joan Bocher, and studied the Bible. Askew stuck to her maiden name, rather than her husband's name. While in London, she became a \\"gospeller\\" or a preacher. In March 1545, Kyme had Askew arrested. She was brought back to Lincolnshire, where he demanded that she stay. The order was short lived; she escaped and returned to London to continue preaching. In early 1546, she was arrested again, but released. In May 1546, she was arrested again, and tortured in the Tower of London (she is the only woman recorded to have been tortured there apart from Margaret Cheyne, wife of Sir John Bulmer). She was ordered to name like-minded women, but refused. The torturers, Lord Chancellor Thomas Wriothesley and Sir Richard Rich, used the rack, but Askew refused to renounce her beliefs. On 18 June 1546, she was convicted of heresy, and was condemned to be burned at the stake. On 16 July 1546, Askew was martyred in Smithfield, London. Because of the torture she had endured, she had to be carried to the stake on a chair. She burned to death, along with three other Protestants, John Lassells, Nicholas Belenian, also known as John Hemsley (\\"a priest\\"), and John Adams, aka John Hadlam (\\"a tailor\\"). A secret supporter of the cause slipped gunpowder to the condemned four, which killed them quickly when it exploded. Background on 1546 In the last year of Henry VIII's reign, Askew was caught up in a court struggle between religious traditionalists and reformers. Stephen Gardiner was telling the king that diplomacy ‚Äì the prospect of an alliance with the Roman Catholic Emperor Charles V ‚Äì required a halt to religious reform. The traditionalist party pursued tactics tried out three years previously, with the arrests of minor evangelicals in the hope that they would implicate those who were more highly placed. In this case measures were taken that were \\"legally bizarre and clearly desperate\\". The people rounded up were in many cases strongly linked to Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, who spent most of the period absent from court in Kent: Askew's brother Edward was one of his servants, and Nicholas Shaxton who was brought in to put pressure on Askew to recant was acting as a curate for Cranmer at Hadleigh. Others in Cranmer's circle who were arrested were Rowland Taylor and Richard Turner. The traditionalist party included Thomas Wriothesley and Richard Rich, who racked Anne Askew in the Tower, Edmund Bonner and Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk. The intention of her interrogators may have been to implicate the Queen, Catherine Parr, through the latter's ladies-in-waiting and close friends, who were suspected of having also harboured Protestant beliefs. These ladies included the Queen's sister, Anne Parr, Katherine Willoughby, and Anne Calthorpe. Other targets were Lady Denny and Lady Hertford, wives of evangelicals at court. Plain speaking The prevailing religious culture of Anne's time, summed up by bishop Stephen Gardiner, viewed \\"plain speaking\\" with suspicion, a tactic used by the devil to spread heresy: \\"and where playnes maye deceyve, he makethe his pretence to speake playnely, and professeth simplycytie\\". The inquisitors saw in Anne a particularly threatening example of such plain speaking, her agile answers demonstrating a mastery of scriptural language that rivaled the inquisitors own. Under questioning from bishop Edmund Bonner who commanded her repeatedly to \\"utter al thynges that burdened [her] conscience\\" she answered in unembellished language blended with Scriptural teachings: \\"God hath geven me the gyfte of knowledge, but not of utterance. And Salomon sayth, that a woman of fewe words, is a gyfte of God.\\" Her answers infuriated the inquisitors, who find they're not able to force from her the answers they want to hear. Faced with Bonner's deepening rage, she repeats only that she believes \\"as the scripture doth teache,\\" making it clear that she won't accept non-scriptural authorities over her own engagement with the Scriptures, which she quotes from directly \\"That God dwelleth not in temples made with handes\\" (). When Christopher Dare asks her interpretation of this saying, she mocks them, invoking the Sermon on the Mount: \\"I answered, that I wolde not throw pearles amonge swyne, for acornes were good ynough.\\" () When questioned about the Eucharist she answers \\"if the host shuld fall, and a beast ded eate it [did the] beast ... receyve God or no?\\" She often played upon traditional gender roles to mock her questioners telling them \\"it is agaynst saynt Paules lernynge, that [she] beynge a woman, should interprete the scriptures, specyallye where so many wise men were.\\" Of particular interest to the questioners was Anne's relationship with the Holy Spirit. Asked if she acted with the Holy Spirit inside her, she answered \\"if I had not, I was but a reprobate or cast awaye.\\" Anabaptists were especially feared because they claimed the authority of the Holy Spirit, and rejected other laws (like the M√ºnster rebellion which declared the establishment of a \\"kingdom of a thousand years\\"). Arrest and interrogation Anne Askew underwent two \\"examinations\\" before she was finally burned at the stake for heresy. On 10 March 1545, the aldermen of London ordered for her to be detained under the Six Articles Act. Askew stood trial before the \\"quest\\", which was an official heresy hearing commission. She was then cross examined by the chancellor of the Bishop of London, Edmund Bonner. He ordered that she be imprisoned for 12 days. During this time she refused to make any sort of confession. Her cousin Brittany was finally allowed to visit her after the 12 days to bail her out. On 19 June 1546, Askew was, yet again, locked away in prison. She was then subject to a two-day-long period of cross examination led by Chancellor Sir Thomas Wriothesley, Stephen Gardiner (The Bishop of Winchester), John Dudley, and Sir William Paget (the king's principal secretary). They threatened her with execution, but she still refused to confess or to name fellow Protestants. She was then ordered to be tortured. Her torturers did so, probably motivated by the desire for Askew to admit that Queen Catherine was also a practicing Protestant. According to her own account, and that of gaolers within the Tower, she was tortured only once. She was taken from her cell, at about ten o'clock in the morning, to the lower room of the White Tower. She was shown the rack and asked if she would name those who believed as she did. Askew declined to name anyone at all, so she was asked to remove all her clothing except her shift. Askew then climbed onto the rack, and her wrists and ankles were fastened. Again, she was asked for names, but she would say nothing. The wheel of the rack was turned, pulling Askew along the device and lifting her so that she was held taut about 5 inches above its bed and slowly stretched. In her own account written from prison, Askew said she fainted from pain, and was lowered and revived. This procedure was repeated twice. Sir Anthony Kingston, then Constable of the Tower of London, refused to carry on torturing her, left the tower, and sought a meeting with the king at his earliest convenience to explain his position and also to seek his pardon, which the king granted. Wriothesley and Rich set to work themselves. They turned the handles so hard that Anne was drawn apart, her shoulders and hips were pulled from their sockets and her elbows and knees were dislocated. Askew's cries could be heard in the garden next to the White Tower where the Lieutenant's wife and daughter were walking. Askew gave no names, and her ordeal ended when the Lieutenant ordered her to be returned to her cell. Execution Anne Askew was burned at the stake at Smithfield, London, aged 24, on 16 July 1546, with John Lascelles, Nicholas Belenian and John Adams.Foxe's Book of Martyrs: 210. The Martyrdom of John Lacels, John Adams, and Nicholas Belenian She was carried to execution in a chair wearing just her shift, as she could not walk and every movement caused her severe pain. She was dragged from the chair to the stake which had a small seat attached to it, on which she sat astride. Chains were used to bind her body firmly to the stake at the ankles, knees, waist, chest and neck. Those who saw her execution were impressed by her bravery, and reported that she did not scream until the flames reached her chest . Prior to their death, the prisoners were offered one last chance at pardon. Bishop Shaxton mounted the pulpit and began to preach to them. His words were in vain, however. Askew listened attentively throughout his discourse. When he spoke anything she considered to be the truth, she audibly expressed agreement; but when he said anything contrary to what she believed Scripture stated, she exclaimed: \\"There he misseth, and speaketh without the book.\\" Legacy Askew wrote a first- person account of her ordeal and her beliefs, which was published as The Examinations by John Bale, and later in John Foxe's Acts and Monuments of 1563, which proclaims her as a Protestant martyr. The story of Askew's martyrdom was thus written into the Protestant hagiography; but as MacCulloch comments, it is written under a version of her unmarried name (which he attributes to some embarrassment over her desertion of her husband Kyme). MacCulloch notes that Robert Parsons picked up on this aspect of the story. John Bale and John Foxe's writings on Askew are the most well-known accounts of her life, but a closer look at their writing causes some critics to question whether these editors help or hurt readers' understanding of Anne Askew. John Bale was the first to publish any work commemorating Askew's life, and he claimed to have solely taken Askew's writings and added only a preface and notes; but critics Thomas S. Freeman and Sarah Elizabeth Wall contest this claim (1169). It is unlikely that Bale invented the entire text, but they find that certain quotes within Askew's narrative have a Baleian tone (1169), and some sections may have been deleted (1170). The exacts are unknown, but Bale seems to have made considerable changes to the account. They also point out that Bale's work has imposed a misogynistic (or adverse towards women) misreading on the narrative. Askew is a woman who is remembered for taking a stand against the church's oppression, but Bale insists on her being a \\"weak vessel of the lord\\" (1166). Her narrative clearly disproves this, and shows that she was an educated woman who actively fought and challenged male control. Because of these criticisms, some argue that Askew's story is improved if read independently of Bale's notes and additions in order to understand her legacy without the distraction of an intrusive author (1167). Foxe's translation and interpretation are often considered an improvement from Bale's original. He eliminated Bale's notes and frames the story more around Askew's narrative (1167). But Foxe also took some artistic liberties by altering language to make certain allusions more obvious (1171) and breaking the narrative into paragraphs (1177). Critics have noted six clear Biblical citation errors within the work (1171); and Foxe also added new information that may have become known through eyewitnesses coming forward with new details, but the exact sources are unclear (1185). While Bale is criticized and Foxe is often commended for doing a better job with capturing her narrative, it is important to point out the accuracy issues of the two texts principally responsible for Askew's legacy. It is also important to notice the impact that Bale and Foxe had on the overall reputation of martyrs of the 16th century; with Anne Askew serving as a prime example. While Askew was writing her accounts of her arrests and trial, she used strategies other men were using at this time, such as John Lascelles (Hickerson, 2006, 53). She stayed silent, did not give up her allies, and stayed true to her faith. Although, other men were doing this at the same time, Askew was highly criticized for doing so and was portrayed as a weak woman. Bale also saw this as a chance to add his thoughts and comments to her published writing to make it more legitimate in the eyes of the people (Hickerson, 2006, 56-58). Her criticism and Bale's comments changed her impact on the Protestant Reformation movement. Examinations Anne Askew's autobiographical and published Examinations chronicle her persecution and offer a unique look into sixteenth century femininity, religion, and faith. Her writing is revolutionary because it deviates completely from what we think and expect from \\"Tudor women or, more specifically, Tudor women martyrs\\" (51). It depicts her confrontations with male authority figures of the time who challenged every aspect of life: from her progressive divorce, which she initiated, to her religious beliefs, which set her apart in England as a devout Protestant woman. Her ability to avoid indictment in 1545 points to what Paula McQuade calls Askew's \\"real brilliance\\", showing \\"her being familiar enough with English law to attempt to use the system to her benefit\\" (52). While her Examinations are a rare record of her experiences as a woman in Tudor England, they also show her unique position in this world as an educated woman. Not only was she able to write down her experiences, she was also able to correspond with select learned men of the time, such as John Lascelles and Dr. Edward Crome who was also arrested for heresy. As stated above, Askew's Examinations are imperfect and were altered by John Bale and John Foxe, but read as they were originally intended, Anne Askew's writing is one of the most important autobiographical accounts of 16th century religious turmoil we have to date, and is a testament to her intelligence and outstanding bravery. In popular culture In the episode \\"Secrets of the Heart\\" of the television series The Tudors, Askew is played by Emma Stansfield. She is executed alone, with the gunpowder that hastens her death secretly supplied by Anne Seymour, Countess of Hertford, played by Emma Hamilton.

The 22nd Regiment of Foot was raised by the Duke of Norfolk in 1689 and was able to boast an independent existence of over 300 years. The regiment was expanded in 1881 as part of the Childers Reforms by the linking of the 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment of Foot and the militia and rifle volunteers of Cheshire. The title 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment continued to be used within the regiment. On 1 September 2007, the Cheshire Regiment was merged with the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot) and the Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's) to form a new large regiment, the Mercian Regiment, becoming the 1st Battalion, Mercian Regiment. History =Early wars= Henry Howard, Duke of Norfolk, founder of the regiment Soldier of 22nd regiment, 1742 Following the 1688 Glorious Revolution and the exile of James II, Henry Howard, Duke of Norfolk, raised a regiment at Chester on behalf of the new regime.Cannon, p. 1 The experience of the 1638-1652 Wars of the Three Kingdoms meant many considered standing armies a danger to individual liberties and a threat to society itself. Until the mid-18th century, regiments were considered the property of their Colonel, changed names when transferred and were disbanded as soon as possible. In September 1689, Sir Henry Belasyse became Colonel and as Belasyse's Regiment of Foot, the unit went to Ireland as part of an Anglo-Dutch force commanded by Frederick Schomberg. When inspected at Dundalk in October 1689, it was reported as having '...hardly any good officers and an entire absence of good order...but Belasyse expected to work reforms.' During the 1689-1691 Williamite War in Ireland, it fought at The Boyne, Aughrim, and the Second Siege of Limerick that ended the war in August 1691. The regiment was transferred to Flanders in October, where it spent the rest of the Nine Years War, fighting at the Battle of Landen in 1693 and during the 1695 Allied siege of Namur. After the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick, the Tory majority in Parliament was determined to reduce costs and by 1699, the English military was less than 7,000 men. However, England, Ireland and Scotland were then separate entities with their own Parliaments and funding; Belasyse's Regiment of Foot avoided disbandment by being transferred onto the Irish military establishment. On the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1701, the regiment was posted to Jamaica; this was a notoriously unhealthy location and Sir Henry Belasyse transferred his Colonelcy to William Selwyn. The regiment spent the next twelve years in the West Indies; soon after arrival in April 1702, Selwyn died and was replaced by Thomas Handasyd, both as Colonel and Governor of Jamaica. Thomas returned to England and was succeeded as Colonel by his son Roger Handasyd in 1712, a position he retained until 1730. In 1726, the regiment was posted to Menorca, where it remained for the next 22 years,Cannon, p. 6 although a detachment was present at the Battle of Dettingen in June 1743, during the War of the Austrian Succession. By 1751, the regiment had become the 22nd Regiment of Foot.Cannon, p. 7 In 1758, it took part in the Siege of Louisbourg in French Canada.Cannon, p. 8 The regiment also took part in General Wolfe's victory over the French at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in September 1759.Cannon, p. 9 They then took part in the conclusive three pronged attack against Montr√©al which capitulated in September 1760. The regiment received two battle honours for taking part in the capture of Martinique and the British expedition against Cuba during 1762.Cannon, p. 10 =American Revolutionary War= The regiment was sent to North America for service in the American Revolutionary War in 1775.Cannon, p. 12 Lieutenant Colonel James Abercrombie, commanding the regiment, embarked in advance of the rest of the regiment at the request of General Thomas Gage and arrived in Boston just before the Battle of Bunker Hill, where he was killed in action. The regiment later evacuated from Boston to Halifax and then took part in the New York and New Jersey campaign of 1776. The Battalion Companies participated in the Battle of Rhode Island in August 1778Cannon, p. 14 and then returned to New York City in 1779; the bulk of the regiment remained there until the end of the War.Cannon, p. 15 Although the County designation existed as early as 1772, the regiment was retitled the 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment of Foot in 1782. =French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars= The regiment deployed to the West Indies in September 1793, where it took part in expeditions against Martinique, Saint Lucia, Guadeloupe, and Saint-Domingue.Cannon, p. 17 In January 1800 the regiment was posted to South Africa,Cannon, p. 19 before moving to India. There it suffered heavy losses during the assault on Bhurtpore in 1805.Cannon, p. 21 In 1810, the regiment took part in the occupation of Mauritius.Cannon, p. 23 =The Victorian era= The regiment took part in the Battle of Meeanee in February 1843, the Battle of Hyderabad in March 1843 and the conquest of Sindh in summer 1843 during further Indian service.Cannon, p. 32 The regiment was not fundamentally affected by the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, which gave it a depot at Chester Castle from 1873, or by the Childers reforms of 1881 ‚Äì as it already possessed two battalions, there was no need for it to amalgamate with another regiment. The depot was the 18th Brigade Depot from 1873 to 1881, and the 22nd Regimental District depot thereafter Under the reforms the regiment became The Cheshire Regiment on 1 July 1881. The reforms added the following units: 1st Royal Cheshire Light Infantry Militia, 2nd Royal Cheshire Militia, 1st Cheshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, 2nd (Earl of Chester's) Cheshire RVC, 3rd Cheshire RVC, 4th Cheshire (Cheshire and Derbyshire) RVC, and the 5th Cheshire RVC. Its recruiting area was confirmed as being the County of Cheshire. Memorial in Chester Cathedral to the men of the Cheshire Regiment who died in South Africa Both battalions of the regiment served in Burma between 1887 and 1891, while the 2nd Battalion saw active service in South Africa from 1900 to 1902, during the Second Boer War. After the end of the war, 376 officers and men of the battalion returned home in October 1902, and were stationed at Aldershot. The 3rd (Militia) battalion was also embodied for active duty in South Africa, with 450 men reported as returning home after the end of the war in September 1902. In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had one Reserve and four Territorial battalions.These were the 3rd Battalion (Special Reserve), with the 4th Battalion at Grange Road West in Birkenhead, the 5th Battalion at Volunteer Street in Chester, the 6th Battalion at the Stockport Armoury and the 7th Battalion at Bridge Street in Macclesfield (all Territorial Force). =First World War= Albert-Bapaume road at Ovillers-la-Boisselle, July 1916 during the Battle of the Somme.

The regiment was deployed to Cyprus and to Egypt in 1951 and to Malaya in 1957. It was posted to Abercorn Barracks in Ballykinler in 1960 and to Buller Barracks in M√ºnster in 1962. While in Munster the regiment was deployed to Cyprus under UN command for six months from October 1964 to April 1965. The regiment moved to Netheravon in Wiltshire for six months in 1966 and then went to Warminster as Demonstration Battalion. The regiment moved to Weeton Barracks in 1968; during the latter part of 1968 the regiment was deployed to Bahrain for nine months, and was then sent to Derry in Northern Ireland at the start of the Troubles in 1970. In December 1970, the regiment was posted to Berlin for two years. The regiment returned to Weeton barracks in 1972 but undertook further tours in the Province throughout the 1970s. The regiment moved to Elizabeth Barracks in Minden in 1977. In 1978, Mike Dauncey was appointed Colonel Commandant and in 1979 the regiment moved to Tidworth. The regiment became the resident regiment at Shackleton Barracks in Ballykelly in 1980 and in 1982; eight soldiers from the Cheshires were killed in the Droppin Well bombing. The regiment then spent two years, from 1984 to 1986, in Hong Kong. Between 1986 and 1988, the regiment was posted to Caterham Barracks as a public duties battalion and in 1988 it moved to Dale Barracks in Chester. The regiment was posted to St Barbara's Barracks at Fallingbostel in 1991. It became the first Armoured Infantry unit to deploy to Bosnia on Operation Grapple 1, as part of 7th Armoured Brigade, on United Nations peace keeping duties to the former Yugoslavia in 1992. Then, after a period at Oakington Barracks between 1993 and 1996, it returned to Shackleton Barracks. It went to Beachley Barracks, near Chepstow in 1998 and to Alexander Barracks in Dhekelia in 2000. It returned to Kiwi Barracks at Bulford Camp in 2002 and was deployed to Iraq (Operation Telic 4) in 2004 before being sent back to Abercorn Barracks in 2005. =Amalgamation= The Cheshire Regiment was one of five line infantry regiments never to have been amalgamated in its history. It shared this claim with The Royal Scots, The Green Howards, The Royal Welch Fusiliers and The King's Own Scottish Borderers. In 2004, as a part of the reorganisation of the infantry, it was announced that the Cheshire Regiment would be amalgamated with the Staffordshire Regiment and the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment to form the new Mercian Regiment. In August 2007, the regiment became the 1st Battalion, the Mercian Regiment. Regimental museum The Cheshire Military Museum is based at Chester Castle.

Brewer invited local San Jose preacher (and Brewer's personal friend) Laurentine Hamilton to join his company on a trek to a nearby summit. Nearing completion of their journey, Hamilton, in good humor, bounded for the summit ahead of the rest of the men and claimed his stake. In fact, Brewer suggested the mountain be named after Hamilton, only after Whitney declined to have the mountain named after him (a different mountain was later named Mount Whitney). The Spanish name for Mt. Hamilton was the Sierra de Santa Isabel and the highest point was originally known as Mount Isabel instead of Mount Hamilton. William Henry Brewer and his fellow geologist, Charles F. Hoffmann, did not know it already had a name, and named it Mt. Hamilton, although they did place Isabel Valley on their map to the east. The \\"Hotel Santa Ysabel\\" was built on the road up the mountain in 1885 on Smith Creek. When in 1895, the USGS realized that the peak two miles southeast of Mt. Hamilton was as tall (), they named it Mt. Isabel.  Climate  Numerous times each winter temperatures drop low enough for Mount Hamilton (left) to receive as much as a foot of snow for a day or two. These mountains are high enough to receive snowfall in the winter, perhaps up to a dozen times. Occasionally, when a cold, wet storm comes in from the Gulf of Alaska or Canada, Mt. Hamilton and the surrounding peaks get significant snowfall. In February 2001, of snow fell, and in March 2006, the peak was left with over a foot (30 cm) of snow in one night. The National Weather Service has had a cooperative weather station on the summit of Mount Hamilton almost since the time that the Lick Observatory opened. It has provided a glimpse of the extreme weather conditions that occur on the Diablo Range, especially in the winter months. Mt. Hamilton had a foot of snow on the ground on April 1, 1967 January is usually the coldest month on Mount Hamilton with an average high of and an average low of . The warmest month is usually July with an average high of and an average low of . Due to frequent thermal inversions during the summer, it is often warmer on Mount Hamilton than in San Jose. The record high temperature of was on August 5, 1978. The record low temperature of was on December 21, 1990. The average days with highs of or higher is 4.3 days. The average days with lows of or lower is 50.6 days. Annual precipitation averages . Measurable rainfall occurs on an average of 71.9 days each year. The most rainfall in a month was in February 1998; no rainfall has been common during the summer months. The maximum rainfall in 24 hours was on December 23, 1955. Annual snowfall averages . The maximum snowfall in a year was in 1955. The maximum snowfall in a month was in February 2019. The 24-hour maximum snowfall of occurred on February 18, 1990. The deepest daily snow depth was in March 1976. Measurable snow has been recorded in every month from November through June. Geography =Copernicus Peak= Mount Hamilton is one summit along a mile-long ridge. Other than Hamilton, peaks along the ridge have astronomical names, such as Kepler. The highest peak on the ridge is Copernicus Peak, with elevation . Copernicus Peak is located to the northeast from Mount Hamilton, and is the highest point in Santa Clara County. Unlike Mount Hamilton's limited prominence, Copernicus Peak has a prominence of . = Mount Hamilton Road = State Route 130 begins its ascent from the junction at Alum Rock Road. The sinuous Mt. Hamilton Road (part of State Route 130) is commonly used by bicyclists and motorcyclists. Built in 1875‚Äì76 in anticipation of the observatory, and the need to carry materials and equipment up the mountain in horse-drawn wagons, the grade seldom exceeds 6.5 percent. The road rises over in three long climbs from San Jose to the mountain top. On a clear day at the summit it is possible to see the Sierra Nevada. Mt. Hamilton Road is popular with cycling clubs. Cyclists commonly use the road because of the long but not overly challenging nature of the climb, sparse vehicular traffic over most of its length, and the views of San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley below. There is an annual cycling challenge climb in April. Thanksgiving consistently draws hundreds of cyclists and is frequently the final climb in the annual Low-Key Hillclimb Series which attracts some of the region's best climbers. The bicycle ride is just over from the Alum Rock Avenue junction. The upward trek is interrupted by two descents, first into Grant Ranch County Park, and again to cross Smith Creek. Quimby Road offers a shorter way from San Jose to Grant Ranch, but is considerably steeper. The main observatory building offers free 15-minute guided tours of the Great Lick refracting telescope.  Geology and hydrology  Much of the foothill slopes of Mount Hamilton is underlain by Miocene age sandstone of the Briones formation: this bedrock is locally soft and weathered in the upper few feet, but grades locally to very hard at depth. Depth to groundwater on these foothill areas of Mount Hamilton is approximately .C.

The Babb Creek drainage comprises some of the watershed draining the slopes of Mount Hamilton. The Calaveras and Hayward active earthquake faults traverse the slopes of Mount Hamilton. Tule elk roam the Diablo Range and are often seen on Coyote Ridge Ecology and conservation Several rare species can be seen on Mount Hamilton. The Mount Hamilton jewelflower (Streptanthus callistus) is endemic to the area. In June 2011, five juvenile California condors flew over Mt. Hamilton and landed on the Lick Observatory, the species' first sighting in the area in at least 30 years. In 1978, California Department of Fish and Game warden Henry Coletto urged the department to choose the Mount Hamilton area as one of California's relocation sites under a new statewide effort to restore tule elk (Cervus canadensis ssp. nannodes).

The Times, page 96, 26 June 2010. was an English musician, artist and author. He was a founding member and the original bass guitarist for the Kinks, from 1963 until 1969. He also sang backing vocals on some of their records. Quaife founded a group known as the Ravens in 1963 with brothers Ray and Dave Davies. In late 1963 or early 1964, they changed their name to the Kinks. The group scored several major international hits throughout the 1960s. Their early singles, including \\"You Really Got Me\\" and \\"All Day and All of the Night\\", have been cited as an early influence on the hard rock and heavy metal genres. In the band's early days, Quaife, who was generally regarded as the best-looking member, was often their spokesman.The Times obituary, 26 June 2010 He departed from the Kinks in 1969 and formed the band Mapleoak, which he left in April 1970. After retiring from the music business, Quaife resided in Denmark throughout the 1970s. He relocated to Belleville, Ontario in 1980, where he worked as a cartoonist and artist. He was diagnosed with kidney failure in 1998 and moved back to Denmark in 2005. Quaife died in June 2010 of kidney failure. The Kinks Quaife was born Peter Alexander Greenlaw Kinnes in Tavistock, Devon, to Joan Mary Kilby, who became pregnant during the war after an affair with an American serviceman.Rogan 2015, p. 59 Kilby returned to London with her son, where she married Stanley Melville Quaife in 1947, who gave his surname to the young Peter. Quaife attended Coldfall Primary School in Muswell Hill and later William Grimshaw School (now Fortismere School where a plaque has been erected to his memory by his brother David Quaife and Penny Toumazou). After a brief period studying commercial art, he formed the Kinks in 1962 along with school friend Ray Davies and subsequently asked Ray's brother Dave Davies to join. The band was originally called the Ravens and performed rhythm and blues at local venues such as the Hornsey Recreation Club at Crouch End Secondary School. The 'Kinks' name came about only upon the signing of a recording contract in late 1963. The Kinks became a top chart act throughout the world beginning with their third single, 1964's \\"You Really Got Me\\". Quaife was commonly the voice of the band in early press interviews. In June 1966, he was seriously injured in a car crash, which left him unable to perform. He later said that he had enjoyed the time off from the band, as he was sick of the conflict which was constant. John Dalton replaced him, as Quaife resigned from the band as a result of his hospitalisation, but Quaife reconsidered and returned in November 1966. For the next two years Quaife played on albums such as Something Else by the Kinks and The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, and helped rehearse some songs on the album Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). Quaife left the Kinks permanently in April 1969, but the others did not at first believe him, and only realised his intention when they saw an article in a music paper revealing Quaife's new band. Ray Davies asked him to change his mind and stay, but without success. He was again replaced on bass, this time permanently, by Dalton. Mapleoak After leaving the Kinks, Quaife founded a new band, the country/rock outfit, Mapleoak. The group's name derived from the heritage of its members: the 'Maple' represented the two Canadian members of the group. Singer-songwriters Stan Endersby (born 17 July 1947, in Lachine, Quebec, Canada) and Marty Fisher (born 24 December 1945, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada), while the 'Oak' represented British members Quaife and drummer Mick Cook. Quaife had contacts in Denmark, so the group gigged heavily there and in the UK during most of 1969 and early 1970. Cook left the band in June 1969, and was replaced by another Canadian: Gordon MacBain (born 5 August 1947, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada), who would write most of the group's original material. Mapleoak released their first single, \\"Son of a Gun\\", in April 1970 but it failed to chart. Quaife then left both the band and the music industry. He subsequently moved to Denmark, and did not appear on Mapleoak's only album, which was released in 1971. 1980s and 1990s Quaife never fully returned to the music world as a professional performer. In 1980, he relocated to Belleville, Ontario, Canada to work as a graphic artist. In 1981, he made his only post 1960s concert appearance with the Kinks, playing bass in an encore number at a show in Toronto. Along with the original Kinks, Quaife was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. At the ceremony in New York City, Quaife jammed on stage with the other musicians being honoured that year. Quaife was an active amateur astronomer and was known as a capable astro-photographer who enjoyed the dark skies of The Bay of Quinte area in Ontario, Canada. He was a member of the RASC, Royal Astronomical Society of Canada and encouraged many people in the science of astronomy. Quaife was diagnosed with kidney failure in 1998. During dialysis sessions, he drew a series of cartoons based on his experiences. Following their enthusiastic reception by other patients, they were subsequently published in book form as The Lighter Side of Dialysis (Jazz Communications, Toronto, 2004). Though he was invariably known as 'Pete' during his time with the Kinks, Quaife's books are published under the name 'Peter Quaife'. In 1996, in an interview for Goldmine Magazine, the Who's John Entwistle was asked who his favourite bassist was, he responded: \\"I'd say one of my favourite bass players was Pete Quaife because he literally drove the Kinks along\\". Entwistle was not the only musician that thought well of Quaife. Thomas Kitts writes that in early 1966, Eric Clapton invited Quaife to join a band that would eventually become Cream. 21st century At the time of his death Quaife had no formal association with the Kinks, but still enthusiastically talked of his time in the band, and made appearances at fan gatherings. During a Kinks Meeting in Utrecht, Netherlands, in September 2004, he read excerpts from Veritas, his fictional account of a 1960s rock group. He also joined in with the Kast Off Kinks on a few songs. Quaife lived in Canada for more than two decades, but he moved back to Denmark in 2005 after his marriage ended in divorce, to live with his girlfriend Elisabeth Bilbo, whom he had known since she was a 19-year-old Kinks fan. At the time of his death, they had become engaged to marry. In 2005, Quaife was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame with Kinks, marking the final reunion of the four original band members. In December 2007, Record Collector published an interview with Ray Davies, in which he was quoted as saying, \\"I spoke to Quaife about a month ago and he dearly wants to make another record with me\\". The tabloid press picked up on this quote, and turned it into a story saying that the Kinks were reforming for a tour in 2008. However, in an interview aired on the Biography Channel in December 2008, Quaife flatly said he would never participate in any type of Kinks reunion. In March 2009, Quaife released a statement that he was permanently retiring from the public eye. =Death= Quaife, who had been receiving kidney dialysis for more than ten years, died on 23 June 2010, aged 66. Two days after Quaife's death, Dave Davies posted a statement on his message board expressing his deep sorrow over the death of his former bandmate and lauding him for his friendship, personality, talent, and contributions to the Kinks' sound. He stated that Quaife \\"was never really given the credit he deserved for his contribution and involvement [with the Kinks]\\". Ray Davies dedicated his 27 June performance at the Glastonbury Festival to him and performed several Quaife-era Kinks songs in tribute to him. Davies told the crowd, \\"I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for him\\", and was visibly close to tears as he sang the opening line to \\"Days\\".Note: this paragraph is copied from the \\"Solo work and potential reunion (1997‚Äìpresent)\\" section on the Wikipedia article for the Kinks Mick Avory said that Quaife's decision to leave was a shame, adding it \\"made a big difference\\" to the band. =Veritas= Quaife's book, Veritas, Volume I, which he had been trying to get published for years, was finally published posthumously in February 2011. The book tells the story of a fictitious 1960s band based largely on Quaife's experiences with the Kinks.

Whereas the main story of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED focuses on the struggles between the Earth Alliance, ZAFT, and Orb Union, the Astray series is focused on the three MBF-P0x mobile suit prototypes (however mainly on Lowe Guele) and their respective pilots and organizations, who mainly exist on the outskirts of the main SEED storyline. The MBF-P02 Astray Red Frame is piloted by Lowe Guele of the Junk Guild, and the MBF-P03 Astray Blue Frame is piloted by Gai Murakumo of the mercenary group Serpent Tail. The third Astray, MBF-P01 Astray Gold Frame, is piloted by the primary antagonist of the Astray story, Orb nobleman Rondo Ghina Sahaku, and later by his twin sister Rondo Mina Sahaku. Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Astray R follows the adventures of the Red Frame's pilot Lowe and his Junk Guild associates and interlocks with the events of the original Astray-series. Both Astray and Astray R are available in the US from Tokyopop. Mobile Suit Gundam SEED: Astray B follows Gai Murakumo and his fellow Serpent Tail mercenaries. It was released in Dengeki Hobby modelling magazine as a \\"photo novel\\" (illustrations using custom-built plastic models accompanied by text), and it is highly unlikely it will make it over to the US. In addition to Astray R and Astray B, there is another Astray manga series. Gundam SEED X Astray is about Canard Pars, who is a failed experiment from the Ultimate Coordinator program. Canard is searching for Kira Yamato, the successful Ultimate Coordinator, so that he can defeat him and prove he was not a \\"failure\\". During his search, he fights anyone he comes across. This brings him into conflict with Lowe Guele and the Junk Guild. Lowe Guele and the Junk Guild find a young boy named Prayer Reverie, who has with him a powerful ZAFT prototype mobile suit, the YMF-X000A Dreadnought, which was built on a heavily modified GuAIZ frame and was the testbed for the DRAGOON (Disconnected Rapid Armament Group Overlook Operation Network) system of the ZGMF-X13A Providence. The sequel to this series is Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Astray, followed by Mobile Suit Gundam SEED VS Astray. Anime As a promotion to the Astray line of products, two 6-minute anime shorts were produced in 2004, one featuring Lowe Guele and the Junk Guild crew, and the other featuring Gai Murakumo and the Serpent Tail.

The Roman Governor in Syria, Varus is reported by Josephus - perhaps in an exaggeration, since archaeology has failed to verify traces of the conflagration - to have burnt the city down, and sold its inhabitants into slavery.Eric M. Meyers,'Sepphoris on the Eve of the Great Revolt (67‚Äì68 C.E.): Archaeology and Josephus,' in Eric M. Meyers,Galilee Through the Centuries: Confluence of Cultures, Eisenbrauns, 1999 pp.109ff., p. 114:(Josephus, Ant. 17.271-87; War 2.56‚Äì69). After Herod's son, Herod Antipas was made tetrarch, or governor, he proclaimed the city's new name to be Autocratoris, and rebuilt it as the \\"Ornament of the Galilee\\" (Josephus, Ant. 18.27).Steve Mason (ed.) Flavius Josephus: Translation and Commentary. Judean war. Vol. 1B. 2,BRILL 2008 p. 138. The meaning of 'autocrator' is not clear, and may denote either autonomy or reference to a Roman emperor. An ancient route linking Sepphoris to Legio, and further south to Samaria-Sebastia, is believed to have been paved by the Romans around this time.Richardson, 1996, p. 133 The new population was loyal to Rome. Maurice Casey writes that, although Sepphoris during the early first century was \\"a very Jewish city\\", some of the people there did speak ancient Greek. A lead weight dated to the first century bears an inscription in Greek with three Jewish names. Several scholars have suggested that Jesus, while working as a craftsman in Nazareth, may have travelled to Sepphoris for work purposes, possibly with his father and brothers.Craig A. Evans (ed.), The Routledge Encyclopedia of the Historical Jesus, Routledge (2010),2014 pp.37,296. Casey states that this is entirely possible, but is likewise impossible to historically verify. Jesus does not seem to have visited Sepphoris during his public ministry and none of the sayings recorded in the Synoptic Gospels mention it. The inhabitants of Sepphoris did not join the revolt against Roman rule of 66 CE. The Roman legate in Syria, Cestius Gallus, killed some 2,000 \\"brigands and rebels\\" in the area.Cohen, 2002, p. 195 The Jerusalemite Josephus, a son of Jerusalem's priestly elite had been sent north to recruit the Galilee into the rebellion's fold, but was only partially successful. He made two attempts to capture Sepphoris, but failed to conquer it, the first time because of fierce resistance, the second because a garrison came to assist in the city's defence.Cohen, 2002, p. 152 Around the time of the rebellion Sepphoris had a Roman theater ‚Äì in later periods, bath-houses and mosaic floors depicting human figures. Sepphoris and Jerusalem may be seen to symbolize a cultural divide between those that sought to avoid any contact with the surrounding Roman culture and those who within limits, were prepared to adopt aspects of that culture. Rejected by Sepphoris and forced to camp outside the city Josephus went on to Jotapata, which did seem interested in the rebellion, ‚Äì the Siege of Yodfat ended on 20 July 67 CE. Towns and villages that did not rebel were spared and in Galilee they were the majority.Searching for Exile, Truth or Myth?, Ilan Ziv's film, screened on BBCFour, 3 November 2013 Coins minted in the city at the time of the Great Revolt carried the inscription Neronias and Eirenopolis, \\"City of Peace\\". After the revolt, coins bore depictions of laurel wreaths, palm trees, caduceuses and ears of barley, which appear on Jewish coinage albeit not exclusively.The Myth of a Gentile Galilee, Mark A. Chancey Remains of Zippori synagogue Just prior to the Bar Kokhba revolt, the city's name was changed to Diocaesarea in Hadrian's time, in honor of Zeus and the Roman emperor. Following the revolt in 132‚Äì135, many Jewish refugees from devastated Judea settled there, turning it into a center of Jewish religious and spiritual life.1,700-year-old Burial Inscriptions Found at Northern Israel Site, Haaretz Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi, the compiler of the Mishnah, a commentary on the Torah, moved to Sepphoris, along with the Sanhedrin, the highest Jewish religious court. Before moving to Tiberias by 150, some Jewish academies of learning, yeshivot, were also based there. The Galilee was predominantly populated by Jews from the end of the 2nd century to the 4th century CE.Mordecai Avian, 'Distribution Maps of Archaeological data from the Galilee, in J√ºrgen Zangenberg, Harold W. Attridge, Dale B. Martin,(eds.) Religion, Ethnicity, and Identity in Ancient Galilee Mohr Siebeck 2007 pp. 115‚Äì132, p. 132. As late as the third-fourth centuries, Sepphoris is believed to have been settled by one of the twenty-four priestly courses, Jedayah by name, a course mentioned in relation to the town itself in both the Jerusalem Talmud (Taanit 4:5) and in the Caesarea Inscription. (Hebrew) Others, however, cast doubt about Sepphoris ever being under a \\"priestly oligarchy\\" by the third century, and that it may simply reflect a misreading of Talmudic sources.Stuart S. Miller, 'Priests, Purities, and the Jews of Galilee,' in J√ºrgen Zangenberg, Harold W. Attridge, Dale B. Martin, (eds.) Ethnicity, and Identity in Ancient Galilee Mohr Siebeck 2007 pp. 375‚Äì401, pp.379‚Äì382. Aside from being a center of spiritual and religious studies, it developed into a busy metropolis for commerce due to its proximity to important trade routes through Galilee. Hellenistic and Jewish influences seemed blended together in daily town life while each group, Jewish, pagan and Christian, maintained its distinct identity.J√ºrgen Zangenberg, Harold W. Attridge, Dale B. Martin, (eds.) Ethnicity, and Identity in Ancient Galilee Mohr Siebeck 2007 pp.9, 438. In the aftermath of the Jewish revolt against Constantius Gallus of 351‚Äì352, Diocaesarea, the epicenter of the revolt, was razed.Bernard Lazare and Robert Wistrich, Antisemitism: Its History and Causes, University of Nebraska Press, 1995, . Diocaesarea was further affected by the Galilee earthquake of 363, but rebuilt soon afterwards, and retained its importance in the greater Jewish community of the Galilee, both socially, commercially, and spiritually. Ancient water system The town was also the center of a Christian bishopric. Three of its early bishops are known by name: Dorotheus (mentioned in 451), Marcellinus (mentioned in 518), and Cyriacus (mentioned in 536).Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 454Konrad Eubel, Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi, vol. 4, p. 175Raymond Janin, v. 2. Dioc√©sar√©e, in Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de G√©ographie eccl√©siastiques, vol. XIV, Paris 1960, coll. 493.494 As a diocese that is no longer residential, it is listed in the Annuario Pontificio among titular sees.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ), p. 881Names of its titular bishop from the 18th to the 20th century can be found at GCatholic.com In the centuries between the rule of Herod Antipas and the end of the Byzantine era, (7th century), the city reportedly thrived as a center of learning, with a diverse, multiethnic and multireligious population of some 30,000 living in relatively peaceful coexistence. =Early Muslim period= Arab and other Islamic dynasties controlled the city, with an interlude during the Crusades, from the 630s and up until World War I. Throughout this period of time, the city was known by the Semitic name Saffuriya.Chancey, 2005, p. 102 The 9th-century Islamic scholar Ya'qubi noted that Saffuriyyah was taken during the first conquest by the Arab armies in Palestine.le Strange, 1890, p.32 in 634.Khalidi, 1992, p. 351. Later, the city was incorporated into the expanding Umayyad Caliphate, and al-jund coins were minted by the new rulers.Aubin, 2000, p. 12 A stone-built aqueduct dating to the early Umayyad period (7th century CE) has been excavated.Berger and Barzilai, 2013, Nahal Zippori 23 Saffuriya was engaged in trade with other parts of the empire at the time; for example, cloaks made in Saffuriyya were worn by people in Medina.Crone, 2004, p. 102 Umayyad rule was replaced by Abbasid rule. =Crusader/Ayyubid and Mamluk periods= At the end of the 11th century, the Crusaders invaded the region and established the Crusader states, with the Kingdom of Jerusalem replacing the Islamic rule over Saffuriya. During the Crusader period, Sephoris/Saffuriya changed hands several times. The Crusaders built a fort and watchtower atop the hill, overlooking the town,Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, pp. 335-338Pringle, 1997, p. 92 and a church dedicated to Saint Anne, the mother of the Virgin Mary.Pringle, 1998, pp. 209-210 This became one of their local bases in the kingdom, and the town was called in or Sephoris. In 1187, the field army of the Latin kingdom marched from their well-watered camp at Sephoris to be cut off and destroyed at the Battle of Hattin by the Ayyubid sultan, Saladin. In 1255, the village and its fortifications were back in Crusader hands, as a document from that year shows it belonged to the archbishop of Nazareth,R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, pp. 326-327, No 1242; cited in Pringle, 1998, p. 210 but by 1259, the bishop experienced unrest among the local Muslim farmers.R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 335, No 1280; cited in Pringle, 1998, p. 210 Saffuriyyah was captured between 1263 and 1266 by the Mamluk sultan Baybars. =Ottoman period= Safurieh 1859 Saffuriya (, also transliterated Safurriya and Suffurriye), came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire after it defeated the Mamluks at the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516. An Ottoman firman of 1572 describes Saffuriyya as one of a group of villages within the sanjak of Safad, which was part of the Qaysi faction, and that had rebelled against the Ottoman authorities.Heydn, 1960, pp. 83‚Äì84. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 269 In 1596, the population was recorded as consisting of 366 families and 34 bachelors, all Muslim. Saffuriyya was larger than neighboring Nazareth but smaller than Kafr Kanna. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, olive trees, goats and beehives, in addition to a press for olive oil or grape syrup and \\"occasional revenues\\"; a total of 31,244 ak√ße. 3/24 of the revenuer went to a Waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 188 A number of important scholars came from the village during this period,Khalidi, 1992, pp. 350‚Äì353 including the historian, poet and jurist al- Hasan al-Burini (d. 1615),Brockelmann, 1960, p. 1333 the qadi (head judge), al-Baq'a al-Saffuri (d. 1625) and the poet and qadi Ahmad al-Sharif (d. 1633). It is reported that in 1745 Zahir al-Umar, who grew up in the town,Pappe, Illan (2010) The Rise and Fall of a Palestinian Dynasty. The Husaynis 1700‚Äì1968. Saqi, . p. 35. built a fort on the hill overlooking Saffuriya. A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed the place, named as Safoureh.Karmon, 1960, p. 166 In the early 19th century, the British traveller J. Buckingham noted that all the inhabitants of Saffuriya were Muslim, and that the house of St. Anna had been completely demolished.Buckingham, 1821, pp. 90-91 In the late 19th century, Saffuriyya was described as village built of stone and mud, situated along the slope of a hill. The village contained the remains of the Church of St. Anna and a square tower, said to have been built in the mid-18th century. The village had an estimated 2,500 residents, who cultivated 150 faddans (1 faddan = 100‚Äì250 dunams), on some of this land they had planted olive trees.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, pp. 279 ‚àí280. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 351. A population list from about 1887 showed that Sepphoris had about 2,940 inhabitants; all Muslims.Schumacher, 1888, p. 182 In 1900, an elementary school for boys was founded, and later, a school for girls. Though it lost its centrality and importance as a cultural center under the Ottomans (1517‚Äì1918) and the British Mandate (1918‚Äì1948), the village thrived agriculturally. Saffuriyya's pomegranates, olives and wheat were famous throughout the Galilee. =British Mandate period= According to the British Mandate's 1922 census of Palestine, Saffuriyeh had 2,582 inhabitants; 2,574 Muslims and 8 Christians,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Nazareth, p. 38 where the Christians were all Roman Catholics.Barron, 1923, Table XVI, p. 51 By the 1931 census the population had increased to 3,147; 3,136 Muslims and 11 Christians, in a total of 747 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 76 In summer of 1931, archaeologist Leroy Waterman began the first excavations at Saffuriya, digging up part of the school playground, formerly the site of the Crusader fort. A local council was established in 1923. The expenditure of the council grew from 74 Palestine pound in 1929 to 1,217 in 1944. In the 1945 statistics, the population was 4,330; 4,320 Muslims and 10 Christians, and the total land area was 55,378 dunams. In 1944/45 a total of 21,841 dunams of village land was used for cereals, 5,310 dunams were irrigated or used for orchards, mostly olive trees,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 110 while 102 dunams were classified as built-up land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 160 By 1948, Saffuriya was the largest village in the Galilee both by land size and population. =State of Israel= The Arab village had a history of anti-Yishuv activities and supported the Arab Liberation Army during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. On 1 July 1948, the village was bombarded by Israeli aircraft.IIED, 1994, p. 95 On 16 July it was captured by Israeli forces along with the rest of the Lower Galilee in Operation Dekel. The villagers put up some resistance and managed to destroy several armoured cars in an ambush.O'Ballance, Edgar (1956) The Arab-Israeli War. 1948. Faber & Faber, London. p. 157. Following the collapse of the resistance, all but 80 of the villagers fled. Some made their way northwards toward Lebanon, finally settling there in the refugee camps of Ain al-Hilweh and Shatila and the adjacent Sabra neighborhood. Others fled south to Nazareth and the surrounding countryside. After the attack, the villagers returned but were evicted again in September 1948. On 7 January 1949, 14 residents were deported and the remaining 550 were resettled in neighboring Arab villages such as 'Illut. Many settled in Nazareth in a quarter now known as the al-Safafira quarter because of the large number of Saffuriyya natives living there. As the Israeli government considers them present absentee, they cannot go back to their old homes and have no legal recourse to recover them.Kacowicz and Lutomski, 2007, p. 140 The works of the poet Taha Muhammad Ali, a native of Saffuriyya expelled from the town, and their relationship to the landscape of Saffuriya before 1948 are the subject of Adina Hoffman's My Happiness Bears No Relation to Happiness (Yale University Press, 2009). The area remained under martial law until the general lifting of martial law in Israel in 1966. Most of the remains of Saffuriya were removed in a late-1960s program to clear depopulated Arab villages. The site of the Arab village was planted with pine trees. By 2011, five books about the Palestinian village history had been published.Davis, 2011, p. 30 On 20 February 1949, the Israeli moshav of Tzippori was founded southeast of the older village. The pomegranate and olive trees were replaced with crops for cattle fodder.Benvenisti, 2002, p. 216 Archaeological park Offering of fruits and grains held in a Roman cornucopia, Nile House mosaics =Crusader tower= The Crusader fortress on the hill overlooking the Roman theater was built in the 12th century on the foundation of an earlier Byzantine structure. The fortress is a large square structure, 15m x15m, and approximately 10 m. high. The lower portion of the building consists of reused antique spolia, including a sarcophagus with decorative carvings. The upper part of the structure and the doorway were added by Zahir al-Umar in the 18th century. Noticeable features from the rebuilding are the rounded corners which are similar to those constructed under Zahir in the fort in Shefa-'Amr. The upper part of the building was used as a school during the reign of Abdul Hamid II in the early 1900s (late Ottoman era), and used for this purpose until 1948.Petersen, 2001, pp. 269-270 =Roman and Byzantine city= Much of the town has been excavated, revealing Jewish homes along a main cobblestone street. Several images have been found carved into the stones of the street, including that of a menorah, and another image that resembles some ancient game reminiscent of tic-tac-toe. Stepped pools have been uncovered throughout Sepphoris, and it is generally believed that these may well have been used as Mikva'ot, Jewish ritual baths.Stuart S. Millar, 'Review Essay: Roman Imperialism, Jewish Self-Definition, and Rabbinic Society,' AJS 31:2 (2007), 329‚Äì362 DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000566 pp.340-341, with notes 24,25. =Roman theatre= The Roman theatre sits on the northern slope of the hill, and is about 45 m in diameter, seating 4500. Most of it is carved into the hillside, but some parts are supported by separate stone pillars. The theatre shows evidence of ancient damage, possibly from the earthquake in 363. =Nile mosaic villa= A modern structure stands to one side of the excavations, overlooking the remains of a 5th-century public building with a large and intricate mosaic floor. Some believe the room was used for festival rituals involving a celebration of water, and possibly covering the floor in water. Drainage channels have been found in the floor, and the majority of the mosaic seems devoted to measuring the floods of the Nile, and celebrations of those floods. =Dionysus mosaic villa= Revelers and attendants of the Dionysus party. A Roman villa, built around the year 200, contains an elaborate mosaic floor in what is believed to have been a triclinium. In Roman tradition, seating would have been arranged in a U-shape around the mosaic for guests to recline as they ate, drank and socialised. The mosaic features images of Dionysus, god of wine and of socialising, along with Pan and Hercules in several of the 15 panels. The mosaic depicts a wine- drinking contest between Dionysus and Hercules.Unique Byzantine-era winepresses unearthed in roofed water cistern in Tzippori The most famous image is that of a young woman, possibly representing Venus, which has been dubbed the \\"Mona Lisa of the Galilee\\".The surprises of Sepphoris Smaller mosaic tesserae were used, which allowed for greater detail and a more lifelike result, as seen in the shading and blush of her cheeks. =Byzantine- period synagogue= Zodiac wheel mosaic in the 5th- century synagogue, combining Roman scroll designs with Hebrew lettering The remains of a 5th- century synagogue have been uncovered in the lower section of the city. Measuring 20.7 meters by 8 meters wide, it was located at the edge of the town. The mosaic floor is divided into seven parts. Near the entrance is a scene showing the angels visiting Sarah. The next section shows the binding of Isaac. There is a large zodiac with the names of the months written in Hebrew. A depiction of the Greek sun god Helios sits in the middle, in his chariot. The last section shows two lions flanking a wreath, their paws resting on the head of an ox. The mosaic shows the \\"tamid\\" sacrifice, the showbread, and the basket of first fruits form the Temple in Jerusalem. Also shown are a building facade, probably representing the Temple, incense shovels, shofars, and the seven-branched menorah from the Temple. Another section shows Aaron dressed in priestly robes preparing to offer sacrifices of oil, flour, a bull and a lamb. An Aramaic inscription reads \\"May he be remembered for good Yudan son of Isaac the Priest and Paragri his daughter Amen Amen\\"Jewish Heritage Report Vol. I, Nos. 3‚Äì4 / Winter 1997‚Äì98 Sepphoris Mosaic Symposium Held in Conjunction with Sepphoris Mosaic Exhibition by Leslie Bussis Tait Excavation history Since 1990 large areas of Zippori have been excavated by an archaeological team working on behalf of the Hebrew University's Institute of Archaeology.Israel Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2010, Survey Permit # G-38 In 2012, a survey of the site was conducted by Zidan Omar on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA).Israel Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2012, Survey Permit # A-6675 In June 2018, archaeologists discovered two subterranean Byzantine-period wine presses at Tzippori National Park.

In 2007 it was itself merged into The Rifles, a \\"large regiment\\". Formation As part of the 1957 Defence Review, it was announced that there would be a reduction in the number of infantry battalions in the British Army. The reduction was to be effected by the merging of a number of pairs of regiments.Merged regiments and new brigading ‚Äî many famous units to lose separate identity. The Times, 25 July 1957. Among the mergers to be carried out were those of the regiments of the two neighbouring counties of Devon and Dorset. * Devonshire Regiment (the former 11th Regiment of Foot, originally raised in 1685) * Dorset Regiment (the successor to the 39th Foot, raised in 1702; and the 54th Foot, dating from 1755)The Dorset Regiment at the archive of regiments.org The amalgamation took place in Minden, Germany, on 17 May 1958. The new 1st Battalion, Devonshire and Dorset Regiment was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Guy Young, formerly commanding officer of the 1st Devonshires, while the colonel of the regiment was Major-General George Neville Wood, formerly of the Dorsets. Service =1958‚Äì1966= In November 1958 the 1st Battalion moved to Cyprus, where they carried out anti-insurgency activities against the paramilitary EOKA organisation. A ceasefire was called in December 1959, and the island achieved independence from Britain in August 1960. Following the ending of the conflict the battalion carried out exercises in Libya before returning to the United Kingdom in 1961. From 1961 to 1963 the battalion was based in Plymouth, taking part in exercises on Salisbury Plain and in recruitment activities following the ending of National Service. In May 1962 the regiment was given the freedom of the City of Exeter, and were presented with a stand of colours by the Colonel-in-Chief, Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent. From July 1963 the battalion was based in Holywood, County Down. Placed on twenty-four hours' travel notice, in May 1964 they moved to British Guiana where there was political and civil unrest. Elections were held in December of that year, a first step in the independence of the colony. The battalion returned to Holywood in January 1965. =1966‚Äì1971= In February 1966 the battalion joined the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) as part of 6th Infantry Brigade based in M√ºnster. In 1967 disturbances spread throughout the Arab world in the wake of the Six-Day War. The battalion were dispatched to Benghazi in Libya to evacuate isolated British personnel. In January 1968 the regiment were transferred within the BAOR to the 12th Infantry Brigade based in Osnabr√ºck. In 1970 the battalion moved to Malta. Following the outbreak of The Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Devon and Dorsets were moved to Belfast with less than twenty four hours' notice in June 1970. They found themselves involved in the Battle of the Falls. They returned to Malta in August 1970. =1971‚Äì1976= In 1971 the battalion moved to Gordon Barracks in Gillingham, Kent. As an air-portable unit, elements of the Devon & Dorsets were frequently dispatched to various locations at short notice: In January 1972 they moved to County Armagh, to British Honduras in August 1972, to West Belfast in October 1973, to Cyprus in October 1974 and to Belize in November 1975. =1976‚Äì1980= In May 1976 the battalion rejoined the 12th Mechanised Brigade in Osnabr√ºck. They did two tours of duty in Northern Ireland: in North Belfast from January to May 1977 and in Central Belfast from January to May 1979. =1980‚Äì1987= In April 1980 the battalion moved to Colchester. From July to November 1981 they did another tour in County Armagh under Operation Banner, and in 1982 took part in training exercises in Kenya. In March 1983 the Devon & Dorsets became a resident battalion at Abercorn Barracks in Ballykinler in Northern Ireland as part of the 39th Infantry Brigade, remaining there until 1985. In 1985 they joined the Berlin Brigade, remaining in the city until 1987. =1987‚Äì1995= From February 1987 the battalion formed part of 1st Brigade at Bulford. Elements of the regiment were sent to the Falkland Islands and Belize in 1987 and 1988. From April to August 1989 they did another tour of duty in County Armagh. The Regimental Band were sent to the Persian Gulf between October 1990 and March 1991 as part of Operation Granby to serve in a field hospital. In August 1991 the battalion returned to Germany and was based in Werl and Paderborn. In 1993 they had another tour of duty in West Belfast. In 1994 they moved to Paderborn as part of the 20th Armoured Brigade. =Bosnia 1995= In May 1995 the battalion formed part of the United Nations Protection Force intervening in the Bosnian War. Corporal Simon Harvey was awarded the Military Cross for twice extracting his Warrior tracked armoured vehicle from enemy fire on the Mount Igman route into Sarajevo. For part of the campaign they served alongside the French 2e R√©giment √âtranger d'Infanterie as part of United Nations Task Force Alpha, and a bond of friendship was later established between the two units. =1995‚Äì2005= The battalion returned to Paderborn in November 1995 and was based there until 1998. Parts of the unit spent time in Fermanagh between December 1996 and June 1997. In March 1998 they moved to Warminster where they assumed responsibility for teaching infantry tactics at the Combined Arms Tactics Centre Battle Group. They moved to the Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow in 2000. After intensive training, the battalion performed public duties in London and Windsor which included providing the Queen's Guard at Buckingham Palace and attending the state funeral of Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. The Devon and Dorsets was again the resident battalion at Ballykinler from 2002 to 2004. In 2004 the battalion moved to Catterick Garrison. =Conversion to light infantry= In 2003 a defence white paper, Delivering Security in a Changing World, was published. Among the changes proposed was the amalgamation of all single-battalion infantry regiments into multi-battalion large regiments. As a result, discussions were undertaken between The Light Infantry and the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment concerning the formation of a three-battalion regiment. In December 2004 details of the amalgamations to be carried out were announced. The Devonshire and Dorset Regiment would integrate Gloucestershire elements of the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment to form a new battalion of The Light Infantry. As part of the preparation for this, the regiment moved from the Prince of Wales' Division to the Light Division, and was renamed the Devonshire and Dorset Light Infantry, on 22 July 2005. =Amalgamation= On 24 November 2005, the Ministry of Defence announced further changes to the amalgamations. The regiment were now to join a new large regiment created by the amalgamation of the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, The Light Infantry, the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment, and the Royal Green Jackets. This new regiment was to be called The Rifles and was to be formed in February 2007. In the lead-up to the formation of The Rifles, officers and men of all four regiments were cross posted, but 1st Battalion, The Rifles was formed from the regular battalions of the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment and the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment. On becoming part of a rifle regiment, the Devon and Dorsets no longer carried their colours; these were laid up in Exeter Cathedral on 27 January 2007.

Their mainstay members were Rebecca Barnard on lead vocals and her then-domestic partner, Shane O'Mara on lead guitar. They released two full-length albums, Way of All Things (1996) and Welcome (1999) before disbanding in 2000. History In 1989 Rebecca Barnard, a singer-songwriter, and her then-domestic partner, Shane O'Mara on lead guitar, recorded a cover version of TISM's track, \\"The Judeo-Christian Ethic\\", which was released on that group's 1991 single, \\"Let's Form a Company\\" (see Hot Dogma). Barnard and O'Mara had worked together (since 1986) and separately in various groups and as session or backing musicians for other artists. Rebecca's Empire was based around Barnard and O'Mara, which formed in 1994 in Melbourne as a rock, pop duo.Rebecca's Empire related entries at Australian Rock Database: * Rebecca's Empire: ‚Äì * Rebecca Barnard: ‚Äì * Michael den Elzen: ‚Äì * Peter Luscombe: ‚Äì * Bill McDonald: ‚Äì * Shane O'Mara: ‚Äì They recorded a cover version of Pearl Jam's \\"Alive\\" for an album by Performers Releasing Information about Clean Syringes (P.R.I.C.S.), Do It Safe (1994). P.R.I.C.S. was a government project for AIDS prevention and education. The band signed with Polydor's newly created Eternity label and the duo were expanded to a four-piece by the addition of Peter Luscombe on drums (ex- Stephen Cummings Band, Black Sorrows) and Bill McDonald on bass guitar (ex-Hot Half Hour, Deborah Conway Band). This line-up released their debut single, \\"Atomic Electric\\", as a four-track extended play, late in 1994. \\"Atomic Electric\\" was an indie success, which was listed at No. 38 on the 1994 Triple J Hottest 100 listeners poll. Early in 1995 Michael den Elzen on bass guitar replaced McDonald, who joined Frente!. Their label released another four-track EP in June of that year with remixed and re-recorded versions of \\"Atomic Electric\\" together with \\"Red Dress\\" and \\"Wasting Time\\" from the first EP. In September they followed with a six-track EP, Take a Look at Happiness, which included the tracks, \\"Empty\\" and \\"Alive\\". \\"Empty\\" was listed at No. 62 on the 1995 Triple J Hottest 100. The band's breakthrough occurred in August 1996, when their first full-length album, Way of All Things, was released to relative critical acclaim. It was produced by O'Mara. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, opined, \\"[it] was brimming with quality songs like the ballads 'In Deep' and 'Talking Star', tough rockers like 'Way of All Things' (with its funky Lenny Kravitz-styled riff), 'So Rude' and 'Atomic Electric', plus two sterling slices of Badfinger-style guitar-pop, 'Empty' and 'Mirage'.\\" Jonathan Lewis of AllMusic rated it at four-out-of-five stars and explained, \\"an example of melodic power pop, similar to both Belly's Star, though without the quirkiness, and Teenage Fanclub's Grand Prix, though more influenced by Led Zeppelin than by The Byrds. Infectious, well-written guitar pop songs were the order of the day and few bands do these as well.\\" The album was successful in indie circles, and had some minor success on the mainstream charts. It provided three singles, \\"In Deep\\" (May 1996), \\"So Rude\\" (July) and \\"Way of All Things\\" (February 1997). \\"So Rude\\" was listed at No. 57 on the 1996 Triple J Hottest 100; while \\"Way of All Things\\" polled at No. 94 in the 1997 list. Way of All Things was followed by a two-year relative hiatus, although they played some concerts in this time. They released a three-track CD single, \\"Car Radio\\", in November 1997, which was only available from concerts. In mid-1998 den Elzen left to join deadstar and was replaced by McDonald returning. In October 1998 Rebecca's Empire issued a single, \\"Medicine Man\\", which preceded their second album, Welcome (August 1999) via Festival Records. Again, it was produced by O'Mara. It provided two more singles, \\"Big Smoke\\" (April 1999) and \\"Bad Blood\\" (July). Welcome was not as well received by critics as their earlier efforts. Although, McFarlane observed, \\"the three year wait had been worth it; it was another slice of pop perfection.\\" Despite the band's profile, none of its singles made the Hottest 100 that year. The album and its accompanying singles were their last releases as they announced their break-up in June 2000. In April 2006 Barnard released her debut solo album, Fortified, via Shock Records, which was co-produced by Barnard and O'Mara. Both returned to session and backing work. After a period of nearly twenty years of being out-of-print, Rebecca's Empire first album was released on streaming platforms on April 2020, with Brian Parker from YourMusicRadar opining that Way Of All Things \\"has now reemerged not only as a great Australian album, but also a case study of a band that could have been a lot more popular\\".

Bands in the genre emphasize complex and fluctuant rhythms through the use of irregular time signatures, polymeters, syncopations and tempo changes. Early mathcore lyrics were addressed from a realistic worldview and with a pessimistic, defiant, resentful or sarcastic point of view. In the 1990s, the hardcore punk scene started to embrace extreme metal openly. It also started to become highly ideological, with most of the popular bands being part of subcultures. This led to bands such as Converge, Botch, Coalesce and The Dillinger Escape Plan to establish the genre.  Characteristics  = Music = Mathcore emphasizes complex and fluctuant rhythms through the use of irregular time signatures, polymeters, syncopations and tempo changes, while at the same time the drummers play with overall loudness. In the words of The Dillinger Escape Plan bassist Liam Wilson, their \\"choppy rhythms that people get kind of tongue-twisted on\\" are \\"Latin rhythms\\" mixed with the speed and \\"stamina\\" of heavy metal, drawing a parallel between them and John McLaughlin's use of Eastern sounds within a jazz context. Most pioneering mathcore drummers had jazz, orchestral or academic backgrounds, including Dazzling Killmen's Blake Fleming, Craw's Neil Chastain, Coalesce's James Dewees, Botch's Tim Latona, The Dillinger Escape Plan's Chris Pennie and Converge's Ben Koller. As with the rhythm section, the guitars perform riffs that constantly change and are seldom repeated after one section. Early bands were almost completely atonal with the guitars or all the instruments playing polyphonic dissonance. After the first The Dillinger Escape Plan records, the guitar work of most bands became extremely technical as well and \\"not only musically challenging, but physically demanding.\\" In a 2016 article, Ian Cory of Invisible Oranges described mathcore's emphasis on technical complexity as \\"the means by which\\" they attain the aggressiveness of punk, \\"but never the end unto itself\\", distinguishing it from \\"the overflowing excess\\" of progressive metal. Writer Keith Kahn-Harris has described some mathcore bands as a mix between the aggressiveness of grindcore and the idioms of free jazz. = Lyrics = Early mathcore lyrics were addressed from a realistic worldview and with a pessimistic, defiant, resentful or sarcastic point of view. They have been singled out for their philosophical and poetic elements. Some bands satirized and criticized the militant branches of the hardcore punk ideologies prominent in the 1990s. Others wrote about deeply personal issues, such as Converge's Jacob Bannon and The Dillinger Escape Plan's Dimitri Minakakis. Although musically rooted in extreme metal, some mathcore artists have shown contempt for extreme metal fictional and horror lyrics. Greg Puciato singing while hanging head down from the ceiling in 2008 = Live performances = Some early mathcore bands incorporated light shows synchronized with the music, while others were noted for their reckless, chaotic performances that usually ended up with fights and injuries. Guitarists Jes Steineger of Coalesce and Ben Weinman of The Dillinger Escape Plan commonly featured erratic and violent behaviors. In 2001, vocalist Greg Puciato joined The Dillinger Escape Plan and starred the most controversial live performances of the band until their disbandment in 2017, being described by Invisible Oranges as \\"the perfect physical embodiment of [the band's music]\\" because of his imposing physique along with destructive behavior.  Etymology  Before the term \\"mathcore\\", the style had been referred to as \\"chaotic hardcore\\" or \\"noisecore\\",Whitney Strub, \\"Behind the Key Club: An Interview with Mark \\"Barney\\" Greenway of Napalm Death \\", PopMatters, May 11, 2006. [1] Access date: September 17, 2008.\\"Botch ... a noisecore pioneer\\", 'Terrorizer, \\"Grindcore Special\\", #180, Feb. 2009, p. 63. though the genre's existence before this time is generally recognized. In the 1990s, groups now often described as mathcore were commonly called \\"noisecore\\" or \\"chaotic hardcore\\". Kevin Stewart-Panko of Terrorizer referred to groups such as Neurosis, Deadguy, Cave In, Today Is the Day, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, Coalesce, Candiria, Botch, and Psyopus as falling under this label.Kevin Stewart-Panko, \\"The Decade in Noisecore\\", Terrorizer no. 75, Feb 2000, p. 22-23. Stewart-Panko described the sound of these bands as a \\"dynamic, violent, discordant, technical, brutal, off-kilter, no rules mixture of hardcore, metal, prog, math rock, grind and jazz.\\" The term is generally applied by journalists, rather than by musicians themselves. Jacob Bannon of Converge stated:  History  = Precedents (1980s to early 1990s) = Early antecedents to mathcore were practiced by post-hardcore bands of the 1980s and early 1990s. Post-hardcore is a broad term to define bands that maintain the aggressiveness and intensity of hardcore punk but emphasizes a greater degree of creative expression. Hardcore punk pioneers Black Flag incorporated characteristics reminiscent to mathcore during their mid-1980s experimental period, including heavy metal laden riffs and lengthy songs, as well as fusion-style time signatures, polyrhythms, instrumental songs and improvisational sections.Steven Blush, American Hardcore: A Tribal History, \\"Thirsty and Miserable\\", Los Angeles: Feral House, 2001, p. 66 At that time, their biggest influences were the Mahavishnu Orchestra and King Crimson during its 1972‚Äì1975 lineup. Author Steven Blush said that their new direction \\"proved too much for many fans\\",Steven Blush, American Hardcore: A Tribal History, \\"Thirsty and Miserable\\", Los Angeles: Feral House, 2001, p. 66 yet numerous mathcore trailblazers would later credit Black Flag as an inspiration. Among others post-hardcore bands usually credited are Minutemen, who were heavily influenced by avant-garde rock and jazz, The Jesus Lizard, inspired by progressive rock, Fugazi, and Drive Like Jehu, who drew from math rock and krautrock. = Early development (1990‚Äì1995) = In the 1990s, the hardcore punk scene started to embrace extreme metal openly and also was highly ideologized, with most of the popular bands being part of subcultures, religions or political groups. Some mathcore bands started inspired by straight edge and Hare Krishna groups, including Converge, Coalesce and Botch. On the other hand, the more unorthodox bands that substantially influenced mathcore remained in the underground. Two bands usually credited as mathcore forerunners are mid-westerners Dazzling Killmen and Craw, who at the time were considered part of the \\"noisier\\" branch of math rock. Their debut albums were released in 1992 and 1993 respectively. They were characterized by a \\"metallic post-hardcore\\" sound but with constant time signature changes and vocals with an \\"animalistic sound of a man losing his mind\\". Three out of four members of Dazzling Killmen knew each other from jazz school, while Craw had a classical percussionist and a jazz bassist. Both were joined by saxophonists on some performances. In 1989, New Jersey band Rorschach was formed within the youth crew hardcore scene but soon developed a more complex and dissonant metallic hardcore style. They were influenced by hardcore punk bands such as Die Kreuzen and Black Flag, as well as thrash metal bands Voivod and Slayer. After their disbandment in 1993, their guitarist Keith Huckins joined Deadguy in 1994 and played on their sole studio album, 1995's Fixation on a Co-Worker. The discordant sound of both bands had a profound impact on the first mathcore bands. At this period, several pioneering mathcore bands began to form: Botch from Washington in 1993; Coalesce from Missouri, Cable from Connecticut and Knut from Switzerland in 1994; Cave In from Massachusetts and Drowningman from Vermont in 1995. In 1990, Massachusetts band Converge was formed but they started writing and playing what they consider \\"relevant\\" music in 1994. Referring to the burgeoning mathcore scene, The Dillinger Escape Plan's founder and guitarist Ben Weinman said: = Establishment, milestone albums and first scene (1996‚Äì2002) = Converge was formed as an amalgamation of extreme metal, crossover thrash and hardcore punk, but in the mid-1990s they were heavily affected by early metalcore and post-hardcore bands, such as Rorschach, Universal Order of Armageddon and Starkweather. Their second and third albums, 1996's Petitioning the Empty Sky and 1998's When Forever Comes Crashing, developed an increasingly technical and bleak style. At their first stages, Coalesce and Botch were influenced by Syracuse, New York metalcore and vegan straight edge pioneers Earth Crisis. Vocalist Sean Ingram relocated to Syracuse to be nearer to its scene, but ended up disillusioned with their ostracizing attitude and on his return to Missouri formed Coalesce. They incorporated influences from progressive metal band Tool, with founding drummer Jim Redd stating that they \\"wanted to be\\" them \\"with none of the quiet parts\\", but only using their \\"heavy guitars, heavy drums, wacky time signatures, and loud-quiet dynamics\\". Their sophomore studio album, Functioning on Impatience, became a landmark of the genre in 1998. Botch initially tried to become a political-straight edge band but got discouraged by the \\"elitist\\" and aggressive stance of many of their participants. Their second album We Are the Romans of November 1999 was influenced by Drive Like Jehu, Sepultura and Meshuggah. This album has influenced numerous bands and met high critical acclaim throughout the years, being lauded by TeamRock in 2015 as \\"one of the greatest albums in the history of heavy music\\". In 1997, The Dillinger Escape Plan evolved from the political-oriented act Arcane because they did not want to become part of \\"cliques\\" again. They turned around their sound significantly in their second EP, Under the Running Board of 1998, and their debut album, Calculating Infinity of September 1999, drawing from progressive death metal bands Cynic, Meshuggah and Death, as well as King Crimson and several jazz fusion artists. Both records created an extremely technical and fast brand of mathcore, which \\"launched an arms race in the metallic hardcore scene\\" and went on to define the subgenre substantially. Relapse Records marketed Calculating Infinity as \\"math metal\\" because its sound and the album's title \\"sounded mathematical\\", yet this was not the band's intent. In 1999, Converge released the split album The Poacher Diaries expanding drastically their technical elements, but afterwards main songwriter Kurt Ballou called it \\"a failed experiment\\". This inspired him to change his focus to song structure and the \\"memorable\\" elements that initially attracted him to music, birthing their 2001 album Jane Doe.

The name is of Celtic origin, going back to the time when Celtic tribe Scordisci settled the area in the 3rd century BC, following the Gallic invasion of the Balkans. Later on, the Roman Republic conquered the area in 75 BC and incorporated it into the province of Moesia. It was an important fort of the Danubian Limes and Roman Legio IV Flavia Felix was garrisoned there since 86 AD. Singidunum was the birthplace to the Roman Emperor Jovian. It was sacked by Huns in 441, and by Avars and Slavs in 584. At the beginning of the 7th century, the Singidunum fort was finally destroyed. Large part of Belgrade's downtown belongs to the \\"Archaeological Site of Singidunum\\", which was declared a protected zone on 30 June 1964.  Celtic period  = Origin = The Scythian and Thracian-Cimmerian tribes traversed through the region in 7th and 6th century BC. The Gallic invasion of the Balkans occurred in the 4th and 3rd century BC. One of the Celtic tribes, the Scordisci, settled around the strategic hilltop at the meeting of the two rivers (modern Danube and Sava). They are credited with establishing Singidunum, which was mentioned for the first time in 279 BC, as an already fortified settlement. There is only limited archaeological evidence from the city's foundational period as there were almost no traces left of the Celtic town, except for some burial sites with grave goods - the necropolises found at the locations in the modern neighborhoods of Karaburma and Rospi ƒÜuprija. These contained valuable artistic artefacts, that belong to the warriors of the Scordiscan tribe. A considerable Celtic cultural influences have been woven into the spiritual culture of the Singidunum inhabitants, and later mixed with Roman classical cultural elements. The Celtic fortification was a primitive one, located on top of Terazije ridge, above the confluence of the Sava into the Danube, where Belgrade Fortress still stands today. Celts also lived in small, open and fortified settlements around the fort, called opidums. Since it is not known for sure where the Celtic fort was, some historians suggest that it was rather close to the necropolises in Karaburma and Rospi ƒÜuprija. Celtic settlements belonged to the La T√®ne culture. The remains of the Scordisci habitation have also been found in the neighborhoods of Autokomanda, Be≈æanija, Ada Ciganlija and Ada Huja. Zemun, former separate town and now part of Belgrade, was also founded by the Scordisci, about the same time when they founded Singidunum. Evidence of their dwelling was also found in the suburban villages of Boljevci, Misloƒëin, Jakovo, Bariƒç, Progar and Ritopek. = Name = The name has Celtic d≈´n(on) \\"enclosure, fortress\\" as its second element. For singi- there are several theories including those that it is a Celtic word for circle, though the only word with a similar form recorded in other Celtic languages is Old Irish seng \\"narrow, slender, good- looking; ant\\" (Modern Irish and Gaelic seang), hence \\"round fort\\", or that it could be named after the Sings, a Thracian tribe that occupied the area prior to the arrival of the Scordisci. Herodotus names several tribes which inhabited the area in the 5th century BC: Sighnis, Graukens and Sinds, which, after the linguistic changes in the later Celtic and Roman periods, ultimately gave the name to the settlement. The Sinds were a Scythian tribe of Maeotian ethnicity. Originally inhabiting the area around the Kuban river and the Azov Sea, a branch of the tribe split in the 6th century BC and migrated to the southern parts of the Pannonian Basin, with one group remaining in Transylvania, while the other moved to the modern Belgrade area. The latest archaeological and linguistic researches showed that the Sinds inhabited the region in the 5th and 4th century BC. Another possibility is that it is a composite name the first part of which (Sin-gi) means \\"Old prayer\\" (\\"sean gu√≠\\" in modern Irish), implying that this was originally a site of Celtic religious significance, in addition to becoming a fortress (dun). This would also fit in with the ancient Celtic burial practice remnants there. However, etymologically speaking this is extremely unlikely. The Modern Irish form is actually sean-ghu√≠, and is from Old Irish sen-guidi, guidi being from the Common Celtic stem guedyo- \\"beg, implore, pray\\". Given the age of the name Singidunum , the expected form would be something like *senogwedyodunom, Latinised as *Senoguediodunum.  Roman era  Flavius Iovianus, Roman Emperor from Singidunum. The Romans first began to conquer lands surrounding Singidun during the 1st century BC. In 75 BC, Gaius \\"Quintus\\" Scribonius Curio, the proconsul of Macedonia, invaded the Balkan interior as far as the Danube, in an effort to drive out the Scordisci, Dardanians, Dacians and other tribes. The Romans had victories during these campaigns, but only stayed briefly, leaving the area outside of Roman control. Thus, very little is known about these operations or when the area was organized into the province of Moesia. It wasn't until the rule of Octavian, when Marcus Licinius Crassus, the grandson of the Caesarian Triumvir and then proconsul of Macedonia, finally stabilized the region with a campaign beginning in 29 BC Moesia was formally organized into a province some time before 6 AD, when the first mention of its governor, Caecina Severus, is made. Singidun was Romanized to Singidunum. It became one of the primary settlements of Moesia, situated between Sirmium (modern Sremska Mitrovica) and Viminacium (modern Kostolac), both of which overshadowed Singidunum in significance, and just across the Sava River from Taurunum, in Pannonia. Singidunum became an important and strategic position along the Via Militaris, an important Roman road connecting fortresses and settlements along the Danubian limes, or border. It became known as Limes Moesiae. Moesia Superior The original military camp was probably occupied by the soldiers from the Legio VIII Augusta from 46 AD to 69 AD. Early Singidunum reached its height with the arrival of Legio IV Flavia Felix which was transferred to the city in 86 AD and remained there until the mid 5th century. The presence of Legio IV prompted the construction of a square-shaped castrum (fort), which occupied Upper Town of today's Belgrade Fortress. Construction began at the turn of the 2st century AD as since the early 100s, Legio IV Flavia Felix became permanently stationed in Singidunum. At first, the fortress was set up as earthen bulwarks and wooden palisades, but soon after, it was fortified with stone as the first stone fort in Belgrade's history. The remains can be seen today near the northeastern corner of the acropolis. The legion also constructed a pontoon bridge over the Sava, connecting Singidunum with Taurunum. Connecting this way Via Militaris with the western parts of the empire, Singidunum became a major crossroad, not only for the local provinces (Moesia, Dacia, Pannonia, Dalmatia). The 6,000-strong legion became a major military asset against the continuous threat of the Dacians just across the Danube. Another step the Romans took to help strengthen Singidunum was the settlement of its legion veterans next to the fortress. In time, a large settlement grew out from around the castrum. The main axis of urban development was along the modern Knez Mihailova Street, which was the main route of communication (via cardo). Hadrian granted Singidunum the rights of municipium, which were confirmed in 169. That means it had a local autonomy, statute and laws. Singidunum outgrew this status and became a full-fledged colony in 239. The Roman Emperor Jovian, who reestablished Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, was born in Singidunum in 332. Jovian is today popularly named as the \\"only Roman emperor born in Belgrade\\", and has a street in the neighborhood of Veliki Mokri Lug. Singidunum and Moesia experienced a peaceful period, but that was not to last, due to the growing turmoil not only from outside the Roman Empire, but also from within. When the province of Moesia was divided in two, Singidunum became part of the Moesia Superior, or Upper Moesia. The city peaked, especially when it comes to culture, in the 3rd century. The Roman Empire began to decline at the end of the 3rd century. The province of Dacia, established by several successful and lengthy campaigns by Trajan, began to collapse under pressure from the invading Goths in 256. By 270, Aurelian, faced with the sudden loss of many provinces and major damage done by invading tribes, abandoned Dacia altogether. Singidunum found itself once again on the limes of the fading Empire, one of the last major strongholds to survive mounting danger from the invading barbarian tribes. Although continuing to be overshadowed by Sirmium, during the 4th century the city remained an important military outpost. It also became a seat of the. bishopric, and was a major center of Arianism until late in the century, with its bishops Ursacius and Secundianus leading local resistance against Nicene Christianity until the First Council of Constantinople in 381. Singidunum was damaged on a large scale for the first time in 378, by the invading Goths. The city was only partially restored after this event. In 395, upon the death of Theodosius I, the Roman Empire was split into two, with Singidunum lying on the northwestern border of the Eastern Roman Empire (better known as the Byzantine Empire). = Layout = Development of the settlement The city was urbanistically arranged. It had a forum, temples, planned, structured and paved streets, aqueduct, sewage system, etc. The town took on a rectlinear construction, with its streets meeting at right angles. The grid structure can be seen in today's Belgrade with the orientation of the streets Uzun Mirkova, Du≈°anova, and Kralja Petra I. Studentski Trg (Students' Square) was a Roman forum, bordered by thermae (a public bath complex whose remains were discovered during the 1970s) and also preserves the orientation the Romans gave Singidunum. Other remnants of Roman material culture such as tombs, monuments, sculptures, ceramics, and coins have been found villages and towns surrounding Belgrade. The area covered by Singidunum spreads over the territory of 5 modern municipalities of Belgrade. Castrum occupied part of today's Belgrade Fortress. Civilian zone spread from the Kralja Petra Street, over the both Sava and Danube slopes, till Kosanƒçiƒáev Venac, extending in a series of necropolises from Republic Square, along the Bulevar kralja Aleksandra all the way to the Mali Mokri Lug. Necropolis at Republic Square contained a well- shaped graves from the 1st century AD. In general, the largest section of the civilian settlement was situated between the modern Simina and Brankova streets, and the Republic Square. As for the Fortress itself, the rectangular castrum covered what is today the Upper Town of the Fortress and the Kalemegdan Park. The castrum had tall walls, built from the white Ta≈°majdan limestone and spread over the area of to , being shaped as an irregular rectangle (approximately ). The area between the rivers and the castrum, Sava and Danube's alluvial plane, was occupied by a suburb Lower Town. Located below the castrum, it was protected by the ramparts and towers. South of the fort there was another suburb, a civilian Roman town. Next to the Lower Town, on the right bank of the Danube, there was a port, which was operational until the 18th century. Modern Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra was a starting section of the long Via Militaris, which connected Singidunum and Constantinople, and in more local terms, Singidunum with fortresses and settlements along the Danube border of the Empire, like Viminacium. Built in the 1st century AD, the road was wide, with rows of shops, forges and arsenals, while Romans were buried along the road in stone sarcophagi. Archeological remnants of the Roman road can still be seen below the \\"Depo\\", former depot of the city's public transportation company. Majority of boulevard's course is part of the \\"Ancient Singidunum\\" archeological locality. The Romans were extracting stone from the quarry located in the modern neighborhood of Ta≈°majdan, using it for the building of Singidunum, and for many surviving sarcophagi. An aqueduct used to conduct water from the modern Kumodra≈æ area. At some point it was joining the aqueduct from the Mokri Lug and then continued further to the castrum. Both Mokri Lug and Kumodra≈æ are hills, so the natural inclination allowed for the water to flow downhill to Singidunum. The modern area of Cvetkova Pijaca was a location of three additional water systems. Aqueducts passed through the modern center of Belgrade, Terazije, and the main pedestrian zone, Knez Mihailova Street, which was one of the main access roads to the city and today still follows the original Roman street grid. In the area bounded by the modern Karaburma, Rospi ƒÜuprija and, at that time island, Ada Huja, Romans cultivated grapevines and used thermal springs for public bathhouses. = Suburbs = The main town and fortress in the vicinity of Singidunum was Taurunum, modern Zemun, across the Sava, on the right bank of the Danube. The Celtic settlement became Roman town in the 1st century AD and was later turned into the harbor for the Singidunum's Pannonian fleet. There are remains from the Singidunum period in the modern suburban village of Brestovik, to the east, with three localized archaeological locations: \\"Podunavlje-Hladna Voda- Vrtlog-Mikulje\\", \\"Beli Breg\\" and \\"Goli Breg\\". There is a Roman tomb in Brestovik, dating from c. 300 and discovered in 1895. Evidence points to the tomb of a wealthy local (a military commander or a high ranked Singidunum clerk who was awarded with an estate), but the popular belief is that Hermylus and Stratonicus, the Christian \\"martyrs of Singidunum\\", were buried there. Three monumental stones, heavy up to 2 tones each, were also discovered. Carved reliefs point to some large public building from before the 4th century. Well preserved bust of emperor Macrinus (ruled 217-218) is discovered in modern village of Boleƒç, halfway between Belgrade and Brestovik, and close to the ancient Tricornium. Tricornium (Latin for \\"three-horned fortification\\"), modern Ritopek, had an important military camp Castra Tricornia. The name originated from three distinctive hills dominating the landscape, one of which sank or was simply washed away into the Danube later. The settlement gave name to the Romanized Thracio-Celtic tribe of Tricornenses. A 258 AD ceremonial breast plate with stylistic illustrations belonging to Legio VII Claudia soldier Aurelius Herculanus has been found and many other artifacts of the Roman period such as silver coins that were washed ashore once the dam of the Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station was constructed. Tricornium was one of the forts, built to protect the Via Militaris. Other forts include Mutatio ad Sextum Militare (modern Grocka) and Mutatio ad Sextum (Mali Mokri Lug). The top of the Avala mountain proved to be suitable for building, so the Romans built a fortified outpost, probably on the foundations of the older Celtic one. Apart from guarding and controlling the access roads to Singidunum, the outpost was also important for the protection of the numerous mines on the mountain, which were exploited by the Romans. They were extracting lead, zinc, silver and mercury, close to the modern Ripanj. The outpost was some below the top of the mountain. The outpost was a base for the future medieval fortress of ≈Ωrnov. The neighboring mountain of Kosmaj was also rich in ores which were excavated by the Romans. In July 2000, during the excavations for the new sports complex in the village of Babe, a spring was discovered in the valley of the Pruten Creek. In the process, a hidden entry into the vast complex of Roman mines was discovered, too, being obscured for centuries. There is evidence of the extraction of silver, iron and lead. In the 3rd century AD, the Kosmaj mines were one of the most important in the Roman Empire, and were administered by the Roman procurator Babenius, whose name is preserved in the name of the Babe village. In the 1970s and 1980s, experts from the National Museum in Belgrade explored the area and discovered many mining necropolis, centered around the villages of Babe, Stojnik and Guberevac. It is estimated that there are some 100 ancient mining shafts on Kosmaj, which go below the ground and are wide. After the Roman period, mining activities ceased, only being revived in the Medieval Serbia. In 1963, a tractor which was plowing the land in the neighborhood of Zemun Polje, in the vicinity of ≈†kolsko Dobro's central building began digging up on the surface the old coins, head of a sculpture, pottery pieces and numerous other objects. The National Museum in Zemun was notified and archaeologists examined the site. It was concluded that it was a Roman fort on the former Sirmium-Singidunum road. The previously unknown settlement was squarely shaped with the sides of and, at the time of discovery, was the largest known \\"outer suburb\\" of Singidunum.  Byzantine rule and Migration Period  Ruski car Tavern at the corner of the Knez Mihailova and Obiliƒáev Venac streets, which follow the original grid layout of Singidunum In the 5th and 6th centuries, Moesia and Illyricum suffered devastating raids by the successive invasions of the Huns, Ostrogoths, Gepids, Sarmatians, Avars, Slavs and Herules. Singidunum fell to the Huns in 441, who razed the city and fortress to the ground, selling its Roman inhabitants into slavery, which they have done with all the cities along the limes. Over the next two hundred years, the city passed hands several times: the Romans reclaimed the city after the fall of the Hun confederation in 454, but the Sarmatians conquered the city shortly thereafter. In 470 the Ostrogoths seized the city around, expelling the Sarmatians. The city was later invaded by Gepids in 488, but the Ostrogoths recaptured it in 504. Six years later the Eastern Roman Empire reclaimed the city according to a peace treaty. Byzantine emperor Justinian I rebuilt Singidunum from scratch in 535, restoring the fortress and city to its former military importance. Singidunum became an important border stronghold, however, Justinian rebuilt only the area within the former legion's camp. The city saw a brief peaceful period of about fifty years, but was then sacked with the arrival of the Avars in 584, though the Byzantines recaptured it in 596. The city remained under the constant attacks of the Avars and their allies at the time, Slavs. During Maurice's Balkan campaigns, Singidunum served as a base of operations, but it was lost again in the early half of the 7th century when the Avars sacked and burned Singidunum to the ground. The destruction of Singidunum and the collapse of the entire Limes Moesiae by the Avars occurred before 614 when Avars attacked the town of Ni≈°, south of Singidunum. Around 630, the Slavs permanently settled in the area.  Belgrade  After its fall to the Avars in the early 7th century, the ancient city ceases to be mentioned, and its fate on the subsequent centuries is obscure. There are no available historical records which mention settlement on this location from the late 6th century to the second half of the 9th century. However, the Slavs settled the city during this period and named it Beligrad (\\"white city\\"), after the white Ta≈°majdan limestone, which Romans used to built the castrum. Its Slavic name was mentioned for the first time in a letter written on 16 April 878 by Pope John VIII to Bulgarian prince Boris I Mihail, as Belgrade was then part of the First Bulgarian Empire. The Slavic settlement obviously existed for a while as the new name was evidently accepted, while the city was a seat of a bishopric since the pope mentions episcopatus Belogradensis (\\"bishop of Belgrade\\"). Under the new name, Belgrade would eventually be restored to its earlier strategic significance, especially after it was reconquered by the Byzantines.  Archaeology  = Overview = Remains of the Roman castrum in the older layers of the modern Belgrade Fortress Later development of Belgrade destroyed over 80% of the cultural layer within the today protected zone of the Ancient Singidunum, that is, of the civilian settlement and necropolises. Only three sections were dug, conserved and reburied: Akademski Park, Park Proleƒáe and Tadeu≈°a Ko≈°ƒáu≈°kog Street. Of the remaining area, only a small part was explored. Northwest rampart with towers is explored to the higher degree, while the urban street grid and locations of soldier barracks can be deduced. In July 2016 city administration announced the complete reconstruction of Studentski Trg and construction of the underground garage. Construction of the two-level underground garage is criticized both by the public and experts, as the archaeological locality beneath the park has not been properly explored, historically or archaeologically, and now all the Roman and later Byzantine remains will be permanently destroyed. It was the first among the most important urban zones of old Belgrade and is especially important as the locality of ancient Singidunum which developed along the Terazije ridge. The area of the square was described as having the deepest \\"cultural and historical sedimentation\\" in the city and as the original source of the urban culture of Belgrade. = Downtown = During the digging of the foundations for the Monument to Prince Michael in 1882, tombs from different periods of Roman rule were discovered. One tomb was made from bricks, and there were 13 circular and 2 rectangle grave pits. Some of them are \\"well-tombs\\", named so because they are more than deep. The \\"well-tombs\\" are rare in these areas and it is believed that the custom arrived from Gaul. The brick tomb, which contained rushlight, was discovered close to the ƒåika Ljubina Street, while the other pits were where the monument is today. The materials found in the tombs include pottery fragments and vessels, pieces of terracotta and stone statues, fan-shaped floor tiles, bronze and bone needles, bricks, rushlights, etc. The pits were filled with ashes and contained animal bones. Coins and bronze rings, parts of the armor, have also been discovered. These \\"well- tombs\\" are considered to be the oldest part of the vast Singidunum necropolis, originating from c.100 AD, while the brick tomb is dated to c.400 and some of its bricks have a stamp of the Legio IV Flavia Felix. During the 2018-2019 renovation, two additional, devastated tombs were discovered. The southwestern necropolis, dating from the 3rd century, was located in the modern neighborhoods of Zeleni Venac, Kosanƒçiƒáev Venac and Varo≈° Kapija. The remains were discovered during the construction works in the 1930s when the Brankova Street was extended to the Sava river, to make a connection to the future King Alexander Bridge. At 16 Brankova Street a Roman tomb was discovered in 1931, with ceramics and coins from the period of the emperors Aurelian and Claudius Gothicus. The grave was made from the reused parts of stele. The sandstone plaque had a niche with a human bust and an inscription naming Valerius Longinus as a builder of the memorial for his son, a veteran Valerius Maximinus. There was another tombstone, crushed into pieces, dedicated by Maximinus' wife. Several other well preserved graves were discovered in the direction of the Pop Lukina and Karaƒëorƒëeva streets. Further discoveries in the area during the Interbellum include a golden polyhedron shaped earring from the early Middle Ages (Great Migration Period), found in Kameniƒçka Street. When the foundations for the building of the Medical Association were dug, more than 4 kg of the Late Roman coins were discovered. They originated from the 5th century. Some remains were also discovered during the 2018 construction of the hotel at 20 Jug Bogdanova Street. On the crossroad of the Gospodar Jevremova and Kneginje Ljubice streets, in Dorƒáol, a house of worship dedicated to the Greek goddess Hecate, a sort of \\"descent to Hades\\", was discovered in 1935. As foundations for a new building were being dug, a long architrave beam, with an inscription in Latin dedicated to Hecate, was discovered at the depth of . The inscription was written by Valerius Crescentio, a legionary of the Legio IV Flavia Felix, in the service of the emperor Maximinus Thrax. It is roughly dated at c.235 AD. It disappeared after it was discovered, but was found decades later and handed over to the National Museum in Belgrade. It is one of the rare findings of Hecate in Serbia. Her cult wasn't developed in this area and she was mostly identified with the Roman goddess Diana, worshiped in the region as the protector of silver mines. The entire surrounding slope around the Gospodar Jevremova was a necropolis, so the temple was probably part of it, since Hecate's temples were usually built on the cemeteries. The beam ends in a step-like manner, so the temple was probably built in the Ionic order rather than the Tuscan order, which would be expected in Singidunum. Impressions of anta capital and their size on the lower side of the beam point to existing of two columns and a probable rectangular gable above it. There is a possibility, due to the terrain, that the temple was actually dug into the slope. The original earthen and wooden fort stretched around the Studentski Trg and Knez Mihailova Street. The oldest Roman graves were discovered in this section, dated to the 1st and early 2nd century. In the Lower Town section of today's Fortress, remains from the 2nd and 3rd centuries were discovered. They include thermae, residential objects and a shrine dedicated to Mithras. The forum, which included the temples of Jupiter and Nemesis, was located close to the Cathedral Church, where the modern building of the National Bank of Serbia in the Kralja Petra Street is situated. Another thermae were located in the ƒåika Ljubina Street. The entire settlement was surrounded by vast necropolises, while the main and the largest one stretched along the Via Militaris in the direction of Viminacium, today's Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra where numerous graves, grave steles and sacrificial altars were discovered. The northern section of the Academy Park, on Studentski Trg, was excavated in 1968 during the building of a furnace oil tank for the boiler room of the Belgrade's City Committee of the League of Communists located nearby. Under the lawn, the remnants of the ancient Roman thermae were discovered, including the frigidarium (room with the cold water), laconicum (room with the warm water where people would sweat and prepare) and caldarium (room with the two pools of hot water). The site became an archaeological dig in 1969 and 8 rooms in total were discovered, including the remains of the brick furnace which heated the water. It was a public unisex bath dated to 3rd or 4th century. The entire area of the park is actually within the borders of the \\"Protected zone of Roman Singidunum\\". It is situated in the area that used to be the civilian sector of the city, outside the fortress. The remnants were visible until 1978 and due to the lack of funds to continue excavations or to cover it with the roof or a marquee, the remains were conserved and buried again. Remains of another thermae on the nearby Faculty of Philosophy Plateau are still visible and used as benches. In 2004 digging for the future shopping mall in Rajiƒáeva Street began, next to the Knez Mihailova. Remains of the antique and late antique layers were discovered, so as the remains of the southwest rampart route and double trench in the direction of Kralja Petra. The trench from the 3rd century was buried and full of coins, lamps, ceramics and jars. Next to this locality, at the corner of Knez Mihailova and Kralja Petra, an area paved with the cobblestone dating from the 2nd century was discovered. It was a public space right before the entrance into the fortress. During almost every construction downtown where digging is involved, more remains are being discovered. In 2007, on the location of the former kafana Tri lista duvana at the corner of Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra and Kneza Milo≈°a street, several necropolises were found. Just across, in Pioneers Park, there is Archaeological Site Pionirski Park. When the underground garage was dug, 19 tombs were discovered. In 2008 in ƒåika Ljubina Street remains of the house from the 4th century was discovered, which included the part of the floor and doorstep of the main entry door. Part of the walls was decorated with frescoes. Similar findings are discovered in the streets of Kosanƒçiƒáev Venac and Tadeu≈°a Ko≈°ƒáu≈°kog. Also in 2008 remains from the late Antiquity were found, while at the corner of Takovska and Kosovska streets. Roman tombs were discovered. Remnants of the Roman castrum from the 2nd century were discovered beneath Tadeu≈°a Ko≈°ƒáu≈°kog during the reconstruction in June 2009, they were conserved and reburied. In Cincar Jankova Street, five graves from the late 1st century were discovered so as three canals. Archaeologists expected to find a southeastern route of the castrum ramparts, but due to the mass wasting in the area and the leveling of the terrain, the route was destroyed in time. Remnants discovered in Kosanƒçiƒáev Venac are actually remains of the luxurious villa, with the floor mosaic and walls decorated in frescoes. = Outer neighborhoods = Pre-Roman artifacts, from the Late Iron Age, have been discovered in the modern neighborhoods and suburbs of Karaburma, Zemun, Batajnica and Ritopek.

Around the year 1010 AD, he followed Leif Eriksson's route to Vinland, in a short-lived attempt to establish a permanent settlement there with his wife Gu√∞r√≠√∞ur V√≠√∞f√∂rla √ûorbjarnard√≥ttir and their followers. Nickname The byname Karlsefni means \\"makings of a man\\" according to the preface of Magnus Magnusson and Hermann P√°lsson, although the Cleasby-Vigfusson dictionary glosses it as \\"a thorough man\\", elaborated elsewhere as a \\"real man\\", a \\"sterling man\\".: \\"Enfi\\" finds its equivalent in the Latin Materia, signifying \\"Stuff\\". \\"Mannsefni\\" stood for a \\"promising man,\\" and \\"Karlsefni\\" for a \\"real\\" or \\"sterling\\" man... indicated that the person to whom it was applied was made of \\"good stuff\\" History Thorfinn's expeditions are documented in the Gr≈ìnlendinga saga (\\"Saga of the Greenlanders\\" henceforth Grl.) and Eir√≠ks saga rau√∞a (\\"Saga of Eirik the Red\\" Henceforth Eir.),Manuscripts of Eir√≠ks saga rau√∞a are indicated by the sigla: A=Hauksbok, B=AM 557=Sk√°lholtsb√≥k in which together are referred to as \\"The Vinland Sagas\\",, etc. but the details are at considerable variance (See under #Saga sources). =Greenland= Thorfinn Karlsefni met in Greenland Gudrid Thorbjarnard√≥ttir (Gu√∞r√≠√∞r √ûorbjarnard√≥ttir), widow of Thorstein Eiriksson and wedded her. She had been staying under the care of her brother-in-law Leif Eriksson, at Brattahl√≠√∞ the estate left to Leif by Eirik the Red, who was dead by this point, having succumbed to an epidemic ca. 1003, even though Eir. has him still alive and playing host to her., \\"(After her husband's death, Thorstein the Black conveyed her to Eiriksfjord, and) Gudrid went to stay with her brother-in-law Leif Eiriksson at Brattahlid\\" (Grl., Ch.6, p.64); \\"Eirik the red received her at Brattahlid..\\" (Eir. Ch. 6, p.90) =Vinland= Thorfinn reached the momentous decision to go to Vinland (ON and Icelandic V√≠nland), which according to Grl. happened at the insistence of Gudrid. And Leif agreed to lend the houses he built in Vinland, though unwilling to make a free gift of it. Among the other settlers into Vinland was Freydis, the sister or half-sister of Leif Eriksson, who may have accompanied Karlsefni's voyage (Eir.) or headed an expedition of her own that ended in carnage (Grl.). According to Grl., Karlsefni left with 60 men and 5 women, trailing the path taken by Leif and Thorvald Eiriksson. Whereas in Eir. he took three ships with 140 men aboard, describing the voyage in greater detail. gives \\"hundred plus forty men\\" and \\"160 people\\", but has \\"var fj√≥rir tigir manna annars hundra√∞s\\" with the reading of \\".xl. manna ok .c. \\" (A, Hauksbok) footnoted Gudrid bore Thorfinn a boy in Vinland, who was named Snorri,, listed as \\"Snorri Karlsefnisson\\" in name index. the first child of European descent known to have been born in the New World and to whom many Icelanders can trace their roots. The exact location of Thorfinn's colony is unknown but is believed to potentially be the excavated Norse camp at L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland.  Saga sources  It has been pointed out that Eir√≠ks saga rau√∞a (Eir.) distorts the facts by giving undue credit to Thorfinn. \\"(Haukr Erlendsson) had special interest in Eirik's saga, for he himself was descended from Thorfinn.. he inserted additional genealogical material into the text (Chapters 7 and 14) and made several slight alterations dessinged to add further lustre to his ancestor's fame.\\" For instance, it denies that Thorvald Eiriksson ever led his own voyage to reach Vinland (as Grl. records), even before Thorfinn. Although Thorvald had met his death by Native American arrows in Vinland before Karlsefni embarked, Eir. postponed Thorvald's death so he can be made to accompany Karlsefni to Vinland, ultimately to suffer a more fantastical death from a shot fired by a Uniped. Eir. shifts over to Karlsefni the credit for naming numerous bits of geographic features, from Helluland and Markland to Kjalarnes \\"Keel Ness\\", though \\"this flatly contradicts the Gr≈ìnlendinga saga and is assuredly wrong\\". Helluland (Baffin Island) and Markland were named by Leif; Kjalarness was where Thorvald had wrecked his ship, and the keel was left to stand as a monument,; and not an anonymous shipwreck as Eir. puts it. = Graenlendinga Saga = According to the Gr≈ìnlendinga saga, Thorfinn Karlsefni's expedition commenced after his marriage to Gudrid Thorbjarnard√≥ttir. This marriage to Gudrid was predicted earlier in the saga by Gudrid's first husband Thorstein Eriksson, upon his death. The expedition brought women and livestock, signifying that they planned on being settled in the area for a while. Along the voyage they ate a beached whale. They also cut timber, harvested grapes, and caught fish and game. A bull they brought frightened the native people (Skraelings). They tried to appease the natives by offering milk, but the natives took ill and battles commenced. Gu√∞r√≠√∞r √ûorbjarnard√≥ttir gave birth to Thorfinn Karlsefini‚Äôs son Snorri before they head back to Greenland. =Eirik the Red's Saga= Eirik the Red's Saga depicts Thorfinn Karlsefni as a successful merchant from Reynines, Skagafjord, in the north of Iceland. Karlsefni embarks on a trading expedition with forty men, and arrive at Brattahlid, Greenland where they are hosted by Eirik the Red. Karlsefni marries Gudrid that winter. Karlsefni departs with three ships and 140 men in search of Vinland. Karlsefni's expedition winter on a piece of land, where two scouting slaves found grapes and wild grain. Eating a beached whale causes illness, as well as a rift. Thorhall's group declared the whale to be a boon from Thor, offending the Christian members and they part ways. Karlsefni's expedition discovers further south a bountiful area full of wheat, fish, and game. They attempt contact with the natives who travel in hide- covered boats. The natives leave and the Greenlanders winter there, where their livestock flourish. The following spring, the expedition reencounter the natives and engage in trade with them, until a bull breaks free and frightens away the natives. The native return after three weeks with hostile intent, a skirmish ensues, and the Greenlanders attempt as best they can to flee into the forest. Karlsefni and his men are saved by Freydis, who scares the natives off by slapping her bare breast with a sword taken from one of the fallen Greenlanders. The expedition heads back north, and Karlsefni searches for Thorhall in vain. Karlsefni's men encounter the one-legged creature that is said to have shot Thorvald Eiriksson dead with an arrow. Karlsefni's son Snorri is born in the New World. But they eventually leave, and after spending time in Greenland to Eirik the Red, Karlsefni and Gudrid return to Karlsefni's farm at Reynines, in Iceland. Family background Thorfinn Karlsefni's father was Thord Horsehead (√û√≥r√∞r hesth√∂f√∞i Snorrason), and his mother was named Thorunn (√û√≥runn). Thord Horsehead was son of Snorri, son of . Thorfinn was presumably raised at his father's estate called Stad (Sta√∞) in Reyniness (). This estate was located in the Skagafjord bay area, which is also where Thorfinn's great-grandfather established roots, at his farm of in . Thorfinn himself also retired in the area in his later years; while Eir√≠ks saga says \\"he went (back) to his farm in Reyniness,\\" Gr√¶nlendinga saga states he bought new lands at . A more detailed genealogy (under Eir√≠ks saga rau√∞a, ch. 7) is interpolated in the H or Hauksb√≥k text of Haukr Erlendsson. Haukr had particular interest since he himself claimed descent from Thorfinn. However, Haukr's ancestral trace before Karlsefni's great-grandfather Thord of Hofdi deviates from other sources, and the Landn√°mab√≥k versionLandn√°mab√≥k: ; : \\"Thord, the son of Bjorn Butter-Box, son of Hroald Spine, son of Bjorn Ironside, son of Ragnar Hairy-Breeks.Thord.. took possession of Hofdastrand in Skagafjord.. and made his home at Hofdi...had a third son called Snorri, who married Thorhild the Ptarmigan, daughter of Thord Gellir, and their son was Thord Horse-Head. He married Thorgerd, daughter of Thorir Slouch and Fridgerd, daughter of King Kjarval of Ireland.\\" is deemed more reliably accurate.For example, crossreferences \\"√û√≥rvaldr hryggr √Åsleiksson\\" given by Haukr as Thord of Hofdi's grandfather to \\"Hr√≥aldr hryggr\\" given by the Landn√°mab√≥k. Though not shown in the family tree (right), Thorfinn also claims descent from the matriarch Aud the Deep-Minded through Thord Gellir., ¬ß95.

Her bequest specified that the funds were to be used to create a series of sculptures \\"emblematic of the history of America.\\" Thorfinn Karlsefni (1915‚Äì1918) was installed along Philadelphia's Kelly Drive near the Samuel Memorial and unveiled on November 20, 1920.; adapted from There is another casting of the statue in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland.

A fictionalized version of Thorfinn Karlsefni is the protagonist of the Japanese Manga series Vinland Saga by author Makoto Yukimura. The popular manga also received a 24-episode anime television series adaptation by Wit Studio which aired on NHK General TV in Japan from July to December 2019 and released worldwide on Prime Video.

Life John Baconthorpe was born at Baconsthorpe, Norfolk, he seems to have been the grandnephew of Roger Bacon (Brit. Mus. Add. MS. 19. 116). In youth, he joined the Carmelite Order, becoming a friarGracia, J. J. & Noone, T. B. (2003). A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages. Oxford: Blackwell. pg. 338-9. at Blakeney,Pasnau, R.

He became regent master of the theology faculty at Paris by 1323. He is believed to have taught theology at Cambridge and Oxford. Eventually, he became known as doctor resolutus,Nolan, S. (2011) \\"John Baconthorp.\\" Encyclopedia of Medieval Philosophy. Lagerlund: Springer, Henrik (Ed.) XXIII, 1423. though the implication of this is unclear. He was a provincial prior of England from 1327‚Äì33. He appears to have anticipated Wycliffe in advocating the subordination of the clergy to the king. In 1333 he was sent for to Rome, where, we are told, he first maintained the pope's authority in cases of divorce; but this opinion he retracted. He died in London, around 1347. Long after his death, during the Renaissance, he became known as the authority on Carmelite theology. Works There are various surviving written works by Baconthorpe. His best-known work, a commentary on the Sentences by Peter Lombard, survives in multiple versions. Nearly three centuries later, it was still studied at Padua, the last home of Averroism, and Lucilio Vanini spoke of him with great veneration. (The text can be found in original Latin under the title Doctoris resoluti Joannis Bacconis Anglici Carmelitae radiantissimi opus super quattuor sententiarum libris.) Additionally, there are three Quodlibeta, questions on canon law, and commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew, Augustine, and Anselm that have survived. Philosophy Although well versed in various theological perspectives, Baconthorpe was first and foremost a Carmelite. As a theologian, he made a point to defend the doctrine of Immaculate Conception, and to assert the importance of his order in the context of historical and spiritual tradition. Similarly, Baconthorpe openly debated with his contemporaries, such as Henry of Ghent, Duns Scotus, and Peter Auriol, and consistently challenged the perspectives of earlier philosophers. He even took issue with fellow Carmelites such as Gerard of Bologna, Guido Terreni, and Robert Walsingham. Baconthorpe is commonly viewed as an Averroist (a follower of Ibn Rushd, or Averroes in the Latin world), though it is unlikely he viewed himself as such. He was given the title princeps Averroistarum, meaning \\"prince of Averroists,\\" by masters at the University of Padua centuries after his death. Further, he was given this title not because he agreed with Averroes, but merely because of his skill in explaining some of Averroes' philosophical ideas. Most notably, in his Sentences commentary, he discusses the perspective of Averroes in great depth, along with that of Aristotle. Similarly, Renan says that he merely tried to justify Averroism against the charge of heterodoxy. Averroes was certainly a relevant influence on Baconthorpe, and he would sometimes reference Averroes' commentaries in making his own arguments; however, he commonly referenced other theologians, including many of his contemporaries, thus it should not be assumed that Averroes was the primary influence on Baconthorpe's thinking. Perhaps the most important influence on John Baconthorpe was the Oxford and Paris Condemnations of 1277, in which teaching any of 219 philosophical and theological theses was prohibited by the Bishop, Stephen Tempier.Thijssen, H. (2008, Fall). \\"Condemnation of 1277\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. . Baconthorpe openly disagreed with many of these prohibited works, such as those by Giles of Rome and Godfrey of Fontaines. This ultimately served to support the doctrines of the church. He paid particular attention to Thomas Aquinas' works on natural philosophy,Wallace, W. A. (1982). \\"St. Thomas‚Äôs conception of natural philosophy and its method\\", in La Philosophie de la nature de Saint Thomas d‚ÄôAquin, Pontificia Editrice Vaticana. pg. 7‚Äì27. which Baconthorpe comes to target in many of his arguments. In contrast to Aquinas, Baconthorpe's perspective was that there are two substances, the human body and the eternal soul. Baconthorpe‚Äôs perspective on angels was similarly influenced by the Condemnations at Paris, in strict opposition to Aquinas. Many of Baconthorpe‚Äôs theological discussions focus largely on the form and function of humanity. In accordance with the notion that the human body and the eternal soul are separate entities, he asserted that the soul is the cause of intellect‚Äîspecifically, that the soul is an intellectual substance which renders the human form intelligible.Etzwiler, J. P. (1971), \\"Baconthorp and the Latin Averroism: The Doctrine of the Unique Intellect\\", Carmelus, 19: 235‚Äì292. Despite this, he still believed that free will exists, without decisions necessarily having a cause. Effectively, he believed that souls make their own decisions which are imposed on human bodies, but God maintains a complete knowledge of each soul and each decision that will be made. As a result, he denies the possibility of any material mechanisms being involved in intellect. References ;Attribution which in turn cites: * Brucker, Hist. Crit. iii. 865. * Stuckl, Phil. d.

Until 1951, it was formally called the Dorsetshire Regiment, although usually known as \\"The Dorsets\\". In 1958, after service in the Second Boer War along with World War I and World War II, the Dorset Regiment was amalgamated with the Devonshire Regiment to form the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment. In 2007, it was amalgamated with the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment, The Light Infantry and the Royal Green Jackets to form a new large regiment, The Rifles. History The Territorials in Dorset trace their origins to the 1st Administrative Battalion, Dorsetshire Rifle Volunteers formed at Dorchester. Its first formation consisted of the following: The first volunteer corps in Dorset had their headquarters in Dorchester. The 1st Dorsetshire Rifle Volunteer Corps (1 Dorsetshire RVC) was at Bridport, 2 Dorsetshire RVC at Wareham, 3 Dorsetshire Rifle Volunteer Corps at Dorchester, 4th Dorsetshire RVC at Poole, 5 Dorsetshire RVC at Weymouth, 6 Dorsetshire RVC at Wimborne, 7 Dorsetshire RVC at Sherborne, 8 RVC at Blandford, 9 Dorsetshire RVC - Shaftesbury, 10 Dorsetshire RVC at Sturminster, 11 Dorsetshire Rifle Volunteer Corps at Gillingham, and 12 Dorsetshire RVC at Stalbridge. Eventually in 1880 as a result of the Childers Reforms the regiment was re- designated to the 1st Dorsetshire Rifle Volunteers. Just a year later it moved under control of the Dorsetshire Regiment as the volunteer battalion. =Early history= The Dorsetshire Regiment was established in the Regular Army in 1881 under the Childers Reforms by the amalgamation of the 39th (Dorsetshire) Regiment of Foot and the 54th (West Norfolk) Regiment of Foot. The 1st Battalion was stationed in Malta from 1888, in Egypt from 1889, and in British India from 1893, where it took part in operations in the Tirah Campaign on the North West Frontier in 1897‚Äì98.Hart‚Ä≤s Army list, 1903 The 2nd Battalion was stationed in Ireland from 1893 to 1897, then in Malta from 1899. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899, they were sent to South Africa, participating in the Relief of Ladysmith. The battalion stayed in South Africa throughout the war, which ended in June 1902 with the Peace of Vereeniging. Four months later 300 officers and men left Cape Town on the SS German in late September 1902, and arrived at Southampton in late October, when they were posted to Portland. In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had one Reserve battalion and one Territorial battalion.These were the 3rd Battalion (Special Reserve), with the 4th Battalion at High West Street in Dorchester (Territorial Force). =First World War= Troops of the Dorsetshire Regiment resting and cleaning rifles in the ruins of a farm near Langemarcke, 17 October 1917. During the First World War, nine hostilities-only battalions were formed, six battalions serving overseas. The 1st Battalion and 6th (Service) battalion served on the Western Front throughout most of the war. Additional battalions (1/4th Battalion, 2/4th Battalion and 3/4th Battalion) were formed as part of the Territorial Force to meet the demand for troops on the Western Front. Regular Army The 1st Battalion was in Belfast when war broke out: it landed at Le Havre in August 1914 forming part of the 15th Brigade in the 5th Division. It transferred to 95th Brigade in the 32nd Division in December 1915 and to the 14th Brigade in the same Division in January 1916. British Army recruiting poster : \\"4th Batt. Dorset Regiment. Men Of Dorset ! Your King And Country Need You. Join Your County Battalion\\". The 2nd Battalion was in Poona, India, when war broke out and was shipped, as part of the 16th Indian Brigade, to Mesopotamia, where it was trapped in the Siege of Kut and captured by the Turks. (Of the 350 men of the battalion captured, only 70 survived their captivity.) During the siege, returning sick and wounded, and the few replacements who had been sent out, were unable to re-join their battalion, so they, and similar drafts of the 2nd Norfolk Regiment, were amalgamated into a scratch battalion forming part of the force attempting to relieve Kut. This battalion was formally titled the Composite English Battalion, but was more commonly known as The Norsets; it was broken up in July 1916, when the 2nd Dorsets was re-constituted. The battalion then served in Egypt as part of 9th Indian Brigade in the 3rd Indian Division. Territorial Force The 1/4th Battalion of the Territorial Force served in India and Mesopotamia and 2/4th Battalion in India and Egypt. New Army The 5th (Service) Battalion took part in the Gallipoli Campaign, and having been evacuated from there in December 1915, went to Egypt before joining the war on the Western Front in July 1916. The 6th (Service) Battalion was shipped to Boulogne in France in July 1915 as part of 50th Brigade in the 17th (Northern) Division and saw action on the Western Front. =After First World War and Anglo-Irish War= On 7 February 1920 4th Battalion was reformed in the Territorial Army with its headquarters in Dorchester and four companies (A-D). The 3/4th Reserve Battalion was moved to Ebrington Barracks in Derry in April 1918. In April 1920, during the Anglo-Irish War, soldiers from the regiment fired into a protesting crowd on Bridge Street, leading to riots and skirmishes which saw it fight alongside the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and (later) Ulster Volunteers (UVF) against the Irish Republican Army (IRA).The Outrages by Pearse Lawlor, pages 15-16 Sporadic violence in the city continued until another large engagement in June, when the Dorsets and the UVF attacked the Bogside area of the city. A large IRA counter-offensive from the west ended the disturbances, which had seen 40 people killed since April.The Outrages by Pearse Lawlor, pages 16-18 Some RIC officers threatened to resign over the Dorsets' fraternisation and co-operation with the UVF. =Malabar Campaign= Moplah Revolt, at the St. Mark's Cathedral, Bangalore In Summer 1921, the 2nd Battalion served under the command of Major-General John Burnett-Stuart, General Officer Commanding Madras District in India, where he was involved in the suppression of the Moplah Rebellion at Malabar between 1921 and 1922. The riots that they quashed were inspired by 10,000 guerrillas and led to 2,300 executions. The Officers and Men from the Dorset Regiment who lost their lives while taking part in the suppression of the revolt are commemorated in a brass tablet at the St. Mark's Cathedral, Bangalore. =Second World War= In the Second World War, the regiment expanded to eight battalions. The 1st Battalion was a regular army unit and part of the 231st Infantry Brigade, alongside the 1st Hampshires and 2nd Devonshires, for the duration of the war, fighting in Malta between 1940 and 1942, Sicily in August 1943, and Italy in September 1943. The 1st Dorsets landed on Gold Beach on D-Day in June 1944 as a part of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and fought with the division in the Battle of Normandy and North-West Europe, until the division was withdrawn in late 1944 and used as a training division. The battalion had troops 327 killed and 1,029 wounded. The 2nd Battalion was also a regular army unit and was part of the 5th Infantry Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, throughout the war, participating in the Battle of France and the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940. In 1944, it took part in the Battle of Kohima during the Burma Campaign of 1944‚Äì1945, still with the 2nd Division. King Peter II of Yugoslavia inspecting the Guard of Honour of a battalion of the Dorset Regiment in England. The 4th Battalion was an original 1st Line Territorial Army unit and, in 1939, raised a 2nd Line duplicate, the 5th Battalion, when the Territorial Army was doubled in size prior to the commencement of the war. The 4th and 5th Battalions were both part of 130th Infantry Brigade in the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, participating in the Normandy Campaign, Operation Market Garden and the Rhine Crossing. Men of the 5th Battalion, Dorsetshire Regiment climb into a Buffalo in preparation for crossing the Rhine, Germany, 28 March 1945. The 30th Battalion, previously the 6th (Home Defence) Battalion, was with the 43rd Infantry Brigade in North Africa and the invasion of Sicily, after which it spent the rest of the war in Gibraltar. The 7th Battalion, which was raised in 1940, was later converted to the 110th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery. The regiment served with the 43rd (Wessex) Division in North-West Europe from June 1944 to May 1945. The 8th Battalion, which was also raised in 1940, was initially assigned to the 210th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home) and was on home defence. Later, the battalion converted to the 105th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery. The regiment was sent to North Africa in late 1942 and fought with the British First Army, It later served in the Italian Campaign with the British Eighth Army. =Post war and amalgamation= In 1958, the regiment amalgamated with the Devonshire Regiment to form the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment.Merged regiments and new brigading ‚Äî many famous units to lose separate identity.

The exposure can originate from various sources, including natural sources. Most frequently the term refers to ionizing radiation, and to a level of radiation that will serve a specific purpose, rather than radiation exposure to normal levels of background radiation. The term irradiation usually excludes the exposure to non-ionizing radiation, such as infrared, visible light, microwaves from cellular phones or electromagnetic waves emitted by radio and TV receivers and power supplies. Applications =Sterilization= If administered at appropriate levels, all forms of ionizing radiation can sterilize objects, including medical instruments, disposables such as syringes, and sterilize food. Ionizing radiation (electron beams, X-rays and gamma rays) may be used to kill bacteria in food or other organic material, including blood. Food irradiation, while effective, is seldom used due to problems with public acceptance.\\"Spinach and Peanuts, With a Dash of Radiation\\" article by Andrew Marin in The New York Times February 1, 2009 =Medicine= Irradiation is used in diagnostic imaging, cancer therapy and blood transfusion.\\"Information for patients needing irradiated blood\\" by National Blood Service In 2011 researchers found that irradiation was successful in the novel theranostic technique involving co-treatment with heptamethine dyes to elucidate tumor cells and attenuate their growth with minimal side effects.Tan X, Luo S, Wang D, et al. A NIR heptamethine Dye with intrinsic cancer targeting, imaging and photosynthesizing properties. Journal of Biomaterials China. 33-7 (2011), pp. 2230-2239.F. Pene, E. Courtine, A. Cariou, J.P. Mira. Toward theranostics. Crit Care Med, 37 (2009), pp. S50‚ÄìS58 =Ion implantation= Ion irradiation is routinely used to implant impurities atoms into materials, especially semiconductors, to modify their properties. This process, usually known as ion implantation, is an important step in the manufacture of silicon integrated circuits. =Ion irradiation= Ion irradiation means in general using particle accelerators to shoot energetic ions on a material. Ion implantation is a variety of ion irradiation, as is swift heavy ions irradiation from particle accelerators induces ion tracks that can be used for nanotechnology. =Industrial chemistry= Irradiation can be used to cross-link plastics or to improve material qualities of semi- precious stones. Due to its efficiency, electron beam processing is often used in the irradiation treatment of polymer-based products to improve their mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties, and often to add unique properties. Cross-linked polyethylene pipe (PEX), high-temperature products such as tubing and gaskets, wire and cable jacket curing, curing of composite materials, and crosslinking of tires are a few examples. =Security= During the 2001 anthrax attacks, the US Postal Service irradiated mail to protect members of the US government and other possible targets. This was of some concern to people who send digital media through the mail, including artists. According to the ART in Embassies program, \\"incoming mail is irradiated, and the process destroys slides, transparencies and disks.\\" =Agriculture= After its discovery by Lewis Stadler at the University of Missouri, irradiation of seed and plant germplasm has resulted in creating many widely- grown cultivars of food crops worldwide. The process, which consists of striking plant seeds or germplasm with radiation in the form of X-rays, UV waves, heavy-ion beams, or gamma rays, essentially \\"mixes\\" the genes already existing in the genome. The UN has been an active participant through the International Atomic Energy Agency. Irradiation is also employed to prevent the sprouting of certain cereals, onions, potatoes and garlic.Bly, J.H. \\"Electron Beam Processing\\", Yardley, PA: International Information Associates, 1988. Appropriate irradiation doses are also used to produce insects for use in the sterile insect technique of pest control.International Database on Insect Disinfestation and Sterilization, Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture website, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, plus the International Atomic Energy Agency. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) recognizes irradiation as an important technology to protect consumers. Fresh meat and poultry including whole or cut up birds, skinless poultry, pork chops, roasts, stew meat, liver, hamburgers, ground meat, and ground poultry are approved for irradiation.Irradiation and Food Safety, U.S. Drug and Food Administration.

It is located at 2445 Dixie Road, just south of Dundas Street East. Like most GO stations, Dixie offers parking facilities for commuters, and allows for wheelchair-accessible train services through a raised mini-platform giving access to the 5th carriage from the locomotive; it is one of the only three stations on the Milton Line (excluding Union Station) that offer the mini-platform. The station building houses a ticket sales agent and a waiting room. Although ridership is growing on the Milton line including at Dixie, GO cannot increase its services here at present because the line is shared with busy Canadian Pacific Railway freight trains. Frequent weekday GO buses serving the station help alleviate the demand. In order to increase capacity on the Milton line, GO plan to extend Dixie's platform to accommodate twelve-carriage trains once more powerful locomotives capable of pulling such trains have entered service in 2008.

W. R. D. Bandaranaike, was the fourth Prime Minister of Ceylon (later Sri Lanka) and founder of the left-wing and Sinhalese nationalist Sri Lanka Freedom Party. S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike became the prime minister of Ceylon in 1956 and carried out left wing reforms such as nationalizing bus serviceshttp://www.swrdbandaranaike.lk/files/speeches/bus_nationalization.pdf and introducing legislation to prohibit caste based discrimination. Bandaranaike is also remembered for removing British naval and air bases in Sri Lanka and establishing diplomatic missions with a number of communist states. Bandaranaike served as the prime minister until he was assassinated by a Buddhist monk named Ven Talduwe Somarama in 1959 allegedly over the signing of the Bandaranaike‚ÄìChelvanayakam Pact. Early life and education Bandaranaike was born in Colombo, Ceylon, to the wealthy Sinhalese Anglican Christian Bandaranaike family, who had become one of the elite native families under the British administration. His father was Sir Solomon Dias Bandaranaike the Maha Mudaliyar, while his mother was Daisy Ezline Obeyesekere, daughter of Sir Solomon Christoffel Obeyesekere, a member of the Legislative Council of Ceylon. Sir Solomon named his only son after West Ridgeway, the Governor of Ceylon at the time, who was his godfather. He had two sisters Alexandra Camelia and Anna Florentina. Sir Forester Obeysekera was his maternal uncle. He was tutored by Mr. Henry Young an English tutor from Nuwaraeliya at his home Horagolla Walauwa in Attanagalla and for a short time attended S. Thomas' College, Mutwal, boarded at the Warden Rev. William Arthur Stone's residence. He passed the Cambridge senior examination with distinctions in English, Latin, Greek and French gaining the second in order of Merit in the British Empire that year. He entered Christ Church, Oxford. He read for Philosophy, Politics and Economics and graduated with honors in modern greats in 1923. At Oxford, he was the Secretary of the Oxford Union and the President of the Majlis Society; his contemporaries at Oxford included Anthony Eden. In 1924, he was called to bar as a Barrister in the Inner Temple; on his return to Ceylon, he took oaths as an Advocate of the Supreme Court of Ceylon. Early political career After his return from Britain, Bandaranaike became active in local politics. He got elected as the Chairman of the Nittambuwa Village Committee in his family seat. He became Secretary of the Ceylon National Congress (CNC) in 1926, and in December the same year was elected from the Maradana Ward to the Colombo Municipal Council, defeating the trade unionist A. E. Goonesinha. State Council Second Board of Ministers of Ceylon. Bandaranaike is in the left corner standing. Following the implementation of the Donoughmore Constitution, the State Council of Ceylon was established as the first legislator in the island with its members elected through universal suffrage. Bandaranaike contended and was elected unopposed from Veyangoda at the 1931 election to the first State Council and was elected to the executive committee for local administration, chaired by Charles Batuwantudawe. He stated in the council that the committee system introduced in the new constitution was satisfactory at the time. =Minister of Local Administration= In 1936, he was re-elected unopposed from Veyangoda in the 1936 election to the second State Council. In its first meeting, he was elected as Minister of Local Administration. As Minister, he was chairmen of the executive committee on local administration, of which he had been a member in the previous term and was a member of the Board of Ministers. Sinhala Maha Sabha In order to promote Sinhalese culture and community interests, Bandaranaike founded the Sinhala Maha Sabha in 1936. He introduced the Free Lanka Bill in the State Council in 1945Richardson, John (2005) Paradise Poisoned: Learning about Conflict, Terrorism, and Development, International Center for Ethnic Studies, Kandy, Sri Lanka, p. 144, In 1947, when Leader of the House, D. S. Senanayake presented the Soulbury Constitution to the State Council, Bandaranaike seconded the motion stating that he does so as the Sinhala Maha Sabha was the largest party in the State Council. With Ceylon heading for self-rule under dominion status, D. S. Senanayake invited Bandaranaike to combine his Sinhala Maha Sabha with other smaller parties into the United National Party (UNP) which Senanayake was forming to contest for the 1947 election under the new Soulbury Constitution. Bandaranaike accepted the invitation, formally dissolving the Sinhala Maha Sabha and merging with the UNP. First Cabinet Minister of Health and Local Government The first Cabinet of Ministers of Ceylon. Bandaranaike is in the first row-second from the left Bandaranaike in Kandy as Minister of Health and Local Government He contested for the newly formed House of Representatives in the 1947 election from the UNP from Attanagalla, winning with a good majority. In September 1947, D. S. Senanayake appointed him to his cabinet as the first Minister of Health and Local Government of Ceylon and he was elected as the Leader of the House. Effectively this made Bandaranaike the most senior member of the cabinet, after the Prime Minister. In fact, Senanayake had Sir Oliver Goonetilleke discuss with Bandaranaike as leader of the Sinhala Maha Sabha, the draft agreements for independence; which Bandaranaike received with mixed feelings. However, he did not object and the agreements signed with the Britain government making way for Ceylon to gain self-rule. As leader of the house, he delivered the address of thanks at the ceremonial opening of parliament on 4 February 1948, which marked Ceylon's independence from Britain. During the next few years, he supported legislation proposed by the government as leader of the house. This included the Ceylon Citizenship Act No. 18 of 1948 and the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act No.3 of 1949 which deprived citizenship to Indian Tamils. He initiated several projects for the improvement of health as minister of health, including the expansion of hospitals and uplifting ayurveda medicine. He attended the Third World Health Assembly in Geneva in May 1950 as Chief delegate of Ceylon. However, he found himself at odds with Senanayake administration on policy. By 1951, it also appeared that Senanayake did not intend to make an early retirement that would have allowed Bandaranaike to succeed him as prime minister. Cross over and formation of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party In July 1951, Bandaranaike resigned from his government posts and crossed the floor to the opposition with several of his close associates from the Sinhala Maha Sabha. Thereafter he dissolved the Sinhala Maha Sabha and formed a new party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) having its inaugural meeting at Town Hall on 2 September 1951.Richardson (2005), Paradise Poisoned, p. 145. A few months later, on 21 March 1952 D. S. Senanayake fell off his horse after suffering a stroke and died the following day. Although Sir John Kotelawala was expected to succeed him, his son Dudley Senanayake, Minister of Agriculture was appointed Prime Minister on 26 March 1952 by the Governor-General Lord Soulbury. Dudley Senanayake called a general election in 1952, which the UNP won gaining 54 seats in parliament. Leader of the Opposition Bandaranaike contested the general election from the SLFP for the Attanagalla seat and was re-elected. With the SLFP gaining nine seats and the LSSP gaining nine. Bandaranaike was elected Leader of the Opposition. The leftist agitated Hartal 1953 affected Senanayake, who shortly stepped down. Kotelawala succeeded him as prime minister. =Pancha Maha Balavegaya= Between 1952 and 1956, Bandaranaike spent much of its time consolidating the new party. Although it drew many supporters from the old Sinhala Maha Sabha, it was still relatively new facing a lack of funds and the lack of support from mess media as it could not afford a party newspaper. It drew much of its support from the rural areas that were marginalized or neglected by the incumbent UNP government which was pro-establishment. On the issue of language, the party originally espoused the use of both Sinhala and Tamil as national languages, but in the mid-1950s it adopted a \\"Swabasha\\" (native language) policy. The party asserted itself as a champion of the Buddhist religion; the SLFP has thus customarily relied upon the socially and politically influential Buddhist clergy (the Sangha) to carry its message to rural Sinhalese. Since the 1950s, SLFP platforms have reflected the earlier organization's emphasis on appealing to the sentiments of the Sinhalese masses in rural areas. To this basis has been added the anti- establishment appeal of non-revolutionary socialism. Bandaranaike continued his policies stated in 1952, on language, Buddhism, and Ayurvedic medicine. As such he stated that the basis of the party would be the ‚ÄòPancha Maha Balavegaya‚Äô (Five Great Forces) which consisted of the native doctors, clergy, teachers, farmers and workers.Sepalika De Silva, Cultural practice of human rights: An anthropological study of human rights in Sri Lanka (2006), p. 57. =Mahajana Eksath Peramuna and the 1956 elections= In 1956, Kotelawala called for early elections. Bandaranaike responded by assembling a coalition with a group of small Marxist parties to form the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) to contest the 1956 general elections. The MEP was a four-party coalition with a no-contest pact with the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the Communist Party of Sri Lanka. Although he inherited his father's vast estate at the death of Sir Solomon in 1946, he was riddled with death duties. Short on funds for the election, Bandaranaike mortgaged his town house at Rosmead Place to the Bank of Ceylon for Rs 200,000; which he used for his campaign. Prime Minister The 1956 elections was a landslide victory for the MEP as it gained a two-thirds majority in parliament and Bandaranaike was invited by the Governor General to form a government as the fourth prime minister of Ceylon in April 1956. He formed his cabinet with a collection of senior members of the parties that made up the MEP and several independents. =National policies= He suspended all British and native honors and enacted the Suspension of the Capital Punishment Act No 20 of 1958, which suspended the death penalty from May 1958. =Language policy and communal tension= One of Bandaranaike's most notable actions was the implementation of the Sinhala Only Act, making Sinhala the sole official language of the country, downgrading the official status of English, and promoting socialist, non- Western policies that profoundly changed the course of Ceylonese politics in the following decades. He is also remembered by the minority Sri Lankan Tamils for his failure to use the state's resources to control the 1958 riots, leading to the deaths of many Tamil citizens at the hands of mobs. The government declared a state of emergency on 27 May after six days of riots. The Tamil Language Special Provisions Act was passed to mitigate the effects of the Sinhala Only Act. =Foreign policy= As prime minister, he took a neutralist stance in foreign policy, but established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. He removed the British air bases at RAF Negombo and RAF China Bay and the naval base at Trincomalee. In 1957, he signed the Bandaranaike‚ÄìChelvanayakam Pact but was forced to withdraw in 1958. =Economic policy= Domestically, he was faced with economic problems and disputes over languages stemming from the Sinhala Only Act. He reformed labor laws and increased wages; established the Employees' Provident Fund and declarers May day a public holiday. The Paddy Lands Bill was introduced by is government to protect peasant farmers. In 1958, he nationalized bus companies and formed the Ceylon Transport Board and the Colombo Port Cargo Operations. =Strikes and cabinet crisis= In early 1959, a cabinet crisis resulted in the resignation of the leftist Philip Gunawardena and William de Silva. However the MEP remained intact. In 1959 trade unions at Colombo Harbour went on strike crippling imports and exports. Bandaranaike requested that the police intervene against trade union action, the order was declined by IGP Osmund de Silva on the grounds that he believed it to be unlawful. In April 1959, de Silva was compulsorily retired from the police force and M. Walter F. Abeykoon, a civil servant and Bandaranaike's bridge partner at the Orient Club, was appointed in his place. Assassination Bandaranaike with Srimavo & E. L. Senanayake on 23rd September 1959 in Kandy,Two days before his assassination. Bandaranaike died four years into his term, aged 60 on 26 September 1959, at the Merchant's Ward of the Colombo General Hospital due to wounds sustained after being shot by Talduwe Somarama, a Buddhist monk. On 25 September, Somarama had visited Bandaranaike at his private residence, Tintagel, in Rosmead Place, Colombo. Since Somarama appeared to be a member of the Buddhist clergy, he was not searched for weapons and given free access to the prime minister as he began his routine meetings with the public. The monk then fired a revolver at Bandaranaike as the latter stood to greet him; he was rushed to hospital but died the following day despite six hours of surgery by Ceylon's most skilled surgeons. A Supreme court trial found Somarama, Mapitigama Buddharakkitha, H.P. Jayewardena guilty and pronounced on all three of them the death sentence (death by hanging). Although Bandaranaike's administration had suspended capital punishment, Talduwe Somarama was hanged on 6 July 1962. It was claimed by the court that the reason for the murder of the Bandaranaike, was due to Bandaranaike's refusal to entertain Buddharakitha Thero's requests following his support for Buddharakitha in the election. After Bandaranaike's death, Wijeyananda Dahanayake, minister of education and the acting leader of the house, was appointed caretaker prime minister by the Governor General and was confirmed by Parliament. C. P. de Silva, the minister of lands, land development and agriculture, and the leader of the house had taken ill at a cabinet meeting in August 25, 1959 and was flown to the United Kingdom for treatment, making Dahanayake the acting leader of the house and had been put up by Bandaranaike as acting prime minister, during his planned visit to the UN. However, he fell out of favor with the members of the government, resulting in the removal of all ministers of the Bandaranaike's cabinet in less than a year. Eventually, the leadership of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party fell to Bandaranaike's widow Sirima Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike who held the SLFP to an election victory in July 1960 becoming the world's first female Prime Minister and was soon appointed a Senator. Family life Bandaranaike Samadhi- S.W.R.D.'s tomb at Horagolla, Sri Lanka In 1940, he married Sirima Ratwatte, daughter of Barnes Ratwatte Rate Mahatmaya, later Dissawa of Sabaragamuwa. Ratwatte was an old Radala family hailing from the Kingdom of Kandy and the Bandaranaike's were an old and wealthy family from the low- country which had been in service of the colonial rulers for centuries. The wedding was dubbed \\"the wedding of the century\\" and linked Bandaranaike with the Kandyan elite through marriage. The newly married couple moved into Wentworth in Guilford Crescent, Colombo which was taken on rent from Lionel Wendt. Their first two children, Sunethra and Chandrika were born and the family stayed at Wentworth till 1946, when Sir Solomon bought a mansion at Rosmead Place, Colombo and the family settled into it. Here their only son Anura was born. Following the death of his father Sir Solomon, Bandaranaike inherited the family seat of Horagolla Walauwa in Atthanagalla. Atthanagalla became his home constituency for the future elections and remained the home constituency of his wife, daughter and son. Sirima Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike, as she was known after her marriage, became the first female prime minister in the world following Bandaranaike's assassination. His daughter Chandrika Kumaratunga subsequently became Prime Minister (1994) and then first female Executive president in the country, his only son Anura Bandaranaike went on to become Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka (2000‚Äì2001) and a Minister (2004‚Äì08) and his eldest Sunethra Bandaranaike who followed her father's footsteps attending Oxford, became a prominent socialite. Legacy Both a highly respected and controversial figure, he has been accused of initiating the racial discords in the island nation with his pro-Sinhalese nationalist policies. His wife continued many of his socialist policies in later years of her administration. On 17 July 1976, a bronze statue of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike was unveiled on Galle Face Green, it was sculpted by Lev Kerbel and gifted from the Soviet Union. The Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall was gifted from the People's Republic of China in his memory in 1970 and houses the S W R D Bandaranaike Museum. The Bandaranaike International Airport, the first international airport in Ceylon was named in his honor when it was opened in 1970. Honours * LLD (honorary) - University of Ceylon See also *S. W. R.

It is located at 3210 Hurontario Street, near Dundas and Hurontario Streets. The future Hurontario LRT will connect to this station. Description Like most GO stations, Cooksville has parking for commuters and a station building with a ticket sales agent and a waiting room. It is located near several condominium complexes, which provides ridership on the Milton Line. The 1400-space parking lot allows access to those who live closer to Mississauga City Centre to use the station. The GO Station is served by seven trains inbound to Union Station in the morning rush hour and seven trains outbound to Milton during the evening rush hour. There is also the Train-Bus during off-peak hours. Despite growing ridership on the Milton line, GO cannot schedule additional trains because of the busy Canadian Pacific Railway freight services running on the same tracks. Trains were extended from ten to twelve carriages in a phased roll-out between April 8, 2008 and May 2, 2008 in order to increase capacity, and congestion is alleviated somewhat by the extensive train-bus services outside of rush periods. On October 13, 2008 the Canadian Pacific Spirit Train stopped at Cooksville GO station to promote the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. Repairs to the platforms and pedestrian tunnels began in October 2014 and was completed by the spring of 2015. Reconstruction Demolition of the original Cooksville GO station building and portions of the parking lot began in 2018 in preparation for the construction of new station structures.

It is affiliated with the United Methodist Church. Founded as High Point College in 1924, it became High Point University in October 1991. HPU offers 47 undergraduate majors, 51 undergraduate minors and 12 graduate- degree majors.  History  Roberts Hall at High Point University Atlas sculpture at High Point University. Artist, Jon Hair Cottrell Hall at High Point University In the mid-19th century, the Methodist Protestant Church, which is now part of the United Methodist Church, became active in educational pursuits in North Carolina. In 1921, after some years of consideration, the statewide governing body of the Methodist Protestant Church voted to establish a college.Sizemore, F. J., ed. The Buildings and the Builders of a City: High Point, North Carolina. High Point: Hall Printing Company, 1947. p. 318-319 Shortly afterwards the church accepted an offer from the citizens of High Point to contribute of land and $100,000 to the project, placing the new school in the city of High Point.Robinson, Blackwell P., and Alexander R. Stoesen. The History of Guilford County, North Carolina, U.S.A. to 1980, A.D. Greensboro: The Guilford County Bicentennial Commission, 1980. p. 233 The campus was designed by R. E. Mitchell of Washington, D.C., assisted by Herbert Hunter of High Point, in the English Renaissance style. The school was founded in 1924 as High Point College, a joint venture between the Methodist Protestant Church and the citizens of High Point, and officially opened its doors on September 14, 1924. When the college opened, the campus consisted of three buildings, attended by nine faculty members, with a student enrollment of 122. The steadfast growth that characterized the birth of the college ended abruptly with the Great Depression. This period was difficult for the college in 1932‚Äì33, as faculty salaries were cut and expenses were sometimes bartered. Despite a $50,000 fund raising campaign, the college declared bankruptcy on June 15, 1934 and reorganization in an effort to reduce its indebtedness.Robinson, Blackwell P., and Alexander R. Stoesen. \\"The History of Guilford County, North Carolina, U.S.A. To 1980, A.D.\\" Greensboro: The Guilford County Bicentennial Commission, 1980. p. 235 Subsequent reorganization enabled the college to move forward with business and renewed expansion. ''' On October 9, 1991, under the guidance of President Dr. Jacob C. Martinson, Jr. and the Board of Trustees, High Point College changed its name to High Point University to reflect post-graduate degree programs. Coinciding with the offering of graduate studies, every building on the campus was renovated and new ones were constructed with a campus quadrangle added to replace a former city street that bisected the campus,https://web.archive.org/web/20040928204703/http://www.high- point.net/edc/2002annrpt.pdf%7C High Point Economic Development Corporation Website and by 2004 the university's endowment increased to $40 million. When Jacob C. Martinson, Jr. stepped down as president in 2005, he was the longest serving United Methodist college president in the country. In 2005, the university was only 92 acres and landlocked with a total undergraduate enrollment of 1,450. The university's operating budget was only $35 million with approximately 100 faculty members. Since Dr. Nido R. Qubein became president of High Point University in 2005 the growth of the university has had significant impact on the city, region and the state of North Carolina. Qubein is the fourth highest paid college president, paid $2.9 million a year, in the United States.Jean Stancill, December 8, 2015, News & Observer, The president of High Point University ranked as the third highest-paid university president in the country, according to a Chronicle of Higher Education report on 2013 data, Retrieved December 14, 2015, \\".....\\" Since taking office in 2005, President Nido Qubein added campus buildings and creating student amenities such as concierge services, an on-campus steak house, free carwashes, and an icecream truck.\\"BubbleU: High Point University\\", Bloomberg Businessweek, April 19, 2012 In early 2012 Businessweek reported that about $700 million in new building and campus upgrades was financed by heavy borrowing and Moody's Investors Service downgraded the school's bonds to junk status in 2009 due to the school's position as one of the most heavily leveraged colleges in the country. The U.S. Department of Education's \\"financial responsibility\\" score for the 2012 and 2013 fiscal year has High Point University scoring the highest possible score of 3, putting the university ahead of Elon University, Duke University, and Davidson College. Businessweek responded by inviting the school to make financial documents available to support any challenges to the article's accuracy, but none were offered in response. In addition to questioning debt levels, Businessweek challenged whether the school's relationships with its lenders and vendors were at an appropriate arm's length, citing in particular that the school spends large marketing dollars with a public relations firm headed by the president's daughter. The college's claims to a growing reputation in higher education were challenged as being based more on high-end student amenities and marketing strategy than on solid academics. The Chronicle of Higher Education Almanac, April 19, 2016 noted Nido R Qubein is the third highest donor university president in the country from 2006-2016. He committed $10 million to High Point University. Donations from alumni, parents and supporters of HPU total about $214 million since 2006. In 2010, the university announced plans to invest about $2.1 billion in overall growth in the next decade.

Ashley Furniture Industries Chairman Ron Wanek donated $10 million to High Point University in 2013 after visiting HPU's President Dr. Nido R. Qubein. Wanek's gift to the university is the 10th contribution of $10 million or more that Qubein has received during his tenure. On September 14, 2014, the university celebrated its 90th anniversary. As part of the commemoration, 90 facts about the university were featured in the News and Record on High Point University's Founders Day. On January 3, 2015, Nido R. Qubein celebrated his 10th anniversary as president of High Point University. In April 2016, High Point University announced plans to invest $160 million in new building projects including a 5,000-seat arena and conference center, undergraduate science center and residence hall.

The screenplay by Steven Zaillian is based on the 1979 book The Falcon and the Snowman: A True Story of Friendship and Espionage by Robert Lindsey, and tells the true story of two young American men, Christopher Boyce (Timothy Hutton) and Andrew Daulton Lee (Sean Penn), who sold US security secrets to the Soviet Union. The film features the song \\"This Is Not America,\\" written and performed by David Bowie and the Pat Metheny Group. Plot Christopher Boyce, an expert in the sport of falconry and the son of an FBI special agent, gets a job at a civilian defense contractor working in the so- called \\"Black Vault,\\" a secure communication facility through which flows information on some of the most classified U.S. operations in the world. Boyce becomes disillusioned with the U.S. government through his new position, especially after reading a misrouted communiqu√© dealing with the CIA's plan to depose the Prime Minister of Australia. Frustrated by this duplicity, Boyce decides to repay his government by passing classified secrets to the Soviets. Andrew Daulton Lee is a drug addict and minor cocaine smuggler, nicknamed \\"The Snowman,\\" who has frustrated and alienated his family. Lee agrees to contact and deal with the KGB's agents in Mexico on Boyce's behalf, motivated not by idealism but by what he perceives as an opportunity to make money with plans to settle in Costa Rica, a nation that at that time had no extradition treaty with the United States. As the pair become increasingly involved with espionage, Lee's ambition to create a major espionage business coupled with his excessive drug use begins to strain the two from each other. Alex, their Soviet handler, becomes increasingly reluctant to deal through Lee as the middleman because of Lee's periods of irrationality. Above all, Boyce wants to end the espionage act so that he can resume a normal life with his girlfriend Lana and attend college. Boyce meets with Lee's KGB handler to explain the situation. Meanwhile, Lee is desperate to regain the Soviets' regard after realizing that the KGB no longer needs him as a courier. Lee is observed tossing a note over the fence at the Soviet embassy in Mexico City and is arrested by Mexican police and a U.S. Foreign Service officer accompanies him to the police station. When the police search his pockets and find film from a Minox camera Boyce used to photograph documents along with a postcard used by the Soviets to show Lee the location of a drop zone, they produce pictures of the same location that was on the postcard, showing officers surrounding a dead man on the street. The Foreign Service officer explains that the Mexican police are trying to implicate him with the murder of a policeman. The police then drag Lee away and interrogate him. Hours later, Lee reveals that he is a Soviet spy. Told by the Mexican police that he will be deported, Lee is offered a choice of where to be sent. Lee suggests Costa Rica, but the choice is merely between the Soviet Union and the United States. Lee reluctantly agrees to go back to America and is arrested as he walks across the border. Knowing that he too will soon be captured, Boyce releases his pet falcon, Fawkes, and then sits down to wait. Moments later, U.S. Marshals and FBI agents surround and capture him. As the film ends, Lee and Boyce are seen being escorted to prison.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave it a perfect four-star rating, citing one of the many strengths as that \\"it succeeds, in an admirably matter-of-fact way, in showing us exactly how these two young men got in way over their heads. This is a movie about spies, but it is not a thriller in any routine sense of the word. It's just the meticulously observant record of how naivet√©, inexperience, misplaced idealism and greed led to one of the most peculiar cases of treason in American history.\\" Film critic Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune also gave the film four stars and hailed Hutton and Penn's work in the film, writing that \\"it's tough to spot Penn in this new role\\" and calling Penn's performance rare because it \\"neither patronizes nor celebrates drug use; instead, it's absolutely lifelike, and for a film based on a true story, there is no greater compliment.\\" Siskel also noted that the two lead characters formed an odd couple that made \\"a terrific formula for a movie, creating at least three stories: The plight of each man, their joint effort to accomplish their goal and the changing dynamic of their relationship as the story progresses. As if that weren't enough, 'The Falcon and the Snowman' also turns into a 'how-to' movie with a fine sense of detail for the worlds of espionage and drugs.\\" Music References External links  * Lucy, the Peregrine Falcon used in the movie. * Movie stills 1985 films 1985 crime drama films 1980s spy drama films American films American crime drama films American spy drama films English-language films Cold War spy films Docudrama films Spy films based on actual events Films directed by John Schlesinger Films set in the 1970s Films set in Mexico Films set in Mexico City Films with screenplays by Steven Zaillian Orion Pictures films 1985 drama films ","title":"The Falcon and the Snowman"},{"id":"1388854","text":"The historical Burro Schmidt Tunnel is located in the El Paso Mountains of the northern Mojave Desert, in eastern Kern County, southern California. It is a 0.5-mile (0.80 km) mining tunnel dug with hand tools and dynamite over a 38-year period by William \\"Burro\\" H. Schmidt (1871‚Äì1954). in the El Paso Mountains of eastern California. The tunnel is below the summit of a mountain. Its southern adit (portal) overlooks the Fremont Valley, Koehn Dry Lake, and the ghost towns of Garlock and Saltdale. History \\"Burro\\" Schmidt, mining gold in the El Paso Mountains, was faced with a dangerous ridge between his mining claims and the smelter to the south in Mojave. Schmidt said that he would \\"never haul his ore to the Mojave smelter down that back trail\\" using his two burros. Thus, he began his tunnel in 1900. The tunnel was about tall and wide. It was cut through solid granite bedrock and required little shoring. However, Schmidt was trapped many times by falling rock and injured often. He eventually installed a mining cart on rails. In 1920 a road was completed from Last Chance Canyon to Mojave, eliminating the need for the tunnel, but Schmidt claimed to be obsessed with completion and dug on. By 1938 he had achieved his \\"goal\\", having dug through nearly of solid granite using only a pick, a shovel, and a four-pound hammer for the initial section, and carefully placed dynamite with notoriously short fuses for the majority portion. It was estimated that he had moved 5,800 tons (5,260 metric tonnes) of rock with just a wheelbarrow to complete his work. Schmidt never used the tunnel to move his mine's ore. Instead, he sold the tunnel to another miner and moved away. A Ripley's Believe It or Not! cartoon celebrated the feat, calling him the human mole. Schmidt's cabin, down below in Garlock, has been largely abandoned and stands as it was in the 1930s, preserved by the dry climate. Ownership dispute Ownership of land underlying a mining claim remains with the United States government, under the management of the Bureau of Land Management, with only mining rights transferred to the mining claim owner. Whereas no mining operations are underway, the Bureau of Land Management states that they own the Schmidt Tunnel and associated surrounding land, because it is an unpatented mining claim under the General Mining Act of 1872, meaning that all rights reverted to the BLM under the Federal Land Policy And Management Act of 1976 upon the death of the grandfathered claimant, Evelyn A. (Tonie) Seger, who had possessed the claim prior to 1976. This is in dispute, as Seger is claimed by heirs to have maintained the claim legally under the terms of the Mining Act and properly transferred the mining claim upon her death to Dave Ayers, her caretaker for the last years of her life. As of 2003 David Ayers and Mr. F. Schmidt claimed to be legal owners of the mining claim containing the Schmidt Tunnel. The historical buildings on the mining claim site were transferred by Tonie Seger's will to her granddaughter, Cheryl Kelly. The BLM assumed ownership of the historic buildings via publication of an abandonment notice after multiple attempts to contact then-owner, Cheryl Kelly, by both BLM personnel and private parties in order to preserve the site failed. According to the BLM, long-time caretaker David Ayers was offered the opportunity to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the BLM to be the full-time caretaker of the site, but refused to sign unless he was paid to be the caretaker and instead chose to leave to work elsewhere after being informed he had no legal right to remain at the site without that MOU. Preservation A small group of history buffs and outdoorspeople, The Friends of Last Canyon Tflcc.org: Friends of Last Canyon are actively preserving the site, but ongoing disputes about ownership of the mining claim and historic structures continue to interfere with preservation efforts. As a result, Schmidt's cabin has fallen prey to vandalism.

In 1969, they moved to Phoenix where his sister Karina was born. His parents got divorced soon after, and the mother and children moved to San Francisco. His mother remarried a Mexican painter, but with time the relationship became abusive and she decided to leave her husband and the US in 1976. Johansen spent his teenage years between Buenos Aires and Montevideo. In 1990 he married an Argentine ballerina in Buenos Aires, and the young couple moved to New York so she could continue her dance studies. Johansen worked as waiter, tourist guide and translator for a while, until he got a chance to start performing regularly at CBGB‚Äôs and got his musical career on track. He divorced his first wife and he remarried in 2006 to Mar√≠a Laura Franco. He currently lives in Buenos Aires with Maria and his four children: Miranda (who is also in the music business), Kim, Tom and Roy.  Musical career  He started to play guitar and write lyrics at 14, and by the end of high school he decided to become a musician. Johansen made a brief appearance in the local rock scene with the band Instrucci√≥n C√≠vica with Julian Benjamin in the 80s they released two albums: Obediencia Debida in 1985 and Instrucci√≥n C√≠vica in 1986. In 1990 he moves with his girlfriend of that time to New York. He had several jobs unrelated to music, until Hilly Kristal heard him sing and invited him to perform at his club CBGB¬¥s. He played in the CBGB's club for several years, until he created the group The Nada, and in 2000 recorded the album with the same name, a mix of different Latin sounds with modern pop, funk and rock.\\"Kevin Johansen: Rock Star with Bilingual Twist\\". Morning Edition, NPR. October 16, 2003. Accessed September 11, 2010. In 2010 he returned to Argentina, where he currently lives. The album, released by Los A√±os Luz, was relatively successful and Johansen and the group went on tour as far as Spain (album edited there by K Industrias). By the end of 2002 Johansen recorded Sur o no Sur, also released by Los A√±os Luz in Argentina and by Sony Music in the rest of the world. During 2003, Johansen became successful in Argentina, playing in June at the Gran Rex Theatre, the largest Buenos Aires hall. Again in Spain, he promoted his new album with concerts in Madrid and Barcelona, this time with bigger audiences. He also performed during the MTV Latino awards, from where he continued a concerts tour to Miami, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco prior to the release of the album in United States. He has performed in Mexico, Chile, Belgium and again Spain, Colombia, among other countries with positive response from fans and the media. At the Latino Grammy Awards, Sur o no Sur was nominated for \\"Album of the year\\", \\"Song of the year\\" (\\"La Procesi√≥n\\") and \\"Best Music Video\\" (\\"La Procesi√≥n\\").\\"Grammys' new look: Fresh faces, voices contend for Latin music awards\\" by Ramiro Burr. Houston Chronicle. September 1, 2004. Accessed September 11, 2010. For about 15 years, most the visual arts of his music was done by the Cartoonist Ricardo Siri Liniers. They went on tours together, where Liniers would draw along to Johansen music while his drawings were projected in the back of the stage. They also published a book (Oops!) together.  Critics reviews  Newspapers from different countries have highlighted his musical and language mixtures. He naturally switches from English to Spanish or from Cumbia to Rock. He is seen as an artists who is not afraid to experiment, since he has not settled with one specific genre he is usually calls his work as ‚Äúde genre-ate‚Äù.

It operates at 95.7 MHz with 100,000 watts of effective radiated power with a transmitter near Issaquah, Washington on Cougar Mountain, and operates from its studios in Seattle's Belltown neighborhood northwest of downtown. KJR-FM is owned by iHeartMedia. KJR-FM broadcasts in HD. HD Radio Guide for Seattle-Tacoma History =KJR= KJR-FM is a replication of KJR (AM) when it was a rock/top-40 station from 1958 to 1982. The AM station is now a sports news station, which started in 1991. =95.7 FM= This station signed on the air on May 25, 1960, and was owned until 1963 by Rogan Jones, founder of the radio automation firm IGM. It had a beautiful music format under the callsign KGMJ. In 1967, it was sold to Elroy McCaw, the owner of KIXI (880 AM) who kept the beautiful music format as a simulcast of the AM station. In 1970, Wally Neskog bought the station, and changed KGMJ's call letters to KIXI-FM on October 19, 1978. In 1980, the simulcasting ended. The AM side adopted an oldies format while the FM side programmed an adult contemporary format that emphasized on instrumentals and easy listening music as \\"KIXI Light\\". The station was sold in 1986 to Thunderbay Broadcasting, and changed call letters and monikers to KLTX \\"95.7 K-Lite\\", on April 28, 1986, while retaining the adult contemporary format. In December 1987, KLTX was sold to the Ackerley Group (owners of KJR). The station had a series of translators located in and around Seattle from the late 1980s through early 1990s. These included K292AL Everett (106.3 FM), K285AE Olympia (104.9 FM, now KTDD), K277AB Edmonds (103.3 FM), and K277AA Seattle (also located at 103.3 FM). The station was known for having a wide and diverse playlist, a rarity for an AC station.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USaLblMpSRg After three weeks of stunting with a mix of music ranging from 1980s' pop, grunge rock, rap, all-'60s music, country, and Hot Adult Contemporary (and branded as \\"The Northwest's New 95.7\\", a nod to KUBE's early years in the 1980s), the station's format was changed to All-'70s Hits on April 29, 1994, and changed call letters to KJR-FM on June 1. The following month, KJR AM & FM would be sold to a partnership with New Century Management and Ackerley titled \\"New Century Media\\" (Ackerley would re-acquire full control of the two stations in February 1998). The station was home to The Lost 45s with Barry Scott during the mid-'90s. The station would gradually shift towards a general classic hits format in 1997. The station was usually ranked in the middle of the ratings, capturing about a 3 share of the market. In early 2000, the station gradually added more 1980s and 1990s music, while still being called KJR-FM. The station officially flipped to Rock AC with the branding \\"Mix 95.7\\" in May 2000. The call letters would change to KMBX on August 11, 2000. This format was only temporary. At 7 p.m., on October 28, 2000, KMBX began stunting with a loop of a heartbeat sound effect. At 7 a.m. on October 30, KMBX flipped to a rhythmic oldies format with the branding \\"95-7 The Beat.\\" The call letters were also changed to KBTB on January 29, 2001. This format did moderately well in the ratings; however, with the nationwide decline with the rhythmic/urban oldies format, the station fell in the ratings as well. Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) bought the station in May 2002, and on May 29, at 6 p.m., after playing \\"Last Dance\\" by Donna Summer, the station started stunting as \\"Quick 96\\", where the station played 1200 10-second clips of certain songs from any given genre. On May 31, at 5 p.m., the stunting concluded and during a live broadcast from the Space Needle, the station changed formats back to classic hits as \\"Superhits 95.7 KJR-FM\\" and changed call letters back to KJR- FM a month later. The first song on the revived \\"KJR-FM\\" was \\"You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet\\" by Bachman-Turner Overdrive. The station featured music from the 1970s and the 1980s, and some 1960's music and hired one of the legendary DJs from the original KJR AM in the 1970's, Ric Hansen, to be its morning personality. The second incarnation of the format had done tremendously well in the Arbitron ratings, usually peaking in the Top 5. In 2008, KJR-FM started rebroadcasting actual American Top 40 shows from the 1970s, picking up the rights from KBSG, which had changed formats that year. By that time, 95.7 had dropped the \\"Superhits\\" name and branded as just \\"95.7 KJR-FM\\".KJR announces return of American Top 40 On November 12, 2010, at 3 p.m., the station started playing round the clock Christmas music (though the majority of it was classic Christmas tunes) and changed monikers to \\"Christmas 95.7\\". On December 26, KJR-FM rebranded as \\"Oldies 95.7\\", but retained the classic hits format. However, the station dumped 1980s' music, but kept 1970s' tracks and added more 1960s' tracks. It was one of two stations targeting the Puget Sound area with an oldies/classic hits format, the other being KMCQ. On April 1, 2011, KJR-FM became the new home of Bob Rivers' morning show. Rivers was let go by rival KZOK-FM the previous September. On November 4, 2011, Clear Channel did not transfer the KJR-FM calls to its sister station 102.9 FM after that station, which was KNBQ (now KZTM), began simulcasting KJR 950. By December 2011, KJR-FM added 1980s' music back into its playlist. It also updated its logo, and rebranded as simply \\"95.7 KJR.\\" KJR-FM has since added actual American Top 40 shows from the 1980s, including those KJR/950 had aired in addition to the AT40 1970s rebroadcast that the station had aired since 2008. The rebroadcasts are heard on the weekends. KJR-FM has also added Dick Bartley's Classic Countdown show, also on weekends. Since 2010, KJR-FM has also billed itself during the holiday season as \\"Seattle's Radio Home for the Holidays,\\" airing continuous Christmas music until returning to its classic hits format every December 26. KJR-FM's playlist, by this point, consisted of hits from 1964‚Äì1989. Over the last two months of 2013 and into 2014, KJR-FM altered its format to add more classic rock and grunge artists. The station registered domains pointing towards a flip to classic rock, classic alternative, or modern rock, with a likely rebranding to 95.7 The Jet, to match Seattle's nickname as \\"Jet City\\", as it is home to Boeing, and to match the old callsign of KJET (now KLFE) at 1590 AM, which was one of the first alternative rock stations in the country from 1982‚Äì1988. On July 29, 2014, KJR-FM went jockless (except for the morning show), and began promoting \\"a new 95.7 taking off\\" on August 8 at 10 a.m., after Bob Rivers' final morning show (Rivers announced his retirement on July 28). On August 8, at 10:08 a.m., following Bob Rivers' goodbye show, KJR-FM flipped back to classic hits and rebranded as 95.7 The Jet. The first song on \\"The Jet\\" was \\"Jet Airliner\\" by The Steve Miller Band. The flip resulted in the dropping of the remaining 1960s music, with an increased emphasis on 1970s and 1980s hits. In addition, the station added some 1990s hits. In early 2017, the station began to decrease the amount of 1970s hits on its playlist, and increased its emphasis on 1980s hits. The station has also added \\"iHeart80s Weekends\\" in which the station plays all-'80s hits every weekend.

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1771, Sheppard's family, loyal to England, lost a great majority of its property during the Revolutionary War, and Sheppard had to fend for himself at a young age. He began working as an errand boy and clerk for a merchant, John Mitchell. Within a few years he became a partner with Mitchell, eventually taking over the business upon Mitchell‚Äôs death,Scharf, J. Thomas (1881). History of Baltimore City and County, p. 892. Louis H. Everts. a business he retired from in 1832. Like many Quakers of the time, he was active in the abolitionism movement and an active supporter of the Protective Society of Maryland to Protect Free Negroes, the American Antislavery Society, and the Society of Friends Indian Affairs Committee. He also helped in the payment for the education of several colored men that became important in founding of Liberia, among them Dr Samuel McGill. Sheppard lobbied the Maryland General Assembly, stopping legislation that would have banished free African-Americans from the state. In Baltimore, as well as being a prominent merchant, Sheppard was also commissioner of the prison. Through this activity Sheppard became aware of the inhumane treatment accorded persons with mental illnesses, or \\"lunatics\\" as they were then called. Appalled by this treatment, and in accordance with the ideas of the Society of Friends, Sheppard sought to improve conditions for those suffering from mental illness. In 1851, he was visited by prominent social reformer Dorothea Lynde Dix, who enlisted Sheppard in her effort to establish a state institution for the humane care of the insane. Sheppard approached and obtained a charter from the Maryland General Assembly for the construction of an asylum to be located on a 340-acre (1.4 km¬≤) farm in Towson, Maryland, just north of Baltimore. This facility, though, would be private, and not a state run institution. Upon his death in 1857, Sheppard dedicated his entire fortune to building the asylum.Sharfstein, Steven S., et al., eds. (2009). Textbook of Hospital Psychiatry, p. 360. American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. Sheppard stipulated the following: ‚ÄúCourteous treatment and comfort of all patients; that no patient was to be confined below ground; all were to have privacy, sunlight and fresh air; the asylum's purpose was to be curative, combining science and experience for the best possible results; and that only income, not principal would be used to build and operate the asylum.‚Äù Because of the financial restrictions that Sheppard put in place the asylum, designed by Calvert Vaux, did not open until 1891, almost 34 years after Sheppard's death. When opened the asylum was known as The Sheppard Asylum, though that name would change in 1896 to The Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital, after fellow Baltimore merchant Enoch Pratt bequeathed a substantial portion of his fortune to the project.

Early life Wills was born in Seagoville, Texas on July 18, 1902. Career He was a performer from early childhood, forming and leading the Avalon Boys singing group in the 1930s. After appearing in a few westerns he disbanded the group in 1938, and struck out on a solo acting career. One of his more memorable roles was that of the distinctive voice of Francis the Talking Mule in a series of popular films. Wills' deep, rough voice, with its Western twang, was matched to the personality of the cynical, sardonic mule. As was customary at the time, Wills was given no billing for his vocal work, though he was featured prominently on-screen as blustery General Ben Kaye in the fourth entry, Francis Joins the WACS. He provided the deep voice for Stan Laurel's performance of \\"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine\\" in Way Out West (1937), in which the Avalon Boys Quartet appeared. Jack Kruschen, John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, and Wills in McLintock! (1963) Wills was cast in numerous serious film roles, including as \\"the city of Chicago\\" as personified by a phantom police sergeant in the film noir City That Never Sleeps (1953), and that of Uncle Bawley in Giant (1956), which also features Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean. Wills was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Davy Crockett's companion Beekeeper in the film The Alamo (1960). However, his aggressive campaign for the award was considered tasteless by many, including the film's star/director/producer John Wayne, who publicly apologized for Wills. Wills' publicity agent, W.S. \\"Bow- Wow\\" Wojciechowicz, accepted blame for the ill-advised effort, claiming that Wills had known nothing about it. The Oscar was instead won by Peter Ustinov for his role as Lentulus Batiatus in Spartacus.Clark, Donald, & Christopher P. Andersen. John Wayne's The Alamo: The Making of the Epic Film, Carol: 1995. Wills was a poker player and a close friend of Benny Binion, the founder of the World Series of Poker and former owner of Binion's Horseshoe Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. Wills participated in the first World Series, held in 1970, and is seated in the center of the famous picture with a number of legendary players. In 1959 he starred as Bije Wilcox in \\"The Bije Wilcox Story\\" on \\"Wagon Train\\". In Rory Calhoun's western series The Texan, Wills appeared in the lead role in the 1960 episode titled \\"The Eyes of Captain Wylie\\". Wills starred in the short-run series Frontier Circus which aired for only one season (1961‚Äì62) on CBS. In 1966, he was cast in the role of a shady Texas rancher, Jim Ed Love, in the short-lived comedy/western series The Rounders (reprising his role in the 1965 film The Rounders, starring Henry Fonda), with co-stars Ron Hayes, Patrick Wayne and Walker Edmiston. in 1963-64, Wills joined William Lundigan, Walter Brennan and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. in making appearances on behalf of U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater, the Republican nominee in the campaign against U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1968, Wills refused to support Richard Nixon for the presidency and served as master of ceremonies for George C. Wallace, former governor of Alabama, for the California campaign stops in Wallace's presidential campaign.The Politics of Rage: George Wallace, by Dan T. Carter (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1995, 2000), pg. 314; Wills was among the few Hollywood celebrities to endorse Wallace's bid against Nixon and Hubert H. Humphrey; another was Walter Brennan. Also in 1968, he starred in the Gunsmoke episode \\"A Noose for Dobie Price\\", where he played Elihu Gorman, a former outlaw who joins forces with Marshal Matt Dillon, played by James Arness, to track down a member of his former gang who has escaped jail. In 1971, he appeared as Pat Reedy on \\"The Men from Shiloh\\" (rebranded name of the TV western The Virginian) in the episode titled \\"The Angus Killer.\\" His last role was in 1978, as a janitor in Stubby Pringle's Christmas. Death On December 15, 1978, Wills died of cancer in Encino, California, aged 76. He was cremated and interred at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

Overview Syahi is usually black in colour, circular in shape and is made of a mixture of flour, water and iron filings. Originally, syahi was a temporary application of flour and water. Over time it has evolved into a permanent addition. Function Syahi functions by loading only a portion of the stretched skin with weight. In the higher-pitched (usually right-hand) drum (for instance, the tabla proper) this has the effect of altering the resonance frequency of some lower order vibrations more than others. The action on the left hand drum is a little different. On other side (for instance, the bƒÅyƒÅ√± in the tabla), its position is offset and serves simply to lower the resonance frequency. Application An Indian craftsman applying the syahi (Hyderabad, Sind - circa 1977) The application of the syahi is very involved. It starts with a base layer of mucilage, followed by the application of numerous thin layers of syahi masala (flour, water, iron filings and other secret ingredients), which are then rubbed with a stone. Not all of the layers are the same size. But the final product is expected to exhibit a specific shape. The stone abrasion is crucial to creating the syahi. The material from which the syahi is made is inherently inflexible; if it were simply applied in a single layer and allowed to harden, it would not allow the drum to vibrate freely. The process of rubbing or polishing with the stone creates a tight latticework of cracks which extend down to the very base of the syahi, allowing the skin to resonate freely, despite the inherent inflexibility of the syahi's. Producing the latticework The process from the application of the first layer of glue and the finesse in adding the subsequent layers of syahi is the main determinant in the resulting tonal purity of the instrument and also of the longevity of the layers. Once the preliminary leatherskin 'Puri' is fastened onto the face of the tabla, the craftsman applies the glue in a circle on the surface leaving a half-inch margin from the 'Chati'. When the glue is about to set, the syahi is applied in a 2‚Äì3 mm thick layer over the glue with small spikes in the syahi layer. Once the syahi is semi-hardened and not yet dry, the rubbing with the stone begins. The rubbing continues till it removes the spikes and a coarse surface results. On this, layers are then added in reducing concentric circles, each half to one mm thick. The essence lies in beginning the rubbing before the syahi completely hardens and continuing it till the surface is nearly dry when the new layer is added. The rubbing and its proper technique ensures that the layers are each uniformly thick, tapering slightly at the edges to smoothly merge in the layer below. The process of rubbing generates heat in the paste applied and achieves the function of drying the paste and also the frictional vibration of the surface with the stone results in a fine latticework of cracks leaving grains of syahi attached only to the base of the layer below. This structure gives the instrument its exceptional sonority and tonal quality among all percussion instruments and also the rich harmonics which range from its tuned pitch of a few hundred Hertz to a few KiloHertz. If the syahi is allowed to harden without rubbing it continuously, pockets of solidity would be left in the layers and distort the tone and also result in breakage of the grains from the layers within a short span, resulting in a jarring rattling sound during playing. =Wear= The layers, as the leatherskin on which they are applied, are vulnerable to humidity in the weather and also the moisture in the player's hand. Interaction with moisture results in melting of the black crystals. This is the reason why players frequently use powder to keep the hands dry while playing.

It reversed the effects of the Compromise Tariff of 1833, which contained a provision that successively lowered the tariff rates from their level under the Tariff of 1832 over a period of ten years until the majority of dutiable goods were to be taxed at 20%. As the 20% level approached in 1842, industrial interests and members of the Whig Party began clamoring for protection by claiming that the reductions left them vulnerable to European competition. The bill restored protection and raised average tariff rates to almost 40% and stipulated sweeping changes to the tariff schedule and collection system, most of which were designed to augment its protective character. It also replaced most ad valorem rates with specific duties, assessed on a good-by-good basis, and replaced the credit system of tariff finance with a cash payment system, collected at portside customs houses. Legislative history The Black Tariff was signed into law somewhat reluctantly by President John Tyler, following a year of disputes with the Whig leaders in Congress over the restoration of national banking and the government's land disbursement policies. For the previous year, Whig leaders in Congress had sent bills to Tyler coupling the tariff hike with a public land disbursement package, which had been insisted upon by Henry Clay, prompting a presidential veto. In the summer of 1842, representatives from the northeastern manufacturing states began feeling electoral pressures for a tariff hike before the elections that fall and abandoned Clay's land disbursement program. The resulting bill contained the tariff hike alone, which satisfied the manufacturers and was acceptable to Tyler since it lacked the land disbursement provisions. The main beneficiary industry to receive protection under the tariff was iron. Import taxes on iron goods, both raw and manufactured, amounted to almost two thirds of their price overall and exceeded 100% on many items, such as nails and hoop iron. The law also raised the percentage of dutiable goods from just over 50% of all imports to over 85% of all imports. Impact The impact of the 1842 tariff was felt almost immediately, with sharp decline in international trade in 1843. Imports into the United States nearly halved from their 1842 levels and exports, affected by overall trade patterns, dropped by approximately 20%. The Tariff of 1842 was repealed in 1846, when it was replaced by the Walker Tariff. The Whigs' loss of Congress and the presidency in 1844 facilitated a Democratic-led effort to reduce the rates again. Concerns that the Black Tariff's high rates would suppress future trade and, with it, customs revenue fueled the movement to repeal the act.

Career Stang once claimed he gained his break in radio by sending a postcard to a New York station requesting an audition, was accepted, and then bought his own ticket to New York from Chelsea, Massachusetts, with the money set aside for his mother's anniversary gift.Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, August 3, 1947 True or not, Stang worked on New York‚Äìbased network radio shows as a boy, appearing on children's programs such as The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour and Let's Pretend. By 1940, he had graduated to teenaged roles, appearing as Seymour on The Goldbergs. Director Don Bernard hired him in October 1941 to do the commercials on the CBS program Meet Mr. Meek but decided his constantly cracking voice would hurt the commercial so he ordered scriptwriters to come up with a role for him.Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Oct. 26. 1941 He next appeared on the summer replacement show The Remarkable Miss Tuttle with Edna May Oliver in 1942Chicago Tribune, July 19, 1942 and replaced Eddie Firestone Jr. in the title role of That Brewster Boy when Firestone joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1943.Chicago Tribune, Sept. 3, 1943 Comedian Henry Morgan made him a sidekick on his program in fall of 1946 and Stang appeared in similar roles the following year on radio shows with Eddie CantorMiami News, Sept. 25, 1947 and Milton Berle.

Eight years after the Turkish Federated State of North Cyprus was proclaimed (in 1975), the declaration of North Cyprus was presented to the Turkish Cypriot parliament in North Nicosia by Turkish Cypriot Leader and Northern Cypriot State President Rauf Denkta≈ü on November 15, 1983. Containing text espousing human rights and a desire to live side-by-side with the Greek Cypriot population, it ended with a declaration that Northern Cyprus was an independent and sovereign state, naming the entity the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The Turkish Cypriot Parliament passed a unanimous resolution later that day ratifying the declaration.  Background   The declaration  Reactions The United Nations Security Council issued two resolutions (541 and 550) proclaiming that the Turkish Cypriot UDI was legally invalid and requesting that no other sovereign state should recognize the declaration and asked for its withdrawal.Text of Resolution 541 at undocs.orgText of Resolution 550 at undocs.org  Recognition  =UN Countries and the Others= Turkey formally recognized Northern Cyprus on the day its UDI was declared. The parliament of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, which is a self-governing exclave of Azerbaijan, has issued a resolution recognizing the TRNC as a sovereign nation. The decision of International Court of Justice on the declarations of independences In 22 July 2010, United Nations' International Court of Justice non-legally- bindingly decided (in relation to Kosovo) that \\"International law contains no prohibition on declarations of independence\\"; see Political status of Kosovo. The ruling was expected to bolster demands for recognition by Northern Cyprus. The decision of UN ICJ was regarded an inspirational way and another option for Turkish Cypriots. After the ICJ‚Äôs decision on Kosovo‚Äôs unilateral declaration of independency, TRNC gained a huge advantage on the negotiation table and also an innovative Neo-Wilsonist path reopened in international arena. Can Kosovo be a sample for Northern Cyprus? According to international law, previous decisions are not become a precedent. But practically especially after the advisory opinion of ICJ in 2010, it surely will be inspirational way and another option for Cyprus and Cypriot Turks.

The screenplay by Richard Jefferies tells the story of a family terrorized by the former owner of the rural estate they bought in foreclosure. Plot Cooper Tilson (Dennis Quaid), his wife Leah (Sharon Stone) and their two children, Kristen (Kristen Stewart) and Jesse, move from New York to the country after purchasing a Mansion. The previous owner, Dale Massie (Stephen Dorff), convinces Cooper to hire him to help with repairs. Dale, recently released from prison, initially appears to be a good, kind worker. As Cooper sorts through the mess in the house, he comes across many old documents and photographs, and decides to record the history of the building on film. A series of unusual incidents start to occur; Cooper is pursued by an unknown car, multiple venomous snakes are found in the property, and Kristen's horse is mysteriously killed, leading Cooper to suspect Dale. Cooper also witnesses Dale strike his girlfriend Ruby (Juliette Lewis) in a crowded bar. To learn the details of the manor's past, Cooper visit's Dale's ageing, demented father who lives in a nearby nursing home. The man's disjointed comments lead Cooper to believe Dale murdered his wife and children who have been missing for several years; Dale claims his wife fled with the children when he was imprisoned. Sheriff Annie Fergusion, Ruby's sister, is initially skeptical about Cooper's accusation but later slowly starts to believe he may be correct. One afternoon after a heated argument with Dale, Cooper finds a dental retainer along with human teeth in the gravel of his driveway, which he compares to old photos and finds it matches that of Dale's daughter. Afraid for his family's safety, Cooper sends them back to stay in the city while he attempts to gather more evidence to incriminate Dale. Meanwhile, Dale visits his father and smothers him to death when he insults him and reveals his knowledge of Dale's crimes. Later that night as a storm approaches, Leah returns to the house alone, having been informed by the children the location of a deep well on the property, called the Devil's Throat. Using a video camera, she and Cooper lower into the well and find the rotting corpses of Dale's wife and children. Cooper contacts Sheriff Ferguson, unaware Dale has attacked and disabled her. Dale then punctures Cooper's truck tires and burns Leah's car to prevent their escape. Cooper and Leah find themselves trapped in the house as Dale cuts the electricity. After a chase, Dale corners Cooper and Leah atop the roof, and he openly declares his intent to kill them and dump their bodies down the Devil's Throat like he did his family. The couple charge at him with a line of rope, knocking him off his feet, then bind him against a roof lantern. Cooper shatters the skylight, sending Dale to his death. Dale's wife and children's remains are recovered and then entombed in the family graveyard at Cold Creek Manor, their spirits finding the peace they desired. Cast Production The film was shot on location in Cambridge, Kitchener, Ayr, and Toronto, Ontario. Release =Critical response= The movie received negative reviews from critics. It holds a 12% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 111 reviews. The site's consensus states: \\"The plot of Cold Creek Manor is too predictable and contrived to generate suspense.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times observed, \\"A serious filmmaker like Mike Figgis can be forgiven, I suppose, for slumming, when he's got a cast as stellar as the one that infuses the scream-by-numbers thriller Cold Creek Manor with more psychological credibility than its screenplay merits.\\" He said the film \\"belongs to the Cape Fear tradition of thrillers in which the mettle of a civilized family man is tested in a life-or-death struggle with crude macho evil.\\"The New York Times review Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film 1¬Ω stars and called it \\"an anthology of cliches\\" and \\"a thriller that thrills us only if we abandon all common sense.\\" He added, \\"Of course preposterous things happen in all thrillers, but there must be at least a gesture in the direction of plausibility, or we lose patience.\\"Chicago Sun-Times review Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle said, \\"As haunted-house thrillers go, Cold Creek Manor is more ludicrous than the average but at the same time more handsomely produced. Hokum with a big-budget gloss, it's a simple, formulaic nail-biter ... The script ... grafts from every possible thriller ‚Äì most of which had pilfered their predecessors ‚Äì and loads on implausibilities until we wonder why the actors play it seriously.\\"San Francisco Chronicle review Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film one star and commented, \\"It's sad to see risk- taking director Mike Figgis do a generic thriller for a paycheck and then not even screw with the rules . . . the only things haunting this movie are cliches.\\"Rolling Stone review Steve Persall of the St. Petersburg Times graded the film D and thought \\"all this bad acting and run-of-the-thrill dialogue might be entertaining if something would just happen besides a silly snake scare and a wan truck chase. The movie plays like an all-star episode of This Old House for the first hour, a telenovela for the next 30 minutes, then, finally, a hack boogeyman flick in the last reel. This isn't a movie, it's channel surfing.\\"St. Petersburg Times review Todd McCarthy of Variety called the film \\"a woefully predictable imperiled-yuppie-family-under-siege suspenser that hardly seems worth the attention of its relatively high-profile participants. Taking a break from his multiple-perspective digicam experiments, helmer Mike Figgis displays at best a half-hearted interest in delivering the commercial genre goods, while Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone fish in vain to find any angles to play in their dimension-free characters.\\"Variety review =Box office= The film opened in 2,035 theaters in the United States on September 19, 2003, and grossed $8,190,574 in its opening weekend, ranking #5 at the box office, behind Underworld, Secondhand Lions, The Fighting Temptations and Once Upon a Time in Mexico.

The Virginia Kidd Literary Agency has been operating continuously at Arrowhead since 1965. Arrowhead has been a focal point for science fiction writers for over fifty years. Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) was partially conceived at Arrowhead, and hundreds of gatherings of science fiction writers who were later prominent SFWA members were hosted there. History The history of Arrowhead is nothing if not colorful. The grounds and building were seriously flooded in 1955 by the remains of Hurricane Diane and then again in 2004 as a consequence of the deluges that accompanied the profoundly busy hurricane season that year. Each time, reconstruction and retrenchment followed; the building is manifestly sturdy, the oldest portions dating back to the 18th century. Writers and others were welcomed during the sixties and Arrowhead took on many aspects of a commune, though it is probably more fair to describe it as a \\"crash-pad\\". Damon Knight, Kate Wilhelm, Thomas M. Disch, Judith Merril, Lester del Rey, Anne McCaffrey, Arthur C. Clarke, Frederik Pohl and many, many more made the afternoons and evenings at Arrowhead merry and stimulating. There were sleeping bags on the expansive porches, bleary-eyed writer-folk sitting around the kitchen table come morning (or afternoon...) and many a story idea was expounded, dissected, and fleshed out. Folk (and Filk) songs were sung, guitars and an upright piano backed decidedly non-professional voices who made up in enthusiasm for what they lacked in technique. Rock bands practiced and jammed in Arrowhead's basement studio space during the 1970s. One alumnus of these sessions, Damon Knight's son Christopher, went on to found the Los Angeles Recording Workshop (see External Links, below), one of the largest and most elaborate recording instruction facilities in the world. Arrowhead medicine chest door obverse At one point during the early 1970s, the downstairs bathroom received a small graffito from James Blish and Virginia Kidd's son, Ben. Instead of the cleaning and reprimand that one might reasonably expect, within a year, the entire bathroom had been covered floor to ceiling by remarks from eminent science fiction writers, agents, and not a few fans. The walls, the ceiling, the shower stall, even the sides of the bathtub did not escape from the onslaught of writers who found a tabula rasa, no matter if it was only a tiny clear space. Sadly, these were removed in the 1990s. Only one graffito escaped the purge, and still remains as of 2005; an electronic diagram for the RF output stage of a pirate AM radio station on the back of the bathroom medicine cabinet door.

She also appears as a supporting character in the sequel, The Return of the Condor Heroes. In The Legend of the Condor Heroes Huang Rong was born to Huang Yaoshi and Feng Heng. Her mother died shortly after she was born and her father raised her all by himself on Peach Blossom Island. She was an intelligent child and quick learner, so her father imparted her with all his skills and knowledge. She flees from home after a quarrel with her father and disguises herself as a beggar by donning filthy rags. Huang Rong meets Guo Jing for the first time in an inn while she was arguing with a waiter. Guo Jing feels sorry for her and decides to pay for her meal. Huang Rong finds him interesting and she orders all kinds of fine cuisine and shares with him. Guo Jing even gives her some gold ingots he received from Genghis Khan. When she asks, he offers her his prized Ferghana horse, a rare Central Asian breed. Since then, Huang Rong is attracted to Guo Jing as she sees that he is a simple, honest and innocent young lad. Guo Jing and Huang Rong embark on adventure together even though Guo's teachers, the \\"Seven Freaks of Jiangnan\\", dislike Huang and oppose Guo's decision to be with her. They meet Hong Qigong, who teaches Guo Jing his 'Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms' to repay Huang Rong's favours of preparing fine cuisine for him every day during the brief period of time he spent with them. Hong Qigong initially refuses to teach Huang Rong any skills when he learns that she is the daughter of his friendly rival, Huang Yaoshi. However, he starts to like her for her adorable nature, and especially after she and Guo Jing saved him from Ouyang Feng. He fought with Ouyang Feng and won but fell into Ouyang Fengs scheme therefore he was bitten by the latter's poisonous serpent, and lost all his inner energy in purging the venom from his body. He teaches Huang Rong his 'Dog Beating Staff Technique' after deciding to pass on his position as the Beggars' Sect's chief to her. Huang Rong plays a significant role in Yang Kang's death although she does not kill him directly. Yang Kang attacks her with a palm strike in an attempt to prevent her from revealing the truth behind the murders he committed. However, instead, he hits the spikes on the soft armour she is wearing. The armour was incidentally stained with venom from a rare snake bred by Ouyang Feng and the poison seeps through Yang Kang's wounds into his body and kills him eventually. Towards the end of the novel, on the summit of Mount Hua, Huang Yaoshi finally consents to his daughter's marriage to Guo Jing. In The Return of the Condor Heroes Guo Jing and Huang Rong play supporting roles in the character development of the protagonist Yang Guo in the sequel. The couple have three children (Guo Fu, Guo Xiang, and Guo Polu) and have also accepted the brothers Wu Xiuwen and Wu Dunru as their students. During their first meeting with Yang Guo, Guo Jing accepts the boy immediately and wants to raise him like a son and groom him to become a young hero. However, Huang Rong has reservations over her husband's decision. She feels that Yang Guo bears an uncanny resemblance to his late father in his attitude and behaviour, and does not fully trust the boy. Yang was taught only literary arts and Confucian values during the brief period of time he spent with the couple. Huang Rong is responsible for the split of Xiaolong Nu and Yang Guo many times. Huang Rong's attitude towards Yang Guo changes over time as her husband shows high regard for the boy and especially after Yang Guo selflessly saved their family from danger again and again. At one point, she fears for Guo Fu's life, after her daughter sliced off Yang Guo's arm in a heated quarrel, but Yang forgives Guo Fu and saves her life later. Huang Rong only fully trusts Yang after he saved Guo Xiang from the Mongols in a later chapter. Huang Rong joins her husband in defending Xiangyang and provides him with all the support to resist the Mongol invaders. In The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber, it is revealed that the couple realise that the eventual fall of Xiangyang is inevitable, so they wrote their knowledge of martial arts and military strategy on scrolls and hid them separately in the blades of the Heaven Reliant Sword and Dragon Slaying Saber, in the hope that future generations would inherit their legacy. Huang Rong was killed along with the rest of her family (excluding Guo Xiang) after Xiangyang fell to the Mongols. Character description Huang Rong is described as a young beggar dressed in filthy clothing during her first appearance in The Legend of the Condor Heroes. Her face is stained with mud and her clothes are covered in dust. When Guo Jing agrees to meet her on the riverbank, she looks completely different from her earlier image, now that she is clean and dressed in beautiful clothes. Her appearance is described as \\"with skin whiter than snow, charm unrivalled by any, and a presence so stunning, one would almost blush from staring at her too intently\\". Guo Jing is taken aback by her new look.

Guo Jing is unable to fully grasp all these skills. Some of them are listed below. * 'Peach Flower Fallen Hero Palm' (Ê°ÉËä±ËêΩËã±Êéå), known in later editions as 'Falling Flower Divine Sword Palm' (ËêΩËã±Á•ûÂâëÊéå). * 'Divine Flicking Finger' (ÂºπÊåáÁ•ûÈÄö) is a technique of channelling a large amount of inner energy into a finger and releasing it with a precise amount of strength and control. It is used to propel objects towards enemies with force and accuracy. * 'Jade Flute Swordplay' (ÁéâÁÆ´ÂâëÊ≥ï) is a type of swordplay that focuses on attacking an opponent's acupuncture points. =Hong Qigong= Huang Rong meets Hong Qigong while out on adventure with Guo Jing. Hong Qigong teaches them his skills to repay Huang Rong's favours of preparing fine cuisine for him. The skills Huang Rong learnt from Hong Qigong are as follows: * 'Carefree Fist' (ÈÄçÈÅôÈÅä) was created by Hong Qigong in his younger days. It requires flexibility and smoothness as its name \\"carefree\\" implies. * 'Rain of Petals' (ÊªøÂ§©Ëä±Èõ®) is a skill created by Hong Qigong to counter Ouyang Ke and his snakes. It involves using sewing needles as dart-like throwing weapons. * 'Dog Beating Staff Technique' (ÊâìÁãóÊ£íÊ≥ï) is a skill known only to the Beggars' Sect's chief. This technique is one of the best among all pole weapons skills for its ever- changing styles and movements. Hong Qigong teaches Huang Rong when he decides to pass on his position as chief to her. Huang Rong teaches Lu Youjiao this skill later when she names him her successor. =Nine Yin Manual= The Nine Yin Manual is the most coveted martial arts manual of its time because of the incredible inner energy cultivation techniques and extraordinary skills it records. Guo Jing shares with Huang Rong after memorising and learning the skills in the book. Mastering the manual's skills allows both of them to maximise the potential of the various skills they had learnt earlier.cnnovels.net =Miscellaneous skills and knowledge= Huang Rong acquired most of her knowledge of geography, medicine, strategy, mathematics, music, literature, etc. from her father. She also inherited her mother's eidetic memory. She is also versed in the art of laying formations, such as the Eight Trigrams Formation, to counter enemies' advances. She uses her powers to make huge rocks and boulders form an array and maze to confuse enemies and force them to retreat. Huang Rong is an excellent cook. She prepared several fine dishes for Hong Qigong to ask him to teach Guo Jing martial arts. Hong Qigong has a penchant for fine cuisine and could not resist the temptation that he has no choice but to keep his promise and teach Guo Jing.

Baur and Herbert T. Morris founded the company, in the Germantown neighborhood along Sedgley Avenue, with an initial investment of $50,000. First, Baur and Morris had opened a bakery in the Pittsburgh area, selling it to the Ward Baking Company in 1913. When Baur and Morris sold to Ward, the terms of the sale prohibited them from opening another bakery within 100 miles of Pittsburgh, so the partners looked instead to Philadelphia. In November 1913 they settled on the Sedgley Avenue location. Morris's wife came up with the Tastykake name. A Boston student created the Tastykake girl and logo. Then, the company adopted the slogan, \\"The Cake That Made Mother Stop Baking.\\" Tasty Baking Company quickly established success for its Tasty brand, selling $28 worth of cakes at ten cents a piece on its first day of sales, $222 in the first week and grossing $300,000 in sales by the end of 1914. Sales began to expand throughout Eastern Pennsylvania. Until 1941 the company distributed its products almost wholly by horse-drawn delivery wagons, making them an exclusive city treat. But World War II changed all that as the company sent thousands of cakes and pies overseas to soldiers in both the European and Pacific/Asian theaters, vastly expanding its market. Over the years, Tastykake expanded its distribution through many modes of transportation including trucks, electric cars, rails and ships, selling its products in Western Pennsylvania, Virginia and New York. Tastykake retired their last horse in 1941. The Tastykake brand identity expanded further and sales doubled in the late 1950s and early 1960s when the company installed state-of-the-art machinery that cut the baking cycle from twelve hours to forty-five minutes. Philip Baur died in 1951, his heirs purchased stock from Herbert Morris' wife, giving the Baur family majority control of the company. Vice-President Paul R. Kaiser became president, and Morris, who had served as president since the company's inception, became chairman of the board. In April 1954, Kaiser was able to report that the Tastykake territory had grown to cover parts of nine states and the District of Columbia. By the end of the decade, annual sales had grown to nearly $22.9 million. 1959 boycott In 1959, a group from Philadelphia who referred to themselves as the 400 ministers, formulated a new strategy for using black consumer power, rather than the city's liberal civil rights networks, to press private employers to improve job opportunities for black workers. Led by Reverend Leon Sullivan, the group believed it was important that the public be conditioned to seeing African Americans doing more than menial jobs in the community. The local branch had approached the management of Tastykake, about employing black workers in the lucrative position of \\"driver-salesman.\\" Driver-salesmen both drove the company's' delivery trucks and sold the company's goods to grocery stores and other retail outlets and thus were able to earn lucrative commissions on top of their salaries. Although the activists' talks with Tastykake, were cordial, most refused to change their employment policies. Since Tastykake had failed to respond to their entreaties, the ministers declared that they intended to stop buying the company's snack foods and they hoped their congregants would join them. On June 16, the ministers announced that Tastykake was to be the target of the first selective patronage campaign and that Rev. Sullivan would serve as spokesperson and chief negotiator for the campaign. Tastykake was known for hiring a large number of black workers, even though it restricted them to certain production departments and was rumored to require them to use segregated restroom and locker facilities. The company's products were very popular among African American neighborhoods and therefore profitable for both Tastykake and the black owned groceries stores. The key to the boycott's success would be to convince 150 black grocery chains to stop selling the lucrative product for the bigger cause of fair employment practices for black workers. With hand made signs in windows declaring the refusal to sell the products, Leon Sullivan and the ministers were successful in unifying the black communities. Tastykake finally agreed to negotiate with the ministers. On August 7, 1959, the ministers announced the end to the boycott. The company's black drivers now had fixed routes, African American women were working in positions previously reserved for white women, and all of the plants' facilities had been desegregated. Product history In 1927 Tastykake introduced its Butterscotch Krimpet and soon thereafter a line of individually wrapped fruit and cream pies, all of which were bundled in wax- paper, a tradition that lasted into the 1960s. The Tandy-Kake, first on the market in 1931, later became the Kandy Kake, the most popular cake in the company's history, with nearly half a million baked and packaged each day. In the 1970s and 80s, Tastykake sought to respond to the changing demographics and aging population of the region. A flurry of new product development added muffins, chocolate-covered pretzels, and pastries. Despite being a predominantly regional product, the company obtained ingredients from around the world, including sugarcane and cocoa from Africa's Ivory Coast, vanilla from Madagascar, cinnamon from Indonesia, nutmeg from the East and West Indies, and banana puree from Ecuador. Other ingredients frequently employed are high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated vegetable oil. Production facilities Tasty Baking owned and operated a major production facility in the Allegheny West neighborhood of Philadelphia, between Allegheny Station and East Falls Station along the SEPTA Manayunk/Norristown Line. A second, smaller facility is located in Oxford, in Chester County. The Oxford plant makes honey buns and use to make most of the mini-donuts and donut holes under the Tastykake brand name, as well as several private-label items. They stopped making donuts here. Just honeybuns and bread and rolls are made in Oxford. In May 2007, Tasty Baking announced it would move its headquarters and main bakery to the Philadelphia Naval Business Center in South Philadelphia. The new bakery is located on South 26th Street, with the headquarters on Crescent Drive. The move was completed in May 2010.Tastykake Baker Finds a Home in the Revamped Philadelphia Navy Yard Financials The Tasty Baking Company went public on the NYSE in 1961 under the ticker symbol TBC. On October 21, 2005, the company transitioned to the NASDAQ National Market and changed their ticker symbol to TSTY. The company's ticker symbol was ceased from trading at the close of business on May 24, 2011, upon completion of its acquisition by Flowers Foods.

The price of Tastykake stock collapsed in early 2011, falling from a closing price of $6.43 on January 4, closing at $4.05 the next day.EDGAR Online, Inc This decline, of about one-third the share price, was accompanied by a spike in trading (from about 5,000 shares on January 4, to almost 1,000,000 the next day). This move came after a 7.4% drop in company sales during the preceding quarter of 2010. The next week, speculation in financial circles indicated Tastykake had failed to realize the projected savings of moving to the new factory. Charlie Pizzi made many bad decisions with handling Tastykake. The company lost money every year since he took over. On April 11, 2011, media reports indicated Tastykake's leadership agreed to sell the company to Flowers Foods, of Thomasville, Georgia, for $34 million in cash, or about $4 per share. (Tastykake stock closed at $1.61 per share at the end of the previous trading day.) The sale to Flowers Foods was good news to Pennsylvania taxpayers, because Tastykake borrowed approximately $80 million to fund its new location in South Philadelphia, about half of which was from state lending programs. In popular culture Tastykake has been a longtime sponsor of the Philadelphia Flyers, who award a case of their desserts whenever a Flyer scored. The cases are usually given to charity in the player's name. Legendary Flyers broadcaster and Hall of Famer Gene Hart's signature goal call went: \\"He shoots, he scores, for a case of Tastykake!\\" Retrieved 2017-07-15 Tastykake has also been a longtime sponsor of Philadelphia Phillies broadcasts. Hall of Fame announcer Harry Kalas (1936‚Äì2009) often announced that a box of Tastykakes had been delivered to the booth between innings. At his memorial service at Citizens Bank Park in April 2009, mourners were treated to Tastykakes and soft pretzels.

He was active in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Black Panther Party, and the League of Revolutionary Black Workers. As the executive secretary of SNCC from 1961 to 1966, Forman played a significant role in the freedom rides, the Albany movement, the Birmingham campaign, and the Selma to Montgomery marches. After the 1960s, Forman spent the rest of his adult life organizing black people around issues of social and economic equality. He also taught at American University and other major institutions. He wrote several books documenting his experiences within the movement and his evolving political philosophy including Sammy Younge Jr.: The First Black College Student to Die in the Black Liberation Movement (1969), The Making of Black Revolutionaries (1972 and 1997) and Self Determination: An Examination of the Question and Its Application to the African American People (1984). The New York Times called him \\"a civil rights pioneer who brought a fiercely revolutionary vision and masterly organizational skills to virtually every major civil rights battleground in the 1960s.\\" Early life and education Forman was born on October 4, 1928, in Chicago, Illinois. As an 11-month-old baby, he was sent to live with his grandmother, \\"Mama Jane\\", on her farm in Marshall County, Mississippi. He was raised in a \\"dirt-poor\\" environment; it was not uncommon for him to eat dirt because it was believed to have some nutritional value. In his autobiography, he called eating dirt a \\"staple\\" of his diet. He recalls being \\"hungry all the time.\\" His family had no outhouse and no electricity. They used leaves, newspapers, and corncobs for toilet paper, and they used twigs as toothbrushes. Despite these things, Forman claims to have never questioned his poverty and did not understand it at the time. His Aunt Thelma once caught James reading a shopping catalog in the dark. She, being a school teacher, took an interest in accelerating James' studying and gave him lessons at home. James credits his upbringing for his eventual successes, saying his grandmother gave him a sense for justice while his aunt gave him his \\"intellectual fire.\\" =Awareness of racism= James' first experience with lynching came when a white man showed up on his doorstep, asking for food and asking that they not tell anyone where he was. The next day, news spread that a white man had been lynched although Forman never learned why. When Forman was around the age of six he had his first experience with racial segregation. While visiting an aunt in Tennessee, Forman attempted to buy a Coca-Cola from a local drugstore. He was told that if he wanted to buy one that he would have to drink it in the back and not at the counter. Confused, Forman asked why and was told \\"Boy, you're a nigger.\\" This was the first time in his life he realized that because of the color of his skin that there were \\"things [he] could and could not do, and other people had the 'right' to tell [him] what [he] could and could not do.\\" In the summer of 1935, Forman moved to Chicago to live with his mother and step-father. That September he enrolled in St. Anselm's Catholic School, his first official schooling, and was immediately put into the second grade. He adjusted to his new life in Chicago fairly well, when playing with the neighborhood kids he would throw rocks and cans at white pedestrians and threw bricks off of roofs and onto police cars. However, his new school put a lot of pressure on him to convert to Catholicism, with his Protestantism becoming a \\"great issue\\" by the 6th grade. Being the only Protestant at an all-Catholic school put James through \\"great emotional turmoil.\\" He decided to transfer to the local public school, the Betsy Ross Grammar School. He did so well there that he was allowed to skip the first semester of the seventh grade. From the age of seven onward, James earned a small amount from selling issues of the Chicago Defender. He would often read these papers which helped develop a \\"strong sense of protest.\\" He read the works of Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Du Bois and was heavily influenced by Du Bois. He called Washington an \\"apologist\\" and often quoted Du Bois and his call for advancing blacks through education. He had yet to enter high school but for James the \\"race issue was on my mind, before my eyes, and in my blood.\\" After finishing his primary education, Forman enrolled in Englewood Technical Prep Academy. He started his high school career by taking vocational courses instead of the general, pre-college coursework. This led to a poor performance and eventually a suspension from school. He was sent to a continuation school, Washburne High, he got a job as a paper roller at Cueno Press, and joined a gang known as the \\"Sixty-first Raiders.\\" His gang activity was very limited in scope and he said he thought using drugs was \\"a waste of time.\\" Around the age of fourteen James Forman, who had been going under the name of James Rufus, found out that his step-father was not his real father by happening upon his own birth certificate. His real father was a cab driver that Forman coincidentally met and introduced himself to while working at his step-father's gas station. When Forman returned to high school he returned to general coursework and was an honors student. During school he was influenced by the writings of such figures as Richard Wright and Carl Sandburg. He received ROTC training and the Chicago Tribune Silver and Gold medal for efficiency as a non-commissioned officer; he was a lieutenant upon graduation. He was also the honor student of his graduating class which landed him an interview in the Chicago Tribune. During the interview he said that when he grew up he wanted to become a \\"humanitarian\\" and a minister as opposed to a preacher. He graduated high school in January 1947. Shortly after Forman graduated high school he was kicked out of his house after an argument with his stepfather. He tried to join the United States Army for a two year period but because of a racial quota he had to settle on joining the United States Air Force for a period of three years. Due to the Korean War his stay was extended to four years. Forman would go on to regret this decision and call the armed forces a \\"dehumanizing machine which destroys thought and creativity in order to preserve the economic system and the political myths of the United States.\\" He met his first wife, Mary, in California two weeks before being shipped off to Okinawa in 1948. They divorced three years later, in 1951. After his discharge the penniless Forman moved to the slums of Oakland. He was eventually able to raise enough money to attend the University of Southern California. During his second semester, after a long night of studying, a police car stopped in front of him. They called him out and said that a robbery had occurred and Forman looked suspicious. Forman denied any wrongdoing but was apprehended anyway. He demanded a phone call and various other civil rights but instead was locked up for three days while being beaten and interrogated. This caused him severe trauma, for which he sought therapy. Forman overcame his trauma and returned to Chicago in 1954. His step-father died that summer and he enrolled at Roosevelt University that fall. He became president of the student body at Roosevelt and graduated in three years. Forman then went to graduate school at Boston University where he began to develop the ideas of a successful social movement. He wanted blacks to come together and start a visible movement. He knew the movement had to use nonviolent direct action, students, and it had to be started in the South. He was also against monolithic, charismatic leaders because he wanted whatever was created to not die along with the leader. In 1958 he visited Little Rock, Arkansas because he was tired of being an \\"armchair revolutionary.\\" He taught in Chicago's public schools and worked with dispossessed tenant farmers in Tennessee before joining SNCC. National organizing with SNCC final march from Selma, March 1965 In 1961, Forman joined the newly formed Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC, pronounced \\"snick\\"). From 1961 to 1966, Forman, a decade older and more experienced than most of the other members of SNCC, became responsible for providing organizational support to the young, loosely affiliated activists by paying bills, radically expanding the institutional staff and planning the logistics for programs. Under the leadership of Forman and others, SNCC became an important political player at the height of the civil rights movement. SNCC began as an affiliate of another direct action group of the movement, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference. At times, Forman's more confrontational and radical style of activism clashed with King's Christian pacifist approach. In August 1961, Forman was jailed with other freedom riders protesting segregated facilities in Monroe, North Carolina. This episode brought him into contact with Robert F. Williams who won Forman's admiration. During a visit to Williams' home in Monroe, Forman discussed the positive role of using armed self-defense in the struggle against white oppression.https://biography.jrank.org/pages/2576/Forman-James-Dedicated-Life- Fighting-Oppression.html#ixzz6ZMixHXoB After his sentence was suspended, Forman agreed to become executive secretary of SNCC. Forman's occasional criticism of Dr. King was not simply a political exercise, but reflected a genuine concern about the direction King was leading the movement in. He specifically questioned King's top-down leadership style, which he saw as undermining the development of local grassroots movements. For example, following W. G. Anderson's invitation to King to join the Albany Movement, Forman criticized the move because he felt much harm could be done by interjecting the Messiah complex. He recognized that King's presence would detract from, rather than intensify, the focus on local people's leadership in the movement. Forman echoed the concerns of those in SNCC and the broader civil rights movement who saw the potential dangers of relying too heavily upon one dynamic leader. In an interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book Who Speaks for the Negro?, Forman laid out many of his ideologies concerning SNCC, commenting that it is \\"the one movement in this country that has within its spheres of activity room for intellectuals.\\" Years before the famous Selma marches of 1965, Forman and other SNCC organizers visited the city to assist the voter registration work of Amelia Boynton and J. L. Chestnut. In addition to frontline organizing, Forman facilitated a visit by celebrities James Baldwin and Dick Gregory for Selma's first \\"Freedom Day\\" in October 1963‚Äîa day of mass African-American voter registration in a Jim Crow area. Forman did significant work for SNCC in the cultural community. For instance, Forman recruited the young folk star Bob Dylan to play benefits and rallies for SNCC ( One of these rallies in Mississippi makes an appearance in the classic documentary Don't Look Back). When Dylan received an award from the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee he said the honor really belonged to \\"James Forman and SNCC.\\" =Selma and Montgomery= When the second march out of Selma was turned around by Martin Luther King, Tuskegee Institute students decided to open a \\"Second Front\\" by marching to the Alabama State Capitol and delivering a petition to Governor George Wallace. They were quickly joined by Forman and much of the SNCC staff from Selma. The SNCC members distrusted King more than ever after the \\"turnaround Tuesday,\\" and were eager to take a separate course. On March 11, SNCC began a series of demonstrations in Montgomery, and put out a national call for others to join them. James Bevel, SCLC's Selma leader, followed them and discouraged their activities, bringing him and SCLC into conflict with Forman and SNCC. Bevel accused Forman of trying to divert people from the Selma campaign and of abandoning nonviolent discipline. Forman accused Bevel of driving a wedge between the student movement and the local black churches. The argument was resolved only when both were arrested.\\"1965-Students March in Montgomery; Confrontation at Dexter Church\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans History and Timeline On March 15 and 16, SNCC led several hundred demonstrators, including Alabama students, Northern students, and local adults, in protests near the capitol complex. The Montgomery County sheriff's posse met them on horseback and drove them back, whipping them. Against the objections of James Bevel, some protesters threw bricks and bottles at police. At a mass meeting on the night of the 16th, Forman \\"whipped the crowd into a frenzy\\" demanding that the President act to protect demonstrators, and warned, \\"If we can't sit at the table of democracy, we'll knock the fucking legs off.\\"Gary May, Bending Toward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy (Basic Books, 2013) p. 107, 126\\"1965-Protests and Police Violence Continue in Montgomery; Brutal Attack in Montgomery\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans History and Timeline The New York Times featured the Montgomery confrontations on the front page the next day.\\"1965-Wednesday, March 17\\", Civil Rights Movement Veterans History and Timeline Although Dr. King was concerned by Forman's violent rhetoric, he joined him in leading a march of 2000 people in Montgomery to the Montgomery County courthouse. SNCC protesters in Montgomery, March 17, 1965 According to historian Gary May, \\"City officials, also worried by the violent turn of events‚Ä¶ apologized for the assault on SNCC protesters and invited King and Forman to discuss how to handle future protests in the city.\\" In the negotiations, Montgomery officials agreed to stop using the county posse against protesters, and to issue march permits to blacks for the first time. >Gary May, Bending Toward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy, (New York: Basic Books, 2013) p. 129 =Post-SNCC work= After being replaced by Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson as executive secretary, Forman remained close to the leadership of SNCC helping to negotiate the ill-fated \\"merger\\" of SNCC and the Black Panther Party in 1967 and even briefly taking a leadership position within the Panthers. In 1969, after the failure of the merger and the decline of SNCC as an effective political organization, Forman began associating with other Black political radical groups. In Detroit he participated in the Black Economic Development Conference, where his Black Manifesto was adopted. He also founded a nonprofit organization called the Unemployment and Poverty Action Committee. As a part of his \\"Black Manifesto\\", on a Sunday morning in May 1969, Forman interrupted services at New York City's Riverside Church to demand $500 million in reparations from white churches to make up for injustices African Americans had suffered over the centuries. Although Riverside's preaching minister, the Rev. Ernest T. Campbell, termed the demands \\"exorbitant and fanciful,\\" he was in sympathy with the impulse, if not the tactic. Later, the church agreed to donate a fixed percentage of its annual income to anti-poverty efforts. On May 30, 1969, Forman made plans to pursue a similar course at a Jewish Synagogue, Congregation Emanu-El of the City of New York. Members of the Jewish Defense League (JDL), led by Rabbi Meir Kahane, showed up carrying chains and clubs promising to confront Forman if he attempted to enter the synagogue. Kahane and the JDL forewarned Forman and the public about their intended actions and Forman never showed up at the synagogue. Later life and death During the 1970s and 1980s, Forman completed graduate work at Cornell University in African and African-American Studies and in 1982, he received a Ph.D. from the Union of Experimental Colleges and Universities, in cooperation with the Institute for Policy Studies. Forman spent the rest of his adult life organizing black and disenfranchised people around issues of progressive economic and social development and equality. He also taught at American University in Washington, D.C. He wrote several books documenting his experiences within the movement and his evolving political philosophy including Sammy Younge Jr.: The First Black College Student to Die in the Black Liberation Movement (1969), The Making of Black Revolutionaries (1972 and 1997) and Self Determination: An Examination of the Question and Its Application to the African American People (1984). Forman died on January 10, 2005, of colon cancer, aged 76, at the Washington House, a hospice in Washington, DC. Personal life Forman's marriages to Mary Forman and Mildred Thompson ended in divorce. He was married to Mildred Thompson Forman (now Mildred Page) from 1959 to 1965, during the most active period of SNCC. Mildred Forman moved to Atlanta with James and worked at the Atlanta SNCC office as well as working as coordinator for tours of The Freedom Singers. During the 1960s and 1970s, Forman lived with Constancia \\"Dinky\\" Romilly, the second and only surviving child of the British-born journalist, anti-fascist activist and aristocrat, the Hon. Jessica Mitford, and her first husband, Esmond Romilly, who was a nephew-by-marriage of Sir Winston Churchill. Though obituaries and other posthumous articles about Forman have stated that he and Romilly were married, correspondence between Romilly's mother and aunts state that the couple were not legally husband and wife.According to a 13 March 1967 letter written at the time of the birth of the couple's first child by Constancia's aunt Deborah, the Duchess of Devonshire, to her sister Nancy Mitford, Romilly and Forman remained unwed \\"because she is white & would be a handicap to him in his political career (he is the right-hand man of one of the leading Negro politicians from the South) & I suppose that is rather insulting ...\\" Shortly afterward, Romilly's mother wrote to Nancy Mitford on 6 April 1967, \\"I don't quite fathom why she doesn't get married (as the babe's father, Jim Foreman [sic], and her have been living together for ages); but she seems happy with her rum lot, so that's a comfort.\\" The full text of the letters and other correspondence regarding Forman and Romilly's relationship and the births of their children appear in the following volume: Charlotte Mosley, editor, \\"The Mitfords: Letters Between Six Sisters\\", London: Fourth Estate, 2007, pp. 485-486 and 488. Forman and Romilly had two sons: Chaka Forman and James Forman Jr., who is a professor at Yale Law School. =Atheism= In his autobiography The Making Of Black Revolutionaries Forman devoted an entire chapter to explaining his atheism. He believed that \\"belief in God hurts my people.\\" He also received the African American Humanist Award in 1994.

Based on Frances Mayes' 1996 memoir of the same name, the film is about a recently divorced writer who buys a villa in Tuscany on a whim, hoping it will lead to a change in her life. The film was nominated for the Art Directors Guild Excellence in Production Design Award, and Diane Lane received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance. Plot Frances Mayes (Diane Lane) is a San Francisco writer whose seemingly perfect life takes an unexpected turn when she learns that her husband has been cheating on her. The divorce‚Äîand the loss of her house to her ex-husband and his much-younger, pregnant new partner‚Äîleaves her depressed and unable to write. Her best friend Patti (Sandra Oh), a lesbian who is expecting a child, is beginning to think Frances might never recover. She urges Frances to take an Italian vacation to Tuscany using the ticket she purchased before she became pregnant. At first, Frances refuses, but after another depressing day in her gloomy apartment, she decides that it's a good idea to get away for a while. In Tuscany, her tour group stops in the small town of Cortona. After wandering through the charming streets, she notices a posting for a villa for sale in Cortona. She rejoins her tour group on the bus, and just outside town, the bus stops to allow a flock of sheep to cross the road. While they wait, Frances realizes that they've stopped directly in front of the very villa that she had seen for sale‚Äîsomething she believes is a sign. She asks the driver to stop and she gets off the bus. Through a series of serendipitous events, she becomes the owner of a lovely yet dilapidated villa in beautiful Tuscany. Frances begins her new life with the help of a variety of interesting characters and unusual but gentle souls. She hires a crew of Polish immigrants to renovate the house. Over time, Frances also befriends her Italian neighbors and develops relationships with her Polish workers, the realtor who sold her the villa, and Katherine (Lindsay Duncan), an eccentric aging British actress who evokes the mystery and beauty of an Italian film star. Later, she is visited by the now very pregnant Patti, whose partner Grace has left her. Frances meets and has a brief romantic affair with Marcello (Raoul Bova), but their relationship does not last. She is about to give up on happiness when one of her Polish workers, a teenager named Pawel (Pawel Szajda), and a neighbor's young daughter come to her for help. Her father does not approve of him, due to his being Polish and not having a family, yet they are very much in love and want to get married. Frances persuades the girl's family to support their love, by proclaiming that she is Pawel's family, and the young lovers are soon married at the villa. During the wedding celebration, Frances meets an American writer who is traveling in Tuscany, and their attraction for each other points to a romantic future.

His career included documentation of the Klondike Gold Rush period in Seattle, natural landscapes in the Northwest, and infrastructure projects in Seattle. Early life Asahel Curtis was born in 1874 in MinnesotaUniversity of Washington to Johnson Asahel Curtis (1840‚Äì1887) and Ellen Sheriff (1844‚Äì1912). Johnson Curtis was a clergyman and American Civil War veteran who was born in Ohio to a father born in Canada and mother from Vermont. Ellen Sheriff was born in New York City,Seattle Post Intelligencer, Friday, December 13, 1912 and both of her parents were born in England. Asahel's siblings were Raphael Curtis (1862‚Äìc1885) aka Ray Curtis; Eva Curtis (10 May 1870 Whittaker, WI-1967, Tacoma Co, WA); and Edward Sheriff Curtis (1868‚Äì1952), a photographer and ethnologist. In 1880 the family was living in Cordova, Minnesota, part of Le Sueur County, and Johnson Curtis was working as a retail grocer. When Edward and Asahel were teenagers they had a homemade camera. In 1885 at the age of seventeen Edward took his interest in photography and became an apprentice photographer in St. Paul, Minnesota. Career When the Curtis family moved to Washington state in 1888, Edward and Asahel were just teenagers. As their careers grew, their choice of subjects became increasingly different. Edward spent 33 years documenting the traditional life of the Native American Indians. Asahel photographed Washington's natural resources and related industries, as well as the early cities of Washington state, historic events, and its population. Asahel's brother, Edward Sheriff Curtis, supported the family by opening a photography studio in Seattle, and Asahel went to work for him in 1894. In 1897, the brothers agreed that Asahel should go to the Yukon and document the Klondike Gold Rush. Asahel remained there for two years, alternately taking pictures and working a small and largely unproductive claim. Asahel launched his photography career with that two year trip to Alaska and the Klondike. Charles Ainsworth, his mining partner, was among the many gold-seeking miners Asahel photographed between 1897 and 1899. After working together for a few years, Edward and Asahel parted ways forever after a bitter disagreement over the rights to Asahel's Yukon photos, which Edward had published under his own name. From then on, the brothers traveled separate paths. A 1908 parade in Seattle, tinted photograph by Asahel Curtis Edward concentrated on securing funding for the North American Indian project through lectures and photograph showings. Edward later became nationally recognized for his twenty-volume series of photographs of Native Americans. Asahel also enjoyed a successful career as a photographer, although he did not receive the acclaim that Edward did. He married Florence Carney in 1902. In 1911, Asahel established his own studio in Seattle and employed a team of developers and colorists, including his sister Eva. He was hired by a number of local companies, organizations, and wealthy individuals to take portraits and promotional photos. He became more widely known for his images of the Washington landscape that were published nationwide. The Asahel Curtis Photo Company Photographs in the collection of the University of Washington Libraries Digital Collection of 1,677 items provides one of the most valuable photographic records of Seattle, the state of Washington, Alaska, and the Klondike, covering a period from the 1850s until 1940. Photo of Mt. Rainier by Asahel Curtis, 1908 Curtis was a keen observer of people, places and events, Asahel documented the Washington timber, agriculture, fishing and mining industries. He photographed historic events such as presidential visits, the building of the dams on the Columbia River, and Seattle's ambitious Denny Regrade project. Curtis appreciated the beauty and uniqueness of Mt. Rainier so much that for several decades he directed his appreciation for scenic beauty and his efforts at regional boosterism and combined them into the development of Mt. Rainier National Park. Curtis was a founding member of the Mountaineers, a mountain-climbing group which also promoted the preservation of wilderness areas. Curtis was active in the affairs of the club for the first several years after its founding in 1906. He led the Mountaineers on climbs up Mt. Rainier and organized a committee within the club to deal with the Mt. Rainier National Park. Curtis said: > One comes more intimately in touch with the mountains when he travels the > trails. In the valleys the forests seem lower, the giant trees rise from > one's side to tremendous heights and the lower growth reaches out a friendly > hand to bid you welcome; but it is on the untrodden mountain heights that > the traveler receives a true reward for his toil. Here where vegetation > makes its last stand amid a world of ice and snow, with the lower world > stretching away to the distant horizon, nature unfolds in all her beauty. Curtis's involvement in the Seattle-Tacoma Rainier National Park Committee (later the Rainier National Park Advisory Board) strained his relations with the Mountaineers. The committee, which Curtis chaired from 1912 to 1936, was formed by community business interests to take advantage of the park's tourism potential. Curtis, through the committee, sought to promote greater accessibility to the park by building roads to increase tourism. His opposition to the expansion of the Olympic National Park in the late 1930s as a representative of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce and the timber industry, led to a further deterioration of relations with the Mountaineers. It also caused a rift between Curtis and his fellow Mt. Rainier boosters and effectively ended his involvement in park affairs. Curtis's advocacy was not limited to the development of Mt. Rainier National Park. While serving as the official photographer for the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, he also chaired its Development Committee and its Highway Committee for years. His interests reached beyond the Puget Sound region. Curtis owned a small orchard in Ellensburg, and he believed that the productivity of Central Washington could be improved by building irrigation projects to turn the arid region into cropland. The Washington Irrigation Association thus chose Curtis to be its president in the 1920s. He also participated in the affairs of the Washington State Good Roads Association, serving as its president in 1932 and 1933. Curtis worked in his Seattle studio until his death in 1941. Sixty thousand of his images are held in trust by the Washington State Historical Society in Tacoma. Legacy The Upper and Lower Curtis Glaciers on Mount Shuksan in North Cascades National Park were named for Curtis, who made an early ascent of the mountain in 1906. The Asahel Curtis Trail is located in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, near the heavily travelled Snoqualmie Pass along Interstate 90.

In those games which follow the Dungeons & Dragons traditions, monks are characters with excellent martial arts skills and who specialize in unarmed, unarmored combat. Many role-playing video games include warrior classes similar to the Dungeons & Dragons monk. The monk class has also found its way into NetHack and Linley's Dungeon Crawl, which borrow elements of the class from Dungeons & Dragons. Conversely, in Guild Wars released in 2005, the monk is similar to the cleric class of other popular games, using spiritual powers to heal and purge disease. Dungeons & Dragons The monk is a character class in the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game which is typically portrayed as a master of martial arts. It is loosely based on the stereotype of Shaolin Buddhist warrior-monks. The Dungeons & Dragons monk specializes in unarmed combat, with no use of armor and only special \\"monk weapons\\", such as kama or nunchaku. The monk class, as with other classes of the Dungeons & Dragons game, utilizes a spiritual element, Ki, that augments their fighting through the use of special abilities gained with experience. These powers and abilities are not traditional magic spells as would be gained from other similar character classes such as clerics and rangers (which also rely heavily on the wisdom attribute). Attacks by an unarmed monk are soon treated the same as a strike from a weapon with magical enhancements. Monks gain increased speed, attacks per round, high saving throws against special attacks, and immunities unique to the class as experience grows. Monks become increasingly difficult to hit because of their dexterity and armor class bonuses. Monks can gain high spell resistances, making them dangerous to mages, but, in some circumstances, can be overwhelmed when attacked by many enemies at once. Diablo Diablo 3 features a monk character class as a melee attacker, using martial arts to cripple foes, resist damage, deflect projectiles, attack with blinding speed, and land explosive killing blows. It combines the melee elements of Diablo II's assassin class with the \\"holy warrior\\" role of the paladin. Blizzard has stated that the monk is not related in any way to the monk class from the Sierra Entertainment-made Diablo: Hellfire expansion. The monk is fueled by spirit, which has defensive purposes and is slowly generated through attacking, though it does not degenerate World of Warcraft In World of Warcraft, Humans, Dwarves, Night Elves, Gnomes, Draenei, Orc, Forsaken, Tauren, Trolls, Blood Elves, and Pandarens can be Monks as of World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria expansion. Monks rely on bare-handed combat and use their weapons for a finishing strike. EverQuest In the game EverQuest, the monk class can be chosen only by the human, lizardman (Iksar), Froglok, or drakkin races. Monks have hand-to-hand combat skills, and can fight with or without weapons, using fists or staves, and able to use only leather armor and lighter because of their weight limit restriction. Monks gain the ability to feign death. This gives the Monk the ability to drop to the ground and cause enemies to forget about his presence, or in MMORPG terms, lose aggro. This technique is useful for pulling, or bringing monsters to a party of player characters to be killed. The monk class also has the capability to mend wounds, which can heal a quarter of his or her total hit points or an ally's. Vanguard: Saga of Heroes Vanguard: Saga of Heroes was created by the same executive producer as EverQuest, and so Vanguard Monks share many of the qualities as the EverQuest Monk. In addition, Vanguard adds a healer class called the Disciple, which is similar to a Monk who also can use unique healing techniques. The primary difference in Vanguard is that the monk's \\"signature\\" area of expertise is delivering area of effect (AOE) damage via melee, a role not present in most games except, sometimes in some limited way due to a particular special ability or talent. Final Fantasy In Square Enix's Final Fantasy series of role-playing video games, the Monk () is a character class (or \\"job\\"). It is frequently also referred as the Black Belt. In Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy III an upgraded, more powerful form of the class appears, named Karate Master or Karateka („Åã„Çâ„Å¶„Åã). In Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, Bangaas have the ability to become a Monk. Final Fantasy games that don't use the job-system usually have a representative for the Monk class. Examples of this representative character are Sabin Rene Figaro of FFVI and Tifa Lockhart of FFVII. Ragnarok Online In Gravity Corp's MMORPG Ragnarok Online, Acolytes can choose their second job as a Monk. The monk is a physical/melee class that can, although rarely, provide secondary support in the absence of a priest (for the buffs blessing and agi up)\\". It is most noted for an ability called \\"Asura Strike\\" (sometimes called Guillotine Fist, or Extremity Fist); an attack some consider the most powerful ability in the game, which may result in damage exceeding possible character health. With the right weapon and appropriately built stats, Asura Strike can do massive amounts of damage in a single hit. Their roles in PvE is either to be the main source of damage to a boss monster, or to let to boss and his minions hit him while other players provide the damage. In War of the Emperium (WoE), they are mostly used for ground control, staying in the backlines and taking out enemy characters that get too close. Five types‚Äîcalled \\"builds\\"‚Äîof the Monk character class are the Combo Monk, Spirit Monk, Dasher Monk, Asura Monk, and Diamond Monk. Each class requires certain stats combined with specific skills in order to reach their effectiveness. *Combo Monk: Usually the fastest attacker of the five types. The Combo Monk utilizes the \\"Raging Trifecta Blow,\\" \\"Raging Quadruple Blow,\\" and \\"Raging Thrust\\" abilities to string together multiple attacks. A fast leveling build, although it lacks somewhat in player versus player situations due to lack of burst damage skills and accuracy. *Spirit Monk: Uses Spirit Spheres to power its skills. The Spirit Monk is often feared by higher defense builds, as the skill \\"Occult Impaction\\" does more damage to more resistant targets. Versatile, and also capable of killing most players with \\"Asura Strike,\\" though not generally nearing the damage of a monk dedicated to the skill. *Dasher Monk: Makes use of the skill \\"Snap\\" (sometimes called Dash Like a Bullet) to get around the battlefield quickly. Considered a hybrid between combo and spirit, but is often difficult to play, owing to the widely spread skill tree required to receive the \\"Snap\\" skill. *Asura Monk: Asura monks utilize the Asura Strike skill to deal massive amounts of damage in one blow. In PvP, the idea is to take out a target in one blow (thus preventing them from regaining hp either via potions or heals from allies). The damage of the skill is based on the users attack, and remaining amount of SP. The skill instantly uses up all remaining SP, and prevents regeneration for five minutes after use. SP can be regained afterwards either by using SP regenerating consumables (such as blue potions, or strawberries), or by the aid of an allied professor via the skill Soul Exhale. Properly geared and buffed Asura Monks can deal upwards of 200,000 to 300,000 damage, which is very useful for boss battles. Generally, these monks have high STR and DEX, depending on whether they were meant for PvP or PvE, and moderate amounts for INT. *Diamond Monk: Taken from the Japanese name for the \\"Mental Strength\\" skill, the Diamond Monk is built to withstand massive amounts of both physical and magical damage. The skill is not interruptible, and reduces all incoming damage by 90%. The reduction further stacks with the users MDEF and DEF, as well as the priest skill Assumptio, making a Mental Strength champ undeniably the best tank in the PvE world. It is used almost exclusively to take damage while other players attack, as while the Mental Strength state, all of the user's active skills are disabled. The hardest type of monk to create, owing to its lack of offensive capabilities. Leveling such a monk usually requires the help of allies, in a method known as leeching. Fire Emblem In the Fire Emblem games, the Monks are usually exclusively male Light Magic users able to defend themselves through Light-related spells while Priests are the male-counterpart to Clerics being only able to use staves. When they're promoted to Bishop class through the Guiding Ring or Earth Seal items, they add staves, or Light magic in the case of Priests, to their arsenal. Monks, and their promoted forms Bishops excel in Speed, Magic and Resistance while occasionally having high luck and skill. They often have the highest Resistance caps in their respective game and have high Luck and Skill in order to gain high critical rates, which makes up for their low Magic in relation to other magic users. Also, they almost always have poor growths in defense and HP which makes them vulnerable to magic-resistant melee units such as Pegasus/Falco(n) Knights, a characteristic shared by all magic-users in the franchise. Heroes of Might and Magic In Heroes of Might and Magic IV, the monk is both a class for heroes and a basic unit: * The basic unit is a magical ranged fighter. * The hero class is reached by learning both Life Magic and Order Magic, and has the special ability to take less damage from Chaos attacks. Guild Wars In Guild Wars Prophecies, monks are spellcasters, without engaging in physical combat. There are three general type of monks: Healing, Protecting, and Smiting. *Healing monks are used primarily to restore lost hitpoints to oneself or allies. *Protection monks are similar to healing monks, but they specialize in preventing damage opposed to restoring it. *Smiting monks are offensive based, and can deal Holy damage to their foes. Undead-type creatures take extra damage. Linley's Dungeon Crawl As with all other classes in Linley's Dungeon Crawl, a character beginning as a monk is free to progress in any other skill throughout their career. A monk typically begins with several skill ranks in the unarmed combat, fighting, and dodging skills. In earlier versions,http://crawl.chaosforge.org/index.php?title=Unarmed_Combat#History the unarmed combat skill even allowed armed fighters to sometimes make free attacks, such as kicks and headbutts, during normal combat,. Back then it may have been more convenient to start in this class and pick up a weapon skill later rather than disarming oneself with an armed fighter in order to build the skill from scratch.

It is usually a basic copper carbonate (()2), but near the sea will be a basic copper chloride (Cu2(OH)3Cl).Sharp, D. W. A: \\"Penguin Dictionary of Chemistry\\", page 419. Penguin Books, 1990 (2nd edition) If acetic acid is present at the time of weathering, it may consist of copper(II) acetate. The Statue of Liberty, showing advanced oxidization; verdigris is responsible for the statue's iconic green colour. Etymology The name verdigris comes from the Middle English vertegrez, from the Old French verte grez, an alteration of vert-de-Gr√®ce (\\"green of Greece\\"). The modern French spelling of this word is vert-de-gris (\\"green of grey\\"). It was used as a pigment in paintings and other art objects (as green color), mostly imported from Greece. Manufacture It was originally made by hanging copper plates over hot vinegar in a sealed pot until a green crust formed on the copper. Another method of obtaining verdigris pigment, used in the Middle Ages, was to attach copper strips to a wooden block with acetic acid, then bury the sealed block in dung. A few weeks later the pot was dug up and the verdigris scraped off. In eighteenth-century Montpellier, France, it was manufactured in household cellars, \\"where copper plates were stacked in clay pots filled with distilled wine.\\" The verdigris was scraped off weekly by the women of the household.Darnton, Robert. \\"A Bourgeois Puts His World in Order\\" in The Great Cat Massacre --and other Episodes in French Cultural History. New York: Vintage Books, 1985. p. 114. The chemical reaction exhibited between wine and copper to produce verdigris may be related to wine's own oxidation process. Another method, used in the early nineteenth century, had to do with reacting copper sulfate solution with solutions of lead, barium, or calcium acetate. Their sulfates are insoluble, forming precipitates and leaving the copper acetate in solution. Uses Natural or artificially created coatings of verdigris are commonly used as a patina to protect copper or bronze objects, especially in architecture. It is also used industrially as a fungicide, a catalyst for organic reactions, and in dyeing (The Merck Index , Ninth Ed., 1976). Verdigris has also been used in medicine. =Pigment= The vivid green color of copper(II) acetate made this form of verdigris a much used pigment. Until the 19th century, verdigris was the most vibrant green pigment available and was frequently used in painting.H. K√ºhn, Verdigris and Copper Resinate, in Artists‚Äô Pigments. A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, Vol. 2: A. Roy (Ed.) Oxford University Press 1993, p. 131 ‚Äì 158Verdigris, ColourLex Verdigris is lightfast in oil paint, as numerous examples of 15th-century paintings show. However, its lightfastness and air resistance are very low in other media. Copper resinate, made from verdigris by boiling it in a resin, is not lightfast, even in oil paint. In the presence of light and air, green copper resinate becomes stable brown copper oxide. This degradation is to blame for the brown or bronze color of grass or foliage in many old paintings, although not typically those of the Early Netherlandish painters such as Jan van Eyck, who often used normal verdigris. In addition, verdigris is a fickle pigment requiring special preparation of paint, careful layered application and immediate sealing with varnish to avoid rapid discoloration (but not in the case of oil paint). Verdigris has the curious property in oil painting that it is initially bluish-green, but turns a rich foliage green over the course of about a month. This green is stable. Verdigris fell out of use by artists as more stable green pigments became available. Chemical properties Copper(II) acetate is soluble in alcohol and water and slightly soluble in ether and glycerol. It melts at and decomposes at . It can be prepared by reacting copper(II) oxide, CuO, or copper(II) carbonate, CuCO3, with acetic acid, CH3COOH. Verdigris is a variable chemical mixture of compounds, complexes and water. The primary components are copper salts of acetate, carbonate, chloride, formate, hydroxide and sulfate. The secondary components are other metallic salts, acids (organic and mineral), atmospheric gases and water. All the components are in an ever-changing and complex electrochemical reaction equilibrium that is dependent on the ambient environment.

After opening with 524 students in 1996 as the Sunshine Coast University College, it was later renamed the University of the Sunshine Coast in 1999. The university has a flagship campus at Sippy Downs on the Sunshine Coast, with more campuses at Hervey Bay on the Fraser Coast, Gympie and Caboolture. In 2020, USC opened a full-service campus at Petrie in Moreton Bay. USC Sippy Downs campus 2019 Undergraduate and postgraduate (coursework and higher degree by research) programs are available, with study areas divided into seven disciplines: business, IT and tourism; creative industries, design and communication; education; engineering and science; health, nursing and sport sciences; humanities, psychology and social sciences; and law and criminology. The university is listed on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students. In the 2019 Student Experience Survey, the University of the Sunshine Coast recorded the ninth highest student satisfaction rating out of all Australian universities, and the third highest student satisfaction rating out of all Queensland public universities, with an overall satisfaction rating of 81.5. History The first discussions about a university for the Sunshine Coast region began in 1973. In 1989, the Australian Federal Government approved its establishment. On 1 July 1994 the Queensland Parliament passed the Sunshine Coast University College Act 1994.Establishment of the University of the Sunshine Coast The university was established in 1994, opening in 1996 as the Sunshine Coast University College. The University of the Sunshine Coast Act 1998 was passed in Queensland Parliament on 19 November of that year, legislating the independent status of the university. The university changed to its current name of the University of the Sunshine Coast (USC) in 1999. It was created by the Australian Government to serve the growing population of the Sunshine Coast region, north of Brisbane, in Queensland. The University of the Sunshine Coast is the first greenfield university established in Australia since 1971. The inaugural vice-chancellor was Professor Paul Thomas, , who took office with effect from 1 January 1996, having spent an earlier period as planning president. USC's second vice-chancellor, Professor Greg Hill AO, took over from Professor Thomas AM in 2011 after starting at the university in 2005 as deputy vice-chancellor. He stayed in the role until August 2020 when Professor Helen Bartlett joined as the university's third vice-chancellor. Justice Gerald ‚ÄúTony‚Äù Fitzgerald was the university's inaugural chancellor, followed by pastoralist Ian Kennedy, AO, who was USC's second chancellor. Air Chief Marshal Sir Angus Houston AK, AFC (Ret‚Äôd) became the university's fourth chancellor when he was appointed to the role in 2017 after John Dobson OAM retired from the position. Sir Angus remains the University's current chancellor. The student body has grown consistently since the university opened in 1996 with an intake of 524 students. In 2019, USC had 17,840 students enrolled. The university introduced paid parking at its Sippy Downs campus from February 2013, a move that garnered a negative response from some students and staff. Of the university's 2,400 parking spaces, approximately 450 (located from the centre of campus) remain as free parking. Rankings USC has consistently received high rankings from independent agencies for areas such as teaching quality and overall student experience. In the 2021 Good Universities Guide, USC received five stars for teaching quality, marking 15 consecutive years the university received top marks in the category. The 2021 edition of the Guide also awarded USC five stars for overall student experience for the ninth consecutive year and learning resources for the fifth consecutive year. The 2021 edition also saw USC awarded five stars for skills development, social equity, and first generation. In the Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching's (QILT) 2019 Student Experience Survey, USC scored above the sector average in five out the six student experience areas. The university scored 84.1 for skills development, 83.6 for teaching quality, 78.1 for student support, 86.5 for learning resources and 81.5 for overall experience. The Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching's (QILT) 2019 Employer Satisfaction Survey also rated USC highly, with five out six categories rated as above the sector average by employers. USC received a 93.5 percent rating for the foundational skills of its graduates, 90.9 percent for their adaptability, 90.4 percent for collaboration, 86 percent for employability and 85.2 percent for overall satisfaction. The 2012 edition of the guide, released in August 2011, also awarded the university five stars for its graduates' satisfaction with the generic skills they gained while at university, and for Indigenous participation. The university scored four stars for access by equity groups, gender balance, and for graduates' satisfaction with their overall university experience. Its ratings for graduates' satisfaction also remained the highest awarded to any public university in Queensland.USC gains five stars for teaching In 2007 the Australian Universities Quality Agency (AUQA) audited USC as part of their assessment of all Australian universities. AUQA is a national agency that operates independently of governments and the higher education sector. The report commended USC for \\"its significant achievements since inception\\" and awarded USC commendations for the quality of the university's learning and teaching, student support services, workplace integrated learning program and degree approval process. The Headstart Program ‚Äì a program allowing Year 11 and 12 school students to study one or more courses at the University, while still completing secondary school ‚Äì and Global Opportunities Program ‚Äì the University's study abroad were also acknowledged in the assessment. The university's Global Opportunities Program received an award from the Queensland government at the Celebrating International Education and Training Industry Showcase in August 2007Department of the Premier and Cabinet ‚Äì 2007 Industry Showcase for promoting internationalisation. In March 2008 the university was one of 99 organisations nationally and one of 10 in Queensland to earn an Employer of Choice for Women citation.2008 Employer of Choice for Women list The citations are awarded annually by the federal government's Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency (EOWA). It has received the citation for six consecutive years to 2010.2010 Employer of Choice for Women list Since 2006, the university has been awarded 17 citations from the Australian Learning and Teaching Council, recognising outstanding contributions to student learning. Six of the citations were awarded in 2009, with a further six citations awarded in 2010. In 2011, a further five USC staff earned ALTC citations.  Campus and locations  The main University of the Sunshine Coast campus is at Sippy Downs, Queensland, which opened in 1996 as the Sunshine Coast University College. In 1999, it was renamed the University of the Sunshine Coast. In 2013, USC opened a Gympie campus before taking over a Fraser Coast campus from the University of Southern Queensland in 2016 . The university also operates an education and research facility at Dilli Village on Fraser Island. The university's geographical expansion continued in 2018 with the transfer of the Queensland University of Technology's Caboolture campus to USC's control. The move into the region just north of Brisbane preceded USC's greenfield development of Moreton Bay's first full-scale university campus at Petrie, which opened in 2020. The Sippy Downs campus is about north of Brisbane. It is a 100-hectare flora and fauna reserve, and borders the Mooloolah River National Park. The site was previously a sugar cane farm, at the geographical heart of the Sunshine Coast and its shires, close to the Bruce Highway and other major transport routes. The buildings on campus have received 30 awardsArchitecture awards for planning, architecture and construction. In 2000 the university received the Royal Australian Institute of Architects President's Award, and in 1997 the Library was awarded the Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Buildings. All buildings on campus focus on environmentally sustainable design to suit the subtropical climate of the Sunshine Coast. Buildings have been designed for passive lighting and natural ventilation to minimise the use of non-renewable energy. In May 2007, the university opened two new buildings, the A$12 million science building and A$13 million chancellery. In July 2007, the A$10 million indoor sports stadium was opened by Federal Education, Science and Training Minister Julie Bishop. A year later, Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan opened the A$13 million Health and Sport Centre, which has testing and research laboratories, a gymnasium and public psychology clinic.Milestones 2007-2008 In August 2010, construction started on a $5 million semi-industrial shared space facility for engineering and paramedic science students. This opened in May 2011 and has specialised equipment and large, open spaces suitable for medical emergency simulations and a wide variety of engineering tests and experiments. It also has several laboratories and tutorial rooms. In November 2010, construction started on the university pool complex, which includes a 50m heated Olympic swimming pool for research and community use. The complex was officially opened on 19 October 2011, by Queensland Sport Minister Phil Reeves. Funding for the $2.1 million project was provided by the Queensland State Government, the university, community donations, and through in-kind support. =Art gallery= Leonard Sabol, Between sculpture with USC Health and Sport Centre in background The University of the Sunshine Coast Gallery hosts a range of exhibitions focusing on contemporary art and design.

Since February 2017 the arena has been the home stadium for National Netball League team Sunshine Coast Lightning. The arena has a seating capacity of 2,200 and features broadcasting facilities and several corporate boxes. As a result of growing demand for the Lightning amongst the public, the venue was upgraded to 3,000 seats and also featured new change rooms, a function room, public bathrooms and an improved sound system; all of which was completed in May 2019. Organisation In 2012, the faculty structure at the university was revised, from three faculties each with a different number of schools contained therein, to two, each with three schools: *Faculty of Arts and Business **School of Business **School of Communication **School of Social Sciences *Faculty of Science, Health, Education and Engineering **School of Health and Sport Sciences **School of Nursing and Midwifery **School of Science, Education and Engineering In 2019, the faculty structure was discontinued to streamline the administrative and management process, with heads of schools instead reporting directly to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic). The University Council is the governing body with the chancellor presiding over council meetings. The council has 19 members including the chancellor drawn from the university staff, student body and wider community. The academic board is the university's senior academic body. It advises the council concerning teaching, scholarship and research matters, formulates proposals for the academic policies of the university, monitors the academic activities of the university's faculties, and promotes and encourages scholarship and research at the university.  Research  The University of the Sunshine Coast's research focus is on regional engagement and sustainability issues. In 2009, research efforts concentrated on applied genetics in primary production, regional sustainability and the health professions. The university has two core research groups; the GeneCology Research Group and the Sustainability Research Centre and an engagement centre, the Centre for Healthy Activities, Sport and Exercise. The USC Research Bank provides open access to the University of the Sunshine Coast's research output. The database ensures the research output of the university is accessible to local, national and international communities. The university's research centres actively seek grants and funding, with the Sustainability Research Centre securing more than $2 million in funding in 2008, leading to the submission of more than 100 research papers. $1.3 million of that funding was drawn from the CSIRO's Collaborative Fund. In May 2009, a separate research team secured an AUSAID grant worth more than $500,000. In June 2011 the university was announced as one of 12 projects to receive Australian government funding under the Collaborative Research Networks (CRN) program. In the period 2011 to 2014 the university will receive $5.45 million to fund research in water, sustainability, forestry and aquaculture.USC receives $5.45 million to boost research = Australian Research Council grants = The university received two Australian Research Council Discovery grants, worth more than $1 million, in the 2012 funding round announced in November 2011: * Scott Cummins was awarded a $656,377 ARC Future Fellowship for his study of primordial germ cell migration in perciform fish, titled: \\"Decoding the rules of fate, attraction and cell migration in perciform fish\\". The ARC grant will be coupled with Dr Cummins' ARC Discovery Project Grant for $145,000 over 2012 to 2014 for research into snail hypometabolism, enabling him to build a significant team of researchers conducting world-class research in the field of the biological sciences. * Roland De Marco, Pro Vice-Chancellor for Research and joint chief investigator in a project called ‚ÄúNew mesoporous materials for use in high temperature proton exchange fuel cell membranes‚Äù, gained a three-year ARC Discovery Project grant of $420,000, with $40,000 each year going to support a PhD student at the university. The research involves using synchrotron radiation techniques to develop innovative fuel cell materials with the potential to provide high energy and high stability alcohol fuel cells. Other 2011 ARC funding: * Kate Mounsey won a $375,000 competitive grant for research into the contagious skin infection, scabies, titled: \\"A porcine model to provide new insights on scabies immunopathology\\". Her study was one of 277 projects selected from 2,159 applications nationally for funding under the ARC's new Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA) scheme. The ARC grant will be coupled with Dr Mounsey's award of a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Project grant of $483,510 (in collaboration with USC's Associate Professor Shelley Walton) on a related project over the same timeframe. * The university was announced as a partner in three successful ARC Linkage Infrastructure Equipment and Facilities grants, involving Cummins (via the University of Queensland), De Marco (via Curtin University) and Senior Lecturer in Environmental Microbiology, Ipek Kurtboke (via the University of Queensland). = Centre for Healthy Activities, Sport and Exercise = The Centre for Healthy Activities, Sport and Exercise (CHASE) undertakes research and related activities in preventative health and rehabilitation, and understanding and enhancing sports performance. Projects include consultancies and tenders, conducting short courses and conferences and contributing to policy debate in areas such as biomechanical assessment, physiological profiling, sports coach education, and the implementation of healthy programs.The Centre for Healthy Activities, Sport and Exercise = GeneCology Research Group = The GeneCology Research Group operates in the areas of genetics, ecology, genomics and physiology and the interaction between these. The research group researches sustainable production of aquaculture, horticulture and forestry systems, biodiversity conservation and sustainable urban forestry and horticulture. In 2009, Professor in Aquaculture Biotechnology Abigail Elizur and Associate Professor in Aquaculture Genetics Wayne Knibb were involved in a project that resulted in the first-ever captive spawning of Southern Bluefin Tuna. The project was voted the second most important innovation of the year by Time, behind NASA's Ares rocket. = Sustainability Research Centre = The Sustainability Research Centre focuses on sustainable communities and sustainable environments, and the institutions that relate to them. The research focus is based around coastal management, climate change, water management, natural and cultural heritage, innovation, adaptive growth, and community wellbeing.  University-based organisations  The University of the Sunshine Coast has one subsidiary company ‚Äì Innovation Centre Sunshine Coast Pty Ltd. At the northern end of the campus, this is the first stage of a planned technology park precinct for Sippy Downs. The Innovation Centre comprises a business incubator for start-up technology businesses and a business accelerator for established technology, knowledge-based, and professional service firms. The Innovation Centre provides serviced office space, high speed optical fibre Internet connection, business development coaching and support. As of July 2010, the Innovation Centre has supported the start-up and growth of around 80 businesses, mainly in ICT, cleantech and creative industry sectors.Innovation Centre ‚Äì companies  Notable people  The current chancellor of the university is Air Chief Marshall Sir Angus Houston, a retired senior officer of the Royal Australian Air Force.  Student accommodation  Three student accommodation complexes are next to the campus in Chancellor Park. Varsity Apartments, UniCentral and The Village are privately owned and operated. All are within walking distance of the campus, linked by pedestrian pathways. Each accommodation complex has furnished apartments, some with Internet connection. The general layout in an apartment is a shared kitchen and living room, with four single bedrooms, each with its own bathroom and toilet. The complexes are gated and have barbecues, pools and outdoor sports courts (such as tennis/basketball and volleyball). Many of these units are shared units, however each student has his/her own bedroom and bathroom, only sharing the main living spaces. Many complexes also mix the residents between local and international students for a well engaged cross cultural experience. Public transport University of the Sunshine Coast is serviced by TransLink bus routes, operated by Sunbus. Services depart to Caloundra, Nambour, Maroochydore and Kawana, with connecting services to Noosa at Maroochydore's Sunshine Plaza interchange, and connecting to rail services at Landsborough Station. Services enter and depart from the new bus station via the Green Link.About the University of the Sunshine Coast bus station and green link See also *List of universities in Australia References  External links  Universities Australia *Innovation Centre Sunshine Coast Buildings and structures on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland Buderim Educational institutions established in 1998 1998 establishments in Australia Sunshine Coast Lightning Schools in Queensland ","title":"University of the Sunshine Coast"},{"id":"1389123","title":"Beeld"},{"id":"1389125","text":"Residence Life is the terminology used to describe the comprehensive program that surrounds the experience of living \\"on and off campus\\" in a residence hall at a college or university in Canada and the United States. Residence Life is usually structured with planned events, a code of conduct and/or ethics, and a relatively large array of staff.  Benefits  Residence Life aims to facilitate a students' transition to post-secondary. Residence halls vary in size and population however, they accommodate hundreds of young adults. Other accommodations for Residence Life and Housing are offered for family housing, Graduate/ Post-Graduate and upper-year accommodations. Traditionally, there is less traditional residence life aspects in these communities (residence assistants, programming) but residents are still offered a great deal of support from professional staff. Residence Life is integral in the student experience at most post-secondary institutions due to a variety of benefits listed below. Overall, Residence Life aims to make residence more than a place to eat and sleep but rather, a place to explore identity and explore personal ideologies through experiences living away from home. Typically, many students live in residence at some point in their post- secondary experience. More often, this is during their first year at the institution. Social/Interpersonal Development: Provides an environment that is conducive to personal connections with peers. Provides an opportunity to be socialized in a new environment (campus). Convenience and Connection on Campus: Living in residence provides the opportunity to live in close proximity to academic classrooms, faculty and campus resources. This proximity allows for students to develop community in residence and that community translates to the greater campus community. Facilitated Social Activities (also called Programming): Hosted by professional staff or student staff, social activities are aimed to promote a sense of community and belonging in residence. This is important for residence students because of the ability to ensure students are able to effectively integrate to a post-secondary campus. Programming is aimed at student development by providing co-curricular learning experiences. Residential Curriculum: Produced by residence life or residence education professionals, students are provided with programming with intentional learning opportunities while living in residence buildings. This curriculum is often connected to learning goals set forth by the department. Academic Success: Specific live-in staff aimed at supporting academics of residence students. Utilizing faculty and student affairs staff, students have access to specific support that is aided by student proximity to classrooms, faculty and academic resources. Residence learning communities (RLCs) (also referred to as living-learning communities (LLCs)), are targeted building areas that cluster students grouped based on academic program or interest. The purpose of these communities are to provide students additional support and faculty connections. This also allows students to easily create study groups with classmates and increased sense of belonging. Students in these communities are typically taking similar or at least one course that is the same. These students also typically see a higher GPA upon leaving residence at the end of their first year. Safety, Security & Support: Access to residence halls is typically limited to residents living in the building, this security is maintained by strict keys and access utilizing Student ID. Other strategies in maintaining student safety include, residence student staff and professional staff that live-in to provide 24 hour on-call support. This on- call support is aimed at providing support to students who are struggling with mental wellness concerns. In addition, students are able to have direct access to campus police able to provide immediate police support. Involvement/Leadership Opportunities: Living in residence provides students access to leadership opportunities like residence council and student staff residence roles like Resident Assistants. These roles typically fall under the Residence Life professional staff team. Increased Intercultural Competency: Residence provides the opportunity for students to meet other students from different cultural backgrounds. Residence Life focuses on the ability to ensure equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) is a priority by creating environments that students are able to engage in their community. This increases intercultural competence for students. The services and support that residence life offers are impactful to the retention, academic engagement and graduation of students, more so of off-campus living or commuting.  Organization  As one of three components of a college/university housing program,The ACUHO-I Ethical Principles and Standards for College and University Student Housing Professionals lays out the three components of a college/university housing program: Business/Management, Education/Programming, and Physical Plant. Residence Life is often one responsibility of a larger Housing office or department. On some campuses, however, Residence Life and Housing are responsibilities of separate departments or organizations. Residence Life, or the department which encompasses it, usually reports to the Division of Student Affairs. However, on campuses with a separate Housing department it is not uncommon for that department to report to the Business Services or Auxiliary Services division or area as most of their responsibilities will be financial, legal, and physical (as opposed to the developmental nature of \\"pure\\" Residence Life). Example reporting structures that could oversee an on-campus, institutionally owned, residence life operations are: 1) oversight of housing and residence life via the Vice President and/or Associate Vice-President of student affairs or student services. 2) oversight of housing and residence life via the Vice President and/or Associate Vice-President of finance, operations or administration. 3) dual oversight of the housing and residence life program. The housing operations (staffing, facilities, admissions etc.) are reported to the Vice-President Finance or an equivalent unit that oversees ancillary services. Residence life (staffing, education and programming) are reported to Vice President and/or Associate Vice-President of student affairs. Institutions operate differently according to culture, location, organizational structure, and values- there is no ‚Äòright‚Äô or ‚Äòwrong‚Äô way to manage residence life units. Regardless of which division to which it reports, Housing departments are usually self-supporting auxiliary departments which receive little or no financial support from the college/university (i.e. tuition or fees). They are dependent on revenue from rent and cost-recovery mechanisms (damage charges, bills for services such as network or telephone service, etc.).Barr & Desler's Handbook of Student Affairs Administration (2000, p. 131) note that management of auxiliary budgets occupy nearly all (as much as 80%) of a chief student affairs fiscal responsibility; this underlines the complexity of this financial management and the potential conflict between the institution's responsibility for financial solvency and student development. = Legal Implications = The relationship between residence life and the students that live within are different than a landlord/tenant relationship. In Ontario, Canada, the Residential Tenancies Act exempts accommodations provided by an educational institution. The reason for this exemption is that on campus student residences are often not full calendar year rentals (duration is typically September to April) and there are student advisory groups that provide regular feedback to the residence professional staff.  Staff  =Professional staff= Residence Life professionals typically possess post-secondary degrees and in some cases have obtained a Masters Degree in college student personnel, higher education, counseling, or a related field. Typical Residence Life departments are overseen by a director, associate director, or assistant director; these positions may be \\"live-on\\" (required to live on campus), depending on the needs of the university and the size of the staff required to be on-call to respond to student emergencies. Many campuses also employ graduate students, graduate assistants or entry-level professionals (most commonly with master's degrees) that directly supervise the RAs and other undergraduate staff (such as desk workers). This staff are variously referred to as Hall Directors (HDs), Resident Directors (RDs), or Residence Life Coordinators (RLCs). The titles vary between institutions with some institutions using the same title to refer to their graduate student staff that another uses for their entry-level staff. These staff members are \\"live-in\\" (required to live in the residence hall, often in a larger or otherwise extraordinary space) or live-on to fulfill their frequent on-call duties. =Student staff= Typically, each residence hall also employs several Resident Assistants, or RAs. These are undergraduate or graduate students who are tasked with helping the students living on their hallway get to know each other. Resourceful RAs can use a variety of planned or spontaneous events‚Äîcalled programming in the field's nomenclature‚Äîto this end. They are also charged with enforcing university rules and regulations and providing general assistance to residents. RAs are often reimbursed with free or discounted room, free or discounted board, a stipend, or even all three. On most campuses, RAs receive intense training at the beginning of the academic year. In addition to ongoing training, some campuses have several days of training at the beginning of the second semester. If the residence hall has a front desk or area office, it is often manned by students who provide assistance to the residents such as accepting packages delivered to the residence hall, reporting maintenance problems, or opening doors for residents who have lost their key(s) (often for a charge). Some Resident Assistants may also be assigned overnight duty. Overnight duty is when a Resident Assistant is on call all night. Most of the time Resident Assistants are in their hall office till 12:00 am. After 12:00 am they are to report to their room for the rest of the night. On call duties consist of helping with lock outs and noise complaints.

New York, N.Y., Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, c1997. IEEE Std 100-1996. [ed. Standards Coordinating Committee 10, Terms and Definitions; Jane Radatz, (chair)] In medicine, the term electrotherapy can apply to a variety of treatments, including the use of electrical devices such as deep brain stimulators for neurological disease. The term has also been applied specifically to the use of electric current to speed wound healing. Additionally, the term \\"electrotherapy\\" or \\"electromagnetic therapy\\" has also been applied to a range of alternative medical devices and treatments. Medical uses Electrotherapy is primarily used in physical therapy for relaxation of muscle spasms, prevention and retardation of disuse atrophy, increase of local blood circulation, muscle rehabilitation and re-education electrical muscle stimulation, maintaining and increasing range of motion, management of chronic and intractable pain, post-traumatic acute pain, post- surgical acute pain, immediate post-surgical stimulation of muscles to prevent venous thrombosis, wound healing and drug delivery. Some of the treatment effectiveness mechanisms are little understood, with effectiveness and best practices for their use still anecdotal. =Musculoskeletal conditions= In general, there is little evidence that electrotherapy is effective in the management of musculoskeletal conditions. In particular, there is no evidence that electrotherapy is effective in the relief of pain arising from osteoarthritis, and little to no evidence available to support electrotherapy for the management of fibromyalgia. Neck and back pain A 2016 review found that, \\"in evidence of no effectiveness,\\" clinicians should not offer electrotherapy for the treatment of neck pain or associated disorders. Earlier reviews found that no conclusions could be drawn about the effectiveness of electrotherapy for neck pain, and that electrotherapy has limited effect on neck pain as measured by clinical results. A 2015 review found that the evidence for electrotherapy in pregnancy-related lower back pain is \\"very limited\\". Shoulder disorders A 2014 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine whether electrotherapy was better than exercise at treating adhesive capsulitis. As of 2004, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about any intervention for rotator cuff pathology, including electrotherapy; furthermore, methodological problems precluded drawing conclusions about the efficacy of any rehabilitation method for impingement syndrome. Other musculoskeletal disorders There is limited, low quality evidence for a slight benefit of noxious-level electrotherapy in the treatment of epicondylitis. A 2012 review found that \\"Small, single studies showed that some electrotherapy modalities may be beneficial\\" in rehabilitating ankle bone fractures. However, a 2008 review found it to be ineffective in healing long-bone fractures. A 2012 review found that evidence that electrotherapy contributes to recovery from knee conditions is of \\"limited quality\\". =Chronic pain= A 2004 Cochrane review found \\"weaker evidence\\" that pulsating electromagnetic fields could be effective in treating recurrent headaches. A 2016 Cochrane review found that supporting evidence for electrotherapy as a treatment for complex regional pain syndrome is \\"absent or unclear.\\" =Chronic wounds= A 2015 review found that the evidence supporting the use of electrotherapy in healing pressure ulcers was of low quality, and a 2015 Cochrane review found that no evidence that electromagnetic therapy, a subset of electrotherapy, was effective in healing pressure ulcers. Earlier reviews found that, because of low-quality evidence, it was unclear whether electrotherapy increases healing rates of pressure ulcers. By 2014 the evidence supported electrotherapy's efficacy for ulcer healing. Another 2015 Cochrane review found no evidence supporting the user of electrotherapy for venous stasis ulcers. History Electric shock treatment with an Oudin coil Use of electrical apparatus. Interrupted galvanism used in regeneration of deltoid muscle. First half of the twentieth century. The first recorded treatment of a patient by electricity was by Johann Gottlob Kr√ºger in 1743. John Wesley promoted electrical treatment as a universal panacea in 1747 but was rejected by mainstream medicine. Giovanni Aldini treated insanity with static electricity 1823-1824.Chalovich, Joseph M, Franklinization: Early Therapeutic Use of Static Electricity, ScholarShip, East Carolina University, 23 January 2012 The first medical treatments with electricity in London have been recorded as far back as 1767 at Middlesex Hospital in London using a special apparatus. The same was purchased for St. Bartholomew's Hospital only ten years later. The record of uses other than being therapeutic is not clear, however Guy's Hospital has a published list of cases from the earlier 1800s. Golding Bird at Guy's brought electrotherapy into the mainstream in the mid-19th century.Morus, Iwan Rhys, Frankenstein's Children: Electricity, Exhibition, and Experiment in Early-nineteenth-century London, pp. 234-237, Princeton University Press, 1998 In the second half of the 19th century the emphasis moved from delivering large shocks to the whole body to more measured doses, the minimum effective.Chalovich, 36' 0\\" =Apparatus= An early 20th century electrotherapy apparatusElectrotherapy equipment has historically included: * The electric bath for high-voltage static induction * Oudin coil, a high-voltage induction coil, in use around 1900 * Pulvermacher's chain, a wearable electrochemical device mostly used by quacks, in use second half of 19th century * Leyden jars, an early form of capacitor, for storing electricity * Electrostatic generators of various sorts = People = Some important people in the history of electrotherapy include; * Luigi Galvani, a pioneer of medical electricity * Benjamin Franklin, an early proponent of electrotherapy who made it widely known, but mostly taken up by quacks and charlatans * Golding Bird, mentioned above * Duchenne de Boulogne * Jacques- Ars√®ne d'Arsonval * George Miller Beard * Margaret Cleaves, a promoter of ozone therapy * Many of the forms of electricity used in electrotherapy were named after scientists  Notable historic fringe practitioners  * James Graham * Franz Mesmer =Muscle stimulation= In 1856 Guillaume Duchenne announced that alternating was superior to direct current for electrotherapeutic triggering of muscle contractions.Licht, Sidney Herman., \\"History of Electrotherapy\\", in Therapeutic Electricity and Ultraviolet Radiation, 2nd ed., ed. Sidney Licht, New Haven: E. Licht, 1967, Pp. 1-70. What he called the 'warming effect' of direct currents irritated the skin, since, at voltage strengths needed for muscle contractions, they cause the skin to blister (at the anode) and pit (at the cathode). Furthermore, with DC each contraction required the current to be stopped and restarted. Moreover, alternating current could produce strong muscle contractions regardless of the condition of the muscle, whereas DC-induced contractions were strong if the muscle was strong, and weak if the muscle was weak. Since that time almost all rehabilitation involving muscle contraction has been done with a symmetrical rectangular biphasic waveform. During the 1940s, however, the U.S. War Department, investigating the application of electrical stimulation not just to retard and prevent atrophy but to restore muscle mass and strength, employed what was termed galvanic exercise on the atrophied hands of patients who had an ulnar nerve lesion from surgery upon a wound.Licht, \\"History of Electrotherapy\\" These galvanic exercises employed a monophasic waveform, direct current.
