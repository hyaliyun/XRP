Symptoms vary by tree species but generally consist of leaf discoloration, wilt, defoliation, and death. The fungus spreads from diseased to healthy trees overland by insect or other airborne vectors and underground by naturally grafted tree roots. Management of the disease historically meant preventing infection by not wounding oaks during certain time periods, removing diseased oaks that will produce spores (sanitation), and breaking root connections with vibratory plows, trenchers, rock saws or hoes. Present methods focus on reducing or eliminating monocultures and restoring ecosystems correctly using soils baseline information. Fungicides are used for preventive treatments in urban areas. Oak wilt poses a danger for oak wood products and shade trees in urban areas. Hosts and symptoms Photograph of leaf and whole tree symptoms of oak wilt in a red oak tree. Joseph O'Brien, USDA Forest Service, Bugwood.org Oak wilt is one of three devastating North American vascular wilt diseases and was first seen in Wisconsin in the 1940s. Within the last decade, it has spread into new counties in northern Wisconsin, counties northwest and northeast of the Twin Cities in Minnesota and also new locations in northeastern states. The other two vascular wilts and their destructive time periods are chestnut blight (1900-1950) and Dutch elm disease (1928 - 1980). Vascular wilts, including oak wilt, kill by fooling the tree into killing itself; the fungus or pathogen does not kill the tree or host. The tree's reaction-to fungus entering into sapwood, by walling off the fungus, causes shutdown of water supply upward, then wilting, thus killing off the fungus doesn't eradicate the problem, keeping the water supply open and flowing upward is the main problem. Certain elements like Boron are crucial to the trees' physiological well being, especially with translocation of fluids. Additionally, copper and chemotherapies have been used to keep the tree or plant from killing itself via wilting . Oak wilt infects and kills all oak species but affects the two main groups, red and white oaks, differently. Mostly, red oak group trees die faster from oak wilt disease than white oak group trees, and red oak group trees spread oak wilt two ways - underground and overland - where white oak group trees spread oak wilt one way only, underground. Oaks in North and Central America are sorted into two groups based mostly upon the porosity and corresponding leaf shape. The white oak group have rounded leaf edges and pores, also known as xylem or sapwood, are clogged with tyloses. The red oak group have pointed leaf edges and pores are large and open. Common names of oaks are based upon folklore or customs, which leads-to black oaks being in the red oak group. In the upper midwest, red oak group trees like black, northern red and northern pin are most threatened by oak wilt for two reasons: they die faster and they produce spore mats, known also as spore pads or pressure pads. Spore mats are the fruiting bodies of the oak wilt fungus and, when ripening or sporulating, can spread disease overland. Overland spread of oak wilt from white oaks is not a problem because white oak group trees rarely produce spore mats. When infected, oaks in the red oak group die over the course of a single summer. These oaks typically die from the top of the tree down as leaves become a bronze color and fall off the tree. Another symptom is discoloration of the vascular tissues. Brown streaks or spots can be seen under the bark in the sapwood; oak wilt specialists call this stage II.Sudden leaf drop July red oak Oaks in the white oak group, white, swamp white, and bur, die slower when infected (white oak in particular) and can live for several years after infection, losing a few branches each season from the top down. Bur oaks tend to die faster than others in the white oak group, although not as fast as trees in the red oak group. Symptoms in white oak are similar to those in red oak. Quercus virginiana, the southern live oak, is the most common of 31 species of evergreen oaks and is in the white oak group. Oaks with oak wilt stand out with their dead crowns compared to a green canopy in the summer, so much so that oak wilt infections can be spotted from the air. Northern pin oak (Q. ellipsoidalis) infection and spread are extreme when monocultures exist. Northern pin oak forests are typically found on entisol soils (aka barren, river terrace or lakebed sands) in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and these forest ecosystems are often misidentified as oak savannas, which are prairie - not forest - ecosystems. Mistaking northern pin oak forest monocultures for oak savannas, then burning them for oak savanna restoration, has made state and federal lands north of Minneapolis-St Paul the largest oak wilt disease reservoirs in Minnesota.Nelson, Steven (2011). Savanna Soils of Minnesota. Minnesota: Self. pp. 21-22,29-30. . Wilt and death in Live oak usually occurs within six months of infection. Live oak foliar symptoms differ from those of red and white oak. Infected live oak leaves develop yellow colored veins then eventually die and turn brown before falling off the tree. Disease Cycle Illustration of the oak wilt disease cycle by Julie Martinez Photograph of spores produced by the oak wilt fungus. (a) Endoconidia (b) Conidiophore The oak wilt fungus spreads in two basic ways: transfer of spores from diseased to healthy trees overland by insect and other vectors and movement underground of the fungus from a diseased tree to a healthy tree through root grafts. Root Graft of hardwood tree after excavation following vibratory plowing = Overland = Spores are the seeds of a fungus. If conditions - temperature, moisture content, wood pH - are right after the oak has wilted and died, spore mats form under the bark of the tree. Bark removed by squirrels attracted-to fruity odor. Spore mats stage III Spore mats produce asexual spores called endoconidia, which are barrel shaped and produced in chains. Wood caramel colored, spore mats stage IIIConidia are often dispersed by air and rain and also by insects and other agents.K√§√§rik, A. (1983).\\"Atlas of Airborne Fungal Spores in Europe\\". Berlin, Heidelberg, New York: Springer-Verlag. p. 7 . If compatible mating types are present, these mats will also produce sexual spores called ascospores in fruiting structures called perithecia. Ascospores are spread by water, insects and other agents.K√§√§rik, A. (1983).\\"Atlas of Airborne Fungal Spores in Europe\\". Berlin, Heidelberg, New York: Springer- Verlag. p. 7 . Certain species of sap beetles plus other insects, birds and animals are attracted to the fruity smell of oak wilt spore mats. Spore mats/pressure pads increase in size, eventually breaking the bark covering them, which sends the spores' fruity odor out into the area, attracting sap beetles and other insects, birds and animals, like squirrels. The oak wilt disease \\"selling\\" business is now open. Spore Mat stage III meaning infectiousOne example of overland spread is sap beetles picking-up spores from diseased red oaks then depositing them onto fresh wounds made on healthy oaks. The oak wilt \\"buying\\" business is now open...for 2 days only. New infections in areas with no history of oak wilt occur by this overland transmission route.Spore mats (dark patches) stage IV - V are no longer infectious However, not all all red oaks that died in one year produce spores/sporulate the next year between April and July. Small red oaks 6 - 10 inch dbh tend to sporulate the autumn of the year they got infected, or not at all; small trees, once dead, dry out faster than large trees and oak wilt fungus cannot survive in that dry environment. Roughly 15 to 30 percent of red oaks greater than 10 inch dbh will sporulate April - July the year following infection. The other 70 - 85 percent of infected red oaks will sporulate, either before April or after July the following year or, not at all, because wood rotting fungi (Trichoderma) is already in the oak and out-competes/kills the oak wilt fungus. = Underground = Oak wilt moves from diseased trees to healthy trees through roots that have become interconnected (root grafts). Transmission via root grafts is the most common means of spread, and makes up more than 85% of new infections every year. Oaks within 50 ‚Äì 150 feet (15 ‚Äì 50 meters) of a diseased oak can be infected via root graft transmission. In this case, spores (also endoconidia) produced inside the tree travel upward through vascular tissue in the wood, known as the xylem. Most root grafts form between oaks of the same species and of the same generation; it's rare for a 60 year old oak to root graft with a 15 year old oak of same species. Red oak roots graft more commonly than do white oak roots, and grafts between red and white oaks are very rare. Environment In the Midwest and eastern United States, conditions are usually favorable for spore production and beetle activity during spring and early summer. In Texas, mat formation is most common in late fall and winter. Frequency of root graft formation, and therefore root graft transmission, is affected by soil type and stand composition (diversity of tree species). See disease cycle and management sections for details. Management Landowners and managers have to remember that oaks love light and heat more than other forest tree species; they are one of the few tree species that survive in the prairie regions. Releasing or thinning oaks from competition, which gives remaining oaks more light, moisture and nutrients, should always be the primary goal, whether or not oak wilt is present. Oak wilt is similar to Dutch elm disease but more controllable. Beetles carrying oak wilt do not have chewing mouth parts, and need some other creature or physical damage to wound the tree, whereas beetles that carry Dutch elm disease do have chewing mouth parts. Prevention is essential, as there is no permanent cure. To prevent overland spread, oaks should not be wounded, including pruned, in the spring months in the east and Midwest or February through June in Texas. Care should be taken to prevent injury to oaks during this period, particularly during construction activities. Painting wounds less than 48 hours old is advised if oaks are wounded in the spring by wind or human caused damage. Painting wounds more than 48 hours old is not helpful because the oak by that time has compartmentalized (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CODIT) the injury/wound. Reducing the source of spores is helpful. When a dead red oak has not sporulated - hasn't reached stage III yet - before the following spring, it should be chipped or mulched onsite, then burned at a CHP (combined heat & power) plant. If that is not possible, wood greater than 5\\" diameter can be split into firewood size pieces then left onsite to dry before spring, or covered with plastic sheeting to effect composting. Heat from composting should destroy the fungus. Logs or firewood from red oak group trees that have died of oak wilt should never be moved to unaffected areas. = Root Graft or Overland Infection? = The first oak in any infection center is always infected from overland spread; additional oaks killed from the disease in that infection center are killed from underground root graft spread. Before control plans are made, the landowner or land manager (forester, arborist) needs to find out how the infection got there and what type (underground, overland or both) it is. Root graft infections move slowly, so additional root graft infections may not be seen for 1‚Äì3 years. It is impossible for one oak infected via overland to infect & wilt seventeen additional oaks via root graft transmission, in less than 4 months (see Kerrick, Minnesota oak wilt photo, below). If one sees more than half dozen oaks wilting during one summer in a new infection with healthy oaks in between means infections started from overland route/storm event, not underground. In that case, each wilting oak is a separate infection center, not part of one infection center. One should also look at the site to confirm whether or not it's an overland infection. Overland infections occur on or near hilltops or other exposed areas, where taller oaks get wounded, then infected, and shorter oaks look healthy. A spread pattern with no obvious direction usually means multiple airborne/overland infections. Root graft infections can \\"fan\\" out in 360 degree pattern, but tend to head faster in one or two directions because of soil and topography changes and tree species arrangement/diversity. Oak wilt and buckthorn cleanup on oak savanna in Chisago County, Minnesota autumn/after leaf drop 2007 A birds-eye view of an infection center, during the middle of summer, going from oldest to newest based on colors would show: stone dead gray, brown, yellow, orange, green. So, if one doesn't see these color sequences or, a hub and spoke pattern radiating out, they are probably looking at multiple airborne infections. Looks can be deceiving because 2-6 large wilting oaks may often have only 1-2 trees left nearby to infect. Compared-to one oak deep in the woods that is just starting to wilt that can lead-to 2-5 dozen more nearby oaks dying in the next 5 years. So, proper ground ID & diagnosis is crucial for stopping this disease. Stopping spread with multiple infections means plowlines will be further out, so natural barriers should be located first. In the Lake States, a vibratory plow line is installed 54 to 72 inches deep in the ground and 60 ‚Äì 150 feet away from the diseased oak. Plowing done correctly ruptures healthy roots that could, in the future, transmit oak wilt to neighboring healthy trees. Installing plow lines far enough away from diseased oaks is key to preventing root graft disease transmission. In southern states like Texas, where heavy clay or Caliche soils are prevalent, rocksaws are commonly used in lieu of vibratory plows. Infected oaks should not be cut down before vibratory plowing because, doing so will speed up oak wilt root graft spread to nearby healthy oaks. Base of trunk or root flare injections of azole or copper based fungicides can help contain foliar - or top down - infections but are costly and have less success containing root graft - bottom up - transmission of oak wilt. = Strategies - Containment vs. Control = There is a big difference between containment and control. Containment happens within a few hours or days; control takes weeks or many months. The lack of appreciation and understanding for disease control methods and strategies has led to a lot of landowners and taxpayers thinking there is no way to control oak wilt. Despite 40‚Äì50 years of work & study showing oak wilt as one of the easiest to control forest diseases in North America. Putting a plowline around an oak wilt infection center is containment, which is not controlling the disease. Going inside the containment lines or natural barriers/edges/cover type changes and making sure all oak wilt infections are dead and gone is control. Landowners and managers have to ask themselves this question (are we going to be containing or controlling this disease?) before starting a disease control project, whether in a small yard or on hundreds of acres. Control also means removal and processing - mostly by logging - of future spore-producing oaks. For the last 40‚Äì50 years, experienced professionals throughout North America have been doing insect & disease control year round, not four or six months per year. They stop oak wilt spread by identifying future spore producing red oaks, which trees to protect from wounding, which trees not threatened by root graft infection then, respond same day to tree health changes. Agriculture and construction work starts in April‚ÄìMay each year, so it behooves oak wilt specialists to continue disease control work and prevention right through spring and early summer. Healthy white oak (Q. alba) remaining after cleaning up 7-1-11 storm damage & oak wilt infections, 13 months after storm, 2012, Chisago County Minnesota After 2005, treatment goals shifted towards \\"passive oak wilt control\\" on properties less than 5 acres and treating to natural barriers or edges for large acreages. Passive control means letting the disease burn out over a few years which allows other native tree and shrub species to take over. Treating to natural barriers means restoring to native forest or savanna species by harvesting out to where oak wilt can no longer expand via root grafts. All oaks of the species that is infected are logged out, whether they are infected or healthy. Passive oak wilt control on large acreages creates short and long-term problems for oaks. White oak group trees are at risk for infection from nearby sporulating red oak group trees for the short term; invasive species can take over and monocultures of oaks can re- develop that sustain oak wilt infections for 50-100 more years making for long term risks. Treating to natural barriers/edges or cover type changes is by far the best method to use when controlling oak wilt on large acreages. Importance Oak wilt is a devastating disease, killing trees rapidly in a single season. It is an important disease in urban areas where a few oak trees in a homeowner's yard may be of great value. If one tree in the homeowners yard becomes infected it will die. Not only will the homeowner need to pay to remove the dead tree, they will also need to protect the rest of the oak trees in their yard or face the prospect that remaining oaks will continue to die. Loss of trees from a property can also lead to a decrease in property value. Even if a homeowner is vigilant about pruning at the correct time, storms and construction can damage trees and introduce oak wilt into a neighborhood. In forest systems, oak wilt is an important disease of oak produced for hardwood lumber and railroad ties. =July 1, 2011 Windstorm in Minnesota and Wisconsin= North Flank of 7-1-2011 Windstorm went thru northern Pine and Carlton Counties Minnesota. Photo shows hilltop infections from May 24‚Äì25, 2016 wind & hailstorms;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:24_-_25_May_2016_NOAA_NWS_Storm_Maps.pdf spores came from 7-1-11 storm-created infection center near Kerrick, Minnesota In 2012 and 2013, oak wilt disease showed-up in areas of east central Minnesota and northern Wisconsin where it had never been seen before. The infections appeared to have coincided-with the July 1, 2011 mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) windstorm,NWS NOAA https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Storm_1_01July2011_SW_to_NE.pdf which had windspeeds of over 100 mph, because foresters found that first oaks infected were 7-1-11 storm-damaged oaks. They also knew infections happened within 48 hours of storm damage. West-facing slopes on the east bank (Wisconsin side) and terrace crests in the St. Croix river valley were hit hard with wind damage and oak wilt infections. Hilltops and bottoms and field edges, where oaks were more exposed, also had more serious wind and oak wilt damage. Approximately 3/4 million acres in Minnesota, possibly 10 times that area for WisconsinWI DNR https://forestrynews.blogs.govdelivery.com/2018/12/03/new-northern-oak-wilt- detections/ and up to the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan, were affected by the storm. Millions of freshly wounded oak trees were now open to infection from trillions of oak wilt spores carried-in by the storm. Infection Levels- Spore Loads It's difficult for oaks to get infected in mid summer - after July 1 - because it's too hot for red oaks to sporulate and latewood cell development has been underway since early to mid-June. Two factors changed this around on July 1, 2011: the trillions of oak wilt spores carried-in from west-southwest and the windstorm's tearing/shredding/breaking-apart trees which re-opened oaks' 2011 & 2010 earlywood cells (earlywood is also called springwood, and latewood goes by the name summerwood in some areas). The oak wilt fungus is too big to fit within the smaller latewood cells, but can fit within and move upward through the much larger earlywood cells. This storm damage increased the chances of infection 1,000 - 1,000,000 times the usual. Instead of one new infection per 1,500 acres, foresters were seeing one new infection per 10 acres. The manageable level of oak wilt disease is one infection per 640 acres.7-1-2011 storm-caused oak wilt on terrace crest in Rushsheba Township, Chisago County, MinnesotaSouth Flank of 7-1-2011 Windstorm went thru St. Croix County, Wisconsin. Photo shows one of five 7-1-11 infection centers on hilltop near East Farmington, Wisconsin One year after the storm, in summer 2012, oak wilt specialists found 10 - 20 infections per 100 acres both in Rushseba Township, Chisago County Minnesota and at St. Croix State ParkMinnesota DNR Forestry 2012 Forest Health Annual Report, p. 37 in Pine County, Minnesota. Wounding & infecting at ten oaks per 100 acres, one oak per 100 acres or one oak per 200 acres presents a serious threat to the oak resource. St. Croix State Park's northernmost infected oak and southernmost infected oak were 10 miles apart. This broad coverage of oak wilt blanketing millions of acres is achieved only with huge spore supplies and re- opening of that years' earlywood cells.

During the storm, oak wilt spread at up to 100 miles per hour. In the two years following the 2011 storm, infections were found at new locations in four Minnesota and at least one (Sawyer) of three Wisconsin counties.Wisconsin DNR Division of Forestry, Annual Report 2012 p. 6WI DNR https://forestrynews.blogs.govdelivery.com/2018/12/03/new-northern-oak-wilt- detections/ These 2011 infections have serious ecological/economic impacts, including loss of stumpage and real estate values, and will only get worse if summer (aerial with ground follow up) surveys aren't established as soon as possible. Host-Parasite Interaction Hardwood vascular wilt diseases are characterized by blockage of the tree's water-conducting vessels by either the physical presence of the pathogen (mycelium and spores), or through the host's own response to infection. Oak trees, in response to wounding or infection often produce tyloses, balloon-like outgrowths of the vessels' cell walls that can function to wall-off pathogens and prevent infections from spreading. Red oaks appear to lack a host-response mechanism that restricts the pathogen's movement, and infection usually kills the tree by wilting the entire crown. White oaks, which produce tyloses more quickly and in greater numbers, are more resistant to the disease, though the exact mechanism for this resistance is unknown. Origin The causal agent, Bretziella fagacearum, is found only within the borders of the United States, but the origin of the pathogen is not known. Recent evidence suggests that the pathogen was introduced into the United States, possibly from Central or South America, or Mexico.Juzwik, J.; Harrington, T.C.; MacDonald, W.L.; Appel, D.N. (2008), \\"The origin of Ceratocystis fagacearum, the oak wilt fungus\\", \\"Annual Review of Phytopathology\\",46: 13-26, The disease currently affects much of the eastern and central US, from Virginia to Minnesota to Arkansas, with pockets of infection as far southwestward as the Hill Country of central Texas. One area of infection has recently been discovered as far northeastward as Glenville, New York. It is particularly common in the Midwest.

The park is mainly a family park. Within it there are a variety of different attractions including a playground, a botanical garden and places of historical interest. There is a lake in the park with geese and ducks, and the Calderstones Mansion House, which features a caf√© and a children's play area.  Notable Features  = The Calderstones = The Calderstones are six neolithic sandstone boulders remaining from a dolmen. Little was known about the Calderstones until the 18th century when they are thought to have been disturbed. In 1825 it was reported that, \\"in digging about them, urns made of the coarsest clay, containing human dust and bones were found\\". During the mid and later 19th century certain academics had declared the Calderstones to have been part of a druidical circle. In the closing years of the century Professor Herdman returned to the earlier evidence and concluded that the stones were once part of a ruined dolmen which had been mistakenly taken for a circle due to the false impression held that all druidical remains should be so arranged. > The six surviving stones are of local sandstone and their sizes range from > approximately eight by three feet to three and a half by two and a half > feet.

Several of the carvings are similar to examples found in Anglesey > and the late-neolithic burial site of Newgrange in the Boyne Valley. The stones were relocated by Joseph Need Walker during his ownership, becoming a gateway feature to the eponymous estate. The stones are now housed in the Harthill Greenhouses in Calderstones Park, having been moved from their previous location in an enclosure just outside the park gates in 1954 to protect them from further weathering. = Calderstones House = The mansion house was built in 1828 by Joseph Need Walker to replace the original farmhouse known as the Old House. The house is of Georgian style, though it has been subject to some alterations over the years and now houses council offices and a small caf√©. The extensive stables and coachhouse remain at the rear of the house. The mansion house is currently being refurbished to accommodate the International Headquarters for Shared Reading. This refurbishment is being run by the Reader Organisation. =The Allerton Oak= One of the park's two most ancient features, estimated at 1,000 years old, is an oak tree. According to legend the ancient local Hundred Court sat beneath its branches. Its dilapidated state is said to be due to the explosion of the gunpowder ship Lottie Sleigh over three miles away on the River Mersey in 1864. It is dependent upon a number of props that hold it up. Acorns and leaves from the oak were sent to soldiers by their families during World War II, such was the reputation of this tree. The tree was named England's 'tree of the year' in 2019 by Woodland Trust. =Botanical garden= After World War II Percy Conn, the new Superintendent of Liverpool Parks, had the vision to recreate the Liverpool Botanic Garden of William Roscoe & John Shepherd from the Mount Pleasant days, in the Harthill Estate grounds at Calderstones Park. This work was started in 1951 and completed in 1964 when the set of 16 connected glasshouses was formally opened. Calderstones botanical garden contained almost 4,000 species of plants brought from all over the world by merchants and other travellers. As funding was very tight post-war, low-grade spruce, rather than teak, was used to build the glasshouses, and by 1979 they had reached the end of their useful lives. The early 1980s was another occasion when the Liverpool City economy was dire, and no money could be found to re-build the glasshouses. The botanical importance of the park encouraged further horticultural improvements such as the creation of a Japanese Garden by park apprentices in 1969, and the introduction of a ‚Äòbog garden‚Äô linked to the artificial lake. In 1984 the glasshouses were closed and all the plants transported to the Liverpool City nursery at Garston, where they remained for the next 23 years. Some of the plants were occasionally seen at Southport Flower Shows over this period. In 2007/2008 a third of the plants were re- housed in 4 glasshouses within Croxteth Hall‚Äôs walled gardens when Garston Nursery was closed as a consequence of the outsourcing of Liverpool‚Äôs Park & Garden maintenance work. Activities in the park =Tennis Tournament= Calderstones Park's tennis court Set in the park, the Tradition-ICAP Liverpool International began in 2002 (with the women's event beginning in 2006) and has attracted many well known tennis stars such as Martina Navratilova, Ivan Ljubiƒçiƒá and David Ferrer.

It is one of the most controversial Spider-Man stories ever told. Although it was intended to wrap up in less than a year, the comics sold very well and the writers were encouraged to prolong the saga as long as possible. This led to some changes to the storyline that ultimately proved unpopular.Goletz, Andrew, and Glenn Greenberg.NewComicsReviews.com: \\"Life of Reilly\\", 35-part series, GreyHaven Magazine, 2003, n.d. Although many people involved were involved in its creation, the Clone Saga is most closely associated with Terry Kavanagh, who proposed the idea, Howard Mackie, who worked on the majority of the smaller crossovers involved in the overall storyarc, and Gerry Conway, who devised the original story. Executive editors on the storyline included Tom DeFalco, Bob Budiansky, and Bob Harras. Storyline There were two \\"Clone Sagas\\": the original storyline in the 1970s and the second saga which consumed all the regular Spider-Man series, several limited series and one shots between 1994 and 1997. Between the two, there were also two smaller storylines that dealt with elements from the original saga. thumb =The original Clone Saga= In the summer of 1973, writer Gerry Conway made the decision to kill off the girlfriend of Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, in The Amazing Spider-Man #121 because the editorial team felt that Gwen had become stale as a character and they wanted to instill an additional element of tragedy into Peter Parker's life.100 Greatest Marvels, #9‚Äì6, introduction to reprint of Amazing Spider-Man vol. 1, #121 In the follow-up arcs, Conway introduced a new villain called the Jackal and let Gwen Stacy seemingly return from the dead. The Jackal was the villain identity of Gwen and Peter's biology professor Miles Warren, who could not cope with the death of Gwen, with whom he had a secret infatuation. As an expert on cloning, he creates clones of both Gwen and Peter, discovering Peter is Spider-Man as a result. Jackal blames Spider-Man for Gwen's death and wants to kill him.Amazing Spider-Man #141‚Äì151 The Jackal kidnaps Spider-Man and forces him to fight his clone. Both men believe they are the real Peter Parker. The two Spider-Men soon decide to work together, but one is seemingly killed by the same bomb that kills the Jackal. The surviving Spider-Man determines he is the original because he is in love with Mary Jane Watson, which did not happen until after Prof. Warren created the clone. Spider-Man drops the body of the clone into an incinerator. Gwen Stacy's clone disappears to find a new life for herself. The Amazing Spider-Man #149, the climactic installment of the original Clone Saga, leaves it ambiguous whether it is the original Spider-Man or his clone who perishes in the bomb explosion. Conway said this ambiguity was unintentional, as at the time he took it as a given that Marvel would never replace the star of The Amazing Spider-Man with a clone. =Clone stories in the interim between the Clone Sagas= A few years later, Spider-Man encountered Carrion, who claimed to be a degenerated clone of Warren.Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #25‚Äì31. The clone of Gwen Stacy reappeared many years later when she was being pursued by the High Evolutionary, who was determined to discover how Warren had been able to perfect cloning. In the process, he discovered that Warren had not, but had instead created a genetic virus which transformed already living beings into supposed clones of other people. It was claimed that the Gwen clone was really a woman named Joyce Delany who was seemingly cured of the virus and left to lead her own life once more.Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #8; part of the \\"Evolutionary War\\" story arc. Later, Spider-Man investigated Warren's old laboratory and discovered that Carrion was another former student of Warren's, Malcolm McBride, who was infected with the virus and became the new Carrion.Spectacular Spider-Man #149. Many years after that in Scarlet Spider Unlimited #1, this story arc was molded to fit into the New Clone Saga. =The second Clone Saga= More years passed before Spider-Man's clone reappeared. He had survived the battle and for five years had lived an existence under the name Ben Reilly (a combination of Peter's Uncle Ben's first name and Aunt May's maiden name), and develops a superhero identity of his own as Scarlet Spider after returning to New York City. A series of chaotic events followed, in which Peter and Ben were plagued by both a resurrected Jackal and by Kaine, who was an unsuccessful first clone. In the process, another clone of Spider- Man became the villain Spidercide. Matters were further confused by the interventions of the mysterious and seemingly all-powerful Judas Traveller and Scrier. The revelations made by the High Evolutionary were revealed to have been inaccurate, driven by a determination to discredit Warren, who had formerly worked with him. Medical tests indicated Peter was actually the clone and Ben the original. Peter temporarily retired as Spider-Man, leaving the mantle of Spider-Man to Ben while he prepared for his new role as a father after the discovery that Mary Jane was pregnant; Peter even lost his powers for a time during his 'retirement', although they eventually came back after a near-death experience. The climax revealed that Peter, Ben, the Jackal and many others had all been manipulated for years by Norman Osborn a.k.a. the Green Goblin, who had returned from the dead and had been secretly masterminding the entire saga. Osborn said Peter was the original‚Äîhaving faked the evidence that revealed Peter's status as the clone as part of a plan to break Peter's spirit‚Äîa claim that was confirmed when Ben died saving Peter's life and his body degenerated like any other clone's. Spider-Man: The Osborn Journal (February 1997) explains the Green Goblin's role in the entire storyline. Selected bibliography During the mid-1990s, Marvel consistently published four monthly Spider-Man series, roughly one every week. For the most part, the Spider-titles were treated during this storyline as a single weekly series, although occasionally they would separate, pair off, or have special anniversary editions. The Clone Saga ran through all four titles from October 1994 to December 1996, in addition to a multitude of spin-offs, one-shots, and ancillary issues.

In 2011 a re-release was scheduled, now titled Spider-Man: The Original Clone Saga. Though no longer in print, there was a trade paperback released in 1997 titled Spider-Man: Revelations () which collected the four- part \\"Revelations\\" storyline that ran in Amazing Spider-Man #418, Peter Parker: Spider-Man #75, Sensational Spider-Man #11, and Spectacular Spider-Man #240. Originally, The Osborn Journal was to be included. Instead, Spider-Man #75 has 14 bonus pages. The first seven show Ben fighting briefly with Norman Osborn, set during Amazing Spider-Man #418. The second seven show Peter and Mary Jane mourning over the loss of Ben Reilly and Baby May, which has Spider- Man dumping Ben's ashes in the river. The bonus pages are drawn by John Romita Jr.. Marvel reprinted the second saga's entire run in large TPBs titled Spider-Man: The Complete Clone Saga Epic. As of December 2013 five volumes (collecting between 12 and 19 issues each) have been released. After the fifth volume the reprint series was retitled Spider-Man: The Complete Ben Reilly Epic and began with The Return Of Spider-Man arc and Reilly's tenure as Spider-Man. As mentioned above, a re-release of the original 1970s story was released in summer 2011, bridging the Clone Saga and Ben Reilly Epics.  Production and development controversy =Conception= The second Clone Saga sprang from Marvel Comics's determination to produce a strong Spider-Man \\"event\\" story that would rival DC Comics' \\"The Death of Superman\\" and \\"Batman: Knightfall,\\" both of which sold extremely well. Spider-Man editor Mark Bernardo said \\"Marching orders we were given by upper management to come up with something similar in scope to DC's \\"Death of Superman\\" storyline, which at the time was breaking sales records left and right. Thus, no outrageous idea was out of bounds. Terry Kavanagh was cajoled into blurting out his clone idea, which first met with groans and indifference, until someone (to my recollection, J.M. DeMatteis) suddenly realized the radical possibilities of such a storyline.\\" Several of the Spider-Man creators believed that the character had drifted too far from his original portrayal and sought a way to restore the Spider-Man of old, in particular jettisoning his marriage to Mary Jane. Howard Mackie revealed \\"When the story was begun we knew it would be controversial, and that was part of the point.\\" He also commented \\"The return to the single Spider-Man did enter the conversation eventually, but it was not the intent of the story when pitched.\\"Adler, Matt. Matt Adler talks THE CLONE SAGA with Howard Mackie!, Ain't it Cool News. Bernardo added that the length of the arc was initially planned to be short, \\"The whole arc was supposed to end in Amazing Spider-Man #400, and leave 'Ben Reilly' as the one and only 'original Peter Parker' and forge a new beginning. The whole storyline was supposed to simplify Spider-Man's mythos and ultimately bring him \\"back to basics.\\" Eventually, editor-in-chief Tom Defalco gave the final approval to begin the story. =Establishing the clone= Although the readers had been getting clues about a mysterious figure with links to Peter Parker in the issues leading up to the story, the starting point for the second Clone Saga was the end of Spectacular Spider-Man #216 (Sept 1994), written by Tom DeFalco and Todd Dezago, in which Spider-Man was confronted by an exact look-alike of himself. In the following issues, the writers established the clone's backstory as a frightened, homeless outcast; and introduced the character Judas Traveller. The writers set up the possibility that the clone could be the real Spider-Man. The clone was then further developed editorially, and given the name Ben Reilly. Additionally, he became known as the super-hero the Scarlet Spider, complete with a unique costume. =Early development trouble= According to established Spider-Man assistant editor Glenn Greenberg \\"No one‚Äînot the writers, not the editors‚Äîseemed to know who or what the hell Judas Traveller was. He was seemingly this immensely powerful, quasi- mystical being with amazing abilities, but what was the real deal with him? ... But to be honest, a character like Traveller didn't really fit into Spider-Man's world.\\" As such, Traveller's role would remain a mystery to readers for a while, as writers dropped him in and out of this saga. Tom DeFalco came up with the idea of making Spider-Man's wife Mary Jane pregnant, feeling it would be a dramatic event that would help set up the saga's ultimate resolution. But then, Marvel Comics experienced a major financial crisis which nearly bankrupted the company. In consequence, editor-in-chief DeFalco was fired, and Marvel's comic line was broken into five separate groups each with its own editor-in-chief. Bob Budiansky became editor-in-chief on the Spider-Man line. By then, the writers had established a new villain, Kaine. To prove that he was dangerous, the writers had him killing classic Spider-Man foes, including Doctor Octopus, with his corpse shown to rule out any possibility that he would return. However, Kaine soon became another reoccurring character of unexplained origin and purpose, like Judas Traveller and the Scrier, whose roles would not be revealed for quite some time. Then, the creative staff brought back the Jackal, the original culprit of the clones. He was used as a plot device to explain the \\"clone degeneration\\" and also set up the possibility he was part of a greater plan by Judas Traveller and Scrier. In this plot developed by J.M. DeMatteis, and part written by Todd DeZago and Howard Mackie, Jackal gave readers doubt and suspicion by stating that Peter was the clone, followed by a reverse statement, and then assessing them as both being clones of an original; because of this, the story was considered convoluted.Spider-Man Vol.1 #56 In a 2008 interview, Glenn Greenberg recalled \\"It only made sense, from a dramatic standpoint. It was this story that kicked off what would become an increasingly tiresome stream of clones, lies upon lies, fake-outs, and convoluted twists and turns.\\" At this point, the creative staff, seemingly without strict direction, inserted a lot of open plot points waiting to be resolved, such as Ben Reilly worrying about \\"degeneration\\" of his body due to cloning, why Kaine was protecting Spider-Man but preying on Ben Reilly, why Ben and Spider-Man shared dreams, why Kaine was foreseeing Mary Jane's death, who the mysterious new character Seward Trainer was as well as the identity of the \\"Third Peter Parker\\" aka Spidercide. With a plethora of writers and editors, the storyline was initiated throughout all the regular Spider-Man series, but slowly grew out of control. The sales department requested extensions to the storyline, buoyed up by very strong sales on the book at a time when most other comics were experiencing a noticeable decline. With this extension, the storyline outlived several key creative staff and many decisions on the eventual direction of the storyline were changed. With Amazing Spider-Man #400, in a controversial decision, the writers ended the life of Spider-Man's aunt May Parker, a major supporting character since 1962. The \\"Mark of Kaine\\" arc added still more clones of Spider-Man. With this arc, the sales of the Spider-Man comics skyrocketed, and therefore, the writers were encouraged to keep the saga going longer. = Establishing Ben Reilly as Spider-Man = At the conclusion of the story arc \\"The Trial of Peter Parker\\" in Spectacular Spider-Man #226, Peter is revealed by Dr. Seward Trainer as the clone of Ben. Peter retired as Spider- Man based on this premise and moved to Portland to live with Mary Jane, allowing Ben to take over as Spider-Man. This resulted in a major backlash by fans, that wrote letters to Marvel with various complaints. Goletz said that the next chapter in the saga was to \\"begin the new era of Spider-Man. Peter and Mary Jane would be written out of the books, and sent off to live in peace with their soon-to-be-born child. Ben would get the chance to establish himself as Spider-Man and move forward. Going into the planning stages for what would turn out to be 'Maximum Clonage', the intent was indeed to finish up the clone story line once and for all and quickly get Ben started as Spider-Man.\\" Also, the Gwen Stacy clone who had started the whole Clone Saga in the 1970s was to be killed to provide a fitting end. But impressed by the Age of Apocalypse crossover of sister Marvel Comics title X-Men, in which huge sales were achieved by long, spread-out story lines, Bob Budiansky ordered to duplicate this recipe for the Maximum Clonage project. Instead of tying up loose ends, the story was changed in such a way that practically every issue brought up new clones. Instead of being killed, the Gwen Stacy clone was allowed to slip away unnoticed. The story arc was heavily criticized for its undefined character motives, and an apparent lack of distinction between villains, heroes, and their allies.http://www.spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/spiderman_one_shots/maxcloneomega.html'' Following the end of \\"Maximum Clonage\\", the creative staff launched revamps of established villains (a new female Doctor Octopus, a new Vulture, and the Grim Hunter, the son of Kraven the Hunter), without much success. DeMatteis resigned out of creative weariness with the saga's repeated extensions, later likening the work to \\"writing chapter two of a multi-part story month after month\\". Greenberg recalled: \\"The idea was to have each Spider-Man book retitled so that the Scarlet Spider's name would replace Spider-Man's‚ÄîAmazing Scarlet Spider, Spectacular Scarlet Spider, Ben Reilly Scarlet Spider, and Web of Scarlet Spider. We'd get four new number #1's out of it, and it would be a way to capitalize on the Scarlet Spider's popularity one last time before he became (the new) Spider-Man. What that meant was holding off Ben's debut as Spider-Man even longer.\\" Though Budiansky and the rest of the editorial staff wanted the retitling to be a one-off for each series, the Scarlet Spider was popular enough for Marvel's sales and marketing to insist on four issues of each title. Ultimately, they compromised on two issues of each title. =Change of heart= In the story \\"Return of Spider-Man\\", opening in the newest series Sensational Spider-Man #0, Ben finds a new Spider-Man suit and develops a life of his own. More efforts were taken to solidify Ben as the new Spider-Man, such as establishing a supporting cast for Ben. However, there were many staff that had a hard time accepting Ben as Peter's replacement, such as the new writer of \\"Sensational\\", Dan Jurgens. Jurgens wanted to work on the Peter Parker version of the character, and was disappointed to have Ben instead, and so he made a plea to Budiansky to bring back Parker, arguing that Ben confused new readers, and was a disappointment to longtime readers who had grown to love Parker. Budiansky was sold on the idea.http://lifeofreillyarchives.blogspot.com/2008/03/part-19.html The Spider- Man: The Final Adventure limited series was originally intended to end with the birth of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson's baby, and finally leave Ben Reilly as the sole focal point of the franchise. But Budiansky was now set on reinstating Peter Parker as Spider-Man, and felt that it would be implausible for him to resume that role if he were a father. So that the series would still have the appearance of a major impact, writer Fabian Nicieza replaced the baby's birth with the removal of Parker's powers, done in such a way that the writers of the regular titles could quickly reinstate them. The task of actually reestablishing Parker as the true Spider-Man without it seeming like a cop-out was daunting enough that Budiansky invited the whole of Marvel's staff to offer ideas. Greenberg recalled \\"I think even the janitor and the mail room guys weighed in at one point. It got a little out of hand, to put it mildly... the memos really started coming in at this point, fast and furious... and I've still got every single one of them, in one big, thick, hernia-inducing file.\\" To provoke new interest from the readers, the storyline \\"Return of Kaine\\" introduced a skeleton that was discovered in the original clone saga lab wearing a Spider-Man suit; however, none of the writers or editorial staff had a theory of what the skeleton's significance was. At this time, Greenberg recalled, the plan for the Clone Saga was: \\"A mysterious figure was intended to be the sole mastermind behind the entire Clone Saga, a powerful and influential figure who was controlling Seward Trainer and manipulating the lives of Peter Parker and Ben Reilly from the shadows. Forced to wear an environmental suit to maintain his life functions, he would eventually be restored to health by Seward, and at that point, we would reveal his identity.\\" However, in July 1995 Tom Brevoort proposed a story in which Ben Reilly is sent five years back in time (to the end of the original Clone Saga) by the Scrier, as part of a contest between himself and Judas Traveller. The Scrier would be revealed as Mephisto, who would appear at the end of the \\"time loop\\" to give Ben the option of saving Peter's life in place of his own. This would eliminate the idea that either Ben or Peter was a clone, instead asserting that Ben was Peter from 5 years in the future, sent back by Mephisto to co-exist with the current Peter. The Jackal would be responsible for convincing Peter that was sent back in time that he was a clone, thus taking on the ID of Ben. The major selling point to this plan was that it would restore the memories of Ben (who was really Peter all along) and thus hopefully satisfy longtime readers. Budiansky and Greenberg fleshed out the storyline with plans for publication in April 1996. = Creative stalemate = While the \\"Time Loop\\" idea had won the approval of the editorial staff, the writers unanimously refused to adopt it, with the minimal role of Spider-Man himself in the storyline being the most troubling issue. The writers proposed alternative solutions, but none of them attained editorial approval the way the \\"Time Loop\\" idea had. As a result, the Spider-Man group was unable to proceed with any conclusion to the saga, despite agreement among both writers and editors that it should end as soon as possible.http://lifeofreillyarchives.blogspot.com/2008/03/part-23.html Greenberg recalls that \\"Budiansky was mired in indecision, and it was hurting the entire line.\\" Finally, Jurgens wrote a memo proposing that the saga end with Ben being revealed as a clone and dying in a climactic act of heroism, while Mary Jane has a miscarriage and separates from Peter. He concluded the memo with \\"This proposal has holes. But I believe it serves as a general framework we can all work with to fill in as needed. This is my last shot. After this, I give up.\\" In November 1995, a story outline drafted by Jurgens and Budiansky and titled \\"Blood Brothers\\" was distributed to the Spider-Man staff. It roughly followed the idea proposed in Jurgens' memo, but added in the revelation that the mastermind behind the saga was Harry Osborn. As a result of a downgrade, Marvel dissolved the five editor-in-chief positions, leaving only one: Bob Harras. Harras rejected the idea of Osborn being the villain and ordered the \\"Clone Saga\\"'s finale to be postponed six months to avoid competition with the crossover storyline \\"Onslaught\\". Jurgens left Marvel in frustration at the postponement. Published issues had already dropped clues at Harry Osborn being the villain, and with him eliminated, Budiansky felt compelled to write a memo forbidding that Harry's father Norman take the role: \\"Norman's death should never be undone, in my opinion. It's too classic... Let him rest in peace.\\" However, as part of a fresh wave of downsizing in Marvel's ranks, Budiansky was laid off.Goletz, Andrew (March 5, 2008). \\"Part 24\\". The Life of Reilly. (Blogger). =Resolution= Harras replaced Budiansky with Ralph Macchio as editor, who declared that Norman Osborn would be the master planner of the cloning. Glenn Greenberg recalled that \\"The reaction was not enthusiastic. I don't think ANYONE - from the writers to the editors to the assistant editors - agreed with Harras's idea, although his rationale certainly made sense to a certain extent. Harras felt that there was only one person who could have had the money, the resources, the connections, the knowledge, and the motivation to orchestrate the Clone Saga and disrupt Peter Parker's life to such a profound extent.\\"http://lifeofreillyarchives.blogspot.com/2008/03/part-28_05.html The saga was resolved in \\"Revelations\\", which concluded in Spider-Man #75. In order to give Norman Osborn's return some credibility and link to continuity, Greenberg charted a detailed timeline to explain how Norman had survived his death and what he had been doing in the years he was believed to be dead. Though this timeline was originally intended only as an internal reference for the creative staff, it became the basis for the follow-up one-shot, \\"The Osborn Journals\\". The issue revealed the details of the Clone Saga from Norman Osborn's perspective, and resolves many plot points, including the skeleton in the smokestack. Spider-Man: The Clone Saga Ex-editor-in-chief Tom DeFalco said that under him, the Clone Saga would have been resolved in a different way: \\"Our plan was to structure the clone saga like a three-act play. Act One would climax at or around Amazing #400‚Äîwhen we revealed that Pete was the clone and Ben was the real guy. Act Two would last around three months and follow Ben's adventures. In Act Three, Peter would triumphantly return as the one, true Spider-Man. Mark and I was hoping the Spider-crew could make Ben a viable character during his turn in the spotlight, and we planned to star Ben in his own monthly title after Peter returned. It was kind of like what I had already done with Thor and Thunderstrike‚Äîtwo very different titles based on a single concept. Of course, our plan went into the trash the day I got fired.\\" In September 2009, a six-part mini-series based on the outline of the original Clone Saga came out, written by Tom DeFalco and Howard Mackie, and drawn by Todd Nauck. Series co-creator Howard Mackie described how this project was born: \\"Somewhere along the line I discovered a notebook which contained the original notes from the very first meeting at which the clone story was discussed. The original notes showed that the story was planned as a three month event spread across the four monthly Spider-Man titles. At some point Ralph talked to Joe Quesada, and I got a phone call from Ralph [Macchio] asking if I wanted to do a mini-series showing a version that was truer to what the writers originally imagined. Tom and I remember certain story points differently. The goal with this mini-series was get back to basics, to strip away the extraneous stuff that got layered onto the original story, and to present the cleanest possible version of what was a pretty simple story at heart. It was decided that it would be best if only two writers collaborated on this mini-series.\\" According to DeFalco, the series closely followed Mackie's notes, but necessarily filled out what was essentially a rough outline with details. In addition, they decided that Jackal and Kaine had to be included in the story in order to cater to fan expectations, even though neither character is mentioned in Mackie's notes. =Plot summary= Ben Reilly and Peter bond after Kaine attacks them, and Ben stays in New York as Peter's blond-haired cousin so he can build a life of his own. He adopts the identity of the Scarlet Spider and works at the Daily Grind. Ben, Peter, and Kaine reach the lair of the shadowy figure responsible for infecting Aunt May and Mary Jane with a genetic virus. The villain is revealed to be the Jackal, who captures all three and reveals that he plans to make an army of Spider- clones and take over the world. Since Ben was the only clone to turn out stable, Jackal takes a sample of his blood to perfect his cloning technique. A mastermind over Jackal wants the blood sample as well, for the body of Norman Osborn. The Jackal intends to clone Gwen Stacy and another unknown figure, and Kaine breaks himself, Ben, and Peter free. During the subsequent fight, the clones dissolve and Jackal suggests that Ben is the original Peter Parker. Kaine kills Jackal, Ben and Peter escape with the cure and save Aunt May and Mary Jane, who is revealed to be pregnant. Peter retires, saying Ben is the real one, so Ben creates a new costume. Peter and MJ begin planning for their baby with the support of Aunt May, while Peter focuses on acquiring a research grant. Ben battles Doctor Octopus, who escapes after knocking down debris. After Ben tracks him down, the villain notes that the newly costumed Spider- Man seems to be an imposter. Kaine arrives and attempts to kill Octopus by asphyxiating him with some webbing and then escaping. Ben shreds the webbing off, saving his life. Informed that Mary Jane is about to give birth, Ben and Peter swing to the hospital in their respective Spider-Man costumes. They come into conflict with Kaine, who escapes and is chased by Ben as Peter goes to the hospital. At the hospital, the baby is born and named May Parker. The nurse takes the baby to ready her for the parents, but actually hands the baby to Kaine at the docks. Kaine tells the mastermind he has the baby, who remarks that it will be raised overseas. The mastermind, now in control of a Parker blood sample, resurrects Norman. The mastermind, Harry Osborn, gives a Green Goblin mask to Norman and tells him there is work to be done. Moments later, Harry attacks Ben and captures him as bait for Peter. Harry asserts that Ben is just a clone. Kaine speaks with the revived Norman, who is a clone, and discusses baby May's fate. Kaine tells Norman he feels that May is his family in addition to Ben, Peter, Mary Jane, and the elder May, and she should not be held accountable for the sins of her father. Harry deploys a Goblin signal outside the building (OsCorp), which attracts Peter, who is still searching for his daughter. Peter finds Ben and both are threatened by Harry. Norman blasts Harry and tells him that he cannot continue the cycle of violence. Peter frees Ben, and both help Norman. Peter's shoulder is dislocated, and Ben demands to know where baby May is, as Aunt May and Mary Jane wonder where Peter is. Kaine enters through a window with baby May and gives her to her family. Back at OsCorp, Harry is restrained by Ben, so he activates his glider to impale Peter from behind. Ben prepares to leap in the path of the flying glider, but Norman jumps in the way, killing himself with it once more. Norman disintegrates due to cellular degeneration. Harry vows to get even. He is put in a sanitarium. Ben leaves the city, but says he will return from time to time. Peter tells Ben that both villains were liars, and it does not matter who is the clone, but they each have a life. Criticism The decision to replace Peter with Ben as the regular, true Spider-Man met with a massive outcry from many readers and was also unpopular with many of the creative staff of the day. Judas Traveller and Scrier were seen as too far out of Spider-Man's league to serve as villains. The decision to resurrect the original Green Goblin was also very controversial; his death was part of the acclaimed \\"Death of Gwen Stacy\\" storyline. Glenn Greenberg, author of the Osborn Journal, commented \\"If Norman was alive and watching everything from the shadows, why did he let his son Harry die? Why did he let the first Hobgoblin come into being-especially since Hobgoblin #1 broke into Norman's secret hideout and stole his personal journals? ...[Tom] Brevoort felt that there was just no way that Norman could have been alive all that time. Tom B. felt that if Norman could manipulate Spider-Man's life from afar, for so long, to such an extent, then so much of what had occurred in the books over the years would never have happened, or would have happened very differently.\\"http://lifeofreillyarchives.blogspot.com/2008/03/part-30.html Spider-Man editor Mark Bernardo said \\"the length of the story arc was initially planned to be short, but rapidly spun out of control and ended as a fiasco: Ironically, the whole storyline, which was supposed to simplify Spider-Man's mythos and ultimately bring him \\"back to basics\\" ended up complicating everything beyond what anyone imagined!\\" Howard Mackie stated that \\"the Clone Saga has not always had the best rap. The thing that struck me in reading various things on the Internet is that people would complain about the Clone Saga, and then go on about how wonderful Ben Reilly was. There is a big movement of ‚ÄúBring Back Ben Reilly‚Äù folks. I found that very curious.\\" Mackie remarked that the length of the saga resulted in so many conflicting plot elements that even though most of these individual elements were popular, it was almost impossible for any reader to embrace the saga as a whole. Marvel eventually parodied the saga in Spider-Man: 101 Ways to End the Clone Saga (January 1997), and again with a gag cover for \\"Sheep-Man\\" in an issue of What If... Other versions =MC2= The alternate future universe of MC2 Spider-Girl (May \\"Mayday\\" Parker) follows up on some events from this storyline. The series establishes that six months after Spider-Man: Revelations, Mongraine was tracked down by Peter's first clone Kaine, who rescued baby Mayday from her grip and returned her to her parents Peter Parker and Mary-Jane. Subsequently she grows up to become Spider-Girl. The events of \\"The Final Chapter\\" (or more accurately, \\"The Gathering of Five\\") take place two years later. In the final battle at the conclusion of the MC2 version of the storyline Norman Osborn dies and Peter loses one of his legs. Mayday generally wears a costume based on Ben Reilly's Spider-Man design. Elizabeth Tyne/Janine Godbe from The Lost Years had Ben's son, Reilly Tyne (Darkdevil). Felicity Hardy fights crime as The Scarlet Spider. Kaine is also a recurring character. Spider-Girl #44‚Äì50 and 52 focus on loose ends of the Clone Saga, such as Alison Mongrain planning to kill Normie Osborn, believing he could pose a threat to the child who was placed in her care. May reveals herself to Alison, in order to save Normie. Alison is last seen in Spider-Girl #52. #44 saw Peter telling May about her Uncle Ben, but not that he was a clone. Overall, the issue recaps the Clone Saga storyline. There was to have been a panel with Ben Reilly in his Scarlet Spider outfit, but it was left out,Tom D. - Re: #44 Questions For Tom D hence the cover mentions him as The Scarlet Spider. A new Clone Saga began in the pages of Amazing Spider-Girl. Normie Osborn, inheriting a few of his grandfather's laboratories, stumbles across a fluid tank containing an exact physical duplicate of Mayday Parker, with several journal entries left behind by Norman Osborn indicating that she is the real Mayday. This May is eventually revealed to have symbiotic powers. Eventually, both Mays come to an understanding and, with the aid of Peter and the spirit of his late Aunt May, defeat Norman Osborn in a psychic duel when all three Parkers are merged briefly into one body controlled by Norman's active consciousness. The story continued in The Spectacular Spider-Girl, a feature being published both online and in the pages of the new Web of Spider- Man. In it, the new May changes her name to April and becomes Mayday's rival and occasional partner. Eventually, April is defeated by the Fury The Goblin Queen and told that she is the clone. April is eventually freed and together, she and Mayday defeat Fury. April afterwards begins to get involved with the gang warfare erupting in New York and eventually cuts herself off from The Parker Family. The saga ends with a future incarnation of April who, having experienced a drastically darker future which is created from Mayday's death, travels back in time and urges her past self to save Mayday's life. April agrees, and seemingly sacrifices her own life to save Mayday as she is caught in a ferocious explosion. Mayday mourns April's passing, though Peter is not convinced of her death and assures May that clones have a habit of turning up again. =Spider-Man: Life Story= Spider-Man: Life Story features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age after Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man in 1962. Miles Warren was ordered by Norman Osborn to create clones of Norman and Peter. In 1977, Norman convinced Harry to attack Miles after discovering that he had secretly created a clone of Gwen as well. Harry deduces that Norman had Miles clone Peter because Norman still viewed Peter as a more worthy successor over him. After Peter calms him down, Harry blows up the containment tubes with the clones. Peter's clone was the only survivor thanks to inheriting Spider-Man's powers. However, Miles reveals that the \\"Gwen\\" Peter was with was actually her clone while the real Gwen died in the explosion. A year later, Peter and Gwen's clones rename themselves as Ben and Helen Parker (later Reilly) and move out of New York for a second chance at life. Ben eventually becomes a photojournalist in Chicago, where he also operates as the hero known as \\"The Red Mask\\". In 1995, he and Peter are kidnapped by Doctor Octopus and taken to Oscorp so Otto could learn how to extend his life by cloning. In the process, Otto discovers that Peter is supposedly the clone while Ben was the original. Ben lashes out at Otto for the revelation before Otto attempts to kill them both and ends up murdering Harry instead. As Ben begins to have an identity crisis, Peter gives him a folder detailing his own life from the last 20 years and allows Ben the opportunity to retake his life as \\"Peter Parker\\" once more. It's later revealed Peter found out that the elderly Norman manipulated Otto into kidnapping them and rigged the results to get back at Peter for putting him in prison, meaning that Ben is still the clone. However, Peter allowed Ben to take over his life so he could live quietly with Mary Jane and his children. =Ultimate Marvel= The cover for Ultimate Spider-Man #103. Art by Mark Bagley. The Clone Saga was adapted for Marvel's Ultimate imprint. It began in Ultimate Spider-Man #97 (July 2006) and concluded in #104, with a small epilogue in #105. In the Ultimate Spider-Man continuity, the character Miles Warren was first introduced as Harry Osborn's psychiatrist who was hired by Norman Osborn to brainwash out any memories of his Goblin persona. Ben Reilly was established as an African-American lab assistant with no personal ties to Peter, although in the \\"Carnage\\" story-arc, Reilly refers to the Carnage creature as \\"Little Ben\\". The creature itself being created from a combination of Peter Parker and Curt Conner's DNA with traces of the Venom suit's genetic material as well. In this version, Bendis wrote a story in which the Scorpion is captured and revealed to be Peter's clone, sharing 94.2% of Peter Parker's DNA (issues 97, 98). MJ is then abducted, and searching for her, Peter runs into Spider-Woman, and in the following issues, further Spider-Man clones appear, among them one with a disfigured face (Kaine) and a black-suited clone with six arms (Tarantula). Bendis also made Peter reveal his secret identity to Aunt May and the Fantastic Four, and let an amnesiac Gwen Stacy and Peter's presumed dead father Richard Parker re-appear (though the former of the two actually escaped). Via a longer dialogue through Peter and Spider-Woman, Bendis also established that every clone has inherited Peter's love for MJ, and his worries of her getting hurt; as a result, they each tried a different approach, the Scorpion trying to make sense of his jumbled memories, Spider- Woman trying to stop the other clones, Kaine using his advanced mind to incorporate the drug OZ into MJ's body, and the Tarantula trying to defend MJ from Kaine. Upon waking to find that she has been injected with OZ, MJ is enraged, and her anger triggers a transformation into a large, red monster called the Demogoblin. As of issue 103, the masterminds behind the clones seem to be Doctor Octopus and Ben Reilly (who stole a sample of Spider-Man's blood shortly after the death of Gwen Stacy). A fight between the clones and Dr. Octopus leaves the Tarantula and Kaine apparently dead, and Doctor Octopus captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. As a twist, Bendis established that Doctor Octopus and Reilly acted with consent of the CIA. In addition, Gwen is revealed to be Carnage, and Richard revealed to be yet another clone (issues 99-103), aged artificially and given psychic treatment to create his false memories. As of the end of the Ultimate Clone Saga, the clone posing as Richard died from his rapid aging, Jessica Drew fled after helping Peter defeat Octavius, and Dr. Franklin Storm and Reed Richards found a cure for Mary Jane's OZ-related affliction; Peter's relief at her safe condition made him realize his true feelings for her and resumed their relationship. Reed Richards suggested that they might even remove Peter's powers after some more research, since they are also partially caused by the OZ serum. However, after a talk with Nick Fury, Peter rejects the cure and got back together with MJ. The Spider-Woman clone left to embrace the \\"Jessica Drew\\" identity and the other remaining clones‚Äîthe Scorpion and Gwen Stacy‚Äîwere left in the custody of Nick Fury, who advised his Scientists to 'get to work' on them. In re-imagining the story for the Ultimate Universe, Brian Bendis inserted many references to the original Clone Saga. Among them are that the brief appearances of the characters Miles Warren and Ben Reilly; Peter re-examining his relationship with MJ; an amnesiac Gwen Stacy appearing from nowhere, then turning out to be more than she seems; Aunt May experiencing a heart attack; a \\"Scarlet Spider\\" (Spider-Woman) evading Peter and later being used as a plot dump; a half-formed, semi-insane clone appearing several times, specifically wanting to protect MJ; a 'mystery woman' called 'Jessica'; an old friend and colleague of Norman Osborn appearing to have been manipulating the scenes from behind (Dr. Mendel Stromm in normal Marvel continuity, Otto Octavius in Ultimate Marvel continuity), later revealing unseen powers over metal. In other media The Six Spider-Men that join to defeat Spider-Carnage in Spider Wars. * In Spider-Man: The Animated Series, the \\"Clone Saga\\" appears in two forms during the fifth and final season. ** In the first version, depicted in the two-part episode \\"The Return of Hydro-Man\\", Miles Warren is shown to have created two water-based clones of Hydro-Man and Mary Jane Watson; the former died in a previous battle with Spider-Man, while the latter was believed to have died after being thrown into an interdimensional portal by the Green Goblin. The Mary Jane clone escaped from Warren's lab, and reunited with Spider-Man early in the fourth season, who believed that the real Mary Jane had returned. Eventually, the Hydro-Man clone tracks her down and takes her to Warren's underwater lab, but Spider-Man follows him, and learns that both Hydro-Man and Mary Jane are clones. With Mary Jane's help, who developed some water-based powers of her own, Spider-Man defeats Hydro-Man, but both clones then evaporate. Following the battle, Warren retrieves a piece of Spider-Man's costume that was torn apart, and collects a DNA sample, with the intent of cloning him as well. ** The second version, which is an adaptation of the second \\"Clone Saga\\", is depicted in the two-part series finale, \\"Spider Wars\\". After testing Spider-Man's leadership skills by having him lead a team of heroes against a team of villains on an alien planet (which served as an adaptation of the \\"Secret Wars\\" storyline), Madame Web and the Beyonder bring him to an alternate reality where Miles Warren has successfully cloned Peter Parker. After both the real Peter and the clone escaped, the former, believing himself to be the clone, became Ben Reilly aka Scarlet Spider, while the clone became Spider-Man. Upon discovering the truth, however, the clone was driven mad by jealousy, and was approached by the Carnage symbiote, who merged with him and transformed him into Spider- Carnage. After destroying New York with the help of several villains, whom he recruited as his enforcers, Spider-Carnage plotted to destroy the multiverse from his native universe using a matter-disintegrator bomb powered by the Time-Dilation Accelerator, and nearly succeeded, but Madame Web and the Beyonder were able to rewind time enough for the \\"prime\\" Spider-Man to assemble an army of five Spider-Men from different universes, including Sacrlet Spider, to foil Spider-Carnage. He then tries to destroy the realities one at a time, and arrives in the armored Spider-Man's native universe, where Uncle Ben is still alive. After the \\"prime\\" Spider-Man brings him to confront Spider-Carnage, Ben reminds him about responsibility, allowing Peter to break free of the Carange symbiote's control and sacrifice himself to destroy it for good, by throwing both himself and Carnage into an interdimensional portal. * Elements of the \\"Clone Saga\\" are incorporated in Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister Six. This version bears more resemblance to the Ultimate Marvel version, as Doctor Octopus is the one who created the clones, with help from HYDRA. The three-part episode \\"The Spider-Slayers\\" introduces the \\"Spider- Slayers,\\" which are Arnim Zola's Synthezoids mixed with Spider-Man's DNA. There are five known Synthezoids: Kaine, Scarlet Spider, Bone Spider, Goliath Spider, and Ghost Spider. Kaine is an imperfect Synthezoid that resembles Spider-Man, who is highly resistant to damage and can reattach lost limbs and feed off the life energy of Spider-Man or other Spider-Slayers. Scarlet Spider (later named Ben Reilly by May Parker) is an almost perfect clone of Spider- Man in terms of physical appearance and powers, except he dons a different costume (reminiscent of Kaine Parker's Scarlet Spider costume) and has a scar on his face. Bone Spider dons a mostly blue costume, with a yellow spider symbol, and has claws and spikes all over his body. Goliath Spider is the largest and strongest of all the Spider-Slayers, and can turn his body into metal. Ghost Spider dons a mostly white costume, with a black spider symbol, and can teleport, become intangible and perform bio-electrokinesis moves. Scarlet Spider is introduced early on in the fourth season, and becomes an ally of Spider-Man, before being revealed to be a spy for Doctor Octopus, though he eventually redeems himself. In \\"The Spider-Slayers\\" [Pt.1], Spider- Man encounters Kaine, and he, Spider-Woman, and Scarlet Spider follow him to one of Doc Ock's labs, where they defeat Kaine and numerous Synthezoid versions of Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider. In \\"The Spider-Slayers\\" [Pt. 2], Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider take Doctor Octopus to HYDRA Island to learn more about the latter's origins, where they encounter Bone Spider, Goliath Spider, and Ghost Spider, referred to as the \\"Delta-Nine Synthezoids.\\" Doc Ock then reveals Scarlet Spider to be the most advanced of the Synthezoids, and that he was supposed to be the Delta-Nine Synthezoids' leader. As Doctor Octopus makes his escape, Arnim Zola reawakens and commands the Delta-Nine Synthezoids to attack Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider, but they eventually defeat them and free them from Zola's control with the help of the recently- arrived Web Warriors. The Delta-Nine Synthezoids are then placed in statis pods and taken to the Triskelion. In \\"The Spider-Slayers\\" [Pt. 3]. Kaine returns in a mutated, misshapen form with spiked tentacles out of his sides, and infiltrates the Triskellion. When the Web-Warriors are unable to defeat Kaine, Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider release the Delta-Nine Synthezoids to help, but Kaine absorbs them and becomes the \\"Ultimate Spider-Slayer.\\" He is finally defeated after Agent Venom uses an energy transmitter to overload Kaine, causing him to explode.

Toponymy Literally translated as 'little gulf'.  Geography  Golfito has an area of km¬≤ and an elevation of metres. From the northern section, which was the old United Fruit Company headquarters, trails go up to the Golfito Mixed Wildlife Refuge on the hill, which is part of the National System of Conservation Areas. Tall, high, evergreen rain forests surround the coastal lowlands around the town. The region receives an average of of rainfall annually. Golfito Bay (a tautonym because it means 'little bay bay') is within the larger Golfo Dulce, and separated from the open Pacific Ocean by the Osa Peninsula. Ferry boats cross the Golfo Dulce from Golfito to Puerto Jimenez, which is an access point to the Osa Peninsula and Corcovado National Park. The town lies on a narrow strip of land between the eponymous bay and a hill and consists of two parts, the town proper and shopping area to the south, and a residential area near the port.  Demographics  For the 2011 census, Golfito had a population of inhabitants.  Transportation  = Road transportation = The district is covered by the following road routes: *25px National Route 14 *25px National Route 238 =Airport= * Golfito Airport airstrip. Economy In the mid 20th century, Golfito was a major banana growing region (also resulting in it being a major port of southern Costa Rica), but a combination of worker unrest, declining foreign markets, rising export taxes and banana disease led to the closing of the United Fruit Company in 1985. Palm oil plantations have replaced the old banana plantations and, due to their success, more and more land is devoted to growing this palm. A small flow of tourists began to arrive in the mid-1990s, and by mid-2006 sport fishing had become the most important tourist attraction. A duty free shopping centre () has attracted shoppers from other regions of the country, helping the local hospitality business. The beaches in the region are beautiful. Calm water provides for tourist activities, even during the tide fluctuation, which averages about . =Fishing and boating= The town offers small marinas, yachting and boating services, sport fishing, and a destination for cruise ships. Much of the tourism in the Golfito area focuses on the sport fishing industry. Many of the lodges and hotels have their own sport fishing boats and captains. Yachting, boating, water sports and beach activities are also possible. The beaches south of Golfito ‚Äî Playa Zancudo, Pilon and Pavones ‚Äî offer excellent surfing. The controversial approval of permits for construction of a new big marina in Golfito was an unsuccessful process that lasted over nine years. Environmentalists and local residents opposed the project. Among the issues were the lack of a scientific study to determine the environmental impact of anti-fouling paint, sewage and oil spillage, and the lack of space to install a water treatment plant. The Regulatory Office for Marinas in Costa Rica (CIMAT) ordered the Golfito Municipality, in early 2010, to withdraw all permits for this marina project. Golfito Tours Sunset over Golfito Bay There's a lot of things you can do in Golfito such as Dolphin and whale watching boat tours, horseback riding, hiking tours to the Golfito Wildlife Refuge or the Piedras Blancas National Park and it's also a famous spot for bird watching tours and sportfishing. Education The town of Golfito has 5 primary schools (1st‚Äì6th year), one secondary school (7th‚Äì12th year) that also offers a separate night schooling. The University of Costa Rica has a branch campus in Golfito where students mostly from the \\"Zona Sur\\" region attend. As a public university, UCR-Golfito offers scholarships and housing to about 90% of its students. UCR-Golfito has student housing facilities (called Bachers), a library, laboratories, and a student union called Club Centro, where art and recreational activities take place.

Underneath is a heat source, formerly a charcoal brazier but now electric, often built into the table itself. Kotatsu are used almost exclusively in Japan, although similar devices are used elsewhere: for example the Spanish brasero or Iranian korsi. History The history of the kotatsu begins in the Muromachi period or Ashikaga shogunate during the fourteenth century. Its origins begin with the Japanese cooking hearth, known as the irori. Charcoal was the primary method of cooking and heating in the traditional Japanese household and was used to heat the irori. By the fourteenth century in Japan, a seating platform was introduced to the irori and its cooking function became separated from its seating function. On top of the wooden platform a quilt was placed, known as an oki that trapped and localized the heat of the charcoal burner. This early ancestor to the modern kotatsu was called a hori-gotatsu. The word hori- gotatsu () is derived from the kanji (hori) meaning ditch, digging, (ko) meaning torch or fire, and (tatsu) meaning foot warmer. The formation of the hori-gotatsu was slightly changed in the Edo period during the seventeenth century. These changes consisted of the floor around the irori being dug-out into the ground in a square shape. The wooden platform was placed around this, making a hearth. Then the blanket was placed on top of the platform again, where one could sit with legs underneath to stay warm. The moveable kotatsu was created later, originating from the concept of hori-gotatsu. This kotatsu came about with the popular use of tatami matting in Japanese homes. Instead of placing the charcoals in the irori, they were placed in an earthen pot which was placed on the tatami making the kotatsu transportable. This more modern style kotatsu is known as the oki-gotatsu. The word oki-gotatsu () is derived from the kanji (oki) meaning placement, meaning torch or fire, and meaning foot warmer. In the middle of the twentieth-century charcoal was replaced with electricity as a heating source. Instead of having the moveable earthen pot of charcoals beneath the kotatsu, it was possible to attach an electric heating fixture directly to the frame of the kotatsu.In 1997 maximum number (approximately two-thirds) of Japanese homes had the modern irori and 81 percent had a kotatsu, but today they warmed by using electricity, not glowing coals or charcoal. Thus, the kotatsu became completely mobile with electricity and became a common feature of Japanese homes during winter. Types There are two kinds of kotatsu used in Japan today, differing in the configuration and the type of heating: *Electric: The modern style of kotatsu, , consists of a table with an electric heater attached to the underside of the table. This evolved from a clay pot with hot coals placed under a table. The kotatsu usually is set on a thin futon, like a throw rug. A second, thicker blanket is placed over the kotatsu table, above which the tabletop is placed. The electric heater attached to the underside of the table heats the space under the comforter. *Charcoal: The more traditional type is a table placed over a recessed floor, . The pit is cut into the floor and is about 40 centimeters deep. A charcoal heater is placed somewhere in the pit's floor, walls, or, as in the modern-style kotatsu, attached to the table-frame. There are pit-type kotatsu with an electric heater too. Use In the twenty-first century, the kotatsu typically consists of the electric heater attached to the frame, which is no longer limited to wood, but may be made of plastic or other materials. Generally, a blanket (or shitagake) is draped over the frame and heater and under the table-top. This first blanket is covered by a second heavier blanket, known as a kotatsu-gake (). Kotatsu-gake often are decorative and may be designed to match home d√©cor. A person sits on the floor or on zabuton cushions with their legs under the table and the blanket draped over the lower body. The kotatsu was designed when people most commonly wore traditional Japanese style clothes, where the heat would enter through the bottom of the robes and rise to exit around the neck, thus heating the entire body. Most Japanese housing is not insulated to the same degree as a Western domicile and does not have central heating, thus relying primarily on space heating. Heating is expensive because of the lack of insulation and the draftiness of housing. A kotatsu is a relatively inexpensive way to stay warm in the winter, as the futons trap the warm air. Families may choose to concentrate their activity in this one area of the house in order to save on energy costs.http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jhes/7/1/7_35/_article In the summer, the blanket may be removed, and the kotatsu used as a normal table. It is possible to sleep under a kotatsu, although unless one is quite short, one's body will not be completely covered. This generally is considered acceptable for naps, but not for overnight sleeping for many reasons: one's body is not completely covered, yielding uneven heating; the table is low, so one may touch heating elements accidentally when moving while asleep, risking burns. Traditionally, children are told that they will catch a cold if they sleep under a kotatsu. Pets such as cats frequently sleep under kotatsu, however, and are small enough to fit completely underneath‚Äîcomparable to cats who sleep on floor heating vents in Western countries (Japanese homes do not generally have floor heating vents). During the winter months in Japan, the kotatsu often is the center of domestic life. In the evening family members gather around the kotatsu to enjoy food, television, games, and conversation while keeping the lower half of their bodies warm. It has been said that \\"once under the kotatsu, all of your worries slip away as a familiar warmth takes over and you become completely relaxed.\\" Other countries There are similar systems in countries around the world: economical and often sociable ways to keep warm while sitting still. In Spain and Portugal, the ' is a small round table with a brasero heater (i.e. a brazier) placed underneath. The Netherlands used to use a foot stove. In the First World War, British Royal Engineers built 'Japanese footwarmers' in the trenches.War Diary of 17 Field Company Royal Engineers, 16 November 1914. For centuries, a very similar item called a sandali has been used widely in Tajikistan and Afghanistan. They are used even today in many traditional houses, as a warm family eating place. A similar product called a korsi is used in Iran. In China and Korea, underfloor heating traditionally is used. The devices used in a similar fashion are, respectively, a Kang bed-stove and an ondol.

Until the French Revolution, Riom was the capital of the province of Auvergne, and the seat of the dukes of Auvergne. The city was of Gaulish origin, the Roman Ricomagus. In the intensely feudalized Auvergne of the 10th century, the town grew up around the collegiate Church of Saint Amabilis (Saint Amable), the local saint, who was the object of pilgrimages. Riom was the capital of the dukes of Auvergne. In the 14th century the city benefitted from the patronage of Jean, duc de Berry, who rebuilt the Ducal Palace and the Saint-Chapelle. In 1531, Riom and Auvergne reverted to the Crown of France. In 1942, Riom was the site of the Vichy government's abortive war-guilt trials, called Riom Trials.

The screenplay was written by Steven Pressfield, Ronald Shusett (who also produced) and Dan Gilroy, loosely adapted from the 1959 science fiction novel Immortality, Inc. by Robert Sheckley. The film was produced by Morgan Creek, and released by Warner Bros. in the United States on January 17, 1992. It received mostly negative reviews. Plot In 2009, the super-wealthy achieve immortality by hiring \\"bonejackers\\", mercenaries equipped with time travel devices, to snatch people from the past, just prior to the moment of their deaths, for use as substitute bodies. Those who escape are known as \\"freejacks\\" and are considered less than human under the law. In this dystopian future, most people suffer from poor physical health as a result of rampant drug use and environmental pollution, making them unattractive as replacement bodies. Alex Furlong is a Formula One racer who is about to die in a spectacular 1991 crash when a time machine snatches him from the cockpit and into 21st century New York City, now a futuristic dystopia populated by scavengers and killers. When Furlong's captors are ambushed by a hit squad, Furlong escapes from Victor Vacendak, a hardened mercenary who has snatched him on behalf of the powerful McCandless Corporation. Alex's former fianc√©e Julie Redlund is now an executive at McCandless, handling high-stakes mineral negotiations with a rival Japanese firm. Alex spends much time escaping the clutches of Victor, a ruthless pursuer who nevertheless lives by a code of honor, and rekindling his relationship with Julie. Ian McCandless, Julie's boss, is revealed to have died and seeks to install his backed-up personality into Furlong's body. Besides evading Vacendak's army of mercenaries and McCandless police personnel, Alex and Julie also have to deal with fleeing from the private guards of McCandless's corporate X.O., Mark Michelette, who is gunning for McCandless's position. Alex finds he cannot trust his old friends from 1991, who are now eager to sell him out. After an encounter wherein Furlong spares Vacendak's life, Julie rescues Furlong in one of Vacendak's vehicles. Tired of running, Furlong pretends to take Julie hostage and negotiates with Michelette to arrange a meeting, counting on Michelette's not knowing about their past relationship; however, Michelette has seen the footage of Julie's grief after Alex's 1991 accident. After she slaps Michelette in return for his mockery, the couple flees. They are thwarted when they encounter a gunfight in the lobby between two factions, now in opposition: McCandless's security guards and Vacendak's mercenaries. Julie plans to leave the building through an \\"escape module\\" on the hundredth floor, but the elevator takes them automatically to the complex at the very top of the building known as the \\"Spiritual Switchboard\\" where McCandless's mind is in storage. In a virtual reality encounter with McCandless's essence, he explains his goal: to use Alex's body to satiate his love for Julie. Apologizing, he offers to die and let Alex run the company under the guise of being McCandless. As they consider the offer, Vacendak arrives, and McCandless reveals he was merely stalling for time. Alex fights the process as Michelette stumbles in, wounded from fighting Vacendak's soldiers. In the confusion, Julie grabs the gun of the soldier holding her and fires off a shot that disrupts the transfer process. The results are inconclusive as to whether or not it is McCandless or Furlong in Alex's body now. The scientists cannot determine the answer, but Vacendak can, as only Vacendak knows a secret code McCandless gave him. Alex reads the code, slowly, and Vacendak asks him to continue. Alex finishes the code quickly. Michelette tries to kill Alex but is gunned down by Vacendak's men. Alex remarks about how he feels in his \\"new\\" body, before telling Julie that she will be dressed more appropriately so that the two of them can take a drive. Hours later, after the coup is over, Julie and Alex get into one of McCandless's favorite vehicles; Alex tells the driver that he will do the driving today. Vacendak stops them as the car leaves the estate. It turns out that the transfer was not complete after all; Furlong got McCandless's secret number wrong, though Vacendak went along with it. He simply waited until Furlong made a mistake: McCandless did not know how to drive. Vacendak admonishes Julie that \\"you'll have to coach him better than that\\", then leaves while Furlong and Julie speed away.

Shooting took place in Atlanta, Georgia. According to reports at the time of the production and interviews with some members of the cast and crew, the original version of the movie had a disastrous test screening, so producer Ronald Shusett was brought in to re- shoot around 40% of the movie and add more character scenes and humor. Emilio Estevez also mentioned how director Geoff Murphy let them down by focusing too much on action in his original cut of the film. Geoff Murphy claims that there was interference from production company Morgan Creek and that he asked for his possessory credit to be removed. Reception The film received negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 18% based on reviews from 17 critics, with an average rating of 4/10.

Early life and education  Cesare Pavese was born in Santo Stefano Belbo, in the province of Cuneo. It was the village where his father was born and where the family returned for the summer holidays each year. He started infant classes in Santo Stefano Belbo, but the rest of his education was in schools in Turin. He attended Liceo Classico Massimo d'Azeglio in Turin for his sixth form/senior high school studies.Ward, David. \\"Primo Levi's Turin.\\" In: Gordon, Robert S.C. (editor). The Cambridge Companion to Primo Levi (Cambridge Companions to Literature). Cambridge University Press, 30 July 2007. , 9781139827409. CITED: p. 11. His most important teacher at the time was Augusto Monti, writer and educator, whose writing style attempted to be devoid of all rhetoric. As a young man of letters, Pavese had a particular interest in English-language literature, graduating from the University of Turin with a thesis on the poetry of Walt Whitman. Among his mentors at the university was Leone Ginzburg, expert on Russian literature and literary critic, husband of the writer Natalia Ginzburg and father of the future historian Carlo Ginzburg. In those years, Pavese translated both classic and recent American and British authors that were then new to the Italian public.  Arrest and conviction; the war in Italy  Pavese moved in antifascist circles. In 1935 he was arrested and convicted for having letters from a political prisoner. After a few months in prison he was sent into \\"confino\\", internal exile in Southern Italy, the commonly used sentence for those guilty of lesser political crimes. (Carlo Levi and Leone Ginzburg, also from Turin, were similarly sent into confino.) A year later Pavese returned to Turin, where he worked for the left- wing publisher Giulio Einaudi as editor and translator. Natalia Ginzburg also worked there. Pavese was living in Rome when he was called up into the fascist army, but because of his asthma he spent six months in a military hospital. When he returned to Turin, German troops occupied the streets and most of his friends had left to fight as partisans. Pavese fled to the hills around Serralunga di Crea, near Casale Monferrato. He took no part in the armed struggle taking place in that area. During the years in Turin, he was the mentor of the young writer and translator Fernanda Pivano, his former student at the Liceo D'Azeglio. Pavese gave her the American edition of Spoon River Anthology, which came out in Pivano's Italian translation in 1943.  After the war  After World War II Pavese joined the Italian Communist Party and worked on the party's newspaper, L'Unit√†. The bulk of his work was published during this time. Toward the end of his life, he would frequently visit Le Langhe, the area where he was born, where he found great solace. Depression, the failure of a brief love affair with the actress Constance Dowling, to whom his last novel and one of his last poems (\\"Death will come and she'll have your eyes\\") were dedicated, and political disillusionment led him to his suicide by an overdose of barbiturates in 1950. That year he had won the Strega Prize for La Bella Estate, comprising three novellas: 'La tenda', written in 1940, 'Il diavolo sulle colline' (1948) and 'Tra donne sole' (1949). Leslie Fiedler wrote of Pavese's death \\"...for the Italians, his death has come to have a weight like that of Hart Crane for us, a meaning that penetrates back into his own work and functions as a symbol in the literature of an age.\\"Twentieth Century Authors: A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Literature: First Supplement, edited by Stanley J. Kunitz, New York: The H. W. Wilson Company, 1955. The circumstances of his suicide, which took place in a hotel room, mimic the last scene of Tra Donne Sole (Among Women Only), his penultimate book. His last book was 'La Luna e i Fal√≤', published in Italy in 1950 and translated into English as The Moon and the Bonfires by Louise Sinclair in 1952. He was an atheist.Paloni, Piermassimo, Il giornalismo di Cesare Pavese, Landoni, 1977, p. 11.  Themes in Pavese's works  The typical protagonist in the works of Pavese is a loner, through choice or through circumstances. His relationships with men and women tend to be temporary and superficial. He may wish to have more solidarity with other people, but he often ends up betraying his ideals and friends; for example in The Prison, the political exile in a village in Southern Italy receives a note from another political confinato living nearby, who suggests a meeting. The protagonist rejects a show of solidarity and refuses to meet him. The title of the collection of the two novellas is Before the Cock Crows, a reference to Peter's betrayal of Christ before his death. The Langhe, the area where he spent his summer holidays as a boy, had a great hold on Pavese. It is a land of rolling hills covered in vineyards. It is an area where he felt literally at home, but he recognised the harsh and brutal lives that poor peasants had making a living from the land. Bitter struggles took place between Germans and partisans in this area. The land became part of Pavese's personal mythology. In The Moon and the Bonfires, the protagonist tells a story of drinking beer in a bar in America. A man comes in whom he recognizes as being from the valleys of Le Langhe by his way of walking and his outlook. He speaks to him in dialect suggesting a bottle of their local wine would be better than the beer. After some years in America, the protagonist returns to his home village. He explores Le Langhe with a friend who had remained in the area. He finds out that so many of his contemporaries have died in sad circumstances, some as partisans shot by the Germans, while a notable local beauty had been executed by partisans as a fascist spy.

Chyavanprash (also spelled chyavanaprasha, chyavanaprash, chyavanaprasam, chamanprash and chyawanaprash) is a cooked mixture of sugar, honey, ghee, Indian gooseberry (amla) jam, sesame oil, berries and various herbs and spices. It is prepared as per the instructions suggested in Ayurvedic texts. Chyavanprash is widely sold and consumed in India as a dietary supplement. Origin Chyavanprash is an ancient formulation and product. Various ancient Indian texts like Mahabharata, Puranas etc., relate that Ashwini Kumar brothers, the twins, who were Raja Vaidya (Royal Physicians) to Devas during Vedic times, first prepared this formulation for Chyavana Rishi at his Ashram on Dhosi Hill near Narnaul, Haryana, India, hence the name Chyavanprash.Panda, H; Handbook On Ayurvedic Medicines With Formulae, Processes And Their Uses, 2004, p10 The first historically documented formula for chyavanprash appears in the Charaka Samhita, the ancient Ayurvedic treatise Bates, D, Knowledge and the Scholarly Medical Traditions Cambridge University Press 1995, p325 from the early first millennium BCE. Taste and appearance Chyavanaprash tastes sweet and sour at the same time. The taste is dominated by the flavors of honey, ghee (clarified butter) and amla, and the smell by ghee and other spices including sandalwood, cinnamon and cardamom. Consumption Chyavanaprash is usually consumed directly. It can also be consumed along with warm water. Composition The recipe of chyavanprash is mentioned in manuscripts written for ayurvedic method of treatment viz. Ashtangahridayam, Charakasamhita, Sangandharasamhita. Amla is a primary ingredient of Chyavanaprash which makes it rich in Vitamin C (445 mg/100g). The number of herbs used may vary from 25 to 80 but the main ingredient of all Chyavanprash is amla.

The character is a pantomime dame, portrayed by a man; and is a comic foil to the principal boy, Aladdin‚Äîplayed by an actress. History The story of Aladdin is drawn from the Arabian Nights, a collection of Middle-Eastern fables. It was first published in England between 1704 and 1714; and this story was dramatised in 1788 by John O'Keefe for Covent Garden as a harlequinade and included the character of 'Aladdin's Mother' (but unnamed) played by Mrs Davett. She was the widow of a tailor (as in the original story) and this was the profession in many later versions. In 1813, she had the same profession but was the Widow Ching Mustapha, and again in 1836, played by Eva Marie Veigel (Mrs Garrick), but the character was not yet comic nor played by a man. In 1844 a burlesque version of the story described Widow Mustapha as 'a washerwoman with mangled feelings'. However in productions of the same year and most others up to 1891 she is involved with tailoring, with rare excursions to a newspaper shop and fishmonger. The laundry was already established as a place for a clown performance on the stage and began to be worked in, notably with Dan Leno as Twankay along with Aladdin's brother Washee-Washee in 1896. The name Twankay appears first in 1861 in a play by Henry James Byron called Aladdin or the Wonderful Scamp, (a parodic name of an earlier opera) which established much of the content and style of the modern pantomime. It was performed by James Rogers who had previously played the female role Clorinda in a version of Cinderella. It was named after a cheap brand of China tea. \\"The origin of popular pantomime stories\\", Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed 22 October 2011 Twankay, or 'twankey' is an inferior grade of green tea, with an old, ragged, open leaf ‚Äì the implication is that the widow is 'past her best' ‚Äî with the name Twankay deriving from Tunxi in Anhui, from where the tea in China originates.The Chambers Dictionary (8th edn, 1998) Chambers Harrap Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh Occasionally, the spelling of her name in the programme (but not the pronunciation on the stage) is varied to make it look more like a \\"Chinese\\" personal name ‚Äì e.g., \\"Tuang Kee Chung\\" in a 1979 musical version.

Construction began in November 2013 and is expected to be finished sometime in 2021. \\"The number's going to be $1.5 billion to do the entire program to make the fix,\\" said Paul Rush, Deputy Commissioner of the NYCDEP. \\"About two-thirds of it, $1 billion, will actually go into constructing a bypass tunnel around the location with the most significant leakage in Roseton, and to do additional concrete grouting in the Wawarsing section.\\" The new bypass tunnel will be one of the most complicated undertakings in the NYCDEP's history. Near the end of construction, the entire Delaware Aqueduct will be shut down to allow the bypass to be connected. It will be dewatered so that the leaks in Wawarsing, and Newburgh, can be fixed. Shutting the aqueduct will deprive New York City of nearly half its water supply. To compensate, the NYCDEP is making improvements to other parts of the system. Construction on the portion of the bypass tunnel that crosses under the Hudson River from Newburgh to Wappinger began on January 8, 2018 in Newburgh. The tunnel boring machine, named NORA after Nora Stanton Blatch Deforest Barney, reached Wappinger on August 13, 2019, after drilling through of 12,448 feet of bedrock located 700 to 800 feet below ground level.

Local groups are the main network participants, and there are now over thirty groups in the UK plus others in the United States, France, Spain, various parts of Africa and whole other networks affiliated to SPEAK in Brazil, the Netherlands and Sweden. In the local group context SPEAK aims to combine faith and action. SPEAK seeks to share their faith in God, as well as campaign for change in where they believe that currently there is injustice, such as world trade and third world debt. SPEAK wants to be a movement that follows Jesus, as he is revealed in the Bible, in a radical way in personal discipleship, as well as striving for social transformation. As a Christian group, SPEAK aims to base its action on the Bible. Biblical passages such as Proverbs chapter 31 verses 8-9, and Micah chapter 6 verse 8 help to define the purpose of the SPEAK network.

As the seat of the Municipality of Puntarenas canton, it is awarded the title of city, which is made from the Puntarenas, Chacarita and El Roble districts. And as the city of the first canton of the province, it is the capital city of the Puntarenas Province as well, according to the Administrative divisions of Costa Rica. Toponymy The Puntarenas name comes from the portmanteau of Punta and Arenas, which means Point and Sands, respectively. Therefore, in English the name would mean \\"Sand Point\\". The name is first referenced by the arrival in February 1720 of the pirate Chipperton to the area, which recorded in his journals to have arrived to a \\"Punta de Arena\\", referring to the needle-like area on which the city stands today.Ciudad Puntarenas, Incop The name is also given to the oddly shaped province of Puntarenas, which as the most extensive province in the country, has its largest section in the South, far from Puntarenas city. Overview There are some 100.000 inhabitants in the town and surrounding neighborhoods. Its Pacific Ocean beaches attract many tourists, especially surfers. It is also a possible stopover point for the tourist destination Monteverde, to the northwest. Its port, Caldera, is one of the main ports and the oldest port in the country. There are regular scheduled ferries to and from Puntarenas and the Nicoya Peninsula.Ferry information  History  Puntarenas was discovered by Gil Gonz√°lez D√°vila in 1522. Despite the use of the Gulf of Nicoya as an entryway to Costa Rica's inland territory, the port of Puntarenas was not developed until 1840 when coffee production in the highlands reached exportable volumes. In 1845 the Congress of the Republic declared Puntarenas a duty-free port (with the exception of Cognac and hard liquor). Originally, the coffee was brought to port in oxcarts via a trail through the mountains. In 1859, a stretch of railway track was completed between Puntarenas and the town of Esparza (one of the country's earliest Spanish settlements, founded in 1574). Eventually, the railway was built all the way through to San Jos√© and service was inaugurated in 1910. With the railway connection to the Central Valley, the Pacific port's activities continued to be a major part of the region's economy throughout the 20th century. However, due to the aging and deterioration of the port facilities and the need to accommodate the much larger vessels of modern shipping fleets, a new port was constructed in the 1980s to the south of Puntarenas. The site chosen was Caldera (located at ), where ships had anchored during colonial times. Caldera was more appropriate site for larger ships, and actually was the first port site used since 1522. Sports The city's major football teams are Second Division sides Puntarenas F.C., who have played many season at the highest level, and Jac√≥ Rays. Cuisine As a major port on the Pacific coast, the gastronomy of Puntarenas is characterized by several seafood dishes, such as ceviche. A very popular dessert is the Churchill, a type of snow cone. Climate Puntarenas is generally hotter than the Costa Rican Central Valley, with daytime highs ranging from in the coldest/hottest months, respectively.Puntarenas temperatures from Climatezone.com References External links Puntarenas Province website * Puntarenas commercial website *www.radiopuntarenas.net La Radio Digital de Puntarenas Populated places in Puntarenas Province ","title":"Puntarenas"},{"id":"1368905","text":"Rash Behari Bose (; Rashbihari Boshu; 25 May 188621 January 1945) was an Indian revolutionary leader against the British Raj. He was born in Village Subaldaha, Purba Bardhaman district of West Bengal. He was one of the key organisers of the Ghadar Mutiny, and later the Indian National Army. Rash Behari Bose handed over Indian National Army to Subhas Chandra Bose. Birth and Ancestry Rash Behari Bose was born on 25th May, 1886 in a Bengali Kayastha family. There is some controversy regarding the place of his birth. The most popular theory is that he was born in his native village named Subaldaha situated in Purba Bardhaman district, West Bengal, India. According to the other theory, he was born at Parala-Bighati (near Bhadreswar), Hooghly district, West Bengal in the house of his maternal grandfather Nabin Chandra Singha. His father's name was Binod Behari Bose. Bhubaneswari Devi was his mother. Tinkori Dasi was Rashbehari Bose's foster mother. The ancestral seat of the Bose family was Boinchi, Hooghly district, West Bengal. From there the family first migrated to Singur in the same district and finally to Subaldaha, Purba Bardhaman district, West Bengal. One of the ancestors of this Bose family, Sri Nidhiram Bose was the first to settle in Subaldaha village.  Early life  The major part of the childhood of Rashbehari Bose and Sushila Sarkar (his sister) was spent in the village Subaldaha. They lived in this village at the house of madam Bidhumukhi and his paternal house. Bidhumukhi was a widow from her early life. Bidhumukhi was the sister in law of Kalicharan Bose. His early education was completed under the supervision of his grandfather, Kalicharan Bose, at village Pathsala (Presently \\"Subaldaha Rashbehari Bose F.P School\\"). Rash Behari Bose got an education of Lathi Khela in his child at Subaldaha. He got the inspiration of revolutionary movement hearing stories from his grandfather at his birthplace Subaldaha. He was the cynosure of all villagers. His nickname was Rasu. He was stubborn and the villagers loved him very much. It is heard from villagers that he was at Subaldaha till he was 12 or 14 years old. His father, Binod Behari Bose, was stationed in Hooghly district for few years. Bose studied at Dupleix College with his friend Shrish Chandra Ghosh. The principal Charu Chandra Roy inspired them into revolutionary politics. Later he joined \\"Morton school\\" in Kolkata. Bose later earned degrees in the medical sciences as well as in Engineering from France and Germany. Revolutionary activities He was interested in revolutionary activities from early on in his life, he left Bengal to shun the Alipore bomb case trials of (1908). At Dehradun he worked as a head clerk at the Forest Research Institute. There, through Amarendra Chatterjee of the Jugantar led by Jatin Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin), he secretly got involved with the revolutionaries of Bengal and he came across eminent revolutionary members of the Arya Samaj in the United Provinces (currently Uttar Pradesh) and the Punjab. Originally Rash Behari Bose stay few years in Hooghly district, West Bengal. 1912 assassination attempt on Lord Hardinge Following the attempt to assassinate Lord Hardinge, Rash Behari was forced to go into hiding. The attempt was made on 23 December 1912 in Delhi when Lord Hardinge was in a ceremonial procession transferring the capital from Calcutta to New Delhi. He was attacked near the Red Fort by Basanta Kumar Biswas a disciple of Amrendar Chatterjee, but missed the target and failed. The bomb was made by Manindra Nath Nayak. Bose was hunted by the colonial police due to his active participation in the failed assassination attempt directed at the Governor General and Viceroy Lord Charles Hardinge in Delhi. He returned to Dehra Dun by the night train and joined the office the next day as though nothing had happened. Further, he organized a meeting of loyal citizens of Dehradun to condemn the dastardly attack on the Viceroy. Lord Hardinge, in his My Indian Years, described the whole incident in an interesting way. During the flood relief work in Bengal in 1913, he came in contact with Jatin Mukherjee in whom he \\"discovered a real leader of men,\\" who \\"added a new impulse\\" to Rash Behari's failing zeal. Thus during World War I he became extensively involved as one of the leading figures of the Gadar Revolution that attempted to trigger a mutiny in India in February 1915. Trusted and tried Ghadrites were sent to several cantonments to infiltrate into the army. The idea of the Gadar leaders was that with the war raging in Europe most of the soldiers had gone out of India and the rest could be easily won over. The revolution failed and most of the revolutionaries were arrested. But Rash Behari managed to escape British intelligence and reached Japan in 1915. Indian National Army Bose fled to Japan in 1915, under the alias of Priyanath Tagore, a relative of Rabindranath Tagore. There, Bose found shelter with various Pan-Asian groups. From 1915‚Äì1918, he changed residences and identities numerous times, as the British kept pressing the Japanese government for his extradition. He married the daughter of Aiz≈ç S≈çma and Kokk≈ç S≈çma, the owners of Nakamuraya bakery in Tokyo and noted Pan-Asian supporters in 1918, and became a Japanese citizen in 1923, living as a journalist and writer. It is also significant that he was instrumental in introducing Indian-style curry in Japan. Though more expensive than the usual \\"British-style\\" curry, it became quite popular, with Rash Bihari becoming known as \\"Bose of Nakamuraya\\". Bose along with A M Nair was instrumental in persuading the Japanese authorities to stand by the Indian patriots and ultimately to officially actively support the Indian independence struggle abroad. Bose convened a conference in Tokyo on 28‚Äì30 March 1942, which decided to establish the Indian Independence League. At the conference, he moved a motion to raise an army for Indian independence. He convened the second conference of the League at Bangkok on 22 June 1942. It was at this conference that a resolution was adopted to invite Subhas Chandra Bose to join the League and take its command as its president. The Indian prisoners of war captured by the Japanese in the Malaya and Burma fronts were encouraged to join the Indian Independence League and become the soldiers of the Indian National Army (INA), formed on 1 September 1942 as the military wing of Rash Behari Bose's Indian National League. He selected the flag for the Azad Hind movement and handed over the flag to Subhas Chandra Bose. But although he handed over the power, his organizational structure remained, and it was on the organizational spadework of Rash Behari Bose. Rash Behari Bose built the Indian National Army (also called 'Azad Hind Fauj'). Prior to his death caused by tuberculosis, the Japanese Government honoured him with the Order of the Rising Sun (2nd grade).  Personal life  Bose met Toshiko Soma when he was hiding at her house in Shinjuku City. She was the daughter of Aiz≈ç S≈çma and Kokk≈ç S≈çma, the owners of Nakamuraya bakery (:ja:‰∏≠ÊùëÂ±ã) in Tokyo and noted Pan- Asian supporters in 1918. At that time, Bose was a fugitive with the British searching for him. Their initial contact was during those intense moments of hiding though without any interactions. In 1916, when Bose was a fugitive no more, he invited the Soma family to his house as a gesture of gratitude. That was the first instance of their interaction in a social context. However, Bose stuck out like a sore thumb in Japan. People would consider them with suspicion. Mitsuru Toyama, as a solution proposed to the Soma's a marriage between Toshiko and Rashbehari. He thought that marriage with a Japanese citizen would make it easy for Bose to apply for citizenship. Despite their initial reservations, the Soma's agreed to the match. When they asked for Toshiko's consent, she took three weeks to decide. They had a happy marriage that lasted for eight years. Bose taught Toshiko Bengali and how to wear a sari. Bose got Japanese citizenship in 1923. Toshiko's health declined soon after and it claimed her life in 1924. After her death, he never remarried. They were buried together after Bose's death. They had two children together. Masahide Bose (Bharatchandra) was born in 1920. He died in World War II aged 24. Their daughter Tetsuko was born in 1922.

(2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 907-908 History The group began as a jangly indie pop band, influenced by Primal Scream's early sound. By the time they recorded their first EP, Barging Into the Presence of God released in 1989, the band went into a direction that displayed a mix of Ian Masters' choirboy-like vocals along with dark atmospheric and noisy pop tunes. Ashley Horner from Edsel Auctioneer briefly joined the band on guitar in the same year. The band was signed to 4AD Records after their first London show, by the label's chief Ivo Watts-Russell. The group's first album, The Comforts of Madness, was released in 1990, and reached the top 40 of the UK Albums Chart. The album's tracks were produced by John Fryer and Gil Norton.Kellman, Andy \\"[ Pale Saints Biography]\\", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation The album includes a cover version of \\"Fell From the Sun\\" by Opal. In late 1990, Meriel Barham, the original vocalist of Lush, joined the band as second guitarist and vocalist. Barham contributed backing vocals and guitars to the Chris Allison produced Half-Life EP, then joined permanently for the Nancy Sinatra cover \\"Kinky Love\\", which gave the band a minor hit single as part of Flesh Balloon EP. In 1992 the band recorded their second full-length album, In Ribbons, which was produced by Hugh Jones. Ian Masters left the band in 1993. Former Heart Throbs bassist Colleen Browne joined afterwards. Sticking with producer Hugh Jones, the group released the EP Fine Friend in mid-1994 followed by their third album Slow Buildings. The group toured Europe and the United States in late autumn of 1994. Their final studio recording was a version of \\"Jersey Girl\\" for the Tom Waits tribute album Step Right Up. Meriel Barham departed in September 1995 and the group eventually disbanded in 1996. In conjunction with the August 2020 Record Store Day release of the Japanese singles compilation Mrs. Dolphin on vinyl for the first time, Masters worked with director and Big Beautiful Bluebottle bandmate Terako Terao to make a video for \\"Sight of You.\\" Post-band projects Masters continues to create music, often of an experimental nature. His first project after Pale Saints was Spoonfed Hybrid with former A.C. Temple member Chris Trout.

It became the replacement in the professional video and broadcast television industries for the then-incumbent 2 inch quadruplex videotape (2 inch Quad for short) open-reel format. Additionally, it replaced the unsuccessful type A format, also invented by Ampex, and, primarily in mainland Europe, it supplemented the type B format, invented by the Fernseh division of Bosch, but it was replaced by type C format also here. Technical detail Compared to Quad, Type C had a smaller size, comparative ease of operation, and slightly higher video quality. 1 inch Type C is capable of \\"trick-play\\" functions such as still, shuttle, and variable-speed playback, including slow motion. 2 inch quadruplex videotape machines lacked these capabilities, due to the segmented manner in which it recorded video tracks onto the magnetic tape. 1 inch Type C VTRs required much less maintenance and used less power and space than did 2 inch machines. 1 inch Type C records composite video at a very high video quality that was superior to contemporary color-under formats such as U-matic, and of comparable quality to analog component video formats like Betacam and MII. Both analog component formats were notoriously fussy and trouble-prone, so in practice Type C gave a stable, more reliable picture than the broadcast quality analog cassette-based videotape formats. Because television was broadcast as a composite signal, there was no real downside to Type C in television broadcasting and distribution. It had approximately 300 (scan or vertical) lines of resolution, and a bandwidth of 5 Mhz, with recording being done with the heads moving across the tape at (a writing speed of) 1,008 inches per second. http://www.labguysworld.com/Museum002.htm#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20late%20production,at%201%2C008%20inches%20per%20second! Type C VTRs can record a single complete frame in a single revolution of the drum, using a single video head, which made the format useful in computer animation. The tape is almost completely wrapped around the drum of the VTR in what is known as an alpha wrap. The format is almost immune to dropouts. https://www.nfsa.gov.au/preservation/preservation-glossary/video-tape PAL Type C VTRs may have higher writing speeds to achieve higher bandwidth given PAL's 8 MHz bandwidth vs NTSC's 6 MHz. Type C VTRs may have flying video erase heads mounted on the drum, allowing for individual frames to be erased.https://www.labguysworld.com/RCA_TH-50A.htm Usage 1 inch tape gained numerous uses in television production including outside broadcasts where it was used for instant replays and creating programme titles. 1 inch machines were considerably smaller and more reliable than preceding two inch versions and were seen by operators as a major technological breakthrough.

The quality and reliability of 1 inch Type C made it a mainstay in television and video production in television studios for almost 20 years, before being supplanted by more reliable digital videocassette formats like DVCAM, D-1, D-2, and DVCPro. 1 inch Type C was also widely used for the mastering of early LaserDisc titles. It was replaced in that role by the digital D-2 videocassette format in the late 1980s.

Founded in Milan, Italy, in 1900 by Cesare Isotta and the brothers Vincenzo, Antonio, and Oreste Fraschini, in 1955 it was merged with engine manufacturer Breda Motori and renamed F.A. Isotta Fraschini e Motori Breda. The company went bankrupt in 1999. In 2000, a new company was founded as a subsidiary of Fincantieri, under the name of Isotta Fraschini Milano based in Bari. History The firm was named for its founders, Cesare Isotta and Vincenzo Fraschini, who had been importing Mors and Renault automobiles as well as Aster proprietary engines since 1899. The company they founded as Societ√† Milanese Automobili Isotta, Fraschini & C. on 27 January 1900 had the stated purpose to \\"Import, sell, repair cars\\". Prior to establishing their own products in 1904, Isotta and Fraschini assembled cars very similar to Renaults, with Aster engines. They differed from the real Renaults in having a neater underslung front radiator arrangement.Nicholson, p. 19 The first automobile bearing this marque featured a four-cylinder engine with an output of . The car, driven by Vincenzo Fraschini, appeared in several races. In 1905, Isotta Fraschini gained notoriety in the Coppa Florio, where they entered a Tipo D with a engine. For a short time in 1907, Isotta Fraschini merged with French automobile company Lorraine-Dietrich. The firm started making race cars using this same engine, establishing the company's reputation and giving its name considerable cachet. It was also one of the first companies to successfully market cars with four- wheel brakes, following their invention by Arrol-Johnston of Scotland in 1909.Georgano, G. N. Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886-1930. (London: Grange- Universal, 1985) They were also among the early pioneers of overhead cam (OHC), with an engine designed by Giustino Cattaneo.Georgano. They were joined by Austro-Daimler's Prinz Heinrich, designed by Ferdinand Porsche, W. O. Bentley (in 1919), and Sunbeam (between 1921 and 1923). Isotta Fraschini introduced their Tipo 8, the first production automobile to be powered by a straight-eight engine, at the Paris Salon in 1919 and began delivering them to customers in 1920. With the growth of the wealthy middle class in North America in the 1920s, Isotta Fraschini marketed deluxe limousines to the new American aristocracy. Early film stars Clara Bow and Rudolph Valentino drove Isotta Fraschinis. A 1929 Tipo 8A Castagna Transformable is featured in the 1950 film Sunset Boulevard and another appears in the 1934 film Death Takes a Holiday with Fredric March. An Isotta Fraschini also makes a featured appearance in the 1946 film Without Reservations with John Wayne and Claudette Colbert. Also, an Isotta Fraschini was gigolo Lindsay Marriott's car in Raymond Chandler's book Farewell, My Lovely (1940) that was made into the motion picture Murder, My Sweet (1944), starring Dick Powell and Claire Trevor. The grille of the Isotta Fraschini with the lightning bolt insignia is seen parked in a ravine, right before Lindsay Marriott gets zapped to death. An oversized Isotta Fraschini is also the vehicle of choice for Dick and Nicole Diver in F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1933 novel Tender is the Night. Seriously affected by the economic crisis of the 1930s and by the disruptions of World War II, Isotta Fraschini stopped making cars after the war (1949). Only five of the last model, the Monterosa, were produced. The plants were converted to produce marine engines. The company was left on the company register and in 1955 it was merged with engine manufacturer Breda Motori and named F.A. Isotta Fraschini e Motori Breda. The company started to produce trolley buses again and in the 1960s built a new diesel engine factory in Bari. In the 1980s, the company was renamed Isotta Fraschini Motori SpA and it became part of Fincantieri group, with administrative headquarters in the old factory in Bari. In the 1990s, attempts to revive the automotive industry of Isotta Fraschini were made. Concept-car coupe and roadster Isotta Fraschini T8 were built in 1996, and concept-car roadster Isotta Fraschini T12 was built in 1998. The company never went into production and closed for bankruptcy in 1999. **Isotta Fraschini Asso 80 R.I. *Isotta Fraschini Asso 120 R.C.40 *Isotta Fraschini Asso 200 *Isotta Fraschini Asso 250 probably misidentification or variant of Asso 200 *Isotta Fraschini Asso 500 * Isotta Fraschini Asso 500 AQ *Isotta Fraschini Asso 750 (140x170=47105cc/2875cuin) **Isotta Fraschini Asso 750 R **Isotta Fraschini Asso 750 R.C. **Isotta Fraschini Asso 750 R.C.35 *Isotta Fraschini Asso IX **Isotta Fraschini Asso IX R.C.45 *Isotta Fraschini Asso 1000 (150x180=57256cc/3494cuin) *Isotta Fraschini Asso Caccia *Isotta Fraschini Asso XI *Isotta Fraschini Asso (racing) *Isotta Fraschini Beta **Isotta Fraschini Beta R.C.10 *Isotta Fraschini Gamma **Isotta Fraschini Gamma R.C.15I **Isotta Fraschini Gamma R.C.35IS *Isotta Fraschini Delta *Isotta Fraschini Zeta **Isotta Fraschini Zeta R.C.25/60 **Isotta Fraschini Zeta R.C.35 **Isotta Fraschini Zeta R.C.42 *Isotta Fraschini Astro 7 C.21 *Isotta Fraschini Astro 7 C.40 *Isotta Fraschini Astro 14 C.40 *Isotta Fraschini Astro 14 R.C.40 *Isotta Fraschini V.4 *Isotta Fraschini V.5 *Isotta Fraschini V.6 *Isotta Fraschini 245hp *Isotta Fraschini K.14 *Isotta Fraschini 80 R *Isotta Fraschini 80 T Vehicles =Passenger cars= * Runabout 1901‚Äì1902 * Tipo FENC 1908 * Tipo KM 1910-1914 * Tipo IM 1913 * Tipo 8 1919-1924 * Tipo 8A 1924-1931 * Tipo 8B 1931-1935 * Tipo 8C Monterosa 1948-1949 * T8 1996 * T12 1998 =Racing cars= * Tipo D 1905 * Tipo FE 1908 =Trucks= * D80 1934‚Äì1955 * D65 1940‚Äì1955 =Trolleybuses= * TS 40F1 * F1 Today Isotta Fraschini is today represented by the following three economic entities. * Intrepida Fides, The Isotta Fraschini Foundation, acronym coined by Gabriele D'Annunzio, with registered office in Milan. * Isotta Fraschini Milano s.r.l., with registered office in Milan, active in the field of vehicles, as well as production and marketing of luxury goods. * Isotta Fraschini Motori S.p.A.: with registered office in Bari.

It is the 2nd largest city of Azad Kashmir and 74th largest city in Pakistan. A significant portion of the population from the district, the Mirpuri diaspora, migrated to the United Kingdom in the mid-to-late 1950s and in the early 1960s, mostly to West Yorkshire, East Midlands, West Midlands, Luton, Peterborough, Derby and East London. Mirpur is thus sometimes known as \\"Little England\\". Many British products are found, and many shops in the city accept the pound sterling. The city itself has gone through a process of modernization, but most of the surrounding area remains agricultural. History  The area that is now Mirpur has always been a crossroad for major invasions of South Asia, and has formed part of various empires over time including the role of an outlying region of the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Kingdom of Gandhara, the Mauryan Empire, the Kushan Empire, the Sultanate of Ghazni, the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal empire amongst others. The city of Mirpur itself was founded in around 1640 AD or 1050AH by the Ghakhar chief Miran Shah Ghazi. The Imperial Gazetteer of India Provincial Series Kashmir and Jammu (1909) reports that \\"it is said to have been founded by Miran Shah Ghazi and Sultan Fateh Khan\\". An alternate view is that the city was founded by Mira Shah Gazi and Gosain Bodhpuri, both regarded as saints. The word 'Mir' was taken from the name of the former and 'Pur‚Äô from the latter. In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin. He conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints, whose dargahs dot its landscape The area that is now Mirpur has been historically associated with Pothohar, though the modern demarcation of Potohar devised by the British excludes Mirpur, by using the Jhelum river as its eastern boundary. By the end of the 18th century, Gakhar power in Pothohar had declined. Mirpur had become part of Chibb, which ruled the state of Khari Khariyali with its capital at Mangla Fort. With the rise of the Sikh power in the Punjab, Maharaja Ranjit Singh established his supremacy and set his eyes on the Chibh states of Bhimber and Khari Khariyali. In 1810, a force was sent against Raja Sultan Khan of Bhimber and was met with fierce resistance. However, in 1812 another Sikh army under prince Kharak Singh defeated Sultan Khan, and the Bhimber state was annexed as Jagir of Kharak Singh. Around the same time, Ranjit Singh acquired Gujrat and invaded Khari Khariyali, then ruled by Raja Umar Khan. Raja Umar Khan made peace with Ranjit Singh; but before a settlement could be made, he died, and the state and Mirpur became part of Ranjit Singh's territories.History of Panjab Hill States, Hutchison, Vogel 1933 In 1808, Ranjit Singh annexed Jammu state, which was already a tributary since 1780, and in 1820 awarded Jammu to his commander Gulab Singh, who hailed from Jammu and had been under the service of Ranjit Singh for the past eight years. Between 1831‚Äì39 Ranjit Singh bestowed on Gulab Singh the royalty of the salt mines in northern Punjab, and the northern Punjab towns including Bhera, Jhelum, Rohtas and Gujrat. Gulab Singh kept on expanding his kingdom, and in 1840 Baltistan was made subject to Jammu while Gilgit fell to a Sikh force from Kashmir in 1842. The state of Kashmir was annexed by Ranjit Singh in 1819. However, the rebellion in Hazara in the beginning of 1846 compelled the country to be transferred to Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu as well. History of Panjab Hill States, Hutchison, Vogel 1933 Ranjit Singh had given Poonch, Mirpur and Bhimber as a Jagir to Gulab Singh‚Äôs younger brother Dhian Singh. However, in 1843 Dhian Singh died and Gulab Singh considered these areas now part of his territory. Though he wasn‚Äôt able to establish full control due to resistances. As an aftermath of the First Anglo-Sikh War and the Treaty of Lahore, The Treaty of Amritsar was signed between the British East India company and Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu on March 16, 1846. The British Government sold Kashmir to the Raja of Jammu for 75 lakhs Nanak Shahi Rupees. This treaty transferred him all the hill states between Ravi and Indus. The transfer included Kashmir, Hazara and the southern hill states (including former Khari Khariyali Thus sealing the fate of Mirpur with the new state of Jammu and Kashmir. =Early Mirpur= Since Mirpur lies in between where the Jhelum River meets the heavily forested foothills of the Pir Panjal mountains and above the plains of the largely treeless Punjab, it was an ideal spot for the construction of the boats used to carry goods from the Himalayas down the five rivers of the Punjab to the Indus River and onto the seaports in the Indus delta. Traders have been operating from there across the Indian Ocean for over three thousand years. Most of the crew on the boats trading up and down the Punjab and Indus River system were drawn from Mirpur, as training as a boat-builder was a necessary prerequisite for becoming a boatman. =British Dominion= During the modern period of the Dogra principality, a British dominion, the thriving river trade diminished due to the construction of railway lines from Bombay and Karachi into the interior of the Punjab. Moving goods by modern rail lines was both cheaper and quicker, and hundreds of Mirpuri boatmen found themselves out of a job. At the same time long-distance ocean trade was shifting from sail to steam. There was a huge demand for men who were prepared to work in the hot, dirty and dangerous stokeholds of the new coal-fired steamers. British seamen avoided such jobs whenever they possibly could. They preferred to work on deck. But in the 1870s Mirpuri ex- river boatmen were desperately searching for a new source of income. Although unfamiliar with stoking coal-fired boilers, they were prepared to learn and quickly gained jobs as engine-room stokers on new steamships sailing out of Karachi and Bombay, a position they retained until coal-fired ships were finally phased out of service at the end of the Second World War. Many Mirpuris also fought in the Indian Army in Burma during the Second World War. =Independence and War= The city was part of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir led by Maharaja Hari Singh, which chose to remain independent after the Partition of India. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947‚Äì1948 Mirpur was captured by the tribal forces on 25 November 1947 and became part of Azad Kashmir. It was the central location of the Mirpur Massacre in November 1947. =Postwar= After World War II, a new set of opportunities opened up. Britain's economy was just starting what proved to be a long postwar boom, and there was an acute short of labour in the foundries of the English Midlands and in the textile mills of Yorkshire and Lancashire. Now it was the turn of ex-seamen to become industrial workers in Britain. In 1960, when the Mangla Dam was about to be constructed, those who were going to be deprived of their agricultural land were afforded the opportunity to migrate to the United Kingdom and to join their relatives, who long established themselves in Britain. Although one major reason for the outflow was the construction of the Mangla Dam, but long before the construction of dam, a sizable Mirpuri community already existed in the UK. Mirpur City  Mirpur City is at 459 m above sea level and is linked with the main Peshawar-Lahore Grand Trunk Road at Dina Tehsil. It is the headquarters of Mirpur District, which has two subdivisions: Mirpur and Dadyal. Mirpur is now one of the largest city of Azad Kashmir.Internet Archive Wayback Machine. Web.archive.org (2009-10-27). Retrieved on 2011-12-17. The building of the new city in late 1960s paved the way for New Mirpur, situated on the bank of Mangla Lake. The project of four-star hotel PC has been completed. The government is planning to make the second rotating hotel of Pakistan in Mirpur, Azad Kashmir. In fact, the remains of the old city (Old Mirpur) are under the waters of the Mangla Lake, bit during the colder months of March and April, the water level recedes to such an extent that one can travel on motorcycle on the old Mirpur, road which still exists. The holy shrines of Syed Abdul Karim and Meeran Shah Ghazi then become visible and so do the remnants of a Sikh gurdwara as well as a Hindu Mandir, possibly dedicated to the \\"Mangla Mata\\" (Mangla mother goddess). The remains of old houses, water wells and graveyards reappear as well. People from surrounding areas visit old Mirpur to pay homage to their ancient land on which they lived and pray on the graveyards of their loved ones. Urs Mubarak of Meeran Shah and Syed Abdul Kareem are also arranged in Old Mirpur. The remains of Old Mirpur depict a silhouette of pre-Independence city, when many faiths coexisted. However, after division of the State of Jammu Kashmir, the non-Muslim community (Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs) fled to Jammu. New Mirpur was well planned, and modern buildings and ample roads serve each part of city. The affluence from emigration mainly to the UK is reflected by the structure and grandiose of the residential houses. There are telltale signs of inward investment by the expatriate community living in the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and the Middle East. There are a number of good hotels, restaurants, shopping malls and other urban facilities. Industry The government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has successfully developed Mirpur industrially and promoted private investment in a diverse economy: foam, polypropylene, synthetic yarn, motorbikes and scooter, textile, vegetable oil (ghee), wood and sawmills, soap, cosmetics, marble, ready-made garments, matches and rosin, turpentine. The economy of Mirpur generated economy of Azad Kashmir. However, much of the infrastructure still needs improvement so that high-quality products can be obtained. As part of the relief/compensation package in the wake of Mangla Dam, a new city is being developed along the southeastern outskirts of Mirpur, with the main city of Mirpur being doubled. Much construction is occurring around the whole district by Pakistani and Chinese contractors, raising the dam. Four towns in the district have been planned near the new city to resettle the population affected by the project. Education  English is common in educational institutes. Previously, the University of Azad Jammu & Kashmir was the only institution for higher studies but there have been significant changes in the educational infrastructure. The Mirpur University of Science and Technology (MUST), the Akson College of Health Science and the Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed Medical College have been formed. The AJK Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Mirpur is responsible for the studies at lower levels. In addition to the state-run schools and colleges, Mirpur has a well-developed private sector providing the education to all sections of the society: Other notable colleges and schools include: * The City School * Mohi ud Din Islamic Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences * Mohi-ud-Din Islamic Medical College * Punjab College, Mirpur  Media  Electronic and print media are rapidly increasing in number. There are many daily newspaper published in Mirpur.  Sport  Football, cricket and volleyball are popular in Mirpur. Mirpur has a cricket stadium, Quaid-e- Azam Stadium. There are registered sports clubs:A-5 Cricket Club, Al-Siraj Cricket Club, South Asia Cricket Club, Pilot Football Club, Youth Football Club and Kashmir National FC. The district football team of Mirpur take part in the All Azad Jammu and Kashmir football championships. Transport CNG auto rickshaws are very popular mode of transport for short routes within the city. The city's transport system links it to a number of destinations in Azad Kashmir notably Bhimber, Jatlan, Chakswari, Dadyal, Kotli and Khoi Ratta and to major cities in Pakistan as well as including services to Gujrat, Jhelum, Kharian, Gujranwala, Lahore and Rawalpindi. There is no railway station in Mirpur. The closest station is in Dina. The promise of a rail extension to Mirpur has not been fulfilled. Islamabad Airport which services the Mirpur region is 130 km away. Sialkot International Airport is 110 kilometres away An international airport has been planned. The location of the airport has not been determined, but possible locations near Mirpur are Mangla, Jatlan and Bhalwhara. In August 2013, the National Assembly and the prime minister approved the airport. It was determined that the airport would be constructed in two years after funding. Demographics According to the 2017 census, Mirpur had a population of 124,352. Mirpur's original population comprises different tribes similar to that of Punjab. However, since 1947, Pahari people emigrated from the neighbouring Rajouri and Poonch districts of the Indian administered Jammu and Kashmir. The bulk of the Mirpuri diaspora resides in England. =Hindu and Sikh communities= Before the Kashmir War in 1947, the Mirpur District had about 75,000 Hindu and Sikhs, amounting to 20 percent of the population. A great majority of them lived in the principal towns of Mirpur, Kotli and Bhimber. Refugees from Jhelum in Western Punjab had taken refuge in Mirpur town, causing the non-Muslim population to increase to 25,000. On 25 November 1947, tribesmen and Pakistani military members moved into the town, seizing the city. Of the minority population, only about 2,500 Hindus or Sikhs escaped to the Jammu and Kashmir along with the State troops. The remainder were marched to Alibeg, where a gurdwara was converted into a prison camp, but the raiders killed 10,000 of the captives along the way and abducted 5,000 women. Only about 5,000 made it to Alibeg, but they continued to be killed at a gradual pace by the captors. In March 1948, the ICRC rescued 1,600 of the survivors from Alibeg, who were resettled to Jammu and other areas of India. The date of 25 November is remembered as the Mirpur Day in the Indian-administered Kashmir. Culture =Saif Ul Malook Festival= The Saif Ul Malook Festival takes place annually in April, usually in the city centre. It is an event celebrating the anniversary of Baba Pir-e-Shah Ghazi Qalandar (Damrian Wali Sarkar), who was the spiritual guide/teacher of Mian Muhammad Bakhsh, the Sufi saint and Potwari poet famous for his poem Saif ul Malook. =Rathoa Mela= The Rathoa Mela takes place annually in summer in Rathoa Muhammad Ali Town near the Mangla dam front. It is an event celebrating culture value peace and tolerance. =Pahari Mushahira= Pahari Mushahira is a literary event in which poets from all over Azad Kashmir present their poems to the general public. It is celebrated regularly in Mirpur, as part of the campaign of Alami Pahari Adabi Sangat for the preservation and rehabilitation of the Pahari language and the culture of Jammu and Kashmir. Development In recent times, the city has seen many new developments. Some of the schemes approved and under construction are the New Bong Escape Hydropower Project, Pakistan's first private Hydel power and the raising of the Mangla Dam. Tourism There are the following places of interest: *Khari Sharif Darbar *Mangla Dam *Ramkot Fort Climate Mirpur has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh). The average annual temperature is 23.1 ¬∞C. The average annual rainfall is 297 mm. Since it is in the extreme south of Jammu and Kashmir, the city has a climate that is extremely hot during summer, making it very similar to the Pakistani areas of Jehlum and Gujar Khan. Mirpur is the breadbasket of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and has a climate similar to that of the neighbouring Potohar and Punjab.

In general, the P/E ratio is higher for a company with a higher growth rate. Thus, using just the P/E ratio would make high-growth companies appear overvalued relative to others. It is assumed that by dividing the P/E ratio by the earnings growth rate, the resulting ratio is better for comparing companies with different growth rates. The PEG ratio is considered to be a convenient approximation. It was originally developed by Mario Farina who wrote about it in his 1969 Book, A Beginner's Guide To Successful Investing In The Stock Market. It was later popularized by Peter Lynch, who wrote in his 1989 book One Up on Wall Street that \\"The P/E ratio of any company that's fairly priced will equal its growth rate\\", i.e., a fairly valued company will have its PEG equal to 1. The formula can be supported theoretically by reference to the Sum of perpetuities method. Basic formula { style=\\"float: right;\\" border=\\"1\\" width=\\"400\\" - valign=\\"top\\" +Examples  * Yahoo! Finance uses 5-year expected growth rate and a P/E based on the EPS estimate for the current fiscal year for calculating PEG (PEG for IBM is 1.26 on Aug 9, 2008 ). * The NASDAQ web-site uses the forecast growth rate (based on the consensus of professional analysts) and forecast earnings over the next 12 months. (PEG for IBM is 1.148 on Aug 9, 2008 ). } \\\\mbox{PEG Ratio} \\\\,=\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\mbox{Price/Earnings}}{\\\\mbox{Annual EPS Growth}} The growth rate is expressed as a percent value, and should use real growth only, to correct for inflation. E.g. if a company is growing at 30% a year, in real terms, and has a P/E of 30, it would have a PEG of 1. A lower ratio is \\"better\\" (cheaper) and a higher ratio is \\"worse\\" (expensive). The P/E ratio used in the calculation may be projected or trailing, and the annual growth rate may be the expected growth rate for the next year or the next five years. As an indicator PEG is a widely employed indicator of a stock's possible true value. Similar to PE ratios, a lower PEG means that the stock is undervalued more. It is favored by many over the price/earnings ratio because it also accounts for growth. The PEG ratio of 1 is sometimes said to represent a fair trade-off between the values of cost and the values of growth, indicating that a stock is reasonably valued given the expected growth. A crude analysis suggests that companies with PEG values between 0 and 1 may provide higher returns. A PEG Ratio can also be a negative number if a stock's present income figure is negative (negative earnings), or if future earnings are expected to drop (negative growth). PEG ratios calculated from negative present earnings are viewed with skepticism as almost meaningless, other than as an indication of high investment risk.Beware the PEG Ratio Jeremy Mullin, in Zacks August 26, 2013, accessed February 25, 2017 Criticism :See: Valuation using multiples #Disadvantages; Sustainable growth rate #From a financial perspective. The PEG ratio is commonly used and provided by numerous sources of financial and stock information. Despite its wide use, the PEG ratio is only a rough rule of thumb. Criticisms of the PEG ratio include that it is an oversimplified ratio that fails to usefully relate the price/earnings ratio to growth because it fails to factor in return on equity (ROE) or the required return factor (T). When the PEG is quoted in public sources it makes a great deal of difference whether the earnings used in calculating the PEG is the past year's EPS, the estimated future year's EPS, or even selected analysts' speculative estimates of growth over the next five years. Use of the coming year's expected growth rate is considered preferable as the most reliable of the future-looking estimates. Yet which growth rate was selected for calculating a particular published PEG ratio may not be clear, or may require a close reading of the footnotes for the given figure. The PEG ratio's validity is particularly questionable when used to compare companies expecting high growth with those expecting low-growth, or to compare companies with high P/E with those with a low P/E. It is more apt to be considered when comparing so-called growth companies (those growing earnings significantly faster than the market). Growth rate numbers are expected to come from an impartial source. This may be from an analyst, whose job it is to be objective, or the investor's own analysis. Management is not impartial and it is assumed that their statements have a bit of puffery, going from a bit optimistic to completely implausible. This is not always true, since some managers tend to predict modest results only to have things come out better than claimed. A prudent investor should investigate for himself whether the estimates are reasonable, and what should be used to compare the stock price. PEG calculations based on five-year growth estimates are especially subject to over-optimistic growth projections by analysts, which on average are not achieved, and to discounting the risk of outright loss of invested capital.Beware the PEG Ratio Jeremy Mullin, in Zacks August 26, 2013, accessed February 25, 2017 =Advantages= Investors may prefer the PEG ratio because it explicitly puts a value on the expected growth in earnings of a company. The PEG ratio can offer a suggestion of whether a company's high P/E ratio reflects an excessively high stock price or is a reflection of promising growth prospects for the company. =Disadvantages= The PEG ratio is less appropriate for measuring companies without high growth. Large, well- established companies, for instance, may offer dependable dividend income, but little opportunity for growth. A company's growth rate is an estimate. It is subject to the limitations of projecting future events. Future growth of a company can change due to any number of factors: market conditions, expansion setbacks, and hype of investors. Also, the convention that \\"PEG=1\\" is appropriate is somewhat arbitrary and considered a rule-of-thumb metric. . The simplicity and convenience of calculating PEG leaves out several important variables. First, the absolute company growth rate used in the PEG does not account for the overall growth rate of the economy, and hence an investor must compare a stock's PEG to average PEG's across its industry and the entire economy to get any accurate sense of how competitive a stock is for investment. A low (attractive) PEG in times of high growth in the entire economy may not be particularly impressive when compared to other stocks, and vice versa for high PEG's in periods of slow growth or recession. In addition, company growth rates that are much higher than the economy's growth rate are unstable and vulnerable to any problems the company may face that would prevent it from keeping its current rate. Therefore, a higher-PEG stock with a steady, sustainable growth rate (compared to the economy's growth) can often be a more attractive investment than a low-PEG stock that may happen to just be on a short-term growth \\"streak\\". A sustained higher-than-economy growth rate over the years usually indicates a highly profitable company, but can also indicate a scam, especially if the growth is a flat percentage no matter how the rest of the economy fluctuates (as was the case for several years for returns in Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme). Finally, the volatility of highly speculative and risky stocks, which have low price/earnings ratios due to their very low price, is also not corrected for in PEG calculations. These stocks may have low PEG's due to a very low short-term (~1 year) PE ratio (e.g. 100% growth rate from $1 to $2 /stock) that does not indicate any guarantee of maintaining future growth or even solvency.

Spec. issue on Mangla Dam VIII.5 (1964): 633. Background Mangala Dam from the top of Ramkot fortress Picture taken on the Mirpur city side of Lake, near sunset. As part of the Indus Waters Treaty signed in 1960, India gained rights to the waters of the Ravi, Sutlej and Beas rivers, while Pakistan, in addition to waters of the above three rivers within Pakistan and some monetary compensation, received the rights to develop the Jhelum, Chenab and Indus river basins. Until 1967, the entire irrigation system of Pakistan was fully dependent on unregulated flows of the Indus and its major tributaries. The agricultural yield was very low for a number of reasons, the most important being a lack of water during critical growing periods. This problem stemmed from the seasonal variations in the river flow due to monsoons and the absence of storage reservoirs to conserve the vast amounts of surplus water during those periods of high river discharge. The Mangla Dam was the first of the two dams constructed to reduce this shortcoming and strengthen the irrigation system of the country as part of the Indus Basin Project, the other being Tarbela Dam on River Indus. Construction =Cost= Mangla Dam was constructed at a cost of Rs. 15.587 billion (US$1.473 billion) with the funding being provided by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.\\"Water Dams: Mangla \\". Water & Power Development Authority.this project included Mr Iqbal Hussein and some other workers who did this work with much hardworking. Retrieved August 10, 2013. =Reservoir= The dam was constructed between 1961 and 1965 across the Jhelum River, about south-east of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad in Mirpur District of Azad Kashmir. The Mangla Dam components include a reservoir, main embankment, intake embankment, main spillway, emergency spillway, intake structures, 5 tunnels and a power station. Besides the main dam, a dyke called Sukian ‚Äì 17,000 feet in length and a small dam called Jari Dam to block the Jari Nala ‚Äì about 11 miles beyond the new Mirpur town had to be constructed. There was a total of 120 x 106 cubic yards (cu yds) of excavation for the reservoir whereas the total fill amounted to 142 x 106 cu yds and concrete to 1.96 x 106 cu yds respectively. The main embankment is earthfill with clay as the core material. Gravel and A-type sandstone are applied on the shoulders. The maximum height of embankment above the core trench is 454 feet and the length is 8,400 feet. The intake embankment is earthfill type with B-type sandstone as the core material. Gravel is applied on the shoulders. The maximum height of intake embankment above the core trench is 262 feet and the length is 1,900 feet. Sukian Dam is earthfill with B-type sandstone as the core material. A-type sandstone is applied on the shoulders. The maximum height of the intake embankment above the core trench is 144 feet and the length is 16,900 feet. Jari Dam is also an earthfill type with silt as the core material. Gravel is applied on the shoulders of the dam. The maximum height of Jari dam above the core trench is 274 feet and the length is 6,800 feet. The main spillway is a submerged orifice type with 9 radial gates, 36 x 40 feet each; it has a maximum capacity of 1.1 million cusecs. The emergency spillway is weir type with an erodible bund and a maximum capacity of 0.23 million cusecs. The 5 tunnels are steel and concrete lined and 1,560 feet long in bedrock. The internal diameter ranges between 26 and 31 feet. =Power house= The power house, which consists of turbines, generators and transformers, has been constructed at the toe of an intake embankment at the ground surface elevation of 865 feet SPD. The water to the power house is supplied through five steel- lined tunnels of 30/26 feet diameter. Each tunnel is designed to feed two generating units. The power house tailrace discharges into New Bong Canal, which has a length of 25,000 feet with discharge capacity of about 49,000 cusecs, and terminates at an automatic gate control headworks at about 12 km downstream located near old Bong Escape Headworks.Butt, M.

A view of turbine relief valve operation at Mangla Power House There are ten vertical Francis type turbines in the power house. Each of these turbines has an output of 138,00 bhp with a rated head of 295 feet of water. The first four turbines were manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric, Japan and were installed in 1969, turbines 5 and 6 are manufactured by ƒåKD Blansko, Czech Republic and were installed in 1974, turbines 7-8 were manufactured by ACEC, Belgium and were installed in 1981, while the remaining two turbines are a make of ≈†koda, Czech Republic and were commissioned in 1994. These turbines are connected to umbrella-type generators which have a generation capacity of 100 MW. Hitachi, Japan had provided generators for turbines 1‚Äì4 and 7-8 while ≈†koda generators are connected to turbines 5-6 and 9-10. These generators are in turn connected to three-phase transformers. The transformers connected to turbine 1, 4 and 7 were manufactured by the Italy-based Savigliano. The transformers for turbine 5 and 6 are a make of Italtrafo, another Italian company, while the remaining five transformers were provided by ≈†koda. Displacement & Resettlement The Government of Pakistan had agreed to pay royalties to the Government of AJK (Azad Jammu and Kashmir) for the use of the water and electricity generated by the dam. Over 280 villages and the towns of Mirpur and Dadyal were submerged and over 110,000 people were displaced from the area as a result of the dam being built.Terminski, Bogumil \\"Development-Induced Displacement and Resettlement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges\\", Indiana University, 2013, available at: http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/handle/10535/8833?show=full Some of those affected by the dam were given work permits for Britain by the Government of Pakistan, and as a result, in many cities in the UK the majority of the Pakistani community originates from the Dadyal-Mirpur area of Azad Kashmir. There are 747,000 Mirpuris in the United Kingdom,http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide- method/census/2011/the-2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/question- and-content-recommendations/kashmiri-research-project-2011---final-report.pdf and the British Mirpuri community forms about 70% of the British Pakistani community. The percentage is greater in northern cities and towns. In Bradford, an industrial town in north-west England, it is estimated that roughly three-quarters of the population is from Mirpur, with a sizeable population also in Birmingham. At the time, many took up work in the textile and steel mills, due to the acute shortage of workers in England. Operation The project was designed primarily to increase the amount of water that could be used for irrigation from the flow of the Jhelum and its tributaries. Its secondary function was to generate electrical power from the irrigation releases at the artificial head of the reservoir. The project, though not initially designed as one, also works as a flood control structure by retaining water during the flood-prone season of Monsoon. On December 5, 1971, the dam was damaged due to a bombing raid conducted by the Indian Air Force during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. This was against the international convention that large water reservoirs would not be targeted in war. As a consequence, the hydro project was temporarily out of service. From the data available in 2009, the project had generated 183.551 billion units of low cost Hydel energy since its commissioning. The annual generation during 2008-2009 was 4797.425 Million KWh while the station shared a peak load of 1150 MW which was 8.18% of the total WAPDA system peak. On 1 September 2013, the water level in Mangla Dam reached to a record height of 1237.15 feet against the maximum conservation level of 1242 feet. Radio Pakistan reported that \\"the water level in Mangla Dam has attained maximum height of 1237.15 feet in the history and it is still increasing.\\" Mangla Dam Raising Project Mangla reservoir had an initial reservoir capacity of , which reduced to in 2005 due to the sedimentation & was likely to reduce further. To counteract this phenomenon, the Mangla Dam Raising Project was started in 2004 and the main dam, spillway and its allied works were completed in 2009 at a cost of Rs. 101.384 billion. This project effectively raised the dam height by 30 feet to 482 feet (147 m), thereby raising the maximum water conservation level from 1202 feet to 1242 feet. This increased the dam's storage capacity from . Besides, it is expected that after raising the height of the Mangla Dam by 30 feet, the power house will generate 12 percent additional energy per year which will increase its installed capacity from 1,000 MW to 1,120 MW. The Mangla Dam Raising Project, however, has affected more than 40,000 people living in vicinity of the dam. The total cost of compensation and resettlement was Rs. 70 billion. The resettlement project includes the construction of New Mirpur City, four satellite towns (Islamgarh, Chakswari, Dadyal, Siakh) with all civic amenities, the Mirpur Bypass and two bridges across River Jehlum and Bong Canal respectively. A motorbike passes over the Dhan Galli bridge, a recently constructed bridge on River Jhelum near the Mangla Dam. =Mangla Power House Expansion Project= Olson with WAPDA Chairman pledging USAID support In November 2012, United States announced a grant of $150 million for the expansion of the Mangla Dam power house. Under the project, $400 million would be spent on the Mangla Dam power house which is estimated to provide additional production for the next 40 years. The project, when complete, will increase the power generation capacity of the Mangla Dam to 1,310 MW from the existing 1000 MW capacity. The dam was further expanded in era of Pervez Musharraf but it did not enhance the capacity of electric generation except increasing the level of water in the dam.

Family Heinz was born in Homberg, Germany to Konrad Spankn√∂bel (1866‚Äì1969) and Christiane Becker (1869‚Äì1966). He had an older brother, Karl Adolf (later Charles A. Noble; 6 September 1892, Homberg, Germany ‚Äì 22 March 1983, Watsontown, Pennsylvania, USA) and younger brothers and sisters: Kathe (1897‚Äì1970), Anne (1898‚Äì1962), Wilhelm (1900‚Äì1980), August (1902‚Äì1969), Martha (1904‚Äì1966), and Freida (1907‚Äì?). In 1918, he married Elsa Fourier (1892‚Äì1957) in W√ºrzburg, Germany. Career In 1920, Spankn√∂bel was ordained as a minister in the Seventh-day Adventist Church in W√ºrzburg. He was admitted to the US as a minister in 1929, but his relationship with religion was dubious while he was in the country. Spankn√∂bel was a member of the Free Society of Teutonia and an employee of the Ford Motor Company. Initial support for American fascist organizations came from Germany. In May 1933, Nazi Deputy F√ºhrer Rudolf Hess gave Spankn√∂bel authority to form an American Nazi organization. Shortly thereafter, with help from the German consul in New York City, Spankn√∂bel formed the Friends of New Germany by merging two older organizations in the United States‚Äî the Society of American Friends of Germany (formed from the dissolved Gauleitung-USA or Gau-USA) and the Free Society of Teutonia; which were both small groups with only a few hundred members each. The Friends of New Germany was headquartered in Yorkville, Manhattan, but had a strong presence in Chicago. The organization led by Spankn√∂bel was openly pro-Nazi, and engaged in activities such as storming the German language New Yorker Staats-Zeitung with the demand that Nazi-sympathetic articles be published. He attempted to infiltrate and influence other non-political German-American organizations, such as the United German Societies. One of the Friends' early initiatives was to counter, with propaganda, a Jewish boycott of businesses in the heavily German neighborhood of Yorkville. In an internal battle for control of the Friends, Spankn√∂bel was ousted as leader and subsequently ordered to be deported in October 1933 because he had failed to register as a foreign agent. At the same time, Congressman Samuel Dickstein's investigation concluded that the Friends represented a branch of German dictator Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party in America. After a U. S. Federal arrest warrant was issued, Spankn√∂bel boarded the S.S. Europa ocean liner bound for Bremen on 29 October. Back in Germany, Spankn√∂bel reportedly became a director of the Propaganda School for Germans Living Abroad. In 1942, a company called Vereinigte Leder- und Lederwarenfabriken Heinz Spankn√∂bel & Co. [United Leather and leather goods factories Heinz Spankn√∂bel & Co.] was founded in Hohenbruck near K√∂niggr√§tz in then Sudetenland.

Transylvania The first reference to the region was as the Medieval Latin expression (\\"land beyond the forest\\") in a document dating to 1075. The expression (\\"area beyond the forest\\") appears in the 12th century in ' and subsequently as ' in medieval documents of the Hungarian kingdom.  '/' The names of in Romanian and in Hungarian are believed to be connected. However, the original source and meaning are disputed and claimed by both Romanians and Hungarians. The first Hungarian form recorded was (12th century, in the Gesta Hungarorum) while the first Romanian form recorded was in 1432 as Ardeliu.Lucy Mallow, Transylvania, 2nd edn. (Bradt Travel Guides, 2013), 16.Rupprecht Rohr, Kleines rum√§nisches etymologisches W√∂rterbuch: 1. Band: A-B, s.v. ‚ÄúArdeal‚Äù (Frankfurt am Main: Haag + Herchen, 1999), 82. The initial a/e difference between the names can be found in other Hungarian loans in Romanian, such as Hungarian ‚Äògooseberry‚Äô ‚Üí Romanian , , as well as in placenames, e.g., ‚Üí , and . =Hungarian view= The consensus of Hungarian linguists and Hungarian historians on the etymology of both Erd√©ly and Transylvania is as follows: * The modern Hungarian form Erd√©ly was derived from Erd≈ë-el√º, literally ‚Äòbeyond the forest‚Äô. means ‚Äòwoods, forest‚Äô, and the archaic el√º suffix meant ‚Äòbeyond‚Äô (modern reflexes: dialectal elv√© ‚Äòbeyond‚Äô, dialectal el, elv ‚Äòthe place beyond‚Äô) and was applied to a type of border region (gyep≈±) and the associated social and economic organisation; for example, (near Ungv√°r), and archaic , ‚ÄòWallachia‚Äô, lit. \\"beyond the snowy mountains\\" ( in Latin, modern ), refers to a region lying beyond the Carpathian mountains if viewed from Hungary, and was under strong Hungarian political influence during the Middle Ages. If viewed from Hungary, Erd≈ë-el√º probably refers to the fact that the Transylvanian plateau is separated in the northwest from the Great Hungarian Plain and Cri»ôana plains by the well-forested Apuseni mountains.Armin Hetzer, ‚ÄúAlloglotte Sprechergruppen in den romanischen Sprachr√§umen: S√ºdostromania‚Äù, Romanische Sprachgeschichte, vol. 23, part 2 (Berlin-NY: Walter de Gruyter, 2006), 1843. Alternatively, from the point of view east of the Carpathians, the name could suggest that the Hungarian name was created in Etelk√∂z/Atelkuzu (Hungarian homeland in southern Ukraine), prior to settling on the Hungarian plain. * The Medieval Latin form (1077), later (from another point of view after the foundation of Hungary in 895), was a direct translation from the Hungarian form (rather than the Hungarian being derived from the Latin).Engel, P√°l (2001). Realm of St. Stephen: History of Medieval Hungary, 895‚Äì1526 (International Library of Historical Studies), London: I.B. Tauris. This theory is also supported by the Romanian historian Ioan-Aurel Pop. =Romanian view= Several Romanian perspectives have suggested alternative etymologies: * A letter from around 960 from the Khazar king Joseph to Chasdai ibn Shaprut, the rabbi of C√≥rdoba, mentions the \\"Ardil country\\" (Eretz Ardil), rich in gold and silver. Today, in Hebrew, Ardeal is written identically: . This theory therefore suggests that Ardi(a)l was the primary form of the name, thus \\"Ardeal\\" is an original Romanian toponym. Siebenb√ºrgen The oldest occurrences of this form are from the 13th century: * In the year 1241: in Annales Sancti Trudperti and in the Annals of Zwifalt: \\"‚Äù * In the year 1242: in the notes of the friar Erfurt: \\"‚Äù * In the year 1285: \\"‚Äù and \\"‚Äù. * In the year 1296: a reference to a particular \\"maister Dietrich von Siebenbuergen‚Äù. * In the year 1300: Ottacher of Styria mentions \\"Sybenburger‚Äù. There exist a number of theories on the etymology of , the German name for Transylvania. The most widely accepted theory is that refers to the seven principal fortified towns of the Transylvanian Saxons. The name first appeared in a document from 1296. An alternate Medieval Latin version, (\\"Seven fortresses\\") was also used in documents. The towns alluded to are Bistritz (Bistri»õa, Beszterce), Hermannstadt (Sibiu, Nagyszeben), Klausenburg (Cluj-Napoca, Kolozsv√°r), Kronstadt (Bra»ôov, Brass√≥), Mediasch (Media»ô, Medgyes), M√ºhlbach (Sebe»ô, Sz√°szsebes), and Sch√§ssburg (Sighi»ôoara, Segesv√°r). Other theories include: * Siebenb√ºrgen means \\"Seven Castles\\" but does not refer to the towns of the Transylvanian Saxons. Transylvania and the Mure»ô valley seem to have been the first portion of land within the Carpathians where Magyars gained a foothold. According to legend, each of the seven Magyar chieftains erected an earthen 'castle' in this region. * Siebenb√ºrgen means explicitly \\"Seven Towns\\" or \\"Seven Castles\\". However, this etymology seems to originate in the dialectical tradition of the first, mainly Low German, Flemish and Dutch settlers, in whose homelands there are hilly regions called \\"Zevenbergen\\" (a town in Noord- Brabant, the Netherlands) and \\"Sevenbergen\\" (east of the town of Hameln on the river Weser, Germany). * Saxon settlement in Transylvania began in Sibiu. An early German name for the town was Cibinburg (akin to the Cibiniensis Latin name of the area). The alternate name Cibinburg was corrupted into Siebenb√ºrgen, and became the name for the whole region. The Slavic names of the region (Sedmigradsko or Sedmogradsko (–°–µ–¥–º–∏–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–æ or –°–µ–¥–º–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–æ) in Bulgarian, Sedmogradska in Croatian, Sedmograjska in Slovene, Sedmihradsko in Czech, Sedmohradsko in Slovak, Siedmiogr√≥d in Polish, Semihorod (–°–µ–º–∏–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥) in Ukrainian), as well as its Walloon name (Zivenbork), are translations of the German one.

It is situated 46 km from Rawalakot. The district's headquarters is located at Bagh. It is said that a bagh (garden) was set up by the landowner where the premises of the Forest Department are now located. As a result, the area that is now the district headquarters was named ‚ÄúBagh‚Äù. History There is an archaeological site located in Bagh called Bagh Fort. Prior to 1947, Bagh was a tehsil in the Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir. Administrative divisions Dhirkot Park The district of Bagh is sub-divided into 3 tehsils: * Bagh Tehsil * Dhirkot Tehsil * Hari Ghel Tehsil Geography and climate Map of Bagh district Topographically, the entire Bagh district is a mountainous area, generally sloping from northeast to south-west. The area falls in the lesser Himalayas zone. The main range in the district is Pir-Panjal. The Haji-Pir Pass is situated at the height of 3421 meters above sea level. The general elevation is between 1500 and 2500 meters above sea level. The mountains are generally covered with coniferous forests. Mahl Nala (in the Bagh sub-division) and Betar Nala (in the Haveli sub-division) are the two main streams. However, numerous other rivulets flow in the district. The climate of the district varies with altitude. The temperature generally remains between 2 ¬∞C to 40 ¬∞C. The main eastern part of the district is very cold in winter and moderate in summer. However, the lower valleys, the localities bordering Bagh at Kohala and its adjoining areas (Mongbajri and Ajra-Bagh) remain cold in winter and hot in summer. May, June and July are the hottest months. Maximum and minimum temperatures during the month of June are about 40 ¬∞C and 22 ¬∞C respectively. December, January and February are the coldest months. The maximum temperature in January is about 16 ¬∞C and minimum temperature is 3 ¬∞C respectively. Annual rainfall is about . Demography The total population of the district according to the 2017 census was 371,919. The major language of Azad Kashmir is Pahari. The Pahari dialect spoken in Bagh is closely related to the dialect spoken to the north in Muzaffarabad (84% shared basic vocabulary) and with the core Pahari varieties spoken to the south(west) in the Galyat region around Murree (86‚Äì88%). The wordlist for these comparisons was collected in Neela Butt.  Education  According to Pakistan District Education Ranking 2017, a report by Alif Ailaan, the district of Bagh is ranked at number 5 nationally in the ranking related to education, with an education score of 73.99. The learning score is at 85.42 and gender parity score of 88.32. The school infrastructure score of Bagh is 28.32, giving Bagh a national rank of 126. School infrastructure is a major problem in all of Kashmir. Access to schools, schools being far away is also a reason why there are fewer enrollments, especially after completing primary school. 2005 earthquake The city of Bagh, like other areas of the district, was heavily damaged in the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. Sixty percent of the buildings collapsed. Thousands of people died and many more found themselves homeless. In the aftermath of the earthquake, NATO came to the district to help with reconstruction and clearing. There was a report that an entire village was wiped out in the district. The U.S., through Pakistan, distributed vouchers so people could buy water and food.

Hayward says he was registered as David Justin Hayward but baptised as Justin David \\"and remained so ever since\\". (born 14 October 1946, in Swindon, Wiltshire) is an English musician best known as songwriter, lead singer, and guitarist of the rock band The Moody Blues. Hayward became the group's principal lead guitarist and vocalist over the 1967‚Äì1974 period, and the most prolific songwriter and composer of several international hit singles for the band. Hayward wrote singles for the Moody Blues including \\"Nights in White Satin\\", \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\", \\"Voices in the Sky\\", \\"Never Comes the Day\\", \\"Question\\", \\"The Story in Your Eyes\\", \\"Driftwood\\", \\"The Voice\\", \\"Blue World\\", \\"Your Wildest Dreams\\", \\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\\" and \\"English Sunset\\"; in all, writing 20 of the group's 27 post-1967 singles. He also has a solo career. His first album outside the Moody Blues, Blue Jays, a collaboration with John Lodge, reached the UK top five in 1975. The single \\"Blue Guitar\\", recorded with 10cc as the backing band, reached the UK top ten in 1975, and his 1978 recording of \\"Forever Autumn\\" from Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds reached the UK top five. In 2018, Hayward was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Moody Blues. Early life and early career Hayward was born in Dean Street, Swindon, Wiltshire, England, and educated at Shrivenham School in Berkshire and the Commonweal School in Swindon. He was playing in several bands as early as age 15 when he bought his Gibson 335, a guitar that appears on nearly all of his records throughout his career, and a Vox AC30 amplifier. All previous guitars were \\"unsatisfactory\\" and required modification. He performed with local Swindon groups in clubs and dance halls playing mostly Buddy Holly songs. One of Hayward's early groups was All Things Bright, which opened for The Hollies and Brian Poole and the Tremeloes. At age 18, he signed an eight-year publishing contract as a songwriter with the skiffle artist and record producer Lonnie Donegan, a move Hayward later regretted, as it meant the rights to all his songs written before 1974 would always be owned by Donegan's Tyler Music. In 1965 he answered an advertisement in Melody Maker and auditioned as guitarist for Marty Wilde and he went on to work with Wilde and his wife in The Wilde Three. The Moody Blues In 1966, after answering another ad in Melody Maker, this time placed by Eric Burdon of The Animals, Hayward was contacted by Mike Pinder of the Moody Blues after Burdon had passed on Hayward's letter and demo discs to Pinder. Within a few days, Hayward had replaced departing Moody Blues vocalist and guitarist Denny Laine. Bassist John Lodge replaced temporary deputy Rod Clarke, who had stood in for departed bassist Clint Warwick at the same time. After beginning by singing the old blues-inspired repertoire of the Moody Blues' 1964‚Äì1965 era, Hayward's initial artistic contribution to the Moody Blues was his song \\"Fly Me High\\", which was a Decca single early in 1967. It failed to chart, but gave the revised band a new direction forward from the R&B; sound they had been largely producing up to that point. Hayward's driving rocker \\"Leave This Man Alone\\" was then used as the B-side of their next single on Decca, backing Pinder's \\"Love And Beauty\\" (1967), the first Moody Blues record to feature the Mellotron. Hayward and Lodge's integration into the Moody Blues along with Pinder's use of the Mellotron sparked greater commercial success and recognition for the band, transforming them into one of pop music's biggest-selling acts. The 1967 album Days of Future Passed, one of the first and most influential symphonic rock albums, gave rise to the Hayward-penned singles \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" and \\"Nights in White Satin\\". The latter record went on to sell over two million copies, charting three times in the UK (1967, 1972, and 1979), and has been recorded by many other recording artists. Hayward's B-side song \\"Cities\\" was an early ecology-themed item. In addition to delivering the lead vocals on his own compositions, Hayward took a featured lead or co-lead vocal on other band members' songs, including \\"Dawn is a Feeling\\" (Pinder), \\"Gimmie A Little Somethin'\\", \\"Isn't Life Strange\\", \\"Candle of Life\\" (Lodge), \\"After You Came\\", \\"I'll Be Level With You\\", \\"The Spirit\\", and \\"Nothing Changes\\" (Edge). The Moody Blues' attempts to come up with another hit single during 1967‚Äì68 had them record three other Hayward compositions; \\"Long Summer Days\\", \\"King and Queen\\", and \\"What Am I Doing Here?\\", all of which were then left unissued, but together with unissued songs by Pinder and Lodge they later formed the 'studio side four' of Decca's 1977 release Caught Live Plus Five which largely comprised a December 1969 live recording of a concert at the Royal Albert Hall (issued against the group's wishes). Hayward also co-wrote with Ray Thomas album tracks \\"Visions of Paradise\\", \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably\\", \\"Watching and Waiting\\", and, much later, \\"Never Blame the Rainbows for the Rain\\", plus he later co-wrote many songs with John Lodge for the Moody Blues, notably \\"Gemini Dream\\" (a US chart hit), \\"Meet Me Halfway\\", \\"Talkin' Talkin'\\", \\"Want to Be With You\\", \\"Once is Enough\\", \\"Strange Times\\", and \\"Sooner or Later (Walkin' on Air)\\", among others. Hayward's songs have opened each of the Moody Blues albums in their 'post-Mike Pinder era' since Long Distance Voyager in 1981, and his songs, both solo compositions and co-written with Lodge, plus his lead vocals, harmony voice, and guitar playing, have been a major overriding factor in the band's work and continued success since 1981. Their album sales from 1978 to the present total more than 60 million. This is the regularly quoted estimate of their album sales, since the total sales of their albums before 1978 are disputed owing to lack of official record company data,Decca Moody Blues liner notes, Decca Records / Universal Music 2006 However, the period 1967 to 1974 was when their albums (and singles) were charting highest in the UK and US plus worldwide (album track \\"Melancholy Man\\" made number one in France as a single in 1970) - Days of Future Passed topped the US album charts on reissue in 1972, then was followed into the album charts by the new studio album Seventh Sojourn. Hiatus and Blue Jays / solo work In 1974, the Moody Blues decided to take what ended up being a four- year break from performing and recording. Hayward continued working with Lodge and producer Tony Clarke, using musicians from the Moody Blues' label, Threshold, and sounding very much like the mother group. Together, they had a hit in 1975 with \\"Blue Guitar\\" (a Hayward recording with the band 10cc) and released an album titled Blue Jays. In 1977, Hayward recorded his first solo album Songwriter. He enjoyed international solo success in 1978 when he appeared on Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds concept album, which yielded his hits \\"Forever Autumn\\" and \\"The Eve of the War\\". Wayne later contributed to Hayward's 1980 album Night Flight. Hayward issued a rare non-album single \\"Marie\\" backed by \\"Heart of Steel' (Decca F13834) in April 1979, both sides composed by him, the 'A' side dedicated to his wife. These tracks were later included among the bonus tracks on a CD reissue of his Songwriter solo album in 2004. During the 1980s, Hayward composed and performed for film and television, including the theme song \\"It Won't Be Easy\\" for the 1987 BBC2 science-fiction series Star Cops, \\"Something Evil, Something Dangerous\\" for the film Howling IV: The Original Nightmare, \\"Eternal Woman\\" for the film She, and music for the animated television series The Shoe People. In 1989, with producer-arranger Mike Batt, Hayward released Classic Blue, an album of pop standards written by other composers set to orchestration arranged by Batt. Classic Blue included a cover version of Led Zeppelin's hit \\"Stairway to Heaven\\". Hayward's solo album The View from the Hill was released in 1996, and a live recording, Live in San Juan Capistrano, followed in 1998. On 10 March 1997, Hayward was featured on the BBC One's programme This Is Your Life with Michael Aspel. Hayward contributed vocals to a song on Rick Wakeman's 1999 album Return to the Centre of the Earth. In June 2003, he gave several performances at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Later that year, he sang along with other rock singers on another orchestral album, consisting of Moody Blues songs with the Frankfurt Rock Orchestra, titled Justin Hayward and Friends Perform the Hits of the Moody Blues (alternatively called Justin Hayward and Friends Sing the Moody Blues Classic Hits). Hayward was later involved in a legal dispute, since resolved, arguing he was not paid for his participation on the album. In April 2006, Hayward took part in the stage tour of Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds, reprising his role in autumn 2007 in Australia and in the UK in December 2007. He did so again in the UK in June 2009 and appeared on the tour in November and December 2010. The Moody Blues, with Hayward, Lodge, and original drummer Graeme Edge, continue to tour extensively, and in a BBC World Service interview, Hayward and Lodge made it clear they have no plans to stop working, regarding it as \\"a privilege\\" to still be working in the music industry. In an interview in 2005, Edge said if he remained in good health, he could go on for 10 more years. In 2011, Hayward contributed to the Moody Blues bluegrass tribute album Moody Bluegrass TWO...Much Love along with Moody Blues bandmates Lodge, Edge, Thomas, and Pinder. Hayward sang lead vocal on his song \\"It's Cold Outside Of Your Heart\\". Many other Hayward compositions are featured on this album as well as 2004's Moody Bluegrass: A Nashville Tribute to the Moody Blues. On 10 December 2011, Hayward, along with Ian Anderson from Jethro Tull and Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden, played a concert together at Canterbury Cathedral. In February 2013, Hayward released his solo album Spirits of the Western Sky on the Eagle Rock label. He toured solo with this album on the East coast of the USA in August 2013, to much acclaim, with Moody Blues keyboardist Alan Hewitt and vocalist Julie Ragins. The opening act and accompanying guitarist in the main show was UK's Mike Dawes. The final show of the solo tour, in Atlanta, was recorded by producer/director David Minasian for a live DVD project and a live CD. Recorded at the Buckhead Theatre on 17 August, the resulting DVD, Spirits‚Ä¶ Live (2014), features the full concert along with a one-hour behind-the-scenes documentary titled On The Road To Love depicting Hayward's 2013 American tour, also directed by Minasian. Following its release by Eagle Rock/Universal in August 2014, the DVD immediately rose to the #2 position on the Billboard Music Video charts Retrieved 19 June 2016. and would soon be broadcast by the PBS network. Two additional Hayward/Minasian collaborations quickly followed: A concert DVD filmed in Clearwater, Florida titled Watching and Waiting, and The Story Behind Nights in White Satin, an award winning documentary which chronicled the origins of Hayward's classic 1967 composition. In April 2015, Hayward was interviewed on BBC Radio 2's Johnny Walker show. The Spring of 2016 saw another Hayward release from producer/director David Minasian. Titled Live in Concert at the Capitol Theatre, the DVD contained a few surprises including the first live performance of \\"You Can Never Go Home\\" from the 1971 Every Good Boy Deserves Favour LP. Also featured was a bonus studio recording of a new song titled \\"The Wind of Heaven\\", a joint composition between Minasian and Hayward. Intended as the main theme for a forthcoming motion picture, the song, with an elaborate music video directed by Minasian, was released ahead of schedule on the DVD to coincide with Hayward's 2016 US solo tour. Hayward postponed his 2019 North American Tour according to Hayward, ‚ÄúDue to a medical condition that prevents me from doing extensive traveling in the next few weeks\\". Hayward did still perform during the \\"On the Blue Cruise\\" in February of 2019. Instruments For the most part, Hayward has used a red Gibson ES-335, though he also uses other guitars in both performing and recording, including a 1955 Martin D-28 \\"Dreadnought\\", a James Olson six-string acoustic, a black Guild acoustic, a Squier Stratocaster (essentially an inexpensive Fender Stratocaster, as Squier is a subsidiary of Fender), a Fender Telecaster, a blonde Guild 12-string acoustic (tuned to \\"open C\\" for \\"Question\\"), and in 1967 a black Gibson Les Paul. Between 1965 and 1968, he was without his Gibson 335 and relied on other instruments, most notably a 1964 Fender Telecaster and a hand-built 12-string guitar he had renovated for Donegan (he eventually bought this guitar from Donegan's widow). However, in an interview included on the Lovely to See You concert DVD (2005), Hayward says the 1963 Gibson 335 has been with him since 1967. Recently, he has played a Collings D3 on stage and on recordings. Among other instruments, Hayward also played mandolin on A Question of Balance and sitar on In Search of the Lost Chord. Personal life Written at the end of one love affair and the beginning of another, the song \\"Nights in White Satin\\" was, according to Hayward, \\"in adoration of all women\\". Hayward married model Ann Marie Guirron on 19 December 1970. His daughter Doremi, who sings on the track \\"Raised on Love\\" on Hayward's 1977 album Songwriter, was born on 3 December 1972. In 2013, Hayward spoke of his learning Transcendental Meditation in 1967, along with other members of the Moody Blues. Awards Hayward was awarded the first of numerous awards from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) for songwriting in 1974. In 1985, the Moody Blues picked up the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, and in 1988, Hayward received the Novello, among other honours, for Composer of the Year (for \\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\\"). In 2000, he was one of a handful of British artists to receive the \\"Golden Note\\" award for lifetime achievement by ASCAP. In 2004, Hayward was awarded the \\"Gold Badge\\" for Songwriters, Composers and Authors. At the Ivor Novello Awards in London on 16 May 2013 Hayward was given the PRS for Music Award for Outstanding Achievement (presented to Hayward by Marty Wilde).

It was later collected in Earth Is Room Enough (1957) and The Best of Isaac Asimov (1973), and adapted into an episode of the science-fiction television series Out of the Unknown. Its pattern is that of dystopian fiction, but of a subtly nuanced flavor. It is considered by some people to be one of his best short stories. Plot summary Asimov extrapolates the twin trends towards centralization of academic research and scientific specialization, to portray a world in which state control of scientific research is overseen by a vast bureaucracy, and scholars are effectively forbidden from working outside their narrow field of specialization. Working innocently under these constraints is Arnold Potterley, a professor of ancient history. Potterley, an expert on ancient Carthage, wishes to gain access to the chronoscope, a device which allows direct observation of past events, to establish whether the Carthaginians really sacrificed children by fire. Pioneered by a neutrino physicist named Sterbinski many years before, the chronoscope is now exclusively controlled by the government. When the government bureaucracy, in the person of bureaucrat Thaddeus Araman, denies Potterley's request for chronoscope access, Potterley sets in motion a clandestine research project to build a chronoscope of his own. Two people assist his quest: a young physics researcher named Jonas Foster and the physicist's uncle, a professional (i.e., licensed by the government) science writer, Ralph Nimmo. As a result of this work, the team makes a series of discoveries. First, they learn that the government has been suppressing research into chronoscopy; nevertheless, Foster invents a way to construct a chronoscope that is much more compact and energy-efficient than that of its pioneer inventor. Though this discovery delights Potterley, Foster soon proves that no chronoscope can see more than about 120 years into the past. In any attempt to observe an earlier time, the inevitable noise totally drowns out the signal. The government's reports of chronoscope observations of earlier years are thus clear fabrications. Personality conflicts and clashes of motivation cause the team members to fall out with each other. Potterley and his wife both remain disturbed by the death of their baby daughter in a house fire many years earlier, and there is the suggestion that he is subconsciously trying to exonerate the Carthaginians of child sacrifice as a way of exonerating himself of the possibility that he accidentally started the fire which killed his daughter. When he sees his wife's reaction to the chronoscope, and realizes that she would use it to obsessively watch their daughter's short life, he alerts the authorities and accepts the blame. His associate, Foster, now in the grip of intellectual pride and zeal for the cause of free inquiry, attempts to publish his breakthrough but is suddenly and unexpectedly apprehended by Thaddeus Araman, the bureaucrat who rejected Potterley's original research request. As Araman attempts to secure a promise from Foster not to persist in publication, Foster's uncle, Nimmo, is brought in. Nimmo proves just as rebellious and intractable as the other two, and Araman, frustrated by their unwillingness to cooperate, has no alternative but to declare the government's hand. He reveals that Foster has been apprehended through the government's own use of the chronoscope in snooping on the plotters. Araman reveals that the government chronoscopy agency, far from suppressing scientific research out of blind authoritarianism, was trying to protect the people in the only way they knew how. As Foster and Potterley have learned, the chronoscope is inherently limited to recent times--but what if, instead of focusing it upon the past of a generation earlier, it were tuned to the past of one-hundredth of a second ago? The dead past, Araman says, is only a synonym for \\"the living present\\". If the plans for a chronoscope, particularly Foster's new and improved version, ever reached the general public, the resulting plague of voyeurism would effectively eliminate the concept of privacy. Even the government workers now assigned to the chronoscope, Araman says, sometimes transgress regulations and use it to spy for personal purposes. Nimmo then reveals that in an attempt to take the pressure off Foster, he has already sent the details of Foster's chronoscope to several of his regular publicity outlets. The details of how to build a chronoscope relatively easily and cheaply are now available to everyone. Araman is resigned to the exposure of the chronoscope, and leaves the three academics with the insightful line: \\"Happy goldfish bowl to you, to me, to everyone, and may each of you fry in hell forever. Arrest rescinded.\\" Analysis The story's twist‚Äîthat the man from the government really was there to help‚Äîqualifies the idea that a world of directed research really constitutes a dystopia. Asimov's thesis, revealed in the final scene, is that central control of scientific research is not necessarily immoral, but that in the long run, it may be impossible after all. The character of Thaddeus Araman is a recognizable dystopian spokesman in the mould of Beatty in Fahrenheit 451 and Mustapha Mond in Brave New World, both of whom also acknowledge the limitations of their societies' control mechanisms. However, reviewer Max Brown noted that \\"In the final scene, the government man admonishes the protagonists for creating 'a fishbowl world' in which privacy had ceased to exist. In fact, however, such a world already existed for two generations‚Äîonly that invading privacy was hitherto a government monopoly. The chronoscope in fact gave the government far more of an omniscient power than even the notorious telescreen of Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. The only thing the protagonists did was to break the government monopoly of this awesome power and let the 'fish' see each other. ... Asimov's basic premise is that well-meaning government officials, possessing the total power of knowing what anyone at any time was doing, would for two whole generations be able to restrain themselves from abusing that power. Frankly, I don't possess such a confidence in human nature. I would certainly not want the government to have such a power for two years, let alone two generations.\\"Max G. Brown, \\"Government Power in Reality and Fiction\\", in The Magazine of Libertarian Studies, 1987 Summer issue. Notes * Asimov wrote the story after seven years as a professor at the Boston University School of Medicine. He said in 1973 that he tried to not let his personal life appear in fiction but \\"The Dead Past\\" was an exception, such as the scientific-research setting and the protagonist's interest in Carthage. * In his autobiography In Memory Yet Green, Asimov writes, \\"The story, one of my favorites, is most memorable to me for what I put in it accidentally. What I was planning was a story that inverted the usual assumption that government planning is tyrannical and that freedom of scientific inquiry is good. In the course of the story, however, I threw in, almost at random, a reference to Carthage that somehow took on a life of its own and quite unexpectedly introduced a subplot that provided the whole course of the story with excellent motivation. Any critic reading the story is bound to conclude I planned that subplot from the beginning, though I swear I didn't.\\" * Although the story is set in the mid-21st century, Asimov did not anticipate the development of transistors; the chronoscope apparently uses vacuum tube technology since it needs a short time to warm up. On the other hand, it might be said that he did accurately predict the effects of the development of cheap and common video recording equipment, from some people's obsessive viewing of recordings of deceased loved ones to the possibility that ubiquitous surveillance may end privacy as it currently exists. * The name Araman is similar to the character in the story \\"The Last Trump\\", \\"R. E. Mann\\" (a pun on Ahriman). * The Asimov festschrift Foundation's Friends includes a sequel to \\"The Dead Past\\" by American science fiction writer Barry N. Malzberg called \\"The Present Eternal\\". * The story is referenced in Alex Kozinski's article for his April 2012 Stanford Law Review article on internet privacy and internet surveillance. * Asimov made up the science of \\"neutrinics\\", the detection and manipulation of the neutrino particle, to explain how the chronoscope functions. Although the existence of the neutrino had been postulated in 1930, the first confirmed report of its detection was published a few months after the story first appeared. * Canadian Historian Bernard Wheatley referred to Asimov's story at a conference, saying: \\"Asimov's story assumes that the government could keep up for several decades the hoax that it has a machine capable of viewing the distant past, without ever producing a single such photo. That is not possible‚Äîhistorians would have smelled a rat long before! Medievalists, Classicists, experts on each and every period of history, would have clamored very loudly for a photo, any genuine photo, of their period. How much we could have learned from such a photo, even if it was just of daily life on an ordinary day when nothing special happened! There would have been no possibility for the government to fake a photo‚Äîthe best experts on the period in question would have looked minutely at the smallest detail. No fake could survive such scrutiny. And if the government persisted in producing no photos, the historians would have soon enough concluded that there just were no photos.Dr. Bernard F.

It is the second-largest town in the province after the capital, Zaragoza, and the largest town in Arag√≥n other than the three provincial capitals. It is the seat of the comarca of Calatayud. Its population has been declining during the last decade due to migration. The town has the title Muy noble, leal, siempre augusta y fidel√≠sima ciudad de Calatayud (\\"The very noble, loyal, always august and most faithful town of Calatayud\\"). The first democratic elections after General Franco's regime were called for 15 June 1977. In Calatayud they were held one day earlier than all the rest of Spain, in order to prepare for a visit there by King Juan Carlos I. Highways and railways The town is located by the Carretera Nacional N-II highway, the Autov√≠a A-2 and the N-234, among other local roads. The AVE Madrid‚ÄìBarcelona high-speed rail line, as well as the RENFE line from Madrid to Barcelona stop in Calatayud. History The city was founded on the site of a Celt-Iberian settlement by the Romans with the name Augusta Bilbilis and was the birthplace of the poet Martial in 40 CE. The site of the ruins of Augusta Bilbilis are approximately four kilometers to the north of the modern city of Calatayud. The modern town was founded by the Moors around the Ayyub castle, circa 716 CE. mud√©jar-gothic Colegiata de Santa Maria la Mayor The name Calatayud came from the Arabic ', \\"Ayyub's castle\\". The ancient inhabitants of Bilbilis moved to the new site. Occupying a strategic placement between the central meseta of Spain and the Ebro valley the city retained its importance in succeeding centuries. By the eleventh century a substantial Jewish community was present, surviving the reconquista until the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. Judaica texts from this era refer to Calatayud as ◊ß◊ú◊¢ ◊ê◊ô◊ï◊ë, ◊ß◊ú◊¢◊î ◊ê◊ô◊ï◊ë, or ◊ß◊ú◊¢◊ô◊î ◊ê◊ô◊ï◊ë (Qal\`a Ayuv, Qal\` Ayuv, Qal\`iya Ayuv) The city was conquered from the Muslims by Alfonso I of Arag√≥n in 1119. Many surviving examples of mud√©jar church architecture show that the Moorish influence lived on. During the Peninsular Wars a notable siege of French- occupied Calatayud led to its capture by guerillas in 1811. The city was the capital of its own province Divisi√≥n provisional del territorio espa√±ol de 27 de Enero de 1822 , the text of the proposed 1822 territorial division of Spain, Instituto de Historia, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC, Spanish National Research Council).

These characters appear in the Mobile Suit Gundam SEED and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny anime television series, as well as in the manga and OVA spinoffs. Both series focus on the raging conflict between Naturals and Coordinators, the former being regular humans and the latter being genetically-enhanced ones. Mobile Suit Gundam SEED begins when the neutral space colony Heliopolis is attacked by ZAFT, a military organization composed of Coordinators. Coordinator Kira Yamato pilots the mobile suit GAT-X105 Strike to protect his friends on the Naturals' ship Archangel from potential enemies as they head towards Earth. Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny continues two years after Mobile Suit Gundam SEED and follows the teenager Shinn Asuka and his duties in ZAFT. Protagonists =Kira Yamato= is a first-generation Coordinator, who lives on the neutral space colony Heliopolis to avoid war between the races of Coordinators and the Naturals, but such area ends involved in the war. Born as a Coordinator, Kira is the only person able to pilot the Strike mobile suit created by the Naturals, and is forced to pilot it into numerous battles to protect his friends. In Gundam Seed Kira uses the GAT-X105 Strike Gundam until it was severely damage and would later gain the ZGMF-X10A Freedom Gundam and the ZGMF-X20A Strike Freedom Gundam in Gundam Seed Destiny. He is voiced in the Japanese series by S≈çichir≈ç Hoshi. In English, he is voiced by Matt Hill in the Ocean dub and by Max Mittelman in the NYAV dub. =Athrun Zala= is a member from the military organization ZAFT. Participating in the war between Coordinators and Naturals, Athrun discovers that his childhood friend Kira Yamato became a member from the Naturals' military organization, the Earth Alliance, despite being a Coordinator. Across the series, Athrun encounters Kira various times, and after almost killing him, Athrun starts questioning his own motives to participate in the war.In Gundam Seed Athrun would use the GAT-X303 Aegis Gundam until Athrun self-destructed the Aegis while grappling the Strike, destroying both units. He would later gain the ZGMF-X09A Justice Gundam and use the mobile suit for the rest of the series until it was destroyed inside GENESIS by activating the self destruct. In Gundam Seed Destiny Athrun used ZGMF-X23S Saviour Gundam until it was destroyed by the Freedom in a battle. Athrun would later use the ZGMF-X19A ‚àû Justice Gundam for the rest of the series. He is voiced in Japanese by Akira Ishida. In English, he is voiced by Sam Vincent in the Ocean dub and by Chris Hackney in the NYAV dub. =Lacus Clyne= is a good natured and popular female vocalist from the space colony PLANT. She is the daughter of PLANT Supreme Council Chairman, Siegel Clyne. Born as a Coordinator, Lacus is introduced when she is found in space by the Archangel, a ship of Naturals and befriends the Coordinator Kira Yamato. Late in the war between the races of Coordinators and Naturals, Lacus becomes the co-leader of the Clyne Faction, stealing the Freedom Gundam to give to Kira Yamato, and then later stealing the space battleship Eternal and joining with the battleship Archangel to stop both sides from fighting. Lacus is voiced in the Japanese series by Rie Tanaka. In the Ocean English dub, Chantal Strand is her regular voice actress, while Jillian Michaels does her singing voice. In the NYAV dub, she is voiced by Stephanie Sheh. =Cagalli Yula Athha= is one of the Naturals, fighting against the Coordinators in an ongoing war. Despite fighting on the battlefield various times alongside the Naturals' military organization the Earth Alliance, Cagalli is later revealed to be daughter of the leader from the neutral country of Orb. After helping her new allies to stop the war, Cagalli becomes the leader of Orb, a role mainly explored in the series' sequel, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. During the series, Cagalli is later revealed to be Kira Yamato's sister. In Gundam Seed and Gundam Seed Destiny Cagalli uses the MBF-02 Strike Rouge. Cagalli is voiced by Naomi Shind≈ç in Japanese. In English, she is voiced by Vanessa Morley in the Ocean dub and by Cherami Leigh in the NYAV dub. =Shinn Asuka= is the anti-hero in Gundam Seed Destiny. He is a member from the military organization ZAFT who joined them after his family was killed during a previous war between ZAFT and the Earth Alliance, and bears an enormous hatred towards his home country Orb for not protecting them. Across the series, Shinn starts questioning his motives to fight for ZAFT, but is still determined to follow their orders. In Gundam Seed Destiny Shinn used the ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam and would later use the ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam. He is voiced in the Japanese series by Kenichi Suzumura and by Matthew Erickson in the English dub. Antagonists =Rau Le Creuset= is an elite ZAFT commander, a skilled mobile suit pilot, and an adept tactician, whose abilities are greatly valued by the ZAFT leadership. He always appears in public with his unique mask covering his face. He becomes famous early in the war during the Battle of Yggdrasil, using his ZGMF-1017M GINN High Maneuver Type mobile suit to destroy thirty-seven Earth Alliance mobile armors and six warships. Despite this fame, he is later revealed a danger to all of humanity. His birth name is , the direct clone of Mu La Flaga's father, Al Da Flaga. Rau possesses spatial awareness, a trait he apparently inherited from his \\"father\\" and shares with his \\"brother\\" Mu. However, Rau has short telomeres within his DNA that cause him rapid aging problems. This is done intentionally, so that Rau can catch up to Mu in age and replace him. Rau takes a drug that stabilizes his aging; if he goes too long without taking the medication, he suffers intense pain. Rau eventually decides that Naturals and Coordinators are both unfit to live, and plans the destruction of both. In the final battle of the war, Rau pilots the ZGMF-X13A Providence Gundam, the final ZAFT suit. He battles with Kira Yamato in the ZGMF-X10A Freedom, who manages to surpass him. Before being finished, Rau and his mobile suit are destroyed by the self- destruction of GENESIS, dying with a smile on his face. In Gundam SEED Destiny, Gilbert Durandal, Rau's former friend and doctor, often imagines Rau conversing with him. He also appears in the final episode to Rey Za Burrel, another clone from Al who he was close with. He is voiced by Toshihiko Seki in Japanese. In English, he is voiced by Mark Oliver in the Ocean dub and by Kevin T. Collins in the NYAV Post dub. =Patrick Zala= , father of Athrun Zala, is the National Defense Committee Chairman who is the radical faction leader of the PLANT Supreme Council. He lost his wife, Lenore Zala, in the Bloody Valentine Tragedy and blames all Naturals for her death. His grief over the death of his wife, Lenore, made him a man driven by hatred and revenge. This makes him easily manipulated by ZAFT Commander Rau Le Creuset, whom Patrick believes to be his right-hand man. Zala has ZAFT construct the GENESIS superweapon and uses it in an effort to destroy all Naturals. Zala soon manages to destroy the Earth Alliance space fleet along with their lunar base at the Ptolemaeus Crater, effectively winning the battle. However, Zala orders the GENESIS to attack the Atlantic Federation capital, Washington. ZAFT Commander Ray Yuki protests such an action, as it would wipe out half of all life on Earth, for which Zala then shoots him. In his dying breath Y≈´ki mortally wounds Zala. As he lies dying in Athrun's arms, Patrick tells his son to fire GENESIS on Earth and make his vision of a Coordinators' world come true. He is voiced by Kinryu Arimoto in Japanese and by Andrew Kavadas in English. =Blue Cosmos/Logos= Muruta Azrael is the leader of the Blue Cosmos terrorist organization, which feels that all nations of Earth, neutral or not, should fight against humanity's \\"enemies\\", the Coordinators, for the sake of a \\"blue and pure world\\" - that is, a world without Coordinators, and has no problems with killing masses of ordinary humans. He wields enormous influence within the Earth Alliance due to his position as director of the Atlantic National Defense Conglomerate, the Alliance military's primary source of arms and munitions.

Due to his insatiable lust for carnage and devastation, he often neglects orders to retreat and even attacks his own teammates while \\"having fun\\". Shani does not state Orga or Clotho's names. As the series progresses, he reveals himself to be a sadistic sociopath with no moral restraints whatsoever. In one instance in the story, he is seen eagerly anticipating the destruction of the PLANTS for the sole purpose of seeing \\"all the pretty lights\\". Shani is the first to die among the three. Shani is killed by Yzak Joule during the Second Battle of Jachin Due, when his GAT-X252 Forbidden is destroyed by Yzak's GAT-X102 Duel Gundam. Clotho Buer is a talkative and quarrelsome person, who is constantly arguing with his teammates. While he fights in his GAT-X370 Raider Gundam, he enjoys shouting out video game‚Äìinspired battle cries. Between missions he spends his time playing on a portable game system called the \\"Great Wonder Swan XXX\\". Depending on the version of Gundam SEED seen, Clotho is killed during the Second Battle of Jachin Due either by Yzak Joule in the GAT-X102 Duel using the Buster's rifle (original Gundam SEED), or by Dearka Elsman in the GAT-X103 Buster (Gundam SEED: Special Edition).

He uses tactics that are reckless and aggressive, causing him to often nearly hit his teammates while piloting his mobile suit, the GAT-X131 Calamity Gundam. He usually spends his time between missions reading paperback novels. He is also the only member of the team that seems to care about the welfare of the other two; when Shani is killed, he screams out his teammate's name, and tries to attack Shani's killer Yzak. Unlike Clotho and Shani, who were killed by Yzak Joule, Orga is killed during the Second Battle of Jachin Due by Three Ships Alliance pilot Athrun Zala in the ZGMF-X09A Justice, equipped with the METEOR. Athrun slices Orga in half from behind as he is dodging a beam from Kira. Lord Djibril is a member of the secret society made up of the leadership of the military- industrial complex \\"Logos\\", and is also the successor to former Blue Cosmos leader, Muruta Azrael. Djibril decided that Junius Seven hitting the Earth would be a shameful incident for all those living on Earth, that the PLANTs (and by extension, all Coordinators) were at fault, and that they must all be exterminated; the members of Logos all agreed to this decision, hence reviving Blue Cosmos' plan to exterminate all Coordinators. When Djibril learned from Neo Roanoke that ZAFT forces were the instigators of the colony drop, he submitted the evidence to the people of Earth and Atlantic Federation President Joseph Copeland, thus starting the Second EA-ZAFT War. After Gilbert Durandal revealed to the world that Djibril and his Logos organization were behind the whole war, he was forced to go into hiding. Djibril was able to use the Requiem, a new Earth Alliance superweapon, in an attempt to destroy the seat of the PLANT Supreme Council, notably Durandal, at Aprilus One; however, interference by a ZAFT task force led by Yzak Joule caused Requiem to miss its intended target, instead destroying several other PLANTs.

Despite Shinn's attempts to keep her away from war, Neo makes her pilot the gigantic transformable mobile armour GFAS-X1 Destroy to attack a large swath of western Eurasia. Shinn tries to calm her, but when she loses control over her fear, Kira Yamato in the ZGMF-X10A Freedom attacks her, causing her death.

During the Battle of Crete his suit is destroyed by Shinn Asuka when he uses the beam javelin of his ZGMF-X56S/Œ≥ Blast Impulse to stab directly into the abdomen of the Abyss, causing it to crash into the sea.

Later, after Logos is revealed to the world by Gilbert Durandal, Lord Djibril flees to Orb under protection by the Seirans. However, the Seirans deny sheltering Lord Djibril in Orb. Their denial is all for naught as ZAFT invades nonetheless. As the battle quickly turned against Orb, Cagalli returned to lead her country's forces. As Yuna was unable to successfully command, he was delighted at Cagalli's return and was easily tricked by her into returning control of Orb to her. Her first command was that Yuna be arrested for treason, an order many officers frustrated with his incompetence happily acknowledged, beating him up before subduing him.

Before he was Chairman of PLANT, Durandal was a brilliant young physician specializing in genetics and advanced biomedical techniques. He also was a friend of Rau Le Creuset, who was also his patient. Rau's inability to understand the purpose of his existence helped Durandal form his opinions about a perfect world society. Durandal also had a relationship with later Minerva Captain Talia Gladys but she left him because she wanted a child. After Lord Djibril's death, Durandal proposes his \\"Destiny Plan\\", which is immediately opposed by the Atlantic Federation, the Kingdom of Scandinavia, and Orb. The Archangels crew think his plan would be to implement a new world order where every human is given the role for which they are best genetically suited at birth, and this would fulfill Durandal's ideal of perfect genetic determinism, as this should be the ultimate goal of all Coordinators. Under this theory humans will no longer fight against others for things that they wish, since each person's destiny are predetermined at birth. During the attack on the Requiem, Durandal strikes with the mobile space fortress Messiah, which is armed with a Neo- Genesis array. However, his plans to destroy Orb failed when the Requiem was destroyed. Eventually Gilbert faces Kira Yamato. The Chairman warns Kira that, if he is killed, the world will descend into chaos.

During the series it is revealed that he, like Rau Le Creuset, is a clone of Al Da Flaga, created as a transaction in exchange for the funds to finance his Ultimate Coordinator project. Due to the way he was born, his telomeres are shortened, which causes him to rely on pain-relieving medication. Sharing a strong bond with Rau, Rey wishes to kill Kira Yamato for Rau's death. At the end of the series, Rey is defeated by Kira in combat. Seeing his confrontation with Durandal, Rey shoots his superior, having been moved by his wish for a future of their own.

Before joining ZAFT he was a civilian with technology background. Near the end of the first EA-ZAFT War, he was the test pilot for the prototype GMF-X999A ZAKU Trial Type. During this testing, he encountered a large squadron of Earth Alliance GAT-02L2 Dagger L mobile suits during test runs of the ZAKU in the South American rainforest. Ignoring the treaty between ZAFT and the Earth Alliance that no fighting would occur in neutral zones, the Dagger Ls attacked and were subsequently wiped out. Before the beginning of the second EA-ZAFT War, Courtney is known to have been the test pilot of the experimental XMF-P192P Proto Chaos mobile armor, and later its complete form, the ZGMF-X24S Chaos. When the Chaos is stolen he again pilots the Proto Chaos to fight against a separate group that attacks Armory One. His current position in the Cosmic Era was as pilot of ZGMF-X56S Impulse Unit 03, equipped with a Destiny Sillouette, at the Battle of Messiah. After the war he returns to the Verne Developmental Corp. Reception The characters from Gundam SEED and Gundam SEED Destiny have been well received by anime fans.

Poonch district borders Indian-administered Kashmir's Poonch district and is part of the greater dispute between India and Pakistan. The capital of the district is Rawalakot.  History  From the end of seventeenth century up to 1837 CE, Poonch was ruled by the Muslim Rajas of Loran in Tehsil Haveli. It then fell into the hands of Raja Faiztalab Punjab Government. Poonch was included in the transfer of the hilly country to Maharaja Gulab Singh of Jammu and Kashmir in 1848. Before this transfer, Poonch was considered a district of Lahore. Maharaja Gulab Singh granted Chibal, Poonch and other areas to Jawahar Singh and Moiti Singh. The Raja of Poonch had to present to the Maharaja one horse with gold trappings. The Raja of Poonch was not to effect any administrative changes in the territory of Poonch without prior consultation with the Maharaja of Kashmir. Separation of Poonch 1947 Poonch district, now called the Poonch Division After independence in 1947, there was a rebellion in the western part of the-then Poonch District. The rebels led by Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, sought support from the Dominion of Pakistan, which provided arms and then launched an invasion of its own, using Pashtun tribals. In response, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir joined India, and the conflict turned into an Indo-Pakistani War. When a ceasefire was effected, the Poonch district was split across the two countries. The former capital city, Poonch, came under the Indian Poonch district. A new capital at Rawalakot was eventually established by Pakistan. Of the four tehsils of the original Poonch district, viz., Bagh, Sudhnoti, Haveli, and Mendhar, the Pakistani Poonch Division included the first two and a portion of the third. All three tehsils were eventually made separate districts, and the new Poonch district was constituted in the centre of the Division by taking portions of the Bagh and Sudhnoti tehsils. Administrative divisions The district is administratively subdivided into 4 tehsils: *Abbaspur Tehsil *Rawalakot Tehsil *Hajira Tehsil *Thorar Tehsil  Education  According to Pakistan District Education Ranking 2017, a report released by Alif Ailaan, the district of Poonch is ranked at number 8 nationally, with an education score of 73.52. Poonch is the most improved district in terms of middle schools over the past 5 years. The learning score of Poonch is 84.15. The school infrastructure score of district Poonch is 14.88, ranking the district at number 151, which places it in the bottom five districts in all of Pakistan relating to infrastructure. Schools in Poonch also have severe electricity problems, drinking water and boundary wall problems reflecting in their score of 2.67, 12.1 and 6.23 respectively. The state of building of some schools are also a major safety risk for the students. Transport A bus across the LOC, the Poonch-Rawalakot bus has helped to re-establish ties across the border.

It was first published in the November 1952 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction and reprinted in the collections The Martian Way and Other Stories (1955), The Best of Isaac Asimov (1973), and Robot Dreams (1986). It was also included in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume Two (1973) after being voted one of the best novellas up to 1965. There were originally no female characters in \\"The Martian Way\\", but Galaxy editor H. L. Gold insisted that one be included. Asimov complied by giving Richard Swenson a shrewish wife. It was not what Gold had in mind, but he accepted the story anyway. When Asimov wrote \\"The Martian Way\\" in 1952, it was thought that the fragments making up Saturn's rings might be over a mile in diameter. It is now known that none of the ring fragments is more than a few meters in diameter. The final journey back to Mars is described to be under constant acceleration (except for brief shutdowns for rest) which took five weeks, with the acceleration being well above the comfortable threshold for human beings. However, even with the maximum distance possible between Mars and Saturn, the constant acceleration and deceleration required to make such a journey in five weeks would have been below 1 m/s2. Plot summary Protagonists Mario Esteban Rioz and Ted Long are Scavengers: Mars-born humans who scour space for the spent lower stages of spacecraft, which are then recycled on the Martian moon Phobos. At the beginning of the story, Rioz scolds Long for wasting power listening to Grounder (Earth-born) politician John Hilder's argument that Earth's settlements on Mars, Venus, and the Moon are useless drains on Earth's economy, and that spaceships are wasting irreplaceable water by using it as reaction mass. A year later, Hilder has used his campaign against \\"Wasters\\" to gain power in Earth's Assembly, and has just reduced shipments of water to Mars, putting the Scavengers out of work. When Hamish Sankov, the head of the Martian colony, learns of Hilder's plan to desist all water shipments to Mars, he authorizes Long's plan to travel to Saturn and tow a fragment of ice from the rings to Mars. A fleet of 25 Scavenger ships makes the trip. Reaching the rings, the Scavengers choose a fragment approximately one cubic mile in volume, carve it into a rough cylinder, embed their spaceships in it, and fly it back to Mars, using the fragment's ice as reaction mass, in five weeks. On Mars, Hilder's allies are pressing Sankov to terminate all water exports to the Martian colony. When he hears from the returning Scavengers, Sankov signs. Two days later, the Scavengers land their ice-spacecraft in full view of the press, and Sankov announces that the fragment they brought holds 200 times the amount of water that Earth had been sending to Mars annually, and that if Earth cannot afford to lose any more water, the Martians will sell some of theirs. Long takes this situation as confirmation that Martians, instead of Terrestrials, shall colonize the remaining Solar System. Influence The Martian Way was Asimov's response to the McCarthy Era and an early exploration of terraforming Mars. Asimov's distaste for the anti-Communist campaigns of McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee was expressed in his portrayal of John Hilder's anti-Waster campaign. Asimov wrote in his autobiography that he expected to be either lionized or condemned for his attack on McCarthyism, but the story actually generated no reaction at all.Asimov, Isaac, In Memory Yet Green, Doubleday, 1979, , pp. 650, 661. He said elsewhere, \\"I must have been too subtle‚Äîor too unimportant.\\" The Martian Way of the title may be seen as an expression of the idea of manifest destiny. Asimov describes the vision of his character Ted Long for the Martians' future in terms of the frontier thesis of Frederick Jackson Turner and the idea of a \\"creative minority\\" expounded by Arnold Joseph Toynbee. The critic Joseph F. Patrouch has interpreted Asimov's choice of a mixture of Anglo-Saxon, Slavic, Latin and Scandinavian names (respectively, Ted Long, Hamish Sankov, Mario Rioz and Richard Swenson) for the Martian characters as a celebration of the melting pot of the American immigrant tradition. Also, Asimov's own claustrophilia informs his picture of the Martians, who can withstand isolation and lack of space much better than Earthborn humans. Asimov was particularly proud of the story's prediction of the euphoria to be experienced by astronauts on spacewalks which were then still 15 years in the future.

The film also stars Beverly Garland, Mark Goddard, and Kimberly Beck, and is directed by Mark L. Lester. The film is set in the Venice, California suburb of Los Angeles at the height of the roller skating fad of the late 1970s. Two characters, Bobby James (Bray) and Terry Barkley (Blair), fall in love while boogie skating to disco music. Along the way they must thwart a powerful mobster who wants the land their favorite roller rink sits on and compete in the Boogie Contest. The film received mostly negative reviews during its theatrical release, though it was a box office success. In recent years has become a cult classic and a time capsule of the late 70s disco era. Linda Blair did several more movies. Plot Bobby James and his friends (Phones, Hoppy, Gordo, and several others) skate to work on the Venice, California boardwalk. Meanwhile, in Beverly Hills, Terry Barkley, genius flautist is also heading towards the beach in her Excalibur Phateon car. She also is joined by her stuck-up girlfriend Lana. Bobby is skating on the boardwalk with a female friend when he encounters Terry. But she remains aloof and spurns his advance. Later they meet at a local skating rink called Jammers. During a near catastrophic skating incident where Bobby saves the day, she gives in. Terry wants to pay him to teach her how to skate for the Roller Disco contest. Even though they share a flirty, romantic couples skate, later on she rebuffs him yet again. The next day has both Terry and Bobby getting flack from their respected friends and family. She has had enough and goes to the beach. She finds Bobby there, practicing a jump and turns on the charm. He shares with her his dream to become an Olympic Roller Skater. They end up making out on the beach. Bobby asks her if she's going to pay him for sex as well, which garners a mighty slap in return and she takes off. Terry goes home and has a row with her mother. She wants to give up her dreams of playing Classical Flute at Juilliard School and win a roller disco contest at the beach. Her mom is shocked, enough so she needs a Valium. Terry decided to run away. The next morning, she calls and invites Bobby to breakfast where she apologizes. He wants to skate with her, but on his terms: no money; he calls the shots. Through a series of outdoor scenes we see them work together to form a routine. Unfortunately, Jammers is about to be sold to a ruthless mob developer. Bobby and Terry are clued into this plot and try to get her father, a lawyer, to help. But he refuses. While Terry is performing at a lush outdoor party, some of the young men sneak up, causing chaos. As a result, a group of distinguished guests falls into the swimming pool. This ruins the concert, as well as the party and its ceremonial cake. Terry gets reprimanded and slapped by her father for her running away, as well as for hanging out with her radical friends. The skaters find evidence, in the form of a cassette tape recording of the invalid ordeal, to kill the deal. Through a wild chase on the streets near the canal zone of Venice, they race to get it to the cops on time. They do, the mobsters are hauled off and the Boogie Contest is on. Terry and Bobby skate their routine and win. Later on, back at the beach Terry and Bobby share a sad goodbye. Both promise to write each other as she heads off to New York City and he to the Olympics. Development Roller Boogie was written by Barry Schneider with Irwin Yablans, who is credited with creating the story. Yablans' Compass International Pictures, founded with Joseph Wolfe, would distribute the movie. Compass International Pictures had unprecedented success the previous year with John Carpenter's slasher Halloween. In between Halloween and Roller Boogie, the company would distribute three other titles, Nocturna, Fyre, and Tourist Trap, the latter the most successful of the three. In an earlier version of the script, Bobby James' primary interest was song- writing. In the movie, Bobby and friends were trying to write a new song by humming into a tape recorder. Once he meets Terry she assists him in scoring it using her musical abilities. By the end of the movie, Terry leaves for her music scholarship whilst Bobby pursues his musical career. There is no mention of the Olympics in the earlier version. Another scene that does not feature in the movie that was present in the script comes where Bobby helps Terry escape from her bedroom after she is grounded by her parents. This scene was shot, however, since there are photos in various publicity items with Jim Bray peeking through a window on a ladder. All of the skating sequences and the dancing sequences were choreographed by David Winters and were instrumental in the success of the movie. Prior to the production of the picture, skating trainer Barbara Guedel tested over 300 young skaters, finally selecting fifty that would make up the skating crowds in the picture ‚Äì many of whom would also feature in another skating-influenced picture, Xanadu (1980). The ensemble were then given three weeks of training before the photography began, and, at the behest of their managers/producers, the principal actors were only on roller-skates for short periods of time. However, Blair did much of her own skating for the picture. Two stunt doubles were used, one for the skating chase around the streets of Venice ‚Äì Barbara Guedel would perform the trickier dancing stunts in the competition sequence. Blair would develop bursitis in her hip during the making of the picture. The film was shot in eight weeks through the Summer of 1979, mostly on the Venice boardwalks but also at the nearby acclaimed Marina Del Rey skatepark, in Beverly Hills and, for the final competition sequence, at The Stardust Ballroom in Hollywood. Soundtrack The soundtrack of the film largely draws on the disco sound that was popular in the late 1970s. A double-LP soundtrack was issued by Casablanca Records in 1979. Almost all of the tracks were written directly for the movie by Bob Esty and Michelle Aller. Esty/Aller had at the time recently scored a sizable hit, writing Cher's disco-single \\"Take Me Home\\". Incidentally, they produced Cher's accompanying LP of the same name, as well as the ill-fated follow-up, Prisoner. Cher would contribute one song to the Roller Boogie soundtrack ‚Äì the Esty produced \\"Hell on Wheels\\", used in the opening sequence. The track originally featured on the Prisoner album, and a rare accompanying video clip featuring Cher roller-skating also appeared around the same time as the release of the movie. The \\"Hell on Wheels\\" Japanese single includes another Prisoner album track, the 12\\" version of \\"Git Down (Guitar Groupie)\\", which is advertised as \\"Theme from Roller Boogie\\". However, the song does not appear in the movie. This single features a still of Linda Blair and Jim Bray on the cover. The song \\"Lord Is It Mine\\", performed by Bob Esty, was originally written by Supertramp's Roger Hodgson for their Breakfast in America LP. He also performed the tracks \\"Summer Love\\", \\"Rollin' Up a Storm\\", and \\"Roller Boogie\\". The segued opening tracks of side two of the double LP, \\"Electronix (Roller Dancin')\\", and the Latin-disco instrumental \\"Cunga\\", are credited to Bob Esty and Cheeks. Craig Safan composed cues for the film's original score, however, the film tends to rely on actual songs as opposed to instrumental pieces. Along with \\"Hell on Wheels\\", the other song on the soundtrack that was previously available prior to the soundtrack release is Earth, Wind & Fire's well-known disco single, \\"Boogie Wonderland\\", featuring the female group, the Emotions. Only one song featured in the film does not feature on the soundtrack, Jean Shy's \\"Night Dancer\\", which appears in the movie when Terry first visits the roller-disco rink.

The film was released nationally on December 23. The film grossed $13.2 million at the box office, proving popular with teen audiences. Initially, Compass International Pictures planned on a sequel (to be set in Mexico‚ÄîAcapulco Roller Boogie); however, probably due to the end of the disco fad, the idea was scrapped. Linda Blair, according to a Teen Beat article published in 1980, intended on moving away from the horror genre in favor of more lighthearted pictures such as Roller Boogie, but returned to the genre the following year in another Compass International Pictures-produced movie, Hell Night (1981). Jim Bray did not appear in any other films after Roller Boogie, despite achieving something of pin-up status in teen magazines largely based on his appearance in the film. Stoney Jackson would appear in the third and final season of The White Shadow as Jesse B. Mitchell before its cancellation in 1981, and in Michael Jackson's pop video \\"Beat It\\", in 1983. He also appeared in the 1984 Diane Lane movie Streets Of Fire as the lead singer of a doo wop group. In August 2006, fashion brand American Apparel played the movie in store windows in New York City. Matthew Swenson, the company's fashion media director, stated, \\"We became obsessed with that movie. On a whim, we also bought lam√© fabric and turned them into leggings, and the gold and silver took off.\\" Despite a weighted average vote of 3.7/10 on the Internet Movie Database (and also a rare 0% on Rotten Tomatoes), the film has developed a loyal following and is seen as something of a time-capsule of the late 1970s and the disco era. The film is considered a cult classic. The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Awards founder John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made. Home media Roller Boogie was released to DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on August 24, 2004 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD. On July 7, 2015, Olive Films released a Blu-ray version.

Conducted as one of the three major actions of Operation Reindeer during the South African Border War, it was the South African Army's first major air assault operation. Claims continue that Cassinga was a refugee camp, rather than a military camp, and that consequently the raid was a massacre of civilians rather than a highly successful military operation. While there are extensive records covering the SADF's planning and actions around the operation (declassified since the change of government in 1994), no SWAPO records other than photographic evidence of the mass grave exist. Background Starting in 1976, SWAPO PLAN combatants regularly travelled south by road from Huambo through Cassinga, an abandoned Angolan mining town that was located about halfway to the battlefront at the Namibian border. The town had about twenty buildings that previously served the local iron-ore mine as warehouses, accommodation and offices. A group of PLAN guerrillas led by Dimo Hamaambo occupied Cassinga some weeks after they began using it as a stopover point; according to both Charles \\"Ho Chi Minh\\" Namoloh and Mwetufa \\"Cabral\\" Mupopiwa, who accompanied Hamaambo when the village was first occupied, the first Namibian inhabitants of Cassinga consisted entirely of trained PLAN combatants. Not long after the establishment of the PLAN camp at Cassinga, it began to function also as a transit camp for Namibian exiles. The Angolan government allocated the abandoned village to SWAPO in 1976 to cope with the influx of thousands of refugees from South West Africa, estimated in May 1978 to total 3,000 to 4,000 people. Two days before the South African raid, UNICEF reported of a \\"well-run and well-organized\\" camp but \\"ill- equipped\\" to cope with the rapid refugee increase in early 1978. The Cubans, who set up a base at nearby Techamutete when they intervened in the war in 1975, provided logistical support to the SWAPO administration at Cassinga. According to SADF intelligence, \\"Logistic planning and the provision of supplies, weapons and ammunition to insurgents operating in central and eastern Ovamboland were undertaken from Cassinga\\", which they learned from PLAN POWs was codenamed \\"Moscow\\". Medical treatment of the seriously wounded as well as the repair of equipment and the assembly of newly trained insurgents on their way to bases in the East and West Cunene Provinces all took place in Cassinga.\\" South African planning By the beginning of 1978 SWAPO had improved its organisation and gained strength in Owambo and the Eastern Caprivi, UNITA was under pressure from the MPLA, and it became increasingly difficult for the SADF to operate in Southern Angola. South Africa also feared the disruption of elections it planned to hold in South West Africa excluding SWAPO. The attack on Cassinga grew out of the plan for Operation Bruilof, wherein the SADF envisaged attacking six SWAPO targets around the town of Chetequera. During the intelligence-gathering portion of the planning for Operation Bruilof, the SADF concluded that the small town of Cassinga was the principal medical, training and control centre for the guerrillas in the region, and one of SWAPO's two regional HQ's (the other being further north at Lubango). The SAAF still held air superiority over Angola at the time, allowing 12 Squadron to conduct aerial photo- reconnaissance with Canberra B12s in spring of 1978. These photos showed newly built military infrastructure including concreted 'drive-in' bunkers for armoured fighting vehicles covering approach roads, zigzag trenches surrounding the base, foxholes for machine guns/mortar crews ‚Äì and the highly characteristic 'star-shaped' concreted base structure for a SAM-3 missile battery and its radar/command vehicle. Also identifiable from the imagery was a civilian single-decker bus. PLAN combatants at Cassinga were aware of the overflights, and in a letter dated 10 April 1978, the camp's commander Hamaambo expressed concerns to his superiors about an \\"imminent invasion intention of our enemy of our camp in Southern Angola\\". In response to the reconnaissance flights, defenses were improved through the creation of a secondary camp north of the main camp, the addition of more trenches and the digging of holes for the protection of food provisions. The SADF shelved the plan for Operation Bruilof and planning for a new operation, Operation Reindeer, began. Reindeer was composed of three main actions; the airborne assault on Cassinga, a mechanised assault on the Chetaquera complex at ‚Äì that also involved SAAF defence-suppression strikes ‚Äì and an assault on the Dombondola complex at by a light infantry force. The planners for the operation were faced with a significant problem. While the Chetequera and Dombondola complexes were only around 35 km from the border with South West Africa/Namibia (then under South African control), therefore making conventional assault possible, Cassinga was 260 km from the border and deep inside Angola. This meant that any conventional assault force would have to fight its way in and out, and would almost certainly have given advance warning to the PLAN (People's Liberation Army of Namibia ‚Äì SWAPO's armed wing) soldiers in Cassinga, allowing them and leaders like Jerobeum 'Dimo' Amaambo (the PLAN commander-in-chief, then resident in Cassinga) and Greenwell Matongo to escape. Cassinga furthermore was located on a small hill, flanked by a river on its West side, and open fields in other directions, factors that combined to give any defenders the advantage. However, South African Defence Force (SADF) intelligence reports had ascertained that SWAPO ‚Äì and probably its advisers ‚Äì was lulled into a false sense of security because of Cassinga's distance from the Namibian border to the south. South African military intelligence briefings before the event indicated no awareness of any nearby supportive infantry or armoured units to support the base against a ground assault, and although SWAPO had been constructing a system of integrated defensive trenches and firing points for wheeled/tracked AFVs and AAA units, they were not then prepared for a joint-arms airborne attack. The SADF had not previously demonstrated any such capability, giving military analysts no reason to suspect that such an option was available to the SADF planners. The planners therefore believed that they could conduct a surprise attack on the base using only a lightly-armed airborne force. Earlier in that year, SAAF 12 Squadron had commenced training for a low-level strike role, utilising anti- personnel weapons such as cluster bombs. The South Africans knew about the success of Operation Eland and Operation Dingo, pre-emptive raids conducted in the previous two years by the Rhodesian Selous Scouts against guerilla forces based in Mozambique, and modeled their raid on many of the same principles. Though a risky plan it was decided that the element of surprise would outweigh the disadvantage of not having supporting armour on the ground. The SADF decided to mount a large airborne assault on Cassinga (by now code-named \\"Alpha\\"), supported by South African Air Force (SAAF) fighter-bombers and a fleet of 17 medium-transport helicopters. Using an exercise already underway called Exercise Kwiksilver as a cover story, the army initiated a call up of the Citizen Force (reserve units similar to the US National Guard) parachute units. The paratroopers conducted refresher training at the base of 1 Parachute Battalion (1 Bn) in Bloemfontein and then field training in the area surrounding the derelict Rheinholdtskop farm on the De Brug Training Area. A top secret document prepared by General Magnus Malan for the then Minister of Defence, P.W. Botha, refers to Cassinga as \\"a large SWAPO base located 260 km north of the border.The border referred to here is the Namibian-Angolan border. It is the operational military headquarters of SWAPO from where all operations against SWA are planned and their execution co-ordinated. From this base all supplies and armaments are provided to the bases further forward. Here training also takes place. In short, it is probably the most important SWAPO base in Angola. The nearest Cuban base is 15 km South of Alpha.\\" The South African cabinet was hesitant to authorise the operation, fearing an international backlash, but on 2 May 1978 the Prime Minister, John Vorster, finally approved the operation. The date of 4 May was specifically chosen as it was after the United Nations Security Council debate on South West Africa ended so as to \\"avoid making lives difficult for those countries favourable to South Africa\\". Composition of forces =South Africa= Airborne forces committed to the battle Because of the secrecy involved in the operation, and the commitment of most of the professional \\"permanent force\\" troops and \\"national servicemen\\" concripts of 1 Bn in other operations, it was decided to use 2 and 3 Parachute Battalions, (2 Bn & 3 Bn,) both reserve or \\"Citizen Force\\" units, in the operation. However, the need for secrecy meant not enough Citizen Force soldiers could be called up to fill both Parachute Battalions. As a result, all three were temporarily merged into a single composite Parachute Battalion, which was commanded by Colonel Jan Breytenbach. The final composition of forces for the attack on Cassinga was therefore the following: *The entire operation was run by Major General Ian Gleeson, who commanded the SWA Tactical HQ (set up specially for Operation Reindeer). *Overall control of the airborne forces was given to Brigadier M.J. du Plessis, who commanded the Parachute Brigade HQ. The units under his command were the Composite Parachute Battalion under Colonel Breytenbach that was composed of A, B, C and D companies (all under-strength), an independent rifle platoon, a mortar platoon and an anti-tank platoon; *The Helicopter Administration Area (HAA) protection force under Major James Hills, consisting of two Hawk Groups (10-man sections of rapid-reaction paratroopers) from 1 Bn; *An Airborne Reserve under Captain Wesley de Beer, consisting of a company from 2 Bn airborne in a C.160 to be used in the event of reinforcements being required, and the Mobile Air Operations Team (MAOT) under Commandant James Kriel, which consisted of five SAAF personnel to set up and run the HAA. All the paratroopers were equipped with a folding stock version of the R1 7.62 mm assault rifle. *The South African Air Force contribution consisted of four C-130 Hercules and five C.160 Transall transport aircraft. The helicopter component of the operation consisted of 13 Pumas and six Super Frelons. *The air attack component provided by the SAAF consisted of four Canberra B-12 bombers, each carrying 300 Alpha anti-personnel bombs; five Buccaneers carrying eight bombs each, as well as a sixth carrying seventy-two 68 mm rockets, and lastly four Mirage III fighter aircraft, armed only with Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and their 30 mm cannons fitted with high-explosive fragmentation shells. One crew from the Canberra squadron was tasked with acquiring further photo-reconnaissance imagery, some to be used in the preparation of photo-strip maps for the Tactical Low Flying (TLF) legs that the various aircraft types would undertake ‚Äì there being inadequate conventional mapping of much of the region ‚Äì and additional and up-to-date detailed imagery of the Cassinga environs for the Parabat drop zone and Buccaneer target planning purposes. Particular attention was paid to identifying units of AAA deployed in/near the target complex. It was during this phase that a serious error was made, with potentially disastrous consequences. Air-photo interpreters put the wrong scale on some of the maps that were used in the planning, despite the altimeter readings being clearly visible in the original reconnaissance photographs. Consequently, the air force planners overestimated the size of the DZ, believing it was long and wide enough to drop the paratroopers, when in fact it wasn't. This 'scale error' also mispositioned the 'Warning' and 'Drop' points on the run-in to drop. Compounding this error, the pilot of the lead aircraft was momentarily distracted by the effects of the bombing, and issued the 'jump' signal a few seconds late. The net effect was that many paratroopers overshot their intended DZs, many landing beyond the river ‚Äì and some in it. Playing a supporting role was a single Cessna C-185, which flew in the target area and acted as an observation post as well as a radio relay aircraft. In addition there was a single DC-4 Strikemaster fitted out as an EW and ELINT aircraft flying over the SWA/Namibia border with Angola. The purpose of this latter aircraft was to both intercept all Angolan, Cuban and SWAPO radio transmissions, before jamming their communications networks at the appropriate time. The successful jamming of the SWAPO, Angolan and Cuban communications network is one of the reasons for the late reaction by either of the latter two in responding to the attack. =PLAN= PLAN, the armed wing of SWAPO, was a guerrilla army and therefore did not have a traditional command and control structure. As such, it is impossible to determine a composition of units inside Cassinga. According to TRC findings, a self-defence unit posted at Cassinga consisted of approximately 300 male and female PLAN cadres (other source: approximately 300 to 600). The military section of Cassinga was easily partitioned from the non-military sections. The overall commander of PLAN in town was Dimo Amaambo, who responsible for the co-ordination of all PLAN actions in Southern Angola, including incursions into South West Africa/Namibia. A headquarters such as Cassinga was second in importance only to Lubango, which was the overall SWAPO military headquarters in Angola. Aside from the system of trenches and bunkers, defensive equipment included two ZPU-4 14.5 mm anti-aircraft guns, one ZU-23-2 23 mm gun, and around one or two ZSU 12.7 mm guns. These were capable of being used in a ground attack role. =Cuba= The nearest Cuban military presence was 15 km south of Cassinga, at the village of Techamutete, located at . It consisted of a reinforced mechanised battalion of at least four T-34 tanks, 17 BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers, seven trucks and four anti-aircraft guns, accompanied by around 400 troops. This unit was known to SADF intelligence, who had intercepted their radio traffic, and were also aware of their anti-UNITA operations. Their strength was estimated at 144 in October 1977, and was a major contributing factor in the choice of air rather than a ground assault. In briefing the strike aircrew, the SAAF Chief of Staff Intelligence was specific that there was no known military formation within 80 miles, except for a detachment of 'African police' with one truck. In debriefs, when questioned by commanders and aircrew of the 2 strike components, Canberras and Buccaneers, he insisted that the Cuban formation being just some 15 km to the south at Tetchamutete was 'a complete surprise and must have been deployed there in recent days'. Certainly, no photo reconnaissance over that village/road junction was ordered, but could easily have been included in the later Canberra PR overflights of Cassinga. Attack =04h00 ‚Äì 09h00= Air movements SAAF Canberra bomber The first to move on the morning of the attack were the paratroopers of the Composite Para Bn, who got up at 04h00 and began fitting their weapons, equipment and parachutes. At 05h19, the four Buccaneers bombers took off from AFB Waterkloof, followed at 05h43 by the faster Canberra. The heavily laden 'Buccs' could fly only at medium altitude, so their true airspeed (TAS) was considerably lower than that of the 'Cans', flying over higher. One of the Buccaneers went to an air force base nearer to the Angolan border in order to refuel and act as a close air support (CAS) aircraft, while the fifth aircraft of the Buccaneer strike force was delayed due to a brake problem, leaving four Buccaneers available for the initial strike. At 06h00 the eight transport aircraft carrying the paratroopers became airborne. Two of the Transall C-160s, carrying the reserve company of 116 paratroopers, peeled off and entered a holding pattern just south of the border so as to be available to drop reinforcements during the battle. The remaining six transports continued on towards a holding point some miles east of Cassinga. At about 06h30, the ELINT/EW Douglas DC-4 became airborne and settled into a holding pattern just south of the border. At the same time, a flight of two Puma helicopters, under the command of Major John Church, took off from 'a jungle night-stop' to fly to a clearing 22 km east of Cassinga in order to set up a Helicopter Administration Area (HAA), where the helicopters used in the operation could refuel. On board the two helicopters were Commandant James Kriel, the commander of the South African Air Force's Mobile Air Operations Team (MAOT) and his signaller, as well as Major James Hills, commander of Bravo Company, 1 Bn, along with one ten-man section from the two Hawk Groups he would be using to protect the HAA. Also in the two helicopters were six 200-litre drums of helicopter fuel, and, to the consternation of Hills, the Chief of the South African Army, Lieutenant-General Constand Viljoen. The MAOT set up their radios and navigational beacons at the HAA, by now code-named Whisky-Three, and signalled the all-clear for the rest of the force, consisting of the rest of the Hawk Group protection element (31 paratroopers), six medical personnel, two more members of the MAOT and eighty- six 200-litre drums of helicopter fuel, all on board a fleet of five Super Frelon and ten Puma helicopters. The HAA was then completed, and the 17 helicopters refuelled and waited for the call to extract the paratroopers after the completion of the attack. Also at around 07h00 the solitary Cessna C-185 took off and began flying towards Cassinga. Its role in the operation was to be an airborne observation post, giving the all-clear for the paratrooper drop, as well as being a radio-relay aircraft (known as \\"Telstar duty\\" in the SAAF). It would later be forced to withdraw due to sustained anti-aircraft fire. At around 07h50 two Mirage III fighter aircraft took off, heading straight for Cassinga. Bombing runs The defence-suppression bombing attack by the Canberras was two minutes late, occurring at 08h02 instead of 08h00 as originally planned, because the lead navigator failing to maintain effective timing-adjustment during the low-level approach phase. This made no difference to the intended effect. As the bombing had been timed to coincide with SWAPO's daily roll call on the parade ground, most of the people in the camp were assembled in the open when the Canberras initiated their low- level fragmentation bomb attack from the north. Each of the four Canberras ‚Äì flying in loose 'line abreast' at and 300 knots ‚Äì dropped 300 Rhodesian- designed \\"Alpha\\" fragmentation bombs, which were small finless bombs like '10-Pin Bowling' balls, designed to bounce up to into the air before detonating. A zone of some 800 metres by 500 metres was carpeted, each aircraft having its own 'bomb line'. The weapons were devastatingly effective against the assembled groupings below, causing most of SWAPO's casualties on the day, and also destroying vehicles, POL (\\"Petroleum Oil Lubricants\\", military acronym for flammable liquids) storage tanks and soft buildings. Immediately after the Canberras came the Buccaneers, from the west, who flew their dive-bombing runs along a generally east‚Äìwest axis. Photography from the cockpit of one of the aircraft showed the graphic lines of the preceding \\"Alpha\\" bomb strikes, was released to the SA press the following day. Of the total of thirty-two 1000 lb (450 kg) conventional bombs dropped by the four Buccaneers on the identified 'hard points', 24 scored direct hits, causing an immense amount of damage. Finally, the two Mirage IIIs conducted a strafing run on the target, using their 30 mm DEFA cannons. All the aircraft except for the solitary Buccaneer on CAS duty then flew back to air bases in South West Africa (Namibia) to refuel and re-arm to provide close air support if required ‚Äì the Mirages to Ondangwa air force base, the Canberras, Buccaneers and C-130/C-160s to Grootfontein air force base, where their support teams and material had been ferried up from Pretoria during the morning. The Canberras and Buccaneers were used for a later strike on the Chetequera complex. Parachute drop After the attack aircraft had finished their bombing runs the six transports, which had been holding in wait to the east, commenced their formation run towards Cassinga at an altitude of 200 feet (60 m). Shortly before reaching the base, the six aircraft climbed to , the drop height, and lined up for the drop. However, required visual 'tracking and distance' co-ordination markers were obscured by smoke from the bombing run, the drop zone (DZ) box scaling and drop point distances were incorrect ‚Äì due to the reconnaissance scaling errors ‚Äì and the drop was a shambles with nearly all the paratroopers being dropped off-target, some on the West side of the river and some into tall maize where they had problems linking up. The resultant confusion caused numerous delays, ruining the schedule of the 'drop- to-contact' plan, and much of the advantage of surprise. The disastrous drop also meant that it would be nearly an hour before C-Company was able to move into position on the eastern side of the camp and seal off the escape routes and as a result a number of top PLAN commanders, including Dimo Amaambo and Greenwell Matongo (two principal targets of the attack) escaped (with Amaambo later becoming the first head of the Namibian Defence Force in 1990). The two independent rifle platoons, No.9 and No.11, were dropped quite accurately to the north. They immediately went into action, moving through a tented camp to the north-west of Cassinga, beyond the bombed areas. Resistance was fierce but short-lived, and a total of 54 bodies were counted by the platoons before they took up their position along the northern end of the base to seal off that escape route. Of the four main paratrooper companies, D-Company had experienced the most accurate drop, though they were still 500 m from their intended drop zone. Regrouping quickly, they moved to attack structures which had been identified in the aerial reconnaissance photos as engineering buildings. However, during the assault on these buildings several of them exploded, perhaps due to ammunition stores within, injuring several paratroopers. There was also a brief blue-on-blue engagement as D-Company paratroopers were mistakenly fired upon by their fellow soldiers from B-Company, which by then had reached the base, but there were no casualties. After completing the assault of the engineer complex, D-Company moved south to set up a stop-line and prevent any guerrillas from escaping via that route. It also dispatched the anti-tank platoon to lay a tank ambush on the road to Techamutete. =09h00 ‚Äì 12h00= By 09h00, A and B Companies had regrouped and were ready to commence the main assault on Cassinga. Instead of attacking eastwards as initially planned, the two companies attacked the base in a northerly direction. Initially, they encountered very little resistance, though this changed dramatically once the paratroopers neared the centre of the base. Heavy sniper fire was directed at the paratroopers from a number of trees inside the base, they were subjected to B-10 recoilless rifle fire, and some SWAPO guerrillas had regrouped, using houses as cover from which to fire at the paratroopers, critically wounding two paratroopers. ZPU-2 anti-aircraft gun However, the paratroopers faced their greatest challenge when they were fired upon by a number of ZPU-2 14.5 mm multi-barrel anti-aircraft guns used in the ground role. This brought both companies to a complete halt, as they were unable to move under the accurate, and close, fire of the guns, and the Buccaneer on CAS duty could not conduct a strike on the guns for fear of hitting the paratroopers close by. In the end, Colonel Breytenbach ordered the commander of D-Company to take some men and work up towards the guns by attacking the trenches to the west of Cassinga. He also ordered the mortar platoon to begin attacking the guns. Upon entering the trenches, the men from D-Company were surprised to find a number of civilians, whom they later asserted were being used as human shields by the guerrillas hiding inside. The guerrillas opened fire on the paratroopers, leading the paratroopers to enter what they described later as a mode of \\"kill or be killed\\", in which preventing the deaths of the civilians in the trenches was allegedly impossible. Though a number of civilians were killed in those trenches, as the paratroopers moved forward encountered less and less civilians until nearer the guns all those in the trenches, male and female, were wearing SWAPO's Cuban-style uniforms. In the meantime, 9 Platoon had entered the trenches from the north, though were making slow progress as they came under the attention of the gunners. After a combination of the attack through the trenches and the mortar fire, the guns were silenced. The toll was an acceptable one for the South Africans; there were at least 95 SWAPO fighters dead inside the trenches and around the guns. Three paratroopers had been killed. After the fall of the guns, all major resistance in Cassinga ended. The odd sniper and corners of light resistance were all that remained, and the mopping up process was soon finished. The paratroopers immediately set up the Bn HQ and Regimental Aid- Post (RAP) next to the SWAPO hospital, and began treating the worst of the injured. Overall, three paratroopers had been killed, and eleven wounded, two of them critically. In addition, a fourth paratrooper was found to be missing, presumed killed. It was later assumed that he had drowned after being dropped in the river during the parachute jump, or that his parachute had malfunctioned. By now the attack was two hours behind schedule, with the first helicopter extractions having been planned for 10h00. =12h00 ‚Äì 15h00= Brigadier Du Plessis at this time informed Colonel Breytenbach of a radio interception, indicating that the Cuban force at Techamutete was deploying. The SADF had been given explicit operational instructions to avoid conflict with the Cubans, but delays on the part of SADF now made that a distinct possibility. Brigadier Du Plessis insisted on extracting all the troops immediately, however Colonel Breytenbach wanted to secure the LZ first. A compromise was agreed whereby half the paratroopers would move to the LZ where 12 Puma helicopters would extract them, while the remainder would continue clearing operations, as well as to collect any and all documents of intelligence value. At around 13h00, Colonel Breytenbach was informed by one of the Buccaneers on CAS duty that the Cuban mechanised battalion was moving up the road from Techamutete to Cassinga. The Buccaneer had spotted an advancing column of around 30 assorted AFVs, APCs, T-34 tanks and other vehicles advancing slowly up the road from Techamutete. It immediately opened fire on the column, destroying three BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers in the process, but then had to return to Grootfontein air force base to re-arm and refuel, leaving about 200 of the remaining paratroopers temporarily unprotected. All that stood between them and the advancing armoured column were the 22 men of the anti-tank platoon, armed only with 10 RPG-7 rocket launchers and five anti-tank mines which they had planted in the road. At this time however, there was a serious breakdown in the South Africans' command and control, and a number of fundamental errors were made. The shuttle of helicopters to and from Whiskey-Three, the HAA, as well as the order in which paratroopers were embarked, was improvised and initially uncoordinated and disorganised. It wasn't made initially clear to the commander of the helicopter extraction force quite what the problem ‚Äì and the sudden urgency ‚Äì was. Furthermore, two engineers, whose role was to destroy enemy equipment, departed in the first wave with all the demolition fuses before all the equipment had been disabled. Meanwhile, the Cuban column advanced directly into the ambush that the paratroopers had set for them. The lead T-34 tank was destroyed by one of the anti-tank mines, while the paratroopers destroyed four of the BTR-152s using their RPG-7s. They also killed approximately 40 of the Cuban troops before making their 'fighting retreat' back along the road towards the Helicopter Landing Zone (HLZ) east of Cassinga where Breytenbach was organising the remaining paratroopers for final extraction. In the face of the oncoming armoured column, Breytenbach ordered a thin defensive line, but realised the lightly armed paratroopers stood little chance against the armoured vehicles and prepared to fall-back into the bush to an emergency LZ while calling urgently for air support. The initial success of the SADF assault now looked like turning into a disaster with the imminent prospect of being overrun by Cuban armoured forces, into enemy territory. General Viljoen, who until this time had been wearing his rank and beret, removed and hid them. At 14h20, when the Cuban AFVs were already in sight of the beleaguered paratroopers, a Buccaneer and two Mirage IIIs arrived overhead. An experienced Forward Air Controller (FAC) amongst the paratroopers began to direct the three aircraft in strikes against the advancing Cuban armour. The Mirage IIIs, with their 30 mm cannons, destroyed 10 BTR-152s before running low on fuel and returning to Ondangwa air force base. The Mirages' cannons were unable to destroy any tanks, but the sole Buccaneer destroyed at least two tanks, an anti-aircraft position and a number of other vehicles with its 68 mm SNEB air- to-ground rockets. The rockets had been omitted from the original Operation Order, but the Buccaneer Squadron Commander had fortuitously chosen to include them in the ordnance that was ferried to the Grootfontein forward air force base by C-130 Hercules, with his ground crews and maintenance spares. The Buccaneer pilot was being fired on continually by a towed 14.5 mm anti- aircraft gun, at which he had to make two passes before he was able to destroy it with rockets. The Buccaneer ran out of ammunition at this point, but this coincided with the arrival of the 17 helicopters to extract the remaining paratroopers in the second wave. The helicopters' arrival betrayed the position of the LZ to the remaining Cuban forces, who began to advance on the area. While unable to see the armoured vehicles, the paratroopers could hear their engines and gunfire, and could see trees being flattened in their path barely away. In a desperate attempt to prevent the Cuban tanks from firing at the vulnerable helicopters and the assembling SA troops waiting to be picked up, the Buccaneer pilot dived his aircraft dangerously low, nearly hitting trees as he flew close over the top of the tanks in mock attacks, disorienting the crews and forcing them to break off their developing attack on the Parabats' positions. There were several holes in the airframe, including one on the armoured front visor glass, needing swift patching by groundcrew after landing, refuelling and re-arming. Because of the disorganisation with the first wave of helicopters, there was nearly not enough space for all the remaining paratroopers and prisoners on the second wave. In the ensuing chaos and panic to scramble aboard the helicopters, 40 SWAPO prisoners, intended to be taken back to South West Africa for interrogation, had to be released to lighten the aircraft. Some excess equipment and ammunition was also dumped from the overloaded helicopters. A final barrage of fire from the paratroopers stalled the closing Cuban armour just sufficiently long enough to complete the extraction of the assembled paratroops. However ten minutes after taking off, two of the Puma helicopters were directed to return to Cassinga, as it was feared that some of the paratroopers might have been left behind. They spotted a group of people huddled together, but closer inspection revealed that they were the prisoners who had been left behind. The helicopters flew a total of four low passes looking for paratroopers, when one of the helicopter pilots spotted a Cuban tank appearing from the bushes. He warned the other Puma pilot, who was able to bank away just in time so that the tank round missed the aircraft. No paratroopers were found and the two Pumas returned to the HAA. The dismantling of the HAA continued throughout the rest of the day. =15h00 ‚Äì 18h00= At 15h00, one of the Mirage IIIs returned to Cassinga, and once again strafed the Cuban vehicles that were still on the road, setting at least one of them alight. It was replaced at 15h30 by another aircraft and a Buccaneer which proceeded to destroy more of the vehicles and a building. About a kilometre south of Cassinga, the Buccaneer attacked another column of vehicles, coming under heavy anti-aircraft fire in the process. Another Buccaneer arrived at 16h45, surprised some Cubans moving through the ruins and destroyed a T-34 tank and some anti-aircraft guns in the process, while further Mirage and Buccaneer strikes at 17h10 and 18h35 destroyed another tank and other equipment. The result was that by nightfall nearly the entire Cuban battalion had been destroyed, killing around 150 Cuban soldiers, accounting for that country's biggest single-day casualty rate during its military involvement in Angola. A complete Angolan tank brigade relief force, arriving at dusk, was too late to have any impact and found only scenes of destruction at what had once been Cassinga. Aftermath According to an Angolan government white paper, the official toll of the Cassinga Raid was a total of 624 dead and 611 injured civilians as well as combatants. Among the dead were 167 women and 298 teenagers and children. Since many of the combatants were female or teenagers and many combatants did not wear uniforms, the exact number of civilians among the dead could not be established. A secret report to the SWAPO Central Committee listed 582 dead and 400 wounded. The South Africans declared the attack on Cassinga to be a great military success, even though disaster was so closely averted by the intervention of the SAAF, and in the face of a SWAPO propaganda campaign that labelled the event a massacre. Despite inflicting heavy casualties, the SADF did not kill or capture Dimo Amaambo or any other senior SWAPO leaders. The SADF casualties were low for such an attack, an important factor in South Africa where the public was intolerant of high casualty rates: Three soldiers were killed, one was missing in action presumed dead (landed in river, failed to emerge), and eleven were wounded. According to General Constand Viljoen, Cassinga set the strategy for the SADF for the next ten years, i.e. that of launching pre-emptive strikes at SWAPO inside Angola, even though subsequent actions would be armoured rather than air assaults. SWAPO launched Operation Revenge, a retaliatory bombardment of Katima Mulilo in the Caprivi Strip on 23 August 1978, during which 10 soldiers were killed and 10 injured as a result of a direct hit on their barracks by an 82 mm mortar bomb. Sixteen guerrillas were killed in a SADF follow-up operation into Zambia. Political consequences According to General Geldenhuys the raid was a \\"jewel of military craftmanship\\", but politically it was a disaster for the apartheid regime. A media campaign had been carefully prepared well in advance of the operation and media releases managed in order to create an impression that SADF intervention was at the request of the SWA administration, and to counter negative reports on South African military actions and claims of killing innocent civilians. This campaign included the fabrication and distortion of SWAPO actions. One of the parachute battalions was specifically tasked to take photographs and instructed to focus on images supporting the South African cause; bodies were only to be photographed with weapons by their side. Negative images, such as suffering victims, were to be avoided. Nevertheless, in spite of these instructions, pictures of bodies without weapons and of dead SADF paratroopers were taken.SADF photographs by Mike McWilliams included pictures of bodies without weapons, and pictures of dead SADF paratroopers. left The Angolans were first to publish details of the attack, followed shortly thereafter by SWAPO press statements that supported and elaborated on the Angolan account. They described the base as a refugee camp and claimed the SADF had slaughtered 600 defenceless refugees. The bodies were buried in two mass graves at Cassinga; pictures of one of the mass graves was used extensively for propaganda purposes, and for many people therefore became the imagery that they associated with the event. The debate over whether Cassinga was a military camp or a refugee camp (or both) continues to rage. Weapons and military installations were present and documented at the camp. In 1998 the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission also concluded that The United Nations invited SWAPO-leader Sam Nujoma to address the council before issuing United Nations Security Council Resolution 428 on 6 May condemning South Africa for \\"the armed invasion of Angola carried out on 4 May 1978\\". The Council condemned apartheid and the continued occupation of Southwest Africa and commended Angola for its support of the Namibian people. After independence, the new government of Namibia declared 4 May as \\"Cassinga Day\\", a public holiday to commemorate the loss of life during the raid. In 2007, the names of the Cuban soldiers who were killed were carved into the wall of Freedom Park in South Africa. Official celebration of this event by the SANDF ended only in 1996, two years after Nelson Mandela was elected president. Veterans of the various South African parachute battalions still privately celebrate Cassinga Day in remembrance both of the extent of the victory and of those who died that day.

The growth of the Academy of Fine Arts was slow. For many years it held its exhibitions in an 1806 building, designed by John Dorsey with pillars of the Ionic order. It stood on the site of the later American Theater at Chestnut and 10th streets. The academy opened as a museum in 1807 and held its first exhibition in 1811, where more than 500 paintings and statues were displayed. The first school classes held in the building were with the Society of Artists in 1810. The Academy had to be reconstructed after the fire of 1845. Some 23 years later, leaders of the academy raised funds to construct a building more worthy of its treasures. They commissioned the current Furness- Hewitt building, which was constructed from 1871. It opened as part of the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition., p. 65 In 1876, former Academy student and artist Thomas Eakins returned to teach as a volunteer. Fairman Rogers, chairman of the Committee on Instruction from 1878 to 1883, made him a faculty member in 1878, and promoted him to director in 1882. Eakins revamped the certificate curriculum to what it used to be today. Students in the certificate program learned fundamentals of drawing, painting, sculpture, and printmaking (relief, intaglio, and lithography) for two years. For the next two years, they had conducted independent study, guided by frequent critiques from faculty, students, and visiting artists. From 1811 to 1969, the Academy organized important annual art exhibitions, from which the museum made significant acquisitions. Harrison S. Morris, Managing Director from 1892 to 1905, collected contemporary American art for the institution. Among the many masterpieces acquired during his tenure were works by Cecilia Beaux, William Merritt Chase, Frank Duveneck, Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer, Childe Hassam, and Edmund Tarbell. Work by The Eight, which included former Academy students Robert Henri and John Sloan, is well represented in the collection. It provides a transition between 19th- and 20th- century art movements. From 1890 to 1906, Edward Hornor Coates served as the tenth president of the Academy. In 1915, Coates was awarded the Academy's gold medal.American Art News (January 7, 1922) Painter John McLure Hamilton, who began his art education at the Academy under Thomas Eakins, in 1921 described the contributions Coates made during his tenure: > The reign of Mr. Coates at the Academy marked the period of its greatest > prosperity. Rich endowments were made to the schools, a gallery of national > portraiture was formed, and some of the best examples of Gilbert Stuart's > work acquired. The annual exhibitions attained a brilliancy and √©clat > hitherto unknown ... Mr. Coates wisely established the schools upon a > conservative basis, building almost unconsciously the dykes high against the > oncoming flow of insane novelties in art patterns ... In this last struggle > against modernism the President was ably supported by Eakins, Anschutz, > Grafly, [Henry Joseph] Thouron, Vonnoh, and Chase ... His unfailing > courtesy, his disinterested thoughtfulness, his tactfulness, and his modesty > endeared him to scholars and masters alike. No sacrifice of time or of means > was too great, if he thought he could accomplish the end he always had in > view‚Äîthe honour and the glory of the Academy. It was under Mr. Coates' > enlightened direction that was fulfilled the expressed wish of Benjamin > West, the first honorary Academician, that \\"Philadelphia may be as much > celebrated for her galleries of paintings by the native genius of the > country, as she is distinguished by the virtues of her people; and that she > may be looked up to as the Athens of the Western World in all that can give > polish to the human mind.\\"Hamilton, John McLure. Men I Have Painted. London: > T. Fisher Unwin Ltd., 1921; p. 176-180 During World War I, Academy students were actively involved in war work. \\"About sixty percent of the young men enlisted or entered Government service, and probably all of the young women and all the rest of the young men were directly or indirectly engaged in war work.\\"Philadelphia in the World War: 1914‚Äì1919, New York: Wynkoop Hallenbeck Crawford Co., 1922. pg. 517 A war service club was formed by students and a monthly publication, The Academy Fling, was sent to service members. George Harding, a former PAFA student, was commissioned captain during the war and created official combat sketches for the American Expeditionary Forces. = Women at the Academy = The 1844 Board of Directors' declaration that women artists \\"would have exclusive use of the statue gallery for professional purposes\\" and study time in the museum on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings signified a significant advance towards formal training in art for women.The Pennsylvania Academy and Its Women, pg. 12 Prior to the founding of the Academy, there were limited opportunities for women to receive professional art training in the United States. This period between the mid-19th and early 20th centuries shows a remarkable growth of formally trained women artists. By 1860 female students were allowed to take anatomy and antique courses, drawing from antique casts.May, Stephen, \\"An Enduring Legacy: The Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, 1805‚Äì2005\\" in Hain, Mark et al. Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, 1805‚Äì2005: 200 years of Excellence Philadelphia, PA: Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, 2005, pg.16 In addition, women enjoyed their newly acquired library and gallery access. Life classes, the study of the nude body, were available to women in the spring of 1868 with female models; male models were added for study six years later. This came after much debate on whether it was appropriate for women to view the nude male form. It took 24 years before women could take full advantage of all aspects of training at the prestigious institution.The Pennsylvania Academy and Its Women, pg. 17 After 1868 women took more active leadership roles and achieved influential positions. For example, in 1878 Catherine Drinker, at the age of 27, became the first woman to teach at the academy.The Pennsylvania Academy and Its Women, pg.19 One of her pupils, her younger cousin Cecilia Beaux, would leave a lasting legacy at the academy as the first female faculty member to instruct painting and drawing, beginning in 1895.Yount, Sylvia et al. Cecilia Beaux: American Figure Painter, Atlanta: High Museum of Art; Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007, pg. 36 By the 1880s women artists competed with men for top accolades and recognition. Not until much later, however, did the academy gain its first woman on the Board of Directors in 1950. Even as women artists were making progress in the United States, they had difficulty studying in Europe. Many of the famous and state-run academies, such as the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, actively excluded women until the late 19th century, and many of the only opportunities available were through privately run, less prestigious art schools or ateliers of artists. Women who chose to travel overseas typically studied the works of master artists in the galleries, not in classes. In 2010, The Academy acquired the Linda Lee Alter Collection of Art by Women, nearly 500 works by female artists, from collector Linda Lee Alter. Artists in the collection include those of international renown, such as Louise Bourgeois, Judy Chicago, Louise Nevelson, Kiki Smith and Kara Walker, as well renowned Philadelphia artists including Elizabeth Osborne. In 2012, The Academy featured the collection in the exhibition The Female Gaze: Women Artists Making Their World. The Academy today North River by George Bellows, 1908 An exhibition space within the Academy =The Museum= Since its founding, the Academy has collected works by leading American artists, as well as works by distinguished alumni and faculty of its school. Today, the Academy maintains its collecting tradition with the inclusion of works by modern and contemporary American artists. Acquisitions and exhibition programs are balanced between historical and contemporary art, and the museum continues to show works by contemporary regional artists and features annual displays of work by Academy students. The collection is installed in a chronological and thematic format, exploring the history of American art from the 1760s to the present. =The School= The Academy was well known for its longstanding 4-year Certificate Program. Since 1929, qualified students were able to apply for and receive a coordinated Bachelor of Fine Arts program at the University of Pennsylvania. Another BFA degree program is offered exclusively in-house (a recent addition) its Master of Fine Arts program, a Post Baccalaureate Certificate in Graduate Studies, and extensive continuing education offerings, as well as programs for children and families. In 2005, the Academy received the National Medal of Arts recognizing it as a leader in fine arts education. In January 2007, the Academy, in association with the Philadelphia Museum of Art, purchased Thomas Eakins's work The Gross Clinic from the Jefferson Medical School. This seminal American work will be displayed at both institutions on a rotating basis. In January 2009, PAFA signed a historic transfer agreement with Camden County College, New Jersey.PAFA To Offer Scholarships to Fine Arts Students at Camden County College, PAFA Press Room, 2/20/2009 The \\"Camden Connection\\" allows for the transfer of liberal arts and studio classes as well as providing, on a competitive basis, for partial merit scholarships specifically for Camden County College students. Other transfer agreements are now in place with the following community college art departments: Community College of Philadelphia, Montgomery County Community College, Atlantic Cape Community College, and Northampton Community College. In 2013, PAFA received Middle States Commission for Higher Education (MSCHED) accreditation. PAFA had offered a major in the Certificate and the Bachelor of Fine Arts Program. Starting in Summer 2015, PAFA began offering a low-residency Master of Fine Arts program. Since Fall 2015, PAFA offers courses in fine arts illustration, which complements painting, drawing, printmaking, and sculpture courses. Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (c. 1895) A detail of the north (Cherry Street) face of the building The Cherry Street walkway between the Furness- Hewitt building (left) and the Hamilton Building (right), with sculpture installations Buildings = The Furness-Hewitt building= The current museum building began construction in 1871 and opened in 1876 in connection with the Philadelphia Centennial. Designed by the American architects Frank Furness and George Hewitt, it has been called \\"One of the most magnificent Victorian buildings in the country.\\" The building's facade draws from a number of different historical styles, including Second Empire, Renaissance Revival and Gothic Revival, amalgamated in an \\"aggressively personal manner\\". The building's exterior coloration combines \\"rusticated brownstone, dressed sandstone, polished pink granite, red pressed brick, and purplish terra- cotta.\\" The inside of the building is equally varied, combining \\"gilt floral patterns incised on a field of Venetian red; ... [a] cerulean blue ceiling sprinkled with silver stars\\", and plum, ochre, sand and olive green gallery walls. The building's structure combines brick, stone and iron; because of fire-proofing concerns, some of the iron i-beams were left uncovered. :1876 opening notes: > The newly Academy of Fine Arts will bear comparison with any institution of > its kind in America.

The Academy building is Furness's best known work, and served to establish him as one of the country's top architects., p. 80 Despite being initially praised by critics, by the turn of the century, tastes had changed and the building was not considered appealing. Eventually, steps were taken to obscure its ornamentation to \\"modernize\\" it. In the post-World War II era, the building was newly appreciated again, with the growth in the historic preservation movement making people more aware of treasures from the past. The building is now considered a masterpiece, one of the greatest buildings in Philadelphia and arguably Furness's greatest work. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975. In 1976 the building was fully restored, both its interiors and exteriors, to coincide with its centennial and with the United States bicentennial. The restoration work was conducted through Day and Zimmerman Associates, and headed by Human Myers. =Samuel M.V. Hamilton Building= In 2002, Dorrance H. Hamilton made a large donation to the Academy for its expansion. It purchased the former automobile factory at 128 N. Broad Street, next to the original building. This had also been adapted for use as a federal office building for some years. The structure was renamed in memory of her husband, Samuel M.V. Hamilton. It was renovated and the School of Fine Arts of the Academy completed its move there in September 2006. The building also contains a special exhibition space called the Fisher Brooks Gallery, named after James R. Fisher, an artist who attended PAFA in the late 1880s, and Leonie Brooks. They are the grandfather and mother, respectively, of Marguerite Lenfest, a philanthropist and PAFA board member. The Hamilton building also houses Portfolio, the museum's gift shop.

It is located near the tripoint on the Tumen River where the borders of Russia, China and North Korea converge. Population: Geography Khasan is the only Russian-inhabited locality on the border with North Korea. It lies near Lake Khasan and the Tumen River. The border between Russia and North Korea is formed by the river, but the Tumen's course sometimes changes during floods, effectively diminishing the territory of Russia and threatening to flood the settlement of Khasan and the Peschanaya border station. Since 2003, work has been progressing to reinforce the area with rocky soil for protection against erosion by the river. There is an unobtrusive Russian outpost near the border with a large radar array.Wikileaks about Khasan On the North Korean side of the border lies Tumangang. The closest Chinese town is Fangchuan. Transportation =Rail= Khasan has a railway station on the Baranovsky-Khasan railway line from Vladivostok to Rason in North Korea. It is the link between Russia and North Korea, by a rail bridge over the Tumen River called the Korean-Russian Friendship Bridge (Korean: Ï°∞Î°úÏπúÏÑ†Íµê). The North Korean station in Tumangang Workers' District, Sonbong County, is directly across the river. Construction began on the railway line from Baranovsky railway station to a point 190 km away in the direction opposite of Kraskino, and was completed in 1941. After World War II, the Baranovski-Kraskino line was continued to the border with North Korea, resulting in a total length of . The end of the line was the Khasan station, located near Lake Khasan. The Khasan station opened for operation on September 28, 1951. It has long remained a dead-end: across the Tumen River, which forms the state border, a temporary wooden bridge was built, which carried its first working train into Korea in 1952. Exchange of goods between the Soviet Union and North Korea by rail through the Khasan station began in 1954. Sixty-five cars or 1,300 tons of cargo were exported from North Korea, with 153 cars or 3,123 tons of cargo being imported. In 1955, 530 cars or 7,200 tons were exported from North Korea, while 295 cars or 4,800 tons of cargo were imported. Two years later, Khasan station exports had grown an incredible fourteen-fold and imports sixteen-fold. The temporary wooden bridge was inadequate for the increasing traffic, so in 1959 a joint decision was made to build a bridge with metal spans on stone abutments, called the \\"Friendship Bridge\\". It was commissioned on August 9, 1959.Communist Logistics in the Korean War, 1995–ñ–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–∂–Ω—ã–µ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä—ã There is a break in gauge between the two railroads since the Russian railroad system is and the North Korean railroad system is . This line is currently little used, with only 10,000 passengers being carried in 2005. In 1988, the two-way cargo traffic exceeded 5 million tons annually, but by 2001 the total volume had dropped to only 144,000 tons. In 1989, 830,000 tons of freight passed through the border from Russia (Khasan) to North Korea (Tumangang). By 1998 this number stood at 150,000 tons, and by 2001, only 92,000 tons of freight crossed the border, according to the Far East customs office. The Korean portion from Tumangang to the port of Rajin was destroyed in the 1950s. Throughout the 1990s, the state of the railroad deteriorated sharply due to the economic crisis in Russia. By 1996, North Korea owed $20 million to the Russian railway operator, Russian Railways. This debt had accumulated over the previous 5 years as North Korea seized and used Russian train cars that were in North Korea. The situation led to the Ministry of Railways of Russia issuing a directive forbidding the passage of trains from Khasan to North Korea, effectively isolating North Korea from the Russian market. The crisis was resolved in September 1996, when North Korea agreed to pay $26 million of the debt.James Moltz, The North Korean Nuclear Program: Security, Strategy and New Perspectives from Russia, 1999 Reconstruction At the beginning of the 21st century the situation improved, and capital investments were made to improve and modernize the railway system in the area. The rail station got a new roof in 2002, and the railroad bed was raised, using crushed stones, in 2002/3. Vladivostok News, Khasan station dreams of revival, October 25, 2002 In 2001, Russian Railways laid a fiber optic link from Ussuriysk to Khasan railway station, which made it possible to connect Khasan to the unified data system of the trains in the Far East.Russian Telecom Newslatter, by Hui Pan, September 2001 In April 2008, Russia and North Korea signed a long-awaited deal to rebuild the railway line to North Korea. Under the deal, the two countries will renovate the rail line from Russia's border town of Khasan to the North Korean port of Rajin, where sea cargo to and from South Korea could be unloaded. To implement the project, the Russian Railways Trading House and the Port of Rajin set up a joint venture. It will ensure investments in the project, as well as employing contractors for design and construction work. The joint venture is to last 49 years, with 70 percent of the shares belonging to Russia and 30 percent to North Korea.Reuters, 24/04/2008 Russian railwaymen began renovating the Khasan-Rajin railway section in October 2008,Itar Tass, october 4, 2008 and a demonstration train ran on the Rajin-Khasan route in October 2011. By the following February, a new dual gauge with the length of 32 kilometres has been laid at the Rajin-Khasan section, complete overhaul of 20 kilometres of the tracks has been made, railroad switches and tracks were installed, a number of stations reconstructed, the work in the tunnels was started, trunk telecommunication lines and electrical interlocking lines were stretched and drainage structures restored.\\"34 DPRK specialists to be trained in centres of Far East Railway\\", ITAR Tass, February 21, 2012.

Due to its sheltered and southerly location, it contains lesser seasonal swings than northerly inland areas. As typical of this area of the world, the East Asian monsoon in summer and the Siberian High in winter are the main drivers of the local climate, resulting in wet and humid and also warm to hot summers. August temperatures are around in terms of mean temperatures, bordering on a hot- summer subtype of the climate type (K√∂ppen climate classification Dwa). This is followed by cold and dry winters.

It stands in a block surrounded by Victoria Street, Crosshall Street, Whitechapel, and Peter Street. After it closed as a warehouse it was converted into a conservation centre for National Museums Liverpool in the 1990s. Initially its exhibition area was open to the public, but this closed in 2010. The centre is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The warehouse was built as a depot for the storage of railway freight in 1872 for the Midland Railway. It was designed by the local architect Henry Sumners of Culshaw and Sumners. The building was extended along Peter Street in 1878 in a similar architectural style. Between 1995 and 1996 it was converted by another local architect, Ken Martin, into the Conservation Centre for National Museums Liverpool. In addition to its conservation work, the centre had an exhibition area open to the public to demonstrate the techniques of conservation, which attracted 60,000 visitors a year. In September 2005 the centre closed for refurbishment, and re-opened in June 2006 as the National Conservation Centre. Because of government cuts in funding, the visitor centre closed in 2010, but conservation work continues in the building. Architecture The centre is constructed in red brick on a rusticated stone plinth, with stone dressings and bands, and some decoration in blue brick. The exterior of the building is expressed as three or four storeys, and around the top of the building is a cornice with modillions. The hipped roof is in slate. On each of the four sides are arched openings large enough to admit freight. The front on Crosshall Street is concave; it is in eight bays, each bay consisting of a tall blind arch containing windows, two of which also have arched entrances. On the Victoria Street front are carved spandrels containing shields and the names of stations of the Midland Railway. In 1921 Charles Reilly, Professor of Architecture at the University of Liverpool, was of the opinion that at the time it was \\"one of the best buildings in the town\\". On 14 March 1975, it was designated as a Grade II listed building.

Fewer than 150,000 mature individuals are left in the wild, but the population is currently thought to be increasing. In 1980s and 1990s, they had become endangered due to massive illegal poaching. They are hunted for their extremely soft, light and warm underfur which is usually obtained after death. This underfur, known as shahtoosh (a Persian word meaning \\"king of fine wools\\"), is used to weave luxury shawls. Shahtoosh shawls were traditionally given as wedding gifts in India and it takes the underfur of three to five adult antelopes to make one shawl. Despite strict controls on trade of shahtoosh products and CITES listing, there is still demand for these luxury items. Within India, shawls are worth $1,000-$5,000, internationally the price can reach as high as $20,000. Classification The Tibetan antelope is the sole species in the genus Pantholops, named after the Greek for \\"all antelope\\". It was formerly classified in the Antilopinae subfamily, but morphological and molecular evidence led to it being placed in its own subfamily, Pantholopinae, closely allied to goat-antelopes of the subfamily Caprinae. However, this has been disputed, and some authors consider the Tibetan antelope to be a true member of the Caprinae. Although the genus Pantholops is currently monotypic, a fossil species, P. hundesiensis, is known from the Pleistocene of Tibet. It was slightly smaller than the living species, with a narrower skull. In addition, the fossil genus Qurliqnoria, from the Miocene of China, is thought to be an early member of the Pantholopinae, which diverged from the goat- antelopes around this time. Description Tibetan antelope in the 226x226px The Tibetan antelope is a medium-sized antelope, with a shoulder height of about in males, and in females. Males are significantly larger than females, weighing about , compared with , and can also be readily distinguished by the presence of horns and by black stripes on the legs, both of which the females lack. The coat is pale fawn to reddish-brown, with a whitish belly, and is particularly thick and woolly. The face is almost black in colour, with prominent nasal swellings that have a paler colour in males. In general, the colouration of males becomes more intense during the annual rut, with the coat becoming much paler, almost white, contrasting with the darker patterns on the face and legs. The males have long, curved-back horns that typically measure in length. The horns are slender, with ring-like ridges on their lower portions and smooth, pointed, tips. Although the horns are relatively uniform in length, there is some variation in their exact shape, so the distance between the tips can be quite variable, ranging from . Unlike caprines, the horns do not grow throughout life. The ears are short and pointed, and the tail is also relatively short, at around in length. The fur of Tibetan antelopes is distinctive, and consists of long guard hairs and a silky undercoat of shorter fibres. The individual guard hairs are thicker than those of other goats, with unusually thin walls, and have a unique pattern of cuticular scales, said to resemble the shape of a benzene ring. Distribution and habitat Endemic to the Tibetan Plateau, the Tibetan antelope inhabits open alpine and cold steppe environments between elevation. They prefer flat, open terrain, with sparse vegetation cover. They are found almost entirely in China, where they inhabit Tibet, southern Xinjiang, and western Qinghai; a few are also found across the border in Ladakh, India. The westernmost population of Tibetan antelope is in Depsang Plains, where they are found at altitudes of up to 5500m. Today, the majority are found within the Chang Tang Nature Reserve of northern Tibet. The first specimens to be described, in 1826, were from Nepal; the species has apparently since been extirpated from the region. No subspecies are recognised. Zhuonai Lake (Âçì‰πÉÊπñ) in Hoh Xil is known as a calving ground for the Tibetan antelope.http://www.qhnews.com/kkxl/system/2011/07/13/010410737.shtml A special adaptation of the species to its high altitude habitat is the retention of the fetal version of hemoglobin even in adult animals, which provides higher oxygen affinity. The Tibetan antelope is the only species of mammal where this adaptation has been documented. Behaviour Head details Tibetan antelope feed on forbs, grasses, and sedges, often digging through the snow to obtain food in winter. Their natural predators include wolves, lynx, and snow leopards, and red foxes are known to prey on young calves. Tibetan antelope are gregarious, sometimes congregating in herds hundreds strong when moving between summer and winter pastures, although they are more usually found in much smaller groups, with no more than 20 individuals. The females migrate up to yearly to calving grounds in the summer, where they usually give birth to a single calf, and rejoin the males at the wintering grounds in late autumn. Reproduction The rutting season lasts from November to December. Males form harems of up to 12 females, although one to four is more common, and drive off other males primarily by making displays or chasing them with head down, rather than sparring directly with their horns. Courtship and mating are both brief, without most of the behaviour typically seen in other antelope species, although males do commonly skim the thighs of females with a kick of their fore legs. Mothers give birth to a single calf in June or July, after a gestation period of about six months. The calves are precocial, being able to stand within 15 minutes of birth. They are fully grown within 15 months, and reach sexual maturity during their second or third year. Although females may remain with their mothers until they themselves give birth, males leave within 12 months, by which time their horns are beginning to grow. Males determine status by their relative horn length, with the maximum length being achieved at around three and a half years of age. Although the lifespan of Tibetan antelopes is not known with certainty, since so few have been kept in captivity, it is probably around 10 years. Conservation The antelope are killed for their wool, which is woven into the luxury fabric shahtoosh, threatening the species‚Äô survival. Since 1979, Tibetan antelope has had legal protection under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Killing, harming or trading in the animal is illegal worldwide, as more than 160 countries are CITES signatories. It also used to be listed as Endangered by the World Conservation Union and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service due to commercial poaching for their underwool, competition with local domesticated herds, and the development of their rangeland for gold mining. Tibetan antelopes' underfur (down hair), being extremely soft, fine and warm, is known as shahtoosh and has traditionally been woven by craftsmen and women in Kashmir into shawls in high demand in India as girls' dowry and in Europe as a symbol of wealth and status. Such demands resulted in massive illegal poaching in the second half of the 20th century. In consequence, the population of this species has suffered a severe decline from nearly a million (estimated) at the turn of the 20th century to less than 75,000 in the 1990s. Although formerly affected by poaching, it is now among the best safeguarded wildlife in the Tibetan Plateau, thanks to effective conservation efforts by the Chinese government since late 1990s. A 2009 assessment estimated an increased population of 150,000. The struggle to stop illegal antelope hunting was portrayed in the 2004 film, Kekexili: Mountain Patrol. In September 2016, Tibetan antelop has been reclassified on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list from Endangered to Near Threatened due to the increased population. To develop testing for shahtoosh, a Hong Kong chemist and a senior forensic specialist looked at the material though a microscope. Using this method, they discovered shahtoosh contains coarser guard hairs unique to the species. By doing this, the duo had found a convenient way to prove this was poached material. In July 2006, the Chinese government inaugurated a new railway that bisects the chiru's feeding grounds on its way to Lhasa, the Tibetan capital. In an effort to avoid harm to the animal, 33 special animal migration passages have been built beneath the railway. However, the railway will bring many more people, including potential poachers, closer to Tibetan antelope's breeding grounds and habitat. On 22 February 2008, The Wall Street Journal Online reported China's state-run news agency, Xinhua, issued a public apology for publishing a doctored photograph of Tibetan antelope running near the Qinghai-Tibet railway. Liu Weiqing, a 41-year-old photographer, was identified as the author of the work. He had reportedly camped on the Tibetan plateau since March 2007, as part of a series by the Daqing Evening News, to raise awareness regarding the Tibetan bovid. He was also under contract to provide images to Xinhua. He has since resigned from Daqing Evening News. Despite the impression given by the faked photo, the antelope are getting used to the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, according to a letter to Nature on 17 April 2008, from researchers of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In the Karakoram regions of Pakistan-administered Kashmir it is listed as an endangered species.

Writing and recording Mitchell wrote \\"A Case of You\\" in or before 1970. As with many of the songs on her album Blue, her breakup with Graham Nash is often cited as the inspiration for it. It is also claimed that it is about Leonard Cohen. She performed the song at the Amchitka Greenpeace benefit concert in October 1970. She recorded the song in 1971, and it was released on the 1971 album Blue with Mitchell playing Appalachian dulcimer, accompanied by James Taylor on acoustic guitar, which was tuned to standard tuning, (EADGBE), although there are cover versions played in an open G tuning (DGDGBD). Mitchell's earliest public performances of \\"A Case of You\\" contain six lines that had changed by the time Blue was recorded. The line \\"I am as constant as a northern star\\" is an allusion to Caesar's \\"I am constant as the Northern Star\\" from the Shakespeare play Julius Caesar, while the quoted line \\"Love is touching souls\\" is inspired by the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke.Chiasson, Dan (October 2, 2017). Touching Souls: Joni Mitchell‚Äôs lessons in love The New Yorker. \\"A Case of You\\" was also released as the B-side of \\"California\\". Additional recordings and performances Mitchell later re-recorded the song for her live album Miles of Aisles (1974), as well as her orchestral album Both Sides Now (2000). She performed it regularly on her 1983 tour. The original recording was included on Mitchell's compilation Misses (1996). Awards and accolades In 2011 Mitchell was voted the No. 1 female artist and \\"A Case of You\\" the No. 1 female song by listeners of BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. Cover versions There are well over 300 known recordings of \\"A Case of You\\". The band Sloan covered the song for the 1992 tribute album Back to the Garden; the cover was released as a single. Tori Amos covered the song as a B-side for the UK single of \\"Cornflake Girl\\" in 1994. Prince played the song throughout his career. He played it in 1983 during the First Avenue performance where the album versions of \\"Purple Rain\\" and several other tracks from the Purple Rain album were recorded. A recording of the song from that year was released on his posthumous album Piano & A Microphone 1983. He recorded a version, retitled \\"A Case of U\\", for his 2002 album, One Nite Alone..., which he dedicated to his father John L. Nelson, who died in August 2001. His rendition was also included on the 2007 tribute album A Tribute to Joni Mitchell. Jane Monheit covered the song for her 2001 album Come Dream with Me. Diana Krall covered the song on her 2001 album Live in Paris. k.d. lang covered the song on her 2004 album Hymns of the 49th Parallel, a tribute to her favourite Canadian songwriters. Julia Murney covered the song on her 2006 album I‚Äôm Not Waiting. Michelle Branch covered the song for the 2009 covers album Covered, A Revolution in Sound. The English singer/songwriter James Blake covered Mitchell's song for his EP Enough Thunder (2011). Samples of the cover were then used in the tracks \\"Tep and the Logic\\" and \\"You Know Your Youth\\", which appeared on the deluxe edition of his eponymous debut album. In 2012 the Portuguese singer Ana Moura recorded a cover version for her album Desfado produced by Mitchell's former husband and producer Larry Klein. In 2013 James Wolpert performed \\"A Case of You\\" during the Live Playoffs of The Voice. His cover reached the Top 10 of the iTunes Top 200 Singles Chart. Other notable versions were performed by Rebekah Smarin (2014), Madi Davis (2015), Troy Ramey (2017), and Addison Agen (2017). Kina Grannis released a cover on her Youtube channel. In 2014 English singer/songwriter Gabrielle Aplin recorded a cover version for her English Rain EP. A version of \\"A Case Of You\\" is part of the final track on Salvador Sobral's Excuse Me Ao Vivo album. In 2019, Brandi Carlile covered the song during a concert at The Garden. Soundtrack appearances The song appears in the films Truly, Madly, Deeply, Practical Magic and Waking the Dead. Mitchell declined, however, to grant permission to use the song in the 2013 film A Case of You. The song was both referenced and featured in a 1996 episode of the medical drama Chicago Hope, in which Dr. Diane Grad (Jayne Brook) mentions that Mitchell's Blue album was a personal favorite of hers while growing up, and that \\"A Case of You\\" was her favorite song on the album. Mitchell's recording of the song later played over the episode's closing credits. In 2013 the song was featured in \\"In Dreams Begin Responsibilities\\", the fourth episode of the fifth season of NBC's Parenthood. One of the main characters, Drew, is pursuing a girl who mentions she loves the song. Drew tries to learn as much about Joni Mitchell as he can, only to find out that the girl only knows \\"A Case Of You\\" because it was in a movie.

It was the third story he wrote, and the first to be published. Written in July 1938 when Asimov was 18, it was rejected by Astounding Science Fiction in August, then accepted in October by Amazing Stories, appearing in the March 1939 issue. Asimov first included it in his 1968 story collection Asimov's Mysteries, and subsequently in the 1973 collection The Best of Isaac Asimov. Plot summary \\"Marooned off Vesta\\" tells the story of three men who survive the wreck of the spaceship Silver Queen in the asteroid belt and find themselves trapped in orbit around the asteroid of Vesta. They have at their disposal three airtight rooms, one spacesuit, three days' worth of air, a week's supply of food, and a year's supply of water. They are initially despondent about their impending suffocation until one of the men is inspired to melt a hole in the water tank. This begins to propel them towards Vesta, where a small community of humans lives. The story accurately portrays the physics and experiences involved with being in space, a theme that often re- emerges in Asimov's later works. Sequel In 1958, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the story's appearance, Asimov wrote a sequel titled \\"Anniversary\\", set twenty years after the original. Both stories appeared in the March 1959 issue of Amazing Stories and later in the collection Asimov's Mysteries. Reception Reviewing an anthology including the story, Algis Budrys said \\"'Marooned off Vesta' was indeed Ike's first sale. His first story came several attempts later\\". He also described \\"Anniversary\\" as \\"a badly contrived stunt\\". Asimov wrote in 1973, \\"Far be it from me to crave indulgence, but I think it is important to understand that at the time I wrote and sold the story (in 1938) I was eighteen years old\\".

Membership in the Convention is open to all churches that \\"willingly seek to implement\\" the principles and practices of the IBC Constitution. Over 70 churches in 27 countries (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates) are affiliated with the International Baptist Convention. Possessing an ecumenical outlook, most of the IBC churches cooperate with other Baptist bodies in their respective countries. The IBC also partners with International Baptist Church Ministries, a non-profit corporation headquartered in Richardson, Texas. History The International Baptist Convention has its roots in the Association of Baptists in Continental Europe (ABCE) and mission work by the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC). Two Baptist churches in Germany--Immanuel Baptist Church in Wiesbaden and Bethel International Baptist Church in Frankfurt--formed the ABCE circa 1959. Beginning in 1961, the Foreign Mission Board of the SBC sent a missionary couple to work with these churches. Some churches from England joined the ABCE in 1964, and the name was changed to the European Baptist Convention (EBC). The first EBC churches were started to minister to United States military personnel stationed in Europe. The name was changed to International Baptist Convention after the body expanded outside Europe. Beliefs Churches of the International Baptist Convention hold as important the following beliefs--the triune Godhead, Jesus Christ as the only savior, the Bible as the inspired Word of God, personal faith in Christ, the priesthood of all believers, baptism by immersion for believers only and religious liberty.

It was first published in the October 1951 issue of Galaxy Magazine and later appeared in Asimov's collections Nightfall and Other Stories (1969) and The Best of Isaac Asimov (1973). One of the few Asimov stories that feature aliens, the story deals with a group of people imprisoned by an alien race when their spaceship is captured. The emphasis of the story is on the interactions and group psychology of the prisoners, all of whom have differing backgrounds and motivations. An argument between Asimov and the editor Horace L. Gold over this story was the inspiration for Asimov's story \\"The Monkey's Finger\\". Plot summary During Earth's first interstellar war, a civilian transport traveling to Earth is captured by the Kloros, a chlorine-breathing race of intelligent beings. The ship is commandeered by two Kloros along with six human civilians as prisoners of war. The humans fall into argument and dispute, some coming to blows, with contradictory feelings on what should be done. Opinions range from a violent counteroffensive to a passive acceptance of their situation. Stuart, who has previously spent time as a guest of the Kloros, where he was provided with prosthetic hands when his own were damaged in an accident, posits that the Kloros are masters of chemistry (thus easily able to maintain an atmosphere and provide food for the captives) but less proficient at engineering, hence prefer to steal human ships to use in the war. Only Mullen, a shy, mild- mannered, short bookkeeper, is willing to make an attempt to take back control of the ship, which he does by exiting via the C-Chute (short for \\"casualty chute\\", normally used for launching corpses for burial in space) and entering the control room via the navigational steam-tubes. He successfully kills the two Kloros by spraying them with oxygen. As an unlikely hero, Mullen admits that he was not motivated by bravery, anger, or fear, but by homesickness for Earth (specifically his hometown, Richmond, Virginia), where he has not returned for 17 years, and that he could not face the prospect of waiting out the war in captivity when on the cusp of returning home. Notes Asimov wrote \\"C-Chute\\" at the start of what he in 1973 called his \\"'mature' period\\", when he \\"was full of self-confidence\\" from having earned his PhD, working as a professor at Boston University School of Medicine\\", publishing three books, and being no longer dependent on Astounding Science Fiction for his fiction. \\"C-Chute\\" was adapted for radio in the anthology series X Minus One, first broadcast on February 8, 1956.

In In Memory Yet Green, Asimov wrote that his motive in writing the story was to deliberately test whether one could do anything in science fiction, so he invented a society in which mother love was considered obscene.

The book tells about a time when children used to learn in a group of the same age of students in large schools that were not merely designated rooms in private houses as in the year 2157. Margie and Tommy discuss what it must have been like to study together with a real person as a teacher, and though at first Margie is skeptical about the notion, by the end of the story she daydreams while sitting on the chair before the mechanical teacher about what it must have been like for 'the fun they had'.

Plot summary Three astronomers, who have been working on the Moon, Mercury and the asteroid Ceres, meet for the first time in ten years at a convention on Earth. They also meet a former colleague of theirs, Romero Villiers, who had to stay on Earth because of illness. Villiers claims to have invented a mass- transference/teleportation device, but dies under suspicious circumstances before he can demonstrate the device to his friends. Another scientist who has seen the device demonstrated suspects that Villiers has been murdered by one of his classmates, and he questions them. In the course of his investigation, a photographic record of a research paper by Villiers describing his theory is discovered on a windowsill of the room, but is found to have been ruined through exposure to sunlight. When none of the suspects admits any guilt, Wendell Urth, an eccentric scientist who has had success in investigating crimes, is brought in. He identifies the guilty astronomer as the one who has been on Mercury. The key lies in the idea (at the time of writing believed to be true) that Mercury has one face always pointing away from the Sun. The guilty party had hidden the film in what he thought was a safe place because he subconsciously expected the night to last forever. Since the story was written, it has been discovered that Mercury is not tidally locked (a fact Asimov noted when the story appeared in subsequent anthologies printed after this advance in scientific knowledge). A Mercurian sidereal day is 58.6 Earth days long, while its solar day is as much as 176 days, due to a 3:2 spin resonance compared to its year at 88 days. References to other stories In this story, the motive for murder was the teleportation device. Asimov noted that in his other Wendell Urth story, \\"The Singing Bell\\", travel by teleportation was regarded as routine. He dismissed this inconsistency with his favorite epithet, \\"Emerson!\\", a reference to Ralph Waldo Emerson's dictum \\"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.\\" In-universe, the inconsistency can possibly be explained by Romero's invention actually being a way to teleport living beings, since in \\"The Singing Bell\\" the teleportation is only used for transporting inert cargo (with humans taking regular transport), while Romero explicitly states he managed to teleport a mouse. Teleportation and FTL transportation are shown to be a more difficult task with living beings than inert cargo in numerous works of science fiction, including Asimov's own short story \\"Risk\\".

It was first published in the March 1959 issue of Amazing Stories and subsequently appeared in the collections Asimov's Mysteries (1968) and The Best of Isaac Asimov (1973). The story was written for the twentieth anniversary of Asimov's first published story, \\"Marooned off Vesta\\", in the March 1939 issue of Amazing. The magazine reprinted the earlier story with the new one, and he feared that someone would write a letter stating that the earlier's writing was better, but no one did. The story is also part of a loosely connected series of stories by Asimov about the supercomputer Multivac. Plot summary Warren Moore and Mark Brandon are two of the three survivors of the wreck of the Silver Queen in the asteroid belt. Every year, they meet on the anniversary of the disaster to celebrate their survival. On the 20th anniversary, Brandon has a surprise: he appears at Moore's house with Michael Shea, the third survivor. As the three men reminisce, Brandon admits that he is unhappy with the way their fame has faded over the years. Even though the three are still the only people ever to survive a spaceship wreck, the public has forgotten them. The only thing the general public remember about the wreck of the Silver Queen is that Dr. Horace Quentin, a great scientist, was killed. When Shea mentions that Trans-space Insurance is still searching for wreckage from the ship, 20 years later, it occurs to Brandon that there must have been something extremely valuable on board, and that Trans-space still hasn't found it. The three men learn via Moore's Multivac terminal that Quentin had a prototype of a revolutionary new invention with him on the ship, and that it is still missing. The only clue is the description of the device as \\"an opticon\\", an apparent reference to a light- manipulating device. Moore realizes that he has had the device all along, having idly picked it up as a souvenir during his spacewalk, and that its actual name is \\"anopticon\\", meaning a device without lenses. An apparently useless tube a few inches long, it seems to employ force-fields instead of conventional optics and can be used as a powerful microscope or telescope. The potential applications of the technology could be even broader. With Quentin's device in their possession, the three men will once again become famous. In the first story, the irony was that the men were in orbit around Vesta with no source of motive power and limited food and air but a year's supply of water. They find a way to use the water as a makeshift rocket in order to reach Vesta, and on the way down they make a toast: \\"Here's to the year's supply of water we used to have.\\" At the end of this story, they change the toast to \\"Here's to the Silver Queen souvenirs we used to have.\\" Story notes Asimov notes in his comments on the story that Moore picking up the device had been a throwaway line he included in the original \\"Marooned Off Vesta\\".

From the very start, Vaisala was an international business, exporting 95 percent of the production. As the Vaisala radiosonde became internationally renowned, the demand for them increased. In 1944, Prof. V√§is√§l√§ established a company called Mittari Oy (\\"Gauge Incorporated\\") and set up manufacturing facilities for radiosonde systems. The first sounding system included a semi-automatic radiosonde receiver, a calibration device and a ground check set. The company employed 13 people at the time. Later, in 1955, the name of Mittari was changed to Vaisala. From a modest start, the company evolved to become a world leader in many measurement fields and to establish a noteworthy Finnish export industry. At the end of 1954 a modern manufacturing plant was relocated in Vantaa. Since then, the headquarters have been expanded several times and Vaisala's product range has been diversified and expanded greatly. Nowadays Vaisala employs over 1,800 people and serves customers in over 150 countries.Vaisala's History website =Commercial production since 1936= After the first sounding, V√§is√§l√§ continued with further development and tests until a radiosonde could be brought into commercial production. Radiosonde deliveries started with the RS11 (1936‚Äì). Amongst its first customers was the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1937, V√§is√§l√§'s radiosonde won a gold medal at the World Fair in Paris. =Recovering from the wars= World War II, the Finnish Winter War 1939‚Äì1940 and the Finnish Continuation War 1941‚Äì1944, disrupted many lives and upset business and delivery activities internationally. The post-war decades witnessed a strenuous effort to revive the national and international economies. Vaisala grew to employ 60 people in 1954. The first issue of Vaisala News magazine was published in 1959. Thanks to major product development efforts, during the 1950s and 1960s the Vaisala Sounding System became completely electronic, the first automatic radiosonde receiver and the world's first fully transistorized radiosonde RS13 (1965‚Äì) were introduced, and the first weather satellite image receiver was delivered. Yrj√∂ Toivola took over as the Managing Director of the company when Professor Vilho V√§is√§l√§ died in 1969. =Vigorous 70s and& 80s= The 1970s and 1980s were busy decades for Vaisala. Thin-film technology was developed for Vaisala HUMICAP¬Æ relative humidity sensors - the first in the world. The Vaisala CORA Automatic Sounding System - along with automatic weather stations, road weather stations and aviation weather systems - was introduced. In 1975, Vaisala employed over 200 people. During the 1980s, numerous new offices were established to ensure the company's ability to serve customers worldwide - in the UK, Japan, USA, Germany, and Australia. A traffic weather company was also acquired in the UK. Vaisala's first cleanroom was built to enable the design and manufacture of semiconductors in-house. Vaisala BAROCAP¬Æ barometric pressure sensor technology was introduced, as well as a new radiosonde family - the Vaisala Radiosonde RS80 (1981‚Äì2008). These units made use of a water activated wet battery that had a very long storage life and high power density but a limited working life. The Professor Vilho V√§is√§l√§ Award was established in cooperation with the WMO, to stimulate interest in meteorological research involving meteorological observation methods and instruments. The radiosondes have also been used in many upper air ozone research studies using an attached detector that had the sensor data multiplexed with the standard meteorology dataset. GPS positioning information was added to gain more accurate wind speed information. =New millennium= CEO Pekka Ketonen was appointed in 1992. The company was listed on the Helsinki Exchanges in 1994. By then, it employed over 600 people. Further product developments included the introduction of GPS technology for upper air wind measurement, the Vaisala CARBOCAP CO2 sensor, and Vaisala DRYCAP sensor technology for industrial dewpoint measurement. New offices were established in France and China, and business acquisitions in aviation weather and surface weather further enhanced Vaisala's presence in the USA. Vaisala RS92-SGPD (left) and its successor, the RS41-SGP (right). The new millennium was kicked off with yet more business acquisitions - in wind profiling, lightning detection and aviation weather. U.S. manufacturing operations were concentrated in Boulder, Colorado. New product launches included a new radiosonde product family - the Vaisala Radiosonde RS92 (2003 - in production), as well as the Vaisala Weather Transmitter, which measures the six most essential weather parameters in one compact instrument. This was much improved from the previous generation device and now included consumer cells to make up the battery due to energy saving techniques. CEO Ketonen retired October 1, 2006. Vaisala's board of directors appointed Kjell Fors√©n the new company CEO. Fors√©n last served as president of Ericsson Finland before joining Vaisala on September 18, 2006. Vaisala technology has played a part in space exploration for some 60 years, for instance the Mars Rover Curiosity and Schiaparelli EDM lander contain pressure and humidity sensors manufactured by Vaisala. With new developments in miniaturization, communications and sensors a new radiosonde the model RS41 (2014 - in production) was announced. This model had again made improvements in specifications. Launch preparation made simple with the RI41 ground check device. It is smaller and has pre-flight dry-point humidity sensor calibration achieved by heating the sensor to drive off contaminants. It is also available in a model (RS41-SG) without a pressure sensor, the pressure reading is derived from the GPS altitude, temperature and humidity readings.

It appeared in Asimov's 1968 collection Asimov's Mysteries, in his 1973 collection The Best of Isaac Asimov, in his 1986 collection Robot Dreams and in The Complete Stories, Vol. 2. Plot summary An example of what Asimov called his \\"late style,\\" the story is a journalist's recollection of the events surrounding the discovery of an anti-gravity device in the mid-21st century. Heavy with physics theory, the story describes the relationship between the creator of the device, the billionaire inventor Edward Bloom, and his former classmate James Priss, a Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist who had discovered most of the theory that made the device possible. The men are expert billiards players and bitter rivals. Challenged to execute a shot on a table which is equipped with the device, Priss sends a ball on a complicated trajectory, which finishes when it enters the device's field. At that point the ball vanishes and Bloom collapses, dead. There is a mysterious hole drilled completely through his chest. Central to the story is the concept of a pure anti-gravity machine that turns out to be a perpetual motion machine of the first order. Energy can be freely created in a volume of space time which is pulled \\"flat,\\" as defined within the Theory of Relativity as determined by Albert Einstein. However, this field possesses remarkable properties, which are the centerpiece of the story: any object which enters the field is reduced to zero mass, and hence must assume the speed of light. There is also the unprovable speculation as to whether Priss knew, from his own theory and the nature of the blue glow produced by the field (possibly due to Cherenkov radiation), what would happen, and if he then directed the ball in such a way as to kill Bloom. Asimov himself had some reservations about the name of the story, and noted that his friend Frederik Pohl's suggested title of \\"Dirty Pool\\" was far better than his own. The story retains its title despite the feeling of its author, as he preferred to remain consistent.

After having received many requests to continue the story of detective Elijah Baley and his robot partner R. Daneel Olivaw, featured in his earlier novels The Caves of Steel and The Naked Sun, Asimov wrote this short detective story. After the story appeared, he received many letters from readers stating \\"Thanks, but we mean a novel\\". Plot summary Baley is unexpectedly contacted by Daneel regarding a dispute between two reputable Spacers on board a ship, who have just submitted essentially identical papers about a revolutionary mathematical technique. Each claims they originated the idea, and approached the other for confirmation only to have them steal the concept and pass it off as their own. Neither will admit guilt and it would reflect badly on the ship's captain not to resolve the authorship prior to arrival at the planet where the papers are to be presented. Daneel suggests Baley, an unbiased outsider, to the desperate captain. Both Spacers have personal robots, who happen to be the same model from the same production batch, and were privy to the discussion between the mathematicians in exactly the same way. The robots' accounts of the dispute are, like their masters' stories, mirror images of each other, apart from the fact that one robot must be telling the truth and one is lying to protect its master's reputation. Being Spacers, neither scientist will speak to an Earthman, but they do allow Baley to unofficially interview their personal robots via telepresence. Both robots respond identically to Baley's questioning, stating they would lie to protect a human's reputation, until he capitalizes on the single difference between the parties: one is elderly and towards the end of his distinguished career, while the other, though brilliant has yet to establish himself fully. He puts to the younger mathematician's robot that his master could still rebuild his reputation, but the elder's would be completely overshadowed by an indiscretion in his old age. In contrast, he puts to the older mathematician's robot that his master's reputation would remain and speak for itself, but the younger's would be completely ruined by an indiscretion of his youth. The younger's robot switches his story to protect the elder man, while the elder's robot tries to maintain the elder is innocent, but ends up malfunctioning. Baley has tried to convince both robots to change their stories. He thus surmises that the elder is the plagiarist, because if the younger's robot received no instruction to lie, it could easily switch sides; while if the elder's robot had been instructed to lie, but became convinced that it should now tell the truth, it could not easily countermand the order of its own volition when only a reputation and not a human life was at risk, and this has led to conflict and shutdown. R. Daneel reports that Baley is correct as the captain has extracted a confession, but points out that Baley not being a robopsychologist, his argument could be applied in reverse ‚Äì a robot might easily override an instruction to lie if compelled to tell the truth, while a truth-telling robot might malfunction if convinced it should lie. Baley agrees that it could have gone either way, but the result matches his original suspicion that a younger man coming up with a new idea would easily consult someone he had revered and studied, whereas an older man would be unlikely to consult an \\"upstart\\" when he was about to arrive at a conference of his peers, and he only used the robot's response an his interpretation of it to force a confession from the elder mathematician.

In 1947, Klara moved to Moscow and on the first attempt she entered VGIK, where she studied at the course of Sergei Gerasimov and Tamara Makarova. In childhood and adolescence, Klara had a completely different voice, a contralto. The ability to speak with her famous children's voice, she found only in her student years after a serious illness. Klara, like all the students of VGIK, toured with concerts on the Moscow Oblast and once she was very cold and almost died of croupous inflammation of the lungs. After lying in the hospital for more than a month, Klara lost her voice. The continued study at the VGIK was in jeopardy. Sergei Gerasimov showed her to a phoniatrician, but he explained that Klara has very rare vocal cords and he does not guarantee that she will be able to properly practice vocal after recovery. For half a year Gerasimov forbade Rumyanova to talk even in a whisper, and they communicated through writing. When her voice recovered, Rumyanova suddenly discovered that she could now speak in a very high voice, which came to be familiar to millions of moviegoers. In 1953, Klara graduated from VGIK and became an actress of the National Film Actors' Theatre. As a student she started acting in film, her cinematic debut took place as an episodic role in the film The Rural Doctor (1951), by the same Gerasimov. However, in the future Klara played only supporting or episodic roles, never playing the main ones. Her notable roles were in the films The Rural Doctor (Lena), They Were the First (Varya), Four (nurse), Life first (Zoya), Resurrection (Bogodukhovskaya), Time, Forward! (Lushka), The Twelve Chairs (the wife of Father Fyodor). Gradually, she was less likely to be offered roles, and she practically stopped filming, which was allegedly caused by a conflict with Ivan Pyryev. For six years (from 1965 to 1970), Klara Rumyanova did not act in film at all, until the Minister of Culture Ekaterina Furtseva dismissed Pyryev from the post of the general director. A year before his death, Pyryev phoned Rumyanova and apologized to her for her behavior. For the first time, Klara applied her \\"children's\\" voice in her debut film The Rural Doctor, where she played a woman in childbirth. While the scene was being prepared, the baby, who was supposed to represent the newborn, fell asleep, and at first could not awaken him for a long time, and then it was found that it was impossible to make him cry. Then Klara volunteered herself on the set to voice the scene. After that, Rumyanova secretly became famous at the whole Mosfilm, as an actress, able to scream in any child's voice, so that, she combined acting in film and voicing, where her voice was often used for young children. Then she began to receive the first invitations from the film studio Soyuzmultfilm, but Klara rejected them, considering her acting potential as higher than merely voicing cartoons. However, she was rarely invited to act in feature films which eventually forced her to do voice work. Her debut in animation was the cartoon The Wonderful Garden (1962). Gradually during this period, Klara began to cooperate more actively with Soyuzmultfilm, and as a result, at a time when she was no longer shooting, she became very popular as an actress and began to record on the radio and perform on the stage with children's songs and romances. Klara Rumyanova became the only actress of the USSR, awarded the honorary title \\"Honored Artist of the RSFSR\\" for her work in animation. Despite this, she was very worried because she could not play in live action film, because she always considered herself a dramatic actress. After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent economic crisis, Rumyanova, like many actors, gradually became unemployed (she was dismissed from the National Film Actors' Theatre) and only occasionally took part in the recording of audio and audio concerts and the production of radio plays. However, even during this period, she was very selective ‚Äì the general director of the studio \\"VOX-Records\\" Viktor Truhan recalled that Rumyanova basically refused to record for audio advertising. Without work, she wrote several plays, in 2000 she published the book \\"My Name is a Woman\\" ‚Äì an author's collection of her plays about significant female characters of Russian history (Nadezhda Durova, Yekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova, Evdokiya Rostopchina). Klara negatively spoke about Gorbachev's perestroika, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the policies of President Yeltsin, remained a convinced supporter of communism for the rest of her life. She died at the age of 74 on 18 September 2004 in Moscow from breast cancer. She was buried at the Don Cemetery.

After the original founder lost his personal interest in promoting the values and principles of Parkour or Freerunning, four German Parkour athletes took over the brand-name and the official URL www.urbanfreeflow.com to re-emphasize the disciplines' altruistic values and the importance of creating community within the sports. Origins Established in 2003, Urban Freeflow (UF) was founded by Paul Corkery (known as Ez), a former boxer who saw an opportunity to connect the international Parkour community through an online forum. As the first mover, the company managed to be profitable as the momentum of parkour and its popularity grew. The reputation built at this time allowed them to grow to be the most prominent group within the scene at that time. The corporate structure of the group was compromised in 2005 when Companies House dissolved the trading company for failing to meet their statutory filing obligations. At this time, Ez and former partner Mark Toorock (M2) split and Ez formed a new company, Urban Free Flow.http://www.streetstunts.net/wiki/Urban_Freeflow#Controversy Through the companies well established website, although the popular forums have been shut since 2010, the company sold branded clothes, many of which feature the Urban Freeflow trademarked Glyph logo. The Glyph logo today has undergone a rebranding to emphasize the new direction, while maintaining its core attribute - to build community. The Glyph logo had become recognised globally as the symbol of Parkour & Freerunning, yet many voices from within the community justly claimed that Urban Freeflow didn't influence the community as positively as its status had demanded. Today, under a new management, Urban Freeflow is a strong advocate for creating a positive image for Parkour as movement discipline and tool that helps its practitioners to grow stronger, to be more useful in helping others. Criticism Despite having over a million registered users on its website, Urban Freeflow has polarised opinion within the parkour and free-running communities for its self-appointed leadership of the movement and its commercialisation of what many consider to be a grass-roots movement. Due to its position as the largest UK based group, it is the popular choice for new traceurs, thus guaranteeing it a constant stream of new customers. However, many become disillusioned over time, and migrate towards other groups which better represent their ideals. It has been criticized over the years more than any other free running or parkour group. It stems from the fact that they claim to be the \\"Official Worldwide Freerun/Parkour Network\\", while the website is neither multilingual nor affiliated with David Belle, the founder of parkour. UF does however have some affiliation with S√©bastien Foucan, the founder and lead ambassador of freerunning. Worldwide Jam may have also contributed to some of the criticism of Urban Freeflow because of an ongoing feud between UF and Worldwide Jam. Many people in the worldwide parkour community also accused UF of distorting the image of parkour, associating it with the flips and artistic movements of freerunning and tricking. Because of this, in 2006 many UF team members walked out. Some critics have even gone as far as making public demonstrations against Urban Freeflow, such as burning UF memorabilia. Furthermore, Urban Freeflow was criticized for organizing freerunning competitions sponsored by Barclaycard. The critics believed that freerunning, like parkour, should be a non-competitive activity. There are also complaints of the corporate nature of the event, many freerunning sites saying that the introduction of merchandising and sponsorships would compromise the true nature of the sport. To this one of the founders of Urban Freeflow, Ez has replied \\"The people who are saying this are the ones who don't have any sponsorship.\\"The Independent However many people practicing parkour and freerunning believe that they are \\"free\\" disciplines and they don't belong to corporations, sponsors and medias.http://parkournorthamerica.com/plugins/content/content.php?content.21 S√©bastien Foucan has since commented on the matter, that free running is about following your 'own way,' and though he himself does not personally believe in competition, others might believe that to be their 'way.'

Soviet origin Gold Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union The Gold Star was established by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on August 1, 1939. Previously, a Hero of the Soviet Union was awarded the Order of Lenin and a special diploma (gramota, –≥—Ä–∞–º–æ—Ç–∞) describing the heroic feat. The star was introduced to distinguish these heroes from other Order of Lenin recipients. The decree also had provisions for awarding second and third Gold Stars for subsequent heroic deeds. Although it was commonly described as a medal, it was actually a distinctive badge consisting of a gold star hung from a rectangular suspension device with a red ribbon, and was worn on the left, above and apart from all other orders and medals, and always in full. The Gold Star was not normally issued for posthumous awards of the title \\"Hero of the Soviet Union\\". Post- Soviet successors Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the title \\"Hero of the Soviet Union\\" was succeeded by titles and insignia in some of the now- independent states, such as \\"Hero of Belarus\\", \\"Hero of the Russian Federation\\" and \\"Hero of Ukraine\\".

Externally visible changes are the target-style stock, the more vertical thumbhole grip, the free-floated bull barrel, and a muzzle brake. Accurizing is the process of improving the accuracy and precision of a gun (firearm or airgun). For firearms, accuracy is the ability to hit exactly what one is aiming at, and precision is the ability to hit the same place over and over again in a repeatable fashion. Both are the goals of accurizing,\\"Accuracy: Gun, Cartridge, and Shooter\\" by Bob Beers at Chuck Hawks web site which generally concentrates on four different areas: *Usability: Enhancements that give the shooter a firmer and more controlled hold on the firearm, as well as a more consistent trigger pull. Better design ergonomics is often employed, such as adjustable buttstocks and grips with more vertical angles that are natural to the human hand and wrist (e.g. pistol grip). Spirit levels are often mounted to prevent canting, which can vary the points of impact. Weapon mounts such as bipods, monopods, benchrests, shooting sticks or simply sandbags can provide a more stable and relaxed platform for the shooter, and devices such as muzzle brakes or compensators can also be used to help counter the muzzle rise from recoil and re-establish aim faster and more precisely for repeated firing. The use of suitable slings can also help shooters to stabilize their aim when shooting off-hand while standing or squatting. *Tolerances: Parts that better fit together will shift less, or shift more consistently, under recoil. Rifle bedding is one of the most common practices of such accurizing procedure. Adequate screw torque setting between the action and the stock is also important for the overall rigidity of the system. Some companies, such as Savage Arms, have even introduced features like floating bolt head to provide better bolt-breech engagement for more adequate breech seal and headspacing. *Harmonics: The act of firing a gun generates a rapid pressure increase within the barrel bore, causing the barrel to resonate and vibrate in a rope-like fashion. The resultant harmonic oscillations of the barrel affect the terminal phase of the projectile's internal ballistics and in turn the initial status of its external ballistics, and therefore need to be minimized or tuned to limit their effects on accuracy. Generally the harmonic effects are proportional to the square of the barrel length, and so are generally only of concern in long guns such as rifles but not handguns. Some external accessories, called tuners or de-resonators, can also be mounted onto the barrel to alter the harmonic wave pattern so that the node is shifted as near to the muzzle as possible. Airguns have significantly lower barrel pressure, and therefore are far less affected by barrel harmonics than firearms. *Projectile propulsion consistency: In airguns, the inbuilt powerplants themselves provide the propulsive force to the projectile, so tuning the gun alone is usually sufficient for accurizing as long as the projectiles' weights and shapes are uniform. Firearms, however, rely purely on oxidative chemical reaction of the powder within a cartridge to provide propulsive force, and any slight variations in powder load and combustion efficiency will affect the internal ballistics of the gun, even if the projectile weights and shape are the same. This means that in addition to the gun itself, consistent ammunition performance is also extremely critical for accuracy with firearms. While some manufacturers produce match-grade ammunition with smaller tolerances, it is common for shooters of high-precision disciplines to handload and fine-tune their own ammunition. Furthermore, the rapid gas expansion that occurs when the projectile leaves the muzzle also barometrically affects flight behaviour, so muzzle devices such as flash hider and suppressor can also be used to modulate the escaping gas and improve the consistency of shots. The key to an accurate firearm is consistency. Getting everything to happen the same way for every shot is key to producing small groupings, and there are a large number of issues to be addressed in achieving an accurate firearm. The keys to firing an accurate shot are a firm but not overtight grip, the ability to get a good sight picture and a controlled squeeze of the trigger. The ability to manage recoil is also important in heavily recoiling calibers, both to aid in possible additional shots, and to prevent the user from developing a fear of the recoil. group measuring about at , which corresponds to an angular size of about 0.08 mrad (0.26 moa). group size is about double, measuring about at , which corresponds to an angular size of about 0.15 mrad (0.51 moa). Determining accuracy Determining accuracy is not always a straightforward task, as it depends on a large number of variables. =Factors affecting accuracy= The accuracy of a shot relies on many different factors, which can be broken down into three broad categories: the firearm, the cartridge, and the shooter. Accurizing generally refers to the processes that are applied to the firearm. Techniques relating to producing accurate ammunition are covered in internal and external ballistics, and handloading, and just like accurizing a firearm, the goal is to produce the most consistent possible results. The shooter must also be consistent, and this means that the fundamentals of marksmanship have to be followed rigorously; any failure on the part of the shooter to remain focused and consistent can result in a bad shot. It's common to use a benchrest or a vise when evaluating ammunition or a weapon for accuracy in order to eliminate human error. =Measurements= Comparison of milliradian (mil) and minute of arc (moa). Since adjusting the point of impact to match the point of aim is relatively simple with any type of adjustable sights, the primary goal of accurizing is to increase the precision of the firearm, which is generally measured by looking at the dispersion of a number of shots fired at the same point of aim. An ideal group would be one where all shots land in a hole no larger than the diameter of a single bullet; this would indicate zero dispersion. The most common way of measuring groups then is to measure the edge to edge distance of the farthest holes, and subtract the bullet diameter, which gives the center to center or c-c measurement of the group. This can be expressed in linear measures (a 30 mm group at 100 m, or a one inch group at 100 yards) or in angular measures (a milliradian or MOA group). Groups for rifles are traditionally shot at either 100 meters or . At 100 yd a minute of arc equals , and the one MOA group (approximately 1/3 or 0.3 mil) is a traditional benchmark of accuracy. Handguns are generally used at closer ranges, and are tested for accuracy at their intended range of use. Also of importance is the number of shots fired. Statistical likelihood says the fewer shots that are fired, the smaller the dispersion will be. 3 or 5-shot groups are acceptable for zeroing the sights and rough accuracy estimates, but most shooters consider 10-shot groups to be the minimum for accuracy comparisons. =Defining accuracy= Graph showing the results of an accuracy test using 3 different revolvers and 7 different brands of ammunition. Even defining accuracy can be problematic. An example of this can be shown by the following tests, run by Performance Shooter magazine in December, 1996. The magazine was testing seven brands of .38 Special wadcutter rounds in three different revolvers, a Smith & Wesson Model 686 and Model 52, and a Colt Python Target model, with six, five and eight inch long barrels, respectively. Ten groups of five shots were fired and measured from each revolver with each ammunition. Click on the image at right to see a larger view of the graph of average group sizes for each type of ammunition and each revolver. The average group size for the overall test was . Based on average group size, the winner was the Model 686, which shot an average group of across the brands of ammunition, with a standard deviation between ammunition types of . However, the Model 52, while shooting slightly larger groups at , was far more consistent across the brands, with a standard deviation of only , and was the most consistent performer of the test. However, if the ammunition was tuned to the gun, the clear winner was the Python, which averaged just with its favored brand of ammunition. The Python was also by far the pickiest, however, turning in the largest groups at averages with its least favorite brands, for a standard deviation of . Based on this test, answering the question \\"Which is the most accurate?\\" becomes a matter of opinion. The 686 shot the best average groups. However, as the Python showed the best performance with one brand of ammunition, it might be the best choice if that brand of ammunition were acceptable for the application in question. If a consistent supply of ammunition were a problem, then the 52 might be the best choice, since it showed the least sensitivity to differences in ammunition. =Testing methodology= As the goal of accurizing a firearm is to improve its accuracy, the way accuracy is measured becomes important. A firearm used primarily as a hunting weapon will need to be accurate on the first shot from a cold, clean barrel, while one used for target shooting may be allowed fouling shots before the first shot for record is fired. Issues of portability or restrictions of certain competitions may limit the alterations that can be made. In addition, every firearm is different, and processes that yield good results on one may not affect another. Another issue in measuring accuracy is the method by which the gun is secured for the test. The most accurate shooting position is a supported position, such as firing from a benchrest with the firearm well-supported by a shooting rest or sandbags; this eliminates much of the shooter's potential for error and will generally result in much smaller groups than firing from an unsupported position. Even for a firearm that is going to be shot offhand, accuracy testing from a machine rest will provide an idea of the ultimate attainable accuracy. Usability No matter what the potential laboratory accuracy of a firearm, it does not matter if a human shooter cannot fire it accurately under a set of real-world conditions. A firearm that is comfortable, fits the user well, and provides for a careful, consistent trigger pull and recoil management is not only a physical advantage over a poorly fit firearm, but a psychological one as well. =Trigger= The dynamics of the trigger are one of the most important aspects of usability, since any movement of the firearm caused by pulling the trigger can affect the placement of the shot. Trigger pulls are relative, however. Compare a sport like action shooting, which emphasizes speed and uses relatively close targets with large scoring zones on the targets, to bullseye shooting, which uses distant targets with tiny scoring zones. While both types of trigger need a predictable pull, bullseye shooters demand a much higher degree of precision. Analysis of the trigger pull The trigger pull consists of three stages: # Takeup or pretravel, which is the movement of the trigger which happens before the sear moves. # Break, the movement during which the trigger moves the sear to the point of release. # Overtravel, which is the distance a trigger moves after the sear releases. The takeup is the least critical stage of the trigger pull, and individual preferences vary widely. Two-stage triggers, for example, consist of a noticeable takeup, followed by a distinct increase in the force required to pull the trigger, followed by the break. A single-stage trigger, on the other hand, has no discernible movement before the break. Fully adjustable triggers will provide a two-stage pull, and the option of reducing the first stage travel to zero, essentially making the trigger a single-stage trigger. The break is a far more critical stage of the pull, as it happens just prior to the shot being fired. Here again, individual preferences vary; some shooters prefer a soft break, where there is a smooth but discernible amount of trigger travel during firing, while others prefer a crisp break, with a heavier weight and little or no discernible movement. The overtravel can be the most critical factor in the trigger pull, as any movement caused at this point will happen as the shot is fired. This is especially important with firearms where there is a sudden release of resistance when the sear breaks, such as in double-action triggers. An overtravel stop will arrest the motion of the trigger just after the break, and prevent movement. Over travel is not always considered bad by some, as the force of the trigger finger does not impact on the gun directly after sear release. Improving the trigger pull A Crosman air pistol trigger mechanism, unmodified (top) and with a sear engagement adjustment (bottom). An adjustable trigger may have ways to adjust all of these stages, plus trigger location. For example, a first stage or takeup adjustment might include weight and travel, a second stage or sear engagement adjustment might include weight and travel, and a trigger stop adjustment would limit the overtravel. While adjustable triggers may provide the greatest level of control, much can be done with standard non-adjustable triggers. Careful hand fitting and polishing of parts, addition of high precision or adjustable aftermarket parts, or fabrication of new parts can greatly improve most triggers. Care should be taken, however, since trigger work requires a great deal of care and precision, and a bad trigger job can easily render a firearm highly unsafe or unusable. Liability issues Most manufacturers ship firearms with fairly heavy, nonadjustable triggers, colloquially known as lawyer triggers. This is out of concern for liability; firearms are inherently dangerous, and allowing the user to adjust the trigger, or even implying such adjustments can be made, exposes the manufacturer to lawsuit. Likewise, manufacturers of aftermarket parts expose themselves to similar liability issues. =Sights= A target aperture sight, mounted on the receiver. This rearward mounting position provides a long sight radius, and the small aperture provides a long depth of field and precise alignment A firearm's sights help its user to align the barrel with an intended target. In some cases the only refinement in a \\"target\\" firearm over a standard model is improved sights. Chapter 7, You Can Build an Overnight Target Pistol Adjustable sights are essential for most target shooting, as they allow compensation for variables such as target range and ammunition type. Firearms with non-adjustable or coarsely adjustable sights cannot give their holders the ability to reliably shoot on target in changing conditions. Improvements in visibility and sharpness of a target image provided by some sights can also improve users' aim and consistency. Typical open sights with a blade, post or bead near the muzzle and a notch over the breech are good for quick alignment but far from ideal for accuracy. An aperture sight mounted closer to the user's eye and farther from the front sight tightens accuracy by lengthening the sight radius while helping the person take better advantage of the improvement. Some of these \\"peep sights\\" provide precise, repeatable adjustments for long range shooting with no need for tools. Telescopic and reflex sights offer advantages to people with less experience or poor eyesight by bringing both target and aiming point into focus, while \\"scopes\\" also magnify and brighten the image. Drawbacks such as weight, bulk, and complexity can also affect a shooter's performance.Telescopic sight, reflex sight =Stocks and grips= Rifle stock with camouflage finish A good stock or grip is one that allows the shooter to have a relaxed but firm grip on the firearm. This can range from minor changes such as texturing grip surfaces or adding a wide, beavertail type grip safety to a 1911, all the way to a custom built, anatomically designed grip that \\"fits like a glove\\". Key features are: *Structure. A firearm that is properly affixed to the stock, allowing the barrel to float freely as opposed to touching other surfaces, will be more accurate. A stock should also allow the action to be affixed securely and provide a good bedding surface, which sometimes requires the use of epoxy resins. *Comfort. This allows the shooter to relax and concentrate on shooting. *Control. The shooter must be able to hold the firearm on target, and provide consistent movement under recoil. *Positioning. The shooter must be positioned correctly and consistently, allowing easy use of the sights, and a clean trigger pull. Gripping surfaces Custom grip checkering Gripping surfaces, particularly on handguns, are often designed to provide a large degree of friction to prevent the shooter's grip from shifting. This can be done by either using a material that provides a high friction, such as rubber, or by adding texture to the grips. Traditionally wood grips and stocks are provided with checkering, a process where \\"V\\" shaped grooves are cut into the wood at an angle to each other, leaving a pattern of pyramidal projections in the wood. Another process uses a punch to leave a random pattern of dents in the surface, called stippling; this process is better suited to complex curves than checkering, and is often found on anatomical grips. Handguns with plastic frames will often have stippling or checkering molded into the frame. Handgun grips Grips for handguns, especially ones used in single handed disciplines such as bullseye and Olympic handgun shooting, are critical to good accuracy. The grip provides very little control compared to a rifle stock, and so a good fit is required to give the shooter control over the gun and isolate the trigger finger movement. Aftermarket parts makers provide a wide range of grips for handguns, allowing shooters to find grips that are suitable for their hands. Competition handgun grips are anatomically shaped, and are often custom fitted to the shooter's hand. An ideal grip will fit the contours of the shooter's grip, so that the knuckles fall into position the same way every time. The ideal grip should allow the shooter to repeatedly grasp the gun, bring it up to shooting position with eyes closed, and be correctly aligned and on target when their eyes are opened; this means the grip provides a consistent placement, and minimal corrections when aiming. Contrary to commonly stated rules of thumb, the handgun should not line up with the forearm when gripped, but rather point slightly outwards, so that when held to shoot, the sights line up with the shooter's eye. In cross- dominant shooters, the angle will be more pronounced. Thumbrests, finger grooves (if well fitted), and palm rests all provide control over recoil. An adjustable palm rest is a desirable feature as well, as it allows the grip to be adjusted to fit the shooter's hand as it swells and contracts over time. Rifle and shotgun stocks Stocks for long guns are not as often changed as handgun grips, but a well fitted stock can make a significant difference in accuracy. For shotguns in particular, the placement of the shooter's face on the stock provides the rear aiming point, and the correct drop, toe alignment, and cast-off can greatly enhance accuracy. This was traditionally accomplished by steaming and bending the stock, but a simpler solution for modern guns is a set of shims that alter the angle of the stock. Rifle stocks have similar issues of fit, and though the use of sights makes this less vital than in a shotgun, a good fit still helps the shooter to relax and concentrate on fundamentals. The shape of a rifle stock should be suited to its intended use. High combs and vertical pistol grips are ideal for high mounted target sights or scopes and careful, deliberate shooting such as encountered in traditional target shooting, metallic silhouette, or varmint hunting, as they provide a maximum point blank range and ideal trigger control. However, these features are not well suited for a typical hunting or action shooting rifle, where the rifle must be brought from a ready position to a shooting position quickly and smoothly. This use favors low sights or scopes, and a shallow pistol grip angle. Rounded forearms are well suited for firing from offhand, while a square-bottomed forearm provides a stable base for shooting off of a sandbag or other rest. Recoil is also a key issue in rifle stock design. Heavy recoiling rifles should have wide butts, with a good recoil pad to absorb the force of recoil, and a comb that is straight or slopes down towards the action, so that it does not push into the shooter's face under recoil. Some target shooting disciplines allow the use of various devices to help support the rifle, and these are often mounted to an accessory rail beneath the forend. Target slings, unlike carrying slings, are used just on the off hand, usually with a hand stop, and provide stability to the shooter's hold. Palm rests are another device that can be attached to the rail, to allow a shooter to lower their off hand and place their elbow into their body for support. Target stocks also are available with a large degree of adjustment, including length of pull, drop, comb height and angle, and buttplate angle and curvature. =Time considerations= The bullet does not leave the barrel as soon as the sear releases; rather, there is a delay between the release of the sear and the bullet exiting the barrel. During this time, any movement will move the firearm off target, and so this time should be minimized, especially for firearms that will be fired from an unsupported standing position. This delay can be broken down into two sections, the lock time and the bullet dwell time. Lock time Lock time is the time between the release of the sear and the ignition of the cartridge, and depends on the design of the firing mechanism. A lengthy lock time gives time for the shooter to drift off target, and so it is advantageous to minimize the lock time and reduce the window for error. Reductions in lock time are generally performed by lightening parts that move as part of the firing operation, such as the hammer and firing pin or striker, shortening the distance that parts, moving as components of the firing operation, have to cover, and using a more powerful spring.Locktime By Randy Wakeman A short lock time is particularly desired when shooting with high precision at small targets. The lock time of conventional bolt action rifles typically lie between 2.6 to 9.0 milliseconds.Tubb Precision Speedlock Firing Pin - Rem 700 Short Action Further reductions in lock time, to near zero levels, can be achieved with electrical primers. Bullet dwell time The bullet dwell time is the time between ignition of the cartridge and when the bullet leaves the barrel. Like lock time, dwell time is a window for error, and can be minimized with a faster bullet or a shorter barrel. In some cases, a shorter barrel is desired to reduce dwell time, but without losing the sight radius of a longer barrel. In this case, a sight extension tube, or bloop tube, can be used. This is a tube that fits on the muzzle end of the barrel, providing support for the front sight, but that is bored to much larger than bore diameter. This provides the sight plane of a long barrel with less weight and dwell time. To put lock time and bullet dwell time in perspective; the lock time of most conventional bolt action rifles varies between 2.6 and 9.0 milliseconds, while after cartridge ignition most rifle bullets travel through a high powered rifle barrel bore in 1.0 to 1.5 milliseconds. Mechanical bolt action rifle trigger systems with a sub 2.0 millisecond lock time are applied in most purpose designed high end competition rifles. Clearances and Tolerances The terms \\"clearance\\" and \\"tolerance\\" are very often confused and misused. Clearance is the distance between the surfaces of mating parts. Tolerance is the allowable variation of a dimension from its nominal (desired) value. For example, a bolt with an outside diameter (OD) of 0.697 inches which is operating in a receiver with a bolt raceway inside diameter (ID) of 0.702 has a clearance of 0.005 inches. If the bolt OD has a nominal OD of 0.698 and a tolerance of +/- 0.001, then the bolt OD can randomly vary from 0.697 to 0.699 along its length, which will allow the bolt clearance in the 0.702 diameter raceway to vary from 0.005 to 0.003. Further, if the raceway also has a tolerance of +/- 0.001 from the nominal of 0.702, then its ID can vary from 0.701 to 0.703 along its length. That combination of tolerances can allow the bolt clearance to vary from 0.002 to 0.006. The point at which the 0.002 clearance occurred would likely cause binding and malfunction in most operational environments. To ensure consistent, repeatable lockup, clearances between moving parts must be kept to the smallest value that will allow proper operation of the mechanism. This goal can be achieved by carefully hand selecting parts and precisely fitting them together, or by manufacturing new parts (bolt, receiver, barrel, etc. to precise dimensions using much tighter tolerances than production components. The best fits are generally attained by selecting slightly oversized parts (or altering stock parts to form an interference fit) and then lapping the mating surfaces to attain the desired fit (clearance). Clearances cannot be too tight, however, or functionality will be compromised; this is very important in automatic and semi-automatic firearms, where there is a certain amount of energy extracted from the firing of the cartridge that must be used to cycle the action. Overly tight clearances mean that there is no place for lubricant and dirt to be, and this can bind the parts. However, except for cost considerations, it is always beneficial to minimize the tolerances applied to the manufacture of mating parts. In some cases, stock parts are not sufficient for the task of producing a finished product with sufficiently tight clearances. In this case, it may be necessary to use specially fabricated parts, built either with minimal clearances (but to a very tight tolerance), or parts that are oversized and intended for hand fitting. =Barrel= Headspace of a .45 ACP cartridge, which headspaces off the case mouth. Cutaway of the barrel of a tank cannon, showing rifling on a large scale. The barrel is one of the most important factors for accuracy, as a poorly made barrel may be beyond correction. Even a quality barrel must be well matched to the cartridge it will be firing. In most cases, it is not practical to fix a barrel whose bore is worn out, poorly or unsuitably rifled, or the wrong bore diameter; the primary exception to that is rimfire barrels, which can be inexpensively bored out and re-lined with a commercial barrel liner. If the barrel is unsuitable and relining is not an option, then an aftermarket or custom barrel is the best solution. However, if the bore is good, then there are a number of operations that can be done to the barrel to improve upon its accuracy. Bore Ideally, the bore must be cylindrical and the rifling geometry the same down the length of the bore. Some airgun rifles have a short cone towards the muzzle to improve the speed of the bullet. A slight gain in the rifling twist, or a slight tapering down of the bore, will still ensure the tight fit of bullet to bore, so when selecting a barrel, the tighter or faster twist end should be chosen for the muzzle. The twist of the rifling must match the intended ammunition for best accuracy. Rifling with too slow a twist will not stabilize long bullets, causing them to precess in flight; at its worst, this can result in the bullets tumbling in-flight and keyholing, where bullets strike the target sideways. Too fast a twist can also be a problem, as it can magnify problems in the bullet. A bullet whose center of mass is slightly off-center will diverge at a rate proportional to the rifling twist, so excess twist will result in greater dispersion. In practical terms, this is only a problem for rifles chambered for common military calibers where a variety of different loads exist. For example, the M16A1 rifle is unable to accurately fire bullets that are heavier than due to barrel twist that is too slow to stabilize heavier bullets.http://www.armystudyguide.com/content/army_board_study_guide_topics/m16a2/ammunition- types-and-char.shtml Precision rifles typically come with barrels that are either tailor-made for a specific ammunition load or made according to the buyer's specifications. Barrels can also benefit from lapping, not only because it makes the bore a more consistent diameter, but also because it polishes the bore. Barrel lapping should be done with the tool moving in the same direction as the bullet will move, so that any imperfections in the barrel will be smoothed out and thus not interfere with the passage of the bullet. A smooth, polished bore will not only hold the bullet better, but also reduce barrel fouling. Chamber Of great importance to accuracy is the fit of the ammunition to the barrel. The chamber should be concentric, and the throat sized just slightly larger than the bullet diameter. The cartridge must headspace correctly, be held firmly in place, concentric to the bore, and the bullet must fit the bore and be guided to engage the rifling cleanly. Once the bullet is engaged in the rifling, with a good seal and coaxial fit, it must stay that way. It is often possible to shorten a barrel slightly by removing material from the breech end and re-cut the chamber, which can correct many problems in the original chamber. Crown The crown is the muzzle face of the barrel. The crown's integrity is critical for two reasons: #It is the last part of the firearm touched by the bullet before it exits. #As the bullet clears the crown, it will release upwards of of back pressure, which must be as uniform as possible. While many barrel manufacturers recess the crown to protect it from accidental damage, it can still be damaged over time by cleaning rods that are too hard. It is also not uncommon for factory crowns to be cut slightly off-center, so that one side of the bullet exits slightly earlier than the other, and this will result in the bullet being pushed away from that side, causing a significant deflection in its path. A crown may be re-cut with relative ease, and this can fix any problems caused by a defective or damaged crown, by ensuring an even release of the bullet. Stress Any machining process on a barrel, whether it's boring, rifling, or turning the outside contour, will produce some stress in the steel of the barrel. This stress can cause the barrel to expand unevenly as it heats, causing shots to \\"walk\\" as the barrel heats and cools. To prevent this, careful post-machining heat treatment is often used to stress-relieve the barrels. The amount of good this does depends on the technique used to make the barrel. For example, the hammer forging method of manufacture leaves a significant amount of stress in the barrels, which could be addressed through stress-relieving heat treatment. Wear Barrel wear is also an important issue, particularly in high- powered firearms. High temperatures tend to erode the barrel at the throat, preventing the bullet from entering the rifling cleanly. One way to produce a long-lasting barrel is by the proper selection of materials. Stainless steels, such as 416, have been shown to have a longer life than the traditional 4140 chrome/molybdenum steels used for barrels. While the stainless barrels are not any more accurate than a 4140 barrel, they will maintain their accuracy longer in many applications, as they are more resistant to erosion caused by the heat of firing high-powered cartridges. One notable exception to this is the .50 BMG cartridge; competition shooters often fire high-precision lathe-turned bullets made from harder brass, bronze, or steel in this caliber, and the 4140 steel will stand up to this better than stainless. Cryogenic treatment Another commonly cited accurizing treatment for barrels is cryogenic treatment. This involves slowly cooling the steel down to liquid nitrogen temperatures, leaving it there for a time, and then slowly warming back to room temperature. This process converts remaining austenite in the steel to martensite. Many proponents of this process claim increased accuracy of the resulting barrels, but independent testing of the process by major manufacturers has shown no increase in accuracy. However, the conversion of austenite to martensite has been shown to result in easier machining and greater wear resistance on steels that tend to have significant amounts of retained austenite, such as stainless steels, and the process does appear to significantly affect the accurate life of stainless steel barrels. =Rifle stocks= A poor fit of the action to the stock is also a source of problems, and this problem is exacerbated by issues such as thermal expansion of metal parts during use, and swelling and contracting of wooden stocks with changes in humidity. These changes can affect accuracy either by allowing the action to shift under recoil, or by causing slight but accuracy-destroying bending of the barrel. By removing wood from areas of contact and, when needed, replacing it with a more stable substance that is precisely fitted, such as a fiberglass composite molded in place, a more stable, precise fit can be achieved. Other materials, such as composites or laminated wood, can also provide a stronger, more dimensionally stable stock than traditional woods can. Some stocks are even being made out of aluminum or other metals, for maximum stability. Bedding epoxy in a stock The process of fitting the action to the stock is called bedding, and there are a number of different processes used. Glass bedding uses a fiberglass composite which is molded in place around the action. This can be as simple as bedding the recoil lug of a bolt-action rifle, or as complex as bedding the entire action and barrel channel. Pillar bedding uses precisely machined metal pillars in the stock which mate with the action, providing a strong metal-to-metal contact without the labor-intensive hand fitting required in glass bedding. Many times it is advantageous to eliminate most or all contact between the stock and barrel, to eliminate potential accuracy-destroying interference in the barrel harmonics. To do this, stock material is removed along the barrel channel to leave a slight gap between the stock and the barrel; this is called free floating the barrel. With some designs, pressure bedding is preferred, where a single point of contact remains between stock and barrel near the forend. In both these cases, bedding the action is required to provide support for the floating or pressure bedded barrel. Since the action ends up supporting the mass of the barrel, a poor stock to action fit will result in unacceptable shifting. =Action= The primary purposes of the firearm action are holding the cartridge in place in the chamber, and providing a way to ignite the propellant. In a single-shot action, little additional functionality is provided, while in a semi-automatic firearm the action also taps energy from the firing process for cycling to fire the next round. From an accuracy perspective, the primary goal of the action is to achieve a consistent placement of the cartridge in the chamber every shot. The term blueprinting, borrowed from high performance engine builders, is also often applied to the process of manufacturing or altering parts to have a desired (usually tighter) clearance than stock parts, and tightening the tolerances on critical dimensions to reduce clearance variations. Blueprinting a firearm action involves similar operations designed to tighten the clearances of a firearm action to ensure consistent and correct seating of the cartridge in the chamber. A typical set of blueprinting operations for a bolt-action firearm would include the following: #Bolt blueprinting operations: ##Squaring the bolt face to the bolt diameter ##Ensuring the bolt is concentric in the action ##Squaring and lapping the locking lugs ##Sleeving the bolt (adding material to increase the diameter), then machining down for a precise fit to the action #Receiver blueprinting operations: ##Making the action threads for the barrel concentric with the action centerline ##Making sure the breech face is square to the action centerline ##Making sure the recoil lug is square to the action ##Squaring and lapping the locking lug recesses These operations ensure that not only is the cartridge consistently and correctly positioned when chambered, but also that it remains correctly positioned during firing. =Revolver specific issues= The defining characteristic of a revolver is the revolving cylinder, separate from the barrel, that contains the chambers. Revolvers typically have 5 to 9 chambers, and the first issue is ensuring consistency among the chambers; if they are not consistent then the point of impact will vary from chamber to chamber. The chambers must also align consistently with the barrel, so the bullet enters the barrel the same way from each chamber. The throat in a revolver is part of the cylinder, and like any other chamber, the throat should be sized so that it is concentric to the chamber and very slightly over the bullet diameter. At the end of the throat, however, things change. First, the throat in a revolver is at least as long as the maximum overall length of the cartridge; if otherwise the cylinder cannot revolve. The next step is the cylinder gap, the space between the cylinder and barrel. This must be wide enough to allow free rotation of the cylinder even when it becomes fouled with powder residue, but not so large that excess gas can be released. The next step is the forcing cone. The forcing cone is where the bullet is guided from the cylinder into the bore of the barrel. It should be concentric with the bore, and deep enough to force the bullet into the bore without significant deformation. Unlike rifles, where the threaded portion of the barrel is in the chamber, revolver barrels threads surround the breech end of the bore, and it is possible that the bore will be compressed when the barrel is screwed into the frame. Cutting a longer forcing cone can relieve this \\"choke\\" point, as can lapping of the barrel after it is fitted to the frame. A consistent lockup is important to keep all these parts in line, and revolvers are prone to abuse that can damage these parts, adversely affecting the accuracy and even safety of the revolver. This lockup consists of two parts, the crane to frame lockup, and the cylinder bolt to cylinder lockup. Many swing-out cylinder revolvers only support the cylinder securely at the rear, and flipping the cylinder open and closed can bend the crane and prevent the cylinder from lining up parallel to the bore. The cylinder bolt, which engages the bottom of the cylinder through a slot in the frame, should provide a relatively tight lockup, and not drag the cylinder during rotation or pop loose when the hammer is cocked at a reasonable speed. Fanning a revolver can batter the cylinder bolt and prevent a solid lockup. Harmonics A Jay Young built unlimited class \\"railgun\\" using a diameter Lilja Precision barrel. During firing, the chamber pressure rises from atmospheric pressure to, in a typical rifle cartridge, pressures of about within microseconds. This rapid increase in pressure causes the barrel to vibrate at a certain natural frequency, much like a tuning fork. The point in time at which the bullet exits the barrel will determine the orientation of the muzzle relative to its rest position. Exiting near a peak or valley in the motion means the muzzle is relatively stationary, and shot dispersion will be minimized; exiting between a peak and valley means the muzzle is rapidly moving, and shot dispersion will be greater. There are two ways to address harmonics; reducing the amplitude with a stiffer barrel, or working with the natural frequency to minimize dispersion. =Stiffness= Stiffness of a barrel is proportional to the fourth power of the diameter, and inversely proportional to the third power of the length. Because of this, short, thick barrels will vibrate with high frequency and low amplitude, and long, thin barrels will vibrate with a low frequency and high amplitude. Due to the effect of length, barrel harmonics are primarily a concern with rifles. By using the shortest and/or fattest barrel possible, the amplitude of the vibrations can be minimized to the point that they are irrelevant to accuracy. Unlimited class benchrest shooting barrels, where weight is of very little consequence, have very large diameters; an outside diameter of 2 inches (5 cm) is not uncommon. While standard rifle barrels taper from breech to muzzle, high precision rifles will often use a barrel with far less taper, called a heavy barrel, sometimes leaving the barrel cylindrical all the way to the muzzle, called a bull barrel. Either technique greatly increases the stiffness of the barrel by enlarging the average diameter, but this process adds significant weight as well. This can greatly increase the mass of the barrel, however; going from a lightweight sporter contour to a heavy barrel contour can double the mass, and a going to a bull barrel contour can more than triple it. Fluting, consisting of grooves machined in the outer surface of the barrel to remove material, can reduce the weight and improve heat dispersion while maintaining most of the stiffness. Barrel tensioning devices are a way of gaining stiffness with minimal increases in weight. They do this by placing a lightweight sleeve, often made of aluminium or a carbon fiber composite, around the barrel, and then using a nut attached to the end of the barrel to tension the barrel and place the sleeve under compression. This serves to keep the muzzle closer to concentric and coaxial to the breech during vibration. =Harmonic tuning= Drawing from US Patent 5,423,145, for a Rifle-Barrel Harmonic Vibration Tuning Device The other solution is to work with the barrel's natural vibration, and tune the components so that the bullet exits the barrel as it is moving the slowest. The simplest approach to harmonic tuning is to concentrate on the ammunition. The internal ballistics of a given cartridge will determine its dwell time, or the time it takes from ignition to exiting the barrel. By experimentally matching the dwell time to the barrel's frequency, the best load for a particular firearm may be found. Similarly, handloading gives the shooter the opportunity to very precisely control the bullet velocity, and experimentally choose the optimum velocity. If it is not possible or desirable to match the bullet to the barrel, there are a number of devices marketed to allow the barrel to be tuned to match the ammunition. There are a number of models of these that work in different ways. One type uses an adjustable damper or pressure bedding point to allow the shooter to find the \\"sweet spot\\", where it will do the most good at damping the vibrations that are affecting accuracy. Other tuners work by using an adjustable weight on the muzzle to alter the length of the resonant portion of the barrel, and allowing the frequency to be matched to the ammunition. Airgun powerplants The difference between an airgun and a firearm is the way in which the power to launch the projectile is provided. In a firearm the projectile propulsion is provided by an exothermic chemical reaction, and in an airgun is it provided primarily by mechanically compressed gas, typically either air or carbon dioxide (CO2), though these gases are used primarily for convenience and some airgun variants run on other gases, such as refrigerants like R-134a commonly used in airsoft guns, or hydrogen used in light-gas guns. There are three primary types of powerplant used in airguns: *Spring-piston, which uses a spring-loaded piston to compress air within an air pump at the moment of firing *Pneumatic, which uses pre-compressed air stored in a reservoir within the gun *Compressed gas, which uses a small removable gas cylinder now ubiquitously stores liquid CO2 (Powerlet) Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, and different areas that can be addressed to ensure consistency. The most powerful systems will produce velocities near or exceeding the speed of sound with lightweight pellets; this, however, is not a good thing where accuracy is concerned. The commonly used airgun diabolo pellets have a poor ballistic coefficient, and quickly lose velocity; when they drop below the speed of sound, they will often tumble. However, high velocities sell airguns; if accuracy is desired from these high velocity guns, then heavier pellets should be used to keep the velocity down. This will provide not only better accuracy, but better downrange preservation of velocity and kinetic energy. =Pneumatic= Pneumatic systems use compressed gas for power, usually compressed air. This air may be compressed by the gun for each shot, in a single stroke or pump (multiple stroke) gun, or it may be precharged by an external compressor. A single stroke system, as the name implies, uses a single stroke of the pump to compress a cylinder full of air, which is then all used for one shot of the gun. Single stroke systems are both inexpensive and capable of high accuracy due to the simplicity and consistency of the single stroke design. The downsides are the low power provided, though this is not a handicap in standard 10 meter airgun target shooting. When Daisy introduced an inexpensive single stroke pistol, the model 717, in the late 1970s, American Olympic shooter Don Nygord demonstrated the potential of the design by shooting an accurized version in a California State air pistol championship, and winning the gold medal. The (at the time) US$40 Daisy, with a better rear sight and an adjustable trigger added, shot as well as the US$400 Olympic class air pistols it was competing against. More powerful is the pump system, which is a slightly more complex version of the single stroke design. Rather than leaving the air in the piston when compressed, the pump airgun has a reservoir to contain the compressed air, allowing multiple pumps to be used, typically 2 at a minimum, up to 10 pumps for full power. The ability to vary the power, however, is the pump airgun's major disadvantage when it comes to accuracy, as it makes it very difficult to get a consistent charge. The increased power of a pump airgun makes it an attractive choice for many shooters, and there are steps that can be taken to improve consistency, such as modifying the air chamber so that not all the air is exhausted in a shot. The last type of pneumatic airgun is the precharged pneumatic. This is both an old and a new design; some of the earliest airguns, such as the model carried by Lewis and Clark, were of this type, as are many new cutting edge models. The precharged pneumatic uses an external source of compressed air, either an external pump or a high pressure reservoir such as a SCUBA tank, to fill a reservoir. The reservoir can be a small, single-shot one, such as in the Brocock Air Cartridge system, or a large, multi-shot tank. The key to top accuracy in a precharged pneumatic is a consistent pressure. With multishot systems (as are most), the pressure in the reservoir will drop with each shot fired, so the best way to achieve consistency is with a pressure regulator, which provides a steady, but lower, pressure at the valve, for as long as the reservoir pressure remains higher than the regulated pressure. Regulators are also generally adjustable, so a low pressure setting will provide many shots of lower power, while a high pressure setting will provide a few high power shots. =Piston= Piston airguns, often called \\"springers\\", are unique in many ways. Since the firing process involves a fairly massive piston suddenly moving to compress the air, they have a significant \\"kick\\", generally called \\"recoil\\" (though this is not the same as firearm recoil). The recoil begins when the piston starts to move forwards, which pushes the rest of the gun backwards. The recoil then stops suddenly as the piston reaches the end of its travel, and is brought to a stop by the cushion of high-pressure air trapped between the piston and pellet. This recoil can be brutal on the gun in high- powered models, and will loosen screws, shift sights, and break scopes not designed specifically for the unique recoil of piston airgun--all of these can lead to poor accuracy. In addition to the recoil, piston airguns have a long lock time, as the piston must compress the air before the pellet begins to move, and the gun is moving due to the recoil during this time. Spring airguns require a special technique to fire, to ensure that the gun moves very consistently during this recoil. The preferred method is a very loose hold, to allow the gun to move back; this means that a piston airgun will not shoot the same from a bench. All accuracy testing and sighting in must be done in the same position the gun will be shot from, otherwise the results will be different. Piston airgun recoil cannot readily be dealt with without a significant redesign; in some cases the action can be mounted on a sliding rail, or two counter-recoiling pistons can be used, but this requires significant changes to the design. The resulting gun will be far less sensitive to the shooter's hold, and thus much easier to shoot accurately. The RSW-54 is a model 48/52 with the action mounted on rails, so it can recoil within the stock. The first step to accuracy of a piston gun is to ensure that all screws are secure and the sights are rated for use on a piston airgun. Another potential issue regarding accuracy is resonance in the spring used to power the piston in most airguns. The spring will vibrate strongly as the piston stops, and this will affect the harmonics of the gun. A gas spring will, if one can be fitted to a given model, provide vibrationless action, though with some loss of efficiency and even sharper recoil. Spring driven pistons also respond well to accurizing; careful fitting of parts and use of quality lubricants and spring damping tar can reduce the level of vibrations and improve accuracy Contains links to all sections of article on the tuning of an R1 air rifle =CO2= CO2 is commonly found in multishot airguns, from the cheapest plinkers to Olympic class target guns, though the latter are facing competition from regulated precharged pneumatics. CO2's advantage is that it is stored in a liquid form, rather than a gas, and as such provides a greater power density. The liquid also provides a constant pressure, the vapor pressure, as long as there is liquid remaining in the reservoir. The downside to CO2 is that it is dependent upon the vapor pressure, which changes significantly with temperature. This is of primary concern to outdoor shooters, who may shoot in widely varying temperatures, or for rapid fire shooters, as rapid release of the gas results in a rapid drop in the temperature of the liquid. The issue of temperature change is not readily addressable, other than by the use of readily adjustable sights, so the shooter can adjust the sights to match the point of impact based on the current ambient conditions. In the case of rapid fire, there is a solution that can provide far greater stability for many guns. The original CO2 airguns were filled from an external source of CO2, but in 1954 Crosman introduced the 12 gram Powerlet, a compact, disposable tank now ubiquitous in inexpensive CO2 airguns. The downside to these is that the small quantity of CO2 liquid cools down quickly, leading to a rapid drop in velocity and a changing point of impact. By moving to a bulk fill system, with a much larger tank, there is more liquid available, and the greater mass will cool far more slowly.

It is located next to Newtown, Richboro, and Churchville. One of its communities is Village Shires, which has approximately 4,000 residents. History Holland, the core of which is situated at the junction of Ironworks and Mill Creek, was originally known as Rocksville due to the rocky banks of Mill Creek situated alongside it. Rocksville was renamed to Holland in 1870 with the building of a postal office due to the many Dutch settlers in the area who settled in 17th and 18th century. A gristmill and a general store were operated at the core of Holland by the Finney family. The general store has been converted to a restaurant, while the gristmill was renovated into Mill Race Inn. The gristmill was powered by the Mill Creek dam which eventually collapsed after torrential rains in 2001. The building currently stands in a dilapidated state. Despite its proximity to Philadelphia, Holland was rural for much of its history. A building boom in the 1970s resulted in a significant increase in housing capacity replacing the large tracts of farmland, mainly in the form of large tract housing developments (e.g. Hillcrestshire, located off of Buck Road). Since then, the town has seen additional growth, becoming a prototypical commuter bedroom community for suburban families. The area's proximity to both Philadelphia and the Trenton/Princeton, New Jersey area make Holland a desirable location, despite its lack of public transit. Holland is located in the Council Rock School District, and is home to several of the district's schools: Council Rock High School South, Holland Middle School (formerly Holland Junior High, and prior to that Council Rock Intermediate School (CRIS)- Holland), Holland Elementary, Hillcrest Elementary, and Rolling Hills Elementary. Holland is also home to several private Catholic schools: Villa Joseph Marie High School, an all-girls school, and St Katharine Drexel Regional Catholic School, affiliated with St Bede the Venerable Parish. Notable residents Notable current and former residents include the following: *Jenn McAllister, famous YouTube star *James C. Greenwood, former U.S. Representative *Matt Walsh, former Florida Gators basketball star and a former player with the NBA's Miami Heat *Shannon James, Playboy Playmate of the Month (May 2007) *Anthony Green, current lead singer of the band Circa Survive *Greg Cochrane, Left Back, San Antonio FC, USL *Justin Pugh, offensive tackle, Syracuse University, picked in the first round of the 2013 NFL Draft by the New York Giants Passenger trains =History= Holland's growth as a commuter haven took place in the mid-1980s, just after the town lost its passenger trains. Regularly scheduled train service lasted until January 14, 1983 via SEPTA's Fox Chase Rapid Transit Line. The station, and all of those north of Fox Chase, were closed due to failing diesel train equipment that the then-cash-strapped SEPTA could not afford to rehabilitate. As a result, ridership was low and the service cancelled on a \\"temporary\\" basis. As such, Holland Station still appears in SEPTA's publicly posted tariffs.SEPTA Tariff No. 154; effective July 1, 2009 Although rail service was initially replaced with a Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus, patronage remained light. The traveling public never saw a bus service as a suitable replacement for a rail service, and the Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus service ended in 1999. The Holland shelter was demolished in the summer of 2000, shortly after bus service was terminated. =Resumption of train service= In the ensuing years since 1983, there has been heavy interest by both residents and politicians in resuming passenger service to Holland. In September 2009, the Southampton-based Pennsylvania Transit Expansion Coalition (PA-TEC) began discussions with township officials along the railway, as well as SEPTA officials, about the realistic possibility of resuming even minimal passenger service to relieve traffic congestion in the region. Plans call for completing the electrification to Newtown, as originally planned in the late 1970s. PA-TEC's efforts have received overwhelming bipartisan support by both Bucks and Montgomery County officials, as well as at the state level, despite SEPTA's overall reservations. However, SEPTA has also confirmed they are willing to reestablish regular commuter service if strong political support exists in both counties.r8newtown.com  Education  Northampton Township is part of the Council Rock School District.

The screenplay by Aeneas MacKenzie, John Huston, and Wolfgang Reinhardt is based on the biography The Phantom Crown by Bertita Harding and the play Juarez and Maximilian by Franz Werfel. Plot The film focuses on the conflict between Maximilian I (Brian Aherne), an Austrian archduke who is installed as the puppet ruler of Mexico by the French Napoleon III (Claude Rains), and Benito Ju√°rez (Paul Muni), the country's president. In 1863, Napoleon III of France, fearful he will lose Mexico to Ju√°rez, circumvents the Monroe Doctrine by instituting sovereign rule and controlling an election that places Maximilian von Habsburg on the Mexican throne. Upon his arrival in the country with his wife Carlota (Bette Davis), Maxmilian realizes he is expected to establish French supremacy by confiscating land that Ju√°rez had returned to the native people and penalizing the rebels under his command. Maximilian decides to abdicate his throne but is deterred from doing so by Carlota. Maximillian offers Ju√°rez the position of prime minister, but Ju√°rez's refusal to compromise democratic self-rule for the Mexican people creates an unbridgeable rift between the two. When the American Civil War comes to an end, the United States warns Napoleon that it intends to enforce the Monroe Doctrine by military force if necessary, sending arms in support of Ju√°rez's army. Their efforts are thwarted by Vice President Alejandro Uradi (Joseph Calleia), who seizes the American ammunition and therefore virtually guarantees victory for Maximilian. However, Napoleon orders all French troops to evacuate Mexico, leaving Maximilian without an army. Angered by this move, Carlota returns to Paris to appeal to Napoleon, but she suffers a mental breakdown. Ju√°rez and his rebels capture Maxmillian and his men. Although arrangements to set him free are made, he insists on remaining with his supporters. Tried and found guilty, they are sentenced to death by firing squad.

Wallis had proposed a film about Maximilian and Ju√°rez to director Max Reinhardt. At the time, he was interested in casting Luther Adler as the Mexican president.Higham, Charles, The Life of Bette Davis. New York: Macmillan Publishing Company 1981. , pp. 118-124 In 1937, Wallis and Jack L. Warner, in an effort to dissuade any other studios from embarking upon a similar project, purchased the screen rights to both the novel The Phantom Crown by Bertita Harding and the play Juarez and Maximilian by Franz Werfel, and on September 30 Aeneas MacKenzie began writing a first draft under associate producer Henry Blanke's supervision.Stine, Whitney, and Davis, Bette, Mother Goddam: The Story of the Career of Bette Davis. New York: Hawthorn Books 1974. , pp.101-104 According to Blanke, \\"Our problem from the outset in preparing this story for the screen was by no means one of glossing over facts, but rather one of cleaving to the exact line.\\" To ensure the film was as accurate as possible, Warners head of research Herman Lissauer acquired three hundred books on the subject, and two historians were hired to help with changes to the script. Because Wallis had decided to cast Paul Muni, then one of the studio's most prestigious contract players, as Ju√°rez, MacKenzie was instructed to make the role the most dominant in the film. His initial script was long enough for two films, and John Huston and Wolfgang Reinhardt were called in to help trim it. Abem Finkel, who had contributed to the screenplays for Marked Woman and Jezebel, worked on the dialogue but received no screen credit for his efforts. In August 1938, Wallis, Blanke, director William Dieterle, and Muni traveled to Mexico, stopping in 15 small towns, then visited the National Museum in Mexico City, where Ju√°rez's personal papers were housed. They also managed to find a 116-year-old man who had fought with Ju√°rez and Porfirio Diaz, and Muni questioned him about the president's mannerisms and speech patterns at length. He worked with makeup artist Perc Westmore to transform his face to resemble Ju√°rez by changing his bone structure and skin tone, a process that took three hours each day. Despite the fact the actor closely resembled his character, studio head Jack L. Warner was unhappy with the results and complained \\"You mean we're paying Muni all this dough and we can't even recognize him?\\" However the premiere audience in Mexico City audibly gasped at first sight of Muni as Juarez, the resemblance being so remarkable. On October 12, 1938, Bette Davis was offered the role of Carlota while in the midst of filming Dark Victory. Although the part was small, she welcomed the opportunity to portray an historical figure, especially one who would go mad during a dramatic confrontation with Napol√©on III. She was asked to submit to makeup tests by Perc Westmore and costume fittings by Orry-Kelly but refused to do so while still working on another character. She reported to the set on December 13, two weeks after principal photography had begun and one week after her divorce from husband Harmon Nelson had been granted, but announced she was unprepared to film her first scene and went home. Filming was suspended for several days, and when Davis returned to the studio she was fretful and distracted. By Christmas she was close to a nervous breakdown. Soon after the holiday, she was diagnosed with a severe case of pleurisy, and as a result she frequently remained in bed until 3:00 pm, finally reporting to work in the late afternoon with a high temperature. Filming of the scene in which Carlota confronts Napol√©on III was postponed for two days until she felt well enough to attempt it. John Garfield was cast as Porfirio Diaz at the request of Paul Muni, who was familiar with his stage work in New York City. Garfield was relatively unknown in Hollywood at the time, but by the time filming began he had received critical acclaim for his performance in Four Daughters. Studio executives questioned his playing a relatively minor role in Juarez, but the actor was anxious to appear in it, so he remained in the cast, his box-office appeal managing to win out over his heavy Bronx accent. Garfield's reviews were uniformly bad, and Diaz proved to be the only period role he played in his career.Juarez at Turner Classic Movies The epic film boasted 1,186 supporting players performing on 54 sets designed by art director Anton Grot and his assistant Leo Kuter. The largest was an 11-acre replica of Mexico constructed on a ranch in Calabasas, California. Behind the throne room and living quarters of Maximilian was a 250-foot-long and 50-foot-high backdrop of Mexico City, with Popocat√©petl in the distance. Erich Wolfgang Korngold researched the music popular in Mexico during the period and discovered it was \\"unmistakenly Viennese.\\" He composed 3,000 bars of music for the score, at times emulating the rhythms of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and Franz Schubert, and the second theme of the first movement of his Violin Concerto was drawn from his work for the film. Audience reaction to the first preview was so negative the film was recut, with entire scenes transposed. A new ending designed to soften Muni's portrayal of Ju√°rez was filmed, although the scene - in which Ju√°rez visits the cathedral where Maximilian is lying in state and asks for his forgiveness - has no basis in fact. The film opened in New York City on April 24, 1939 and went into general release on June 4. Critical reception Upon its initial release, Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times observed \\"Ideologically the new Warner film is faultless. What it has to say about the conflict between imperialist, benevolent despot and democrat has been expressed logically and eloquently, with reasonable fidelity to historic fact...But approval of a film's purpose and message cannot blind one altogether to some of the weaknesses of its structure. Juarez has not been smoothly assembled. Its central character has been thrown out of focus by a lesser one. Too much and too little attention has been paid to the subordinate people in the drama. William Dieterle, who ordinarily directs so well, has been guilty in this instance of a surprisingly static camera, of stage technique rather than cinematic. The picture runs for something more than two hours, which should have been enough to balance its budget and its plot. Yet it is out of balance, in character and in narrative. Possibly the fault is in its editing, although that would not explain it all.\\" He continued, \\"The picture seems one long dissolve from council chamber to council chamber, broken rather pointlessly by a pompous ceremony of royal adoption...and dramatically by Carlota's mad scene and Juarez's bold outfacing of a traitor. In the last mentioned two, the picture enters brilliantly into the true medium of cinema expression, blends imagery with eloquence and vitalizes its screen. But the very vividness of these sequences accentuates the staticism of many of the others ‚Äî a pictorial staticism, we hasten to add, for the quality of the writing is splendid, the measure of the performance high, the concept admirable.\\" He concluded \\"Juarez, with all its faults, still must be rated a distinguished, memorable and socially valuable film.\\"New York Times review In later years, Time Out London stated \\"Only Bette Davis and Gale Sondergaard have any fire in this otherwise plodding Warner Bros costume drama,\\"Time Out London review while Channel 4 noted \\"Despite the frills, there is very little substance in this overcooked adventure.\\"Channel 4 review Awards and nominations Brian Aherne was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and Tony Gaudio was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Black and White Cinematography.

It also includes an extensive network of Thruway Motorcoach bus connections, operated by private companies under contract. The three lines shared the use of Amtrak California branded Thruway buses and trainsets. History The former logo of Amtrak California, still seen on some equipment The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) assumed operation of almost all intercity passenger rail in the United States in 1971. Service in California, as in most of the United States, was basic and infrequent. In 1976 California began providing financial assistance to Amtrak. At the same time, the Caltrans Division of Rail was formed to oversee state- financed rail operations and the brand Amtrak California started appearing on state-supported routes. In 1990, California passed Propositions 108 and 116, providing $3 billion for transportation projects ($ billion after inflation), with a large portion going to rail service.Prop. 108: Passenger Rail And Clean Air Bond Act of 1990; California Streets and Highways Code, Division 3, Chapter 17 As a result, new locomotives and passenger cars were purchased by the state, and existing inter-city routes expanded. A more distinct image for Amtrak California, such as painting locomotives and passenger cars in \\"California Color\\" of blue and yellow, was established with the arrival of new rolling stock. In 1998, while still funded by the state, the management of the Capitol Corridor was transferred to the Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Authority (CCJPA), formed by local jurisdictions of the line serves. In 2015 the management of the San Joaquin and the Pacific Surfliner were similarly transferred to the San Joaquin Joint Powers Authority (SJJPA) and the Los Angeles-San Diego-San Luis Obispo Rail Corridor Agency (LOSSAN), respectively. As a result, the Amtrak California brand became less prominent in the websites and marketing materials. Caltrans is studying Amtrak service to the Coachella Valley. Routes =Pacific Surfliner= The Pacific Surfliner is a major commuting route in Southern California. The entire length of the line runs from San Luis Obispo in the north, down to San Diego in the south. It hugs the California coast for most of the route‚Äìas close as 100 feet from the Pacific in some areas‚Äìproviding a stunning backdrop. Most trains on the Pacific Surfliner route only travel a portion of the whole route. With 2.7 million passengers in fiscal year 2013, this is Amtrak's most heavily travelled service outside the Northeast Corridor. This is the busiest of the three Amtrak California routes in terms of ridership; in fact it is the third- busiest Amtrak route nationwide, behind only the Northeast Regional and the Acela Express. It is also the oldest; service along this route dates to 1939, with the Santa Fe's San Diegan. Amtrak extended up the Central Coast in the 1980s and 1990s, ultimately renaming it the Pacific Surfliner in 2000. =San Joaquin= The San Joaquin operates 14 trains (7 in each direction) each day between Bakersfield and Stockton. From Stockton, five trains from Bakersfield continue west to Oakland, while two trains proceed north to the state capital of Sacramento. Central Valley communities served include Fresno, Corcoran, Hanford, Lodi, Madera, Merced, Modesto, Turlock/Denair and Wasco. Delta/Bay communities of Antioch, Martinez, and Richmond are also served by the San Joaquin. Los Angeles is not served on this route due to the bottleneck of the Tehachapi Pass line, where the Union Pacific prohibits passenger train use due to freight traffic along the world's busiest single-track railway. (On rare occasions Amtrak trains use this as a detour if their railway tracks are being repaired.) The San Joaquin has operated since 1974. =Capitol Corridor= The Capitol Corridor route, operating since 1991, runs north from San Jose through the East Bay to Oakland and Richmond, then east through the Delta communities of Martinez and Suisun City, and the Sacramento Valley cities of Davis and Sacramento. One Capitol Corridor train per day continues east of Sacramento during the afternoon commute to the small Sierra Nevada town of Auburn, returning in the morning. It is the fourth-busiest Amtrak route nationwide. Rolling stock =Locomotives= Capitol Corridor train passing through Davis in September 2019 Amtrak California operates a fleet of EMD F59PHI, GE Dash 8-32BWH and Siemens Charger locomotives that are used on San Joaquin and Capitol Corridor trains. These locomotives are owned by Caltrans and carry the CDTX reporting marks.All Aboard ‚Äì Amtrak California Locomotives from Amtrak's national fleet such as P42DC are often used as substitutes when the Amtrak California dedicated fleet of locomotives undergoes maintenance. Amtrak's Siemens Charger SC-44 locomotive #2102 with Capitol Corridor train at Sacramento Valley station Twenty-two additional locomotives built by Siemens will join Amtrak California's locomotive fleet starting from 2017. These locomotives, named Charger, were parts of a multi-state order funded by a combination of federal and state money. Illinois Department of Transportation, acting as the leading agency, awarded the order to Siemens on December 18, 2013. Caltrans ordered the first six with the initial order in 2013, then exercised the option to buy 14 more locomotives in 2015 to replace Amtrak- owned locomotives currently used on Pacific Surfliner. Two additional locomotives were ordered in 2016. = Passenger cars =  California Car / Surfliner bi-level trainsets  Amtrak California's routes typically use bi- level, high-capacity passenger cars, dubbed the Surfliner and California Car. All of the California Cars are owned by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). Amtrak owns most of the Surfliner cars with some owned by Caltrans. The design of the cars is based on Amtrak's Superliner bi- level passenger cars, but several changes were made to the design to make the vehicle more suitable for corridor services with frequent stops. One significant difference is that the Surfliner and California Car have two sets of automatic doors on each side instead of only one manually operated door on the Superliners, which speeds up boarding and alighting considerably. Additionally, Surfliner and California Car coaches are equipped with higher- density seating and bicycle racks to permit transport of unboxed bicycles. Consists on the San Joaquin, Capitol Corridor, and Pacific Surfliner routes usually include between four and six cars, with one locomotive and a cab control car on the rear end.  Superliner I rebuilds  In 2007, Amtrak California paid for the repair of seven wreck-damaged Superliner Coaches owned by Amtrak in exchange for a six-year lease, intended to quickly add capacity on busy Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin trains. Four of the cars have been painted to match the \\"California car\\" livery, and three have been painted to match the \\"Surfliner\\" livery. Each car also has the current Amtrak logo on the middle left side of each car. Superliner I/II coaches from Amtrak's national fleet are used on some consists due to shortages of inter-city \\"Surfliner\\" & \\"California cars.\\"  Comet car single-level trainsets  A single-level \\"Comet car\\" trainset at Martinez Increasing ridership on the San Joaquin led Amtrak California to purchase 14 Comet IB rail cars from NJ Transit in 2008 for $75,000 per car. Caltrans paid approximately $20 million to have these former commuter cars refurbished and reconfigured to serve as intercity coaches at Amtrak's Beech Grove Shops. Caltrans has also paid to lease and refurbish 3 Horizon dinettes (used as caf√© cars) and 3 Non-Powered Control Units (old F40PH locomotives converted to serve as a cab/baggage car). Siemens Venture single-level trainsets A single-level Siemens Venture trainset test train In November 2017, the California Department of Transportation announced that it would be ordering seven Siemens Venture trainsets through its contractor Sumitomo Corporation. The states had initially contracted Sumitomo, which in turn subcontracted with Nippon Sharyo, to build the Next Generation Bi-Level Passenger Rail Car, but a prototype car failed a buff strength test in August 2015. After the test failure, canceled its deal with Nippon Sharyo, and turned to Siemens to be the new subcontractor. The cars are being built at the Siemens factory in Florin, California and will be hauled by California's existing fleet of diesel- electric locomotives. California's trainsets will be used exclusively on the San Joaquins service and will consist of seven cars each: four coaches with economy seating, two coaches with economy seating and vending machines, and one cab car (control car) with economy seating. The order includes 49 cars for California, formed into seven semi-permanently-coupled trainsets. Since Siemens Venture trainsets were originally designed to be used with high platforms the SJJPA modify all stations, adding two mini-high platforms (short lengths of high platform, each long enough for one door, with an accessible ramp to the longer low platform). The first trainset is supposed to go into revenue service in 2020. =Livery= Amtrak California utilizes a livery and logo that is different from the standard Amtrak colors. All state-contracted Thruway Motorcoach and state-owned locomotives and passenger cars, with the exception of equipment used on the \\"Pacific Surfliner\\" route, are painted in the \\"California Colors\\" of blue and yellow. Each permanently assigned passenger car is named after a geographical feature of California. The \\"Capitol Corridor\\" and \\"San Joaquin\\" trains are the two routes most identified with the Amtrak California image, since they extensively use \\"California Colored\\" equipment. The other state-supported rail route, the \\"Pacific Surfliner\\", uses a unique blue and silver paint scheme that is different from the other Amtrak California-branded trains. The NPCUs that operate on the Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin are painted differently from the locomotives, as they are painted in the old \\"Caltrain\\" locomotive livery, with an Amtrak California and Caltrans logo on the sides. The single level cars, both the Comet cars and the Horizon dinettes, have three stripes closest to the boarding doors, orange, blue and green, which resemble the NJ Transit livery that was previously used on the Comet cars.

Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 24. This is an active area of biological research that includes the study of the transformation of energy in living organisms and the study of thousands of different cellular processes such as cellular respiration and the many other metabolic and enzymatic processes that lead to production and utilization of energy in forms such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules. Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 27. That is, the goal of bioenergetics is to describe how living organisms acquire and transform energy in order to perform biological work. Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 24. The study of metabolic pathways is thus essential to bioenergetics. Overview Bioenergetics is the part of biochemistry concerned with the energy involved in making and breaking of chemical bonds in the molecules found in biological organisms.Ferrick D. A., Neilson A., Beeson C (2008). Advances in measuring cellular bioenergetics using extracellular flux. Drug Discovery Today, 13 5 & 6: 268‚Äì274. Accessed 9 April 2017. It can also be defined as the study of energy relationships and energy transformations and transductions in living organisms.Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 506. The ability to harness energy from a variety of metabolic pathways is a property of all living organisms that contains earth science. Growth, development, anabolism and catabolism are some of the central processes in the study of biological organisms, because the role of energy is fundamental to such biological processes.Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 28. Life is dependent on energy transformations; living organisms survive because of exchange of energy between living tissues/ cells and the outside environment. Some organisms, such as autotrophs, can acquire energy from sunlight (through photosynthesis) without needing to consume nutrients and break them down.Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 22. Other organisms, like heterotrophs, must intake nutrients from food to be able to sustain energy by breaking down chemical bonds in nutrients during metabolic processes such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Importantly, as a direct consequence of the first law of thermodynamics, autotrophs and heterotrophs participate in a universal metabolic network‚Äîby eating autotrophs (plants), heterotrophs harness energy that was initially transformed by the plants during photosynthesis.Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 22, 506. In a living organism, chemical bonds are broken and made as part of the exchange and transformation of energy. Energy is available for work (such as mechanical work) or for other processes (such as chemical synthesis and anabolic processes in growth), when weak bonds are broken and stronger bonds are made. The production of stronger bonds allows release of usable energy. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the main \\"energy currency\\" for organisms; the goal of metabolic and catabolic processes are to synthesize ATP from available starting materials (from the environment), and to break- down ATP (into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate) by utilizing it in biological processes. In a cell, the ratio of ATP to ADP concentrations is known as the \\"energy charge\\" of the cell. A cell can use this energy charge to relay information about cellular needs; if there is more ATP than ADP available, the cell can use ATP to do work, but if there is more ADP than ATP available, the cell must synthesize ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. Living organisms produce ATP from energy sources, mostly sunlight or O2, Schmidt-Rohr, K. (2020). \\"Oxygen Is the High- Energy Molecule Powering Complex Multicellular Life: Fundamental Corrections to Traditional Bioenergetics‚Äù. ACS Omega 5: 2221‚Äì2233. . mainly via oxidative phosphorylation. The terminal phosphate bonds of ATP are relatively weak compared with the stronger bonds formed when ATP is hydrolyzed (broken down by water) to adenosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate. Here it is the thermodynamically favorable free energy of hydrolysis that results in energy release; the phosphoanhydride bond between the terminal phosphate group and the rest of the ATP molecule does not itself contain this energy. Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 522‚Äì523. An organism's stockpile of ATP is used as a battery to store energy in cells.Hardie, D. G., Ross, F. A., Hawley, S. A (2012). AMPK: a nutrient and energy sensor that maintains energy homeostasis. Nature, 13, 251‚Äì262. Accessed 9 April 2017. Utilization of chemical energy from such molecular bond rearrangement powers biological processes in every biological organism. Living organisms obtain energy from organic and inorganic materials; i.e. ATP can be synthesized from a variety of biochemical precursors. For example, lithotrophs can oxidize minerals such as nitrites or forms of sulfur, such as elemental sulfur, sulfites, and hydrogen sulfide to produce ATP. In photosynthesis, autotrophs produce ATP using light energy, whereas heterotrophs must consume organic compounds, mostly including carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The amount of energy actually obtained by the organism is lower than the amount released in combustion of the food; there are losses in digestion, metabolism, and thermogenesis.FAO, Calculation of the Energy Content of Foods‚ÄîEnergy Conversion Factors. Environmental materials that an organism intakes are generally combined with oxygen to release energy, although some can also be oxidized anaerobically by various organisms. The bonds holding the molecules of nutrients together and in particular the bonds holding molecules of free oxygen together are relatively weak compared with the chemical bonds holding carbon dioxide and water together. The utilization of these materials is a form of slow combustion because the nutrients are reacted with oxygen (the materials are oxidized slowly enough that the organisms do not actually produce fire). The oxidation releases energy because stronger bonds (bonds within water and carbon dioxide) have been formed. This net energy may evolve as heat, which may be used by the organism for other purposes, such as breaking other bonds to do chemistry required for survival. Types of reactions * An exergonic reaction is a spontaneous chemical reaction that releases energy. It is thermodynamically favored, indexed by a negative value of ŒîG (Gibbs free energy). Over the course of a reaction, energy needs to be put in, and this activation energy drives the reactants from a stable state to a highly energetically unstable transition state to a more stable state that is lower in energy (see: reaction coordinate). The reactants are usually complex molecules that are broken into simpler products. The entire reaction is usually catabolic. Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 502. The release of energy (specifically of Gibbs free energy) is negative (i.e. ŒîG < 0) because the energy of the reactants is higher than that of the products. * An endergonic reaction is an anabolic chemical reaction that consumes energy. It is the opposite of an exergonic reaction. It has a positive ŒîG, for instance because ŒîH > 0, which means that it takes more energy to break the bonds of the reactant than the energy of the products offer, i.e. the products have weaker bonds than the reactants. Thus, endergonic reactions are thermodynamically unfavorable and will not occur on their own at constant temperature. Additionally, endergonic reactions are usually anabolic. Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 503. The free energy gained or lost (ŒîG) in a reaction can be calculated as follows: ŒîG = ŒîH ‚àí TŒîS where ‚àÜG = Gibbs free energy change, ‚àÜH = enthalpy change, T = temperature (in kelvins), and ‚àÜS = entropy change. Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 23. Examples of major bioenergetic processes * Glycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose into pyruvate, producing two molecules of ATP (per 1 molecule of glucose) in the process. Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 544. When a cell has a higher concentration of ATP than ADP (i.e. has a high energy charge), the cell cannot undergo glycolysis, releasing energy from available glucose to perform biological work. Pyruvate is one product of glycolysis, and can be shuttled into other metabolic pathways (gluconeogenesis, etc.) as needed by the cell. Additionally, glycolysis produces reducing equivalents in the form of NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), which will ultimately be used to donate electrons to the electron transport chain. * Gluconeogenesis is the opposite of glycolysis; when the cell's energy charge is low (the concentration of ADP is higher than that of ATP), the cell must synthesize glucose from carbon- containing biomolecules such as proteins, amino acids, fats, pyruvate, etc. Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 568. For example, proteins can be broken down into amino acids, and these simpler carbon skeletons are used to build/ synthesize glucose. * The citric acid cycle is a process of cellular respiration in which acetyl coenzyme A, synthesized from pyruvate dehydrogenase, is first reacted with oxaloacetate to yield citrate. Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 633. The remaining eight reactions produce other carbon-containing metabolites. These metabolites are successively oxidized, and the free energy of oxidation is conserved in the form of the reduced coenzymes FADH2 and NADH. Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 640. These reduced electron carriers can then be re- oxidized when they transfer electrons to the electron transport chain. * Ketosis is a metabolic process whereby ketone bodies are used by the cell for energy (instead of using glucose). Cells often turn to ketosis as a source of energy when glucose levels are low; e.g. during starvation. Owen, O.E. (2005) Ketone Bodies as a Fuel for the Brain during Starvation. The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 33:4, 246‚Äì251. * Oxidative phosphorylation is the process where the energy stored in the relatively weak double bonds of O2 is released in a controlled manner in the electron transport chain. Reducing equivalents such as NADPH, FADH2 and NADH can be used to donate electrons to a series of redox reactions that take place in electron transport chain complexes. Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 731. Nelson, David L., Cox, Michael M. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2013. Sixth ed., p. 734. These redox reactions take place in enzyme complexes situated within the mitochondrial membrane. These redox reactions transfer electrons \\"down\\" the electron transport chain, which is coupled to the proton motive force. This difference in proton concentration between the mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane space is used to drive ATP synthesis via ATP synthase. * Photosynthesis, another major bioenergetic process, is the metabolic pathway used by plants in which solar energy is used to synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide and water. This reaction takes place in the chloroplast. After glucose is synthesized, the plant cell can undergo photophosphorylation to produce ATP. Cotransport In August 1960, Robert K. Crane presented for the first time his discovery of the sodium-glucose cotransport as the mechanism for intestinal glucose absorption.Robert K. Crane, D. Miller and I. Bihler. \\"The restrictions on possible mechanisms of intestinal transport of sugars\\". In: Membrane Transport and Metabolism. Proceedings of a Symposium held in Prague, August 22‚Äì27, 1960. Edited by A. Kleinzeller and A. Kotyk. Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, 1961, pp. 439‚Äì449. Crane's discovery of cotransport was the first ever proposal of flux coupling in biology and was the most important event concerning carbohydrate absorption in the 20th century. Chemiosmotic theory One of the major triumphs of bioenergetics is Peter D. Mitchell's chemiosmotic theory of how protons in aqueous solution function in the production of ATP in cell organelles such as mitochondria. This work earned Mitchell the 1978 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. Other cellular sources of ATP such as glycolysis were understood first, but such processes for direct coupling of enzyme activity to ATP production are not the major source of useful chemical energy in most cells. Chemiosmotic coupling is the major energy producing process in most cells, being utilized in chloroplasts and several single-cell organisms in addition to mitochondria.

The corporation also owns Pierce Manufacturing, a fire apparatus manufacturer in Appleton, Wisconsin. Based in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the company employs approximately 16,000 people around the world. It is organized in four primary business groups: access equipment, defense, fire and emergency, and commercial. History Founded in 1917 as the Wisconsin Duplex Auto Company, the company was created to build a severe- duty four-wheel-drive truck. After the first prototype was built, the company began to develop rapidly. This first four-wheel-drive truck, known today as \\"Old Betsy\\", is still owned by Oshkosh Corporation and housed in the new Global Headquarters building in Oshkosh. The vehicle still runs and is used frequently in demonstrations and parades.Scott Eden, \\"The War Within: The Deal that Saved Oshkosh \\", TheStreet.com, November 19, 2009. The first mass- produced truck was the 2-ton Model A, with seven produced in 1918. The 3.5-ton Model B and 5-ton Model F followed. The Model TR, introduced in 1933, was a diversification for the company and was the first rubber tired earthmover ever built. The Model 50-50, introduced in 1955, was the first truck created specifically for the hauling of concrete. The first ARFF built by Oshkosh was a W Series truck delivered to the U.S. Coast Guard in 1953. Oshkosh has also produced aircraft tow tractors, and in 1968 the company designed and built the U-30, 45 of which were built for the U.S. Air Force to tow the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft. In 1976 the company won a U.S. Army contract to supply 744 M911 heavy equipment transporters, the first in a long line of U.S. Army contracts that now sees Oshkosh Defense as the sole supplier of medium and heavy tactical trucks to the U.S. Army and Marines. On August 25, 2015, Oshkosh was awarded the U.S. military's Joint Light Tactical Vehicle contract. The initial JLTV award is valued at $6.75 billion for up to 16,901 vehicles. The procurement objective for JLTV stands at 54,599 vehicles (49,099 Army; 5500 Marines), the estimated program cost being $47.6 billion. JLTV will partially replace the AM General Humvee. On November 7, 2017, the Oshkosh Common Council approved a proposal to sell part of the century-old Lake Shore Golf Course along the shore of Lake Butte des Morts to Oshkosh Corp. for its new headquarters. On November 22, 2017, the Oshkosh Corporation announced it would build the new headquarters on the golf course. The city plans to redevelop the rest of the golf course into a new public space. In February 2020, Oshkosh Corporation was named one of the 2020 World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. Locations Oshkosh Corporation is headquartered in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

One degree Brix is 1 gram of sucrose in 100 grams of solution and represents the strength of the solution as percentage by mass. If the solution contains dissolved solids other than pure sucrose, then the ¬∞Bx only approximates the dissolved solid content. The ¬∞Bx is traditionally used in the wine, sugar, carbonated beverage, fruit juice, maple syrup and honey industries. Comparable scales for indicating sucrose content are the degree Plato (¬∞P), which is widely used by the brewing industry, and the degree Balling, which is the oldest of the three systems and therefore mostly found in older textbooks, but also still in use in some parts of the world.Hough, J.S., D. E. Briggs, R. Stevens and T. W. Young, Malting and Brewing Science, Vol 2 Hopped Wort and Beer, Chapman & Hall, London,1971 A sucrose solution with an apparent specific gravity (20¬∞/20 ¬∞C) of 1.040 would be 9.99325 ¬∞Bx or 9.99359 ¬∞P while the representative sugar body, the International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (ICUMSA), which favours the use of mass fraction, would report the solution strength as 9.99249%. Because the differences between the systems are of little practical significance (the differences are less than the precision of most common instruments) and wide historical use of the Brix unit, modern instruments calculate mass fraction using ICUMSA official formulas but report the result as ¬∞Bx. Background In the early 1800s, Karl Balling, followed by Adolf Brix, and finally the Normal-Commissions under Fritz Plato, prepared pure sucrose solutions of known strength, measured their specific gravities and prepared tables of percent sucrose by mass vs. measured specific gravity. Balling measured specific gravity to 3 decimal places, Brix to 5, and the Normal-Eichungs Kommission to 6 with the goal of the Commission being to correct errors in the 5th and 6th decimal place in the Brix table. Equipped with one of these tables, a brewer wishing to know how much sugar was in his wort could measure its specific gravity and enter that specific gravity into the Plato table to obtain ¬∞Plato, which is the concentration of sucrose by percentage mass. Similarly, a vintner could enter the specific gravity of his must into the Brix table to obtain the ¬∞Bx, which is the concentration of sucrose by percent mass. It is important to point out that neither wort nor must is a solution of pure sucrose in pure water. Many other compounds are dissolved as well but these are either sugars, which behave very similarly to sucrose with respect to specific gravity as a function of concentration, or compounds which are present in small amounts (minerals, hop acids in wort, tannins, acids in must). In any case, even if ¬∞Bx is not representative of the exact amount of sugar in a must or fruit juice, it can be used for comparison of relative sugar content. Measurement =Specific gravity= As specific gravity was the basis for the Balling, Brix and Plato tables, dissolved sugar content was originally estimated by measurement of specific gravity using a hydrometer or pycnometer. In modern times, hydrometers are still widely used, but where greater accuracy is required, an electronic oscillating U-tube meter may be employed. Whichever means is used, the analyst enters the tables with specific gravity and takes out (using interpolation if necessary) the sugar content in percent by mass. If the analyst uses the Plato tables (maintained by the American Society of Brewing Chemists\\"ASBC Methods of Analysis\\", ASBC; St. Paul Table 1: Extract in Wort and Beer) he or she reports in ¬∞P. If using the Brix table (the current version of which is maintained by NIST and can be found on their website), he or she reports in ¬∞Bx. If using the ICUMSA tables,\\"ICUMSA Methods Book\\" op. cit. Specification and Standard SPS-4 Densimitry and Tables: Sucrose ‚Äì Official; Glucose, Fructose and Invert Sugars ‚Äì Official he or she would report in mass fraction (m.f.). It is not, typically, actually necessary to consult tables as the tabulated ¬∞Bx or ¬∞P value can be printed directly on the hydrometer scale next to the tabulated value of specific gravity or stored in the memory of the electronic U-tube meter or calculated from polynomial fits to the tabulated data. Both ICUMSA and ASBC have published suitable polynomials; in fact, the ICUMSA tables are calculated from the polynomials. The opposite is true with the ASBC polynomial. Also note that the tables in use today are not those published by Brix or Plato. Those workers measured true specific gravity reference to water at 4 ¬∞C using, respectively, 17.5 ¬∞C and 20 ¬∞C, as the temperature at which the density of a sucrose solution was measured. Both NBS and ASBC converted to apparent specific gravity at 20 ¬∞C/20 ¬∞C. The ICUMSA tables are based on more recent measurements on sucrose, fructose, glucose and invert sugar, and they tabulate true density and weight in air at 20 ¬∞C against mass fraction. =Refractive index= Dissolution of sucrose and other sugars in water changes not only its specific gravity but its optical properties, in particular its refractive index and the extent to which it rotates the plane of linearly polarized light. The refractive index, nD, for sucrose solutions of various percentage by mass has been measured and tables of nD vs. ¬∞Bx published. As with the hydrometer, it is possible to use these tables to calibrate a refractometer so that it reads directly in ¬∞Bx. Calibration is usually based on the ICUMSA tables,\\"ICUMSA Methods Book\\", op. cit.; Specification and Standard SPS-3 Refractometry and Tables ‚Äì Official; Tables A-F but the user of an electronic refractometer should verify this. =Infrared absorption= Sugars also have known infrared absorption spectra and this has made it possible to develop instruments for measuring sugar concentration using mid-infrared (MIR), non-dispersive infrared (NDIR), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) techniques. In-line instruments are available which allow constant monitoring of sugar content in sugar refineries, beverage plants, wineries, etc. As with any other instruments, MIR and FT-IR instruments can be calibrated against pure sucrose solutions and thus report in ¬∞Bx, but there are other possibilities with these technologies, as they have the potential to distinguish between sugars and interfering substances. Newer MIR and NDIR instruments have up to five analyzing channels that allow corrections for interference between ingredients.  Tables  =Specific gravity= Approximate values of ¬∞Bx can be computed from 231.61 √ó (S ‚àí 0.9977), where S is the apparent specific gravity of the solution at 20 ¬∞C/20 ¬∞C. More accurate values are available from: :^{\\\\circ}Bx = 182.4601S^3-775.6821S^2+1262.7794S-669.5622, derived from the NBS table with S as above. This should not be used above S = 1.17874 (40 ¬∞Bx). RMS disagreement between the polynomial and the NBS table is 0.0009 ¬∞Bx. The Plato scale can be approximated by the Lincoln Equation: :^{\\\\circ}P = (463-205S)(S-1) or values obtained with high accuracy with respect to the ASBC table from the ASBC polynomial: :^{\\\\circ}P = 135.997S^3 - 630.272S^2 + 1111.14S - 616.868 The difference between the ¬∞Bx and ¬∞P as calculated from the respective polynomials is: :^{\\\\circ}P-^{\\\\circ}Bx= 46.4631S^3-145.4101S^2+151.6394S-52.6942 The difference is generally less than ¬±0.0005 ¬∞Bx or ¬∞P with the exception being for weak solutions. As 0 ¬∞Bx is approached ¬∞P tend towards as much as 0.002 ¬∞P higher than the ¬∞Bx calculated for the same specific gravity. Disagreements of this order of magnitude can be expected as the NBS and the ASBC used slightly different values for the density of air and pure water in their calculations for converting to apparent specific gravity. It should be clear from these comments that Plato and Brix are, for all but the most exacting applications, the same. Note: all polynomials in this article are in a format that can be pasted directly into a spreadsheet. =Refractive index= When a refractometer is used, the Brix value can be obtained from the polynomial fit to the ICUMSA table: :^{\\\\circ}Bx= 11758.74(nD)^5 -88885.21(nD)^4 + 270177.93(nD)^3 - 413145.80(nD)^2 + 318417.95(nD) -99127.4536, where nD is the refractive index measured at the wavelength of the sodium D line (589.3 nm) at 20 ¬∞C. Temperature is very important as refractive index changes dramatically with temperature. Many refractometers have built in \\"Automatic Temperature Compensation\\" (ATC) which is based on knowledge of the way the refractive index of sucrose changes. For example, the refractive index of a sucrose solution of strength less than 10 ¬∞Bx is such that a 1 ¬∞C change in temperature would cause the Brix reading to shift by about 0.06 ¬∞Bx. Beer, conversely, exhibits a change with temperature about three times this much. It is important, therefore, that users of refractometers either make sure the sample and prism of the instrument are both at very close to 20 ¬∞C or, if that is difficult to ensure, readings should be taken at 2 temperatures separated by a few degrees, the change per degree noted and the final recorded value referenced to 20 ¬∞C using the Bx vs. Temp slope information. Usage The four scales are often used interchangeably since the differences are minor. *Brix is primarily used in fruit juice, wine making, carbonated beverage industry, starch and the sugar industry. *Plato is primarily used in brewing. *Balling appears on older saccharimeters and is still used in the South African wine industry and in some breweries. *Oechsle as direct reading for the sugar content is primary used in wine making in Germany, Switzerland and Luxembourg. Brix is used in the food industry for measuring the approximate amount of sugars in fruits, vegetables, juices, wine, soft drinks and in the starch and sugar manufacturing industry. Different countries use the scales in different industries: In brewing, the UK uses specific gravity X 1000; Europe uses Plato degrees; and the US use a mix of specific gravity, degrees Brix, degrees Baum√©, and degrees Plato. For fruit juices, 1.0 degree Brix is denoted as 1.0% sugar by mass. This usually correlates well with perceived sweetness. Modern optical Brix meters are divided into two categories. In the first are the Abbe-based instruments in which a drop of the sample solution is placed on a prism; the result is observed through an eyepiece. The critical angle (the angle beyond which light is totally reflected back into the sample) is a function of the refractive index and the operator detects this critical angle by noting where a dark-bright boundary falls on an engraved scale. The scale can be calibrated in Brix or refractive index. Often the prism mount contains a thermometer which can be used to correct to 20 ¬∞C in situations where measurement cannot be made at exactly that temperature. These instruments are available in bench and handheld versions. Digital refractometers also find the critical angle, but the light path is entirely internal to the prism. A drop of sample is placed on its surface, so the critical light beam never penetrates the sample. This makes it easier to read turbid samples. The light/dark boundary, whose position is proportional to the critical angle, is sensed by a CCD array. These meters are also available in bench top (laboratory) and portable (pocket) versions. This ability to easily measure Brix in the field makes it possible to determine ideal harvesting times of fruit and vegetables so that products arrive at the consumers in a perfect state or are ideal for subsequent processing steps such as vinification. Due to higher accuracy and the ability to couple it with other measuring techniques (%CO2 and %alcohol), most soft drink companies and breweries use an oscillating U-tube density meter. Refractometers are still commonly used for fruit juice. Brix and actual dissolved solids content When a sugar solution is measured by refractometer or density meter, the ¬∞Bx or ¬∞P value obtained by entry into the appropriate table only represents the amount of dry solids dissolved in the sample if the dry solids are exclusively sucrose. This is seldom the case. Grape juice (must), for example, contains little sucrose but does contain glucose, fructose, acids, and other substances. In such cases, the ¬∞Bx value clearly cannot be equated with the sucrose content, but it may represent a good approximation to the total sugar content. For example, an 11.0% by mass D-Glucose (\\"grape sugar\\") solution measured 10.9 ¬∞Bx using a hand held instrument. For these reasons, the sugar content of a solution obtained by use of refractometry with the ICUMSA table is often reported as \\"Refractometric Dry Substance\\" (RDS)\\"ICUMSA Methods Book, op. cit. Method GS4/3/8-13 (2009) \\"The Determination of Refractometric Dry Substance (RDS %) of Molasses ‚Äì Accepted and Very Pure Syrups (Liquid Sugars), Thick Juice and Run-off Syrups ‚Äì Official\\", which could be thought of as an equivalent sucrose content. Where it is desirable to know the actual dry solids content, empirical correction formulas can be developed based on calibrations with solutions similar to those being tested. For example, in sugar refining, dissolved solids can be accurately estimated from refractive index measurement corrected by an optical rotation (polarization) measurement. Alcohol has a higher refractive index (1.361) than water (1.333). As a consequence, a refractometer measurement made on a sugar solution once fermentation has begun will result in a reading substantially higher than the actual solids content. Thus, an operator must be certain that the sample they are testing has not begun to ferment. Brix or Plato measurements based on specific gravity are also affected by fermentation, but in the opposite direction; as ethanol is less dense than water, an ethanol/sugar/water solution gives a Brix or Plato reading which is artificially low.

Built in 1824 and much modified in the 1880s, it is now a museum and art gallery which contains the collection of George Holt, a shipping-line owner and former resident, in its original setting. It includes work by Thomas Gainsborough, Joshua Reynolds, Edwin Landseer, John Everett Millais and J. M. W. Turner. The house was bequeathed to the city of Liverpool by Holt's daughter, Emma Georgina Holt, in 1944 and is managed by National Museums Liverpool. History =Structure= Sudley, as it was originally known, was completed in 1824 on land formerly owned by the Tarleton family as a two-storey ashlar house for Nicholas Robinson, a corn merchant who was Lord Mayor of Liverpool in 1828-29\\\\. Robinson paid ¬£4500 for the land. Upon the death of Robinson in 1854, the house passed to his two daughters, who died in 1883. The house and estate, comprising just under , was put up for sale in 1880. It became the home of Victorian shipping-line owner and merchant George Holt in 1884. Pevsner says that the original design was probably by John Whiteside Casson and was modified by James Rhind when Holt purchased it. However, National Museums Liverpool say that the original architect is unknown, although there are features that suggest it may have been Thomas Harrison. The structural modifications, which involved moving the main entrance from the east facade to that of the north and also adding an office wing on the west, have significantly affected the interior. The original staircase with Doric fluted columns, above which is a dome and glazed oculus, became exposed and, according to Pevsner, this has left the surrounding internal features as \\"a bit of a mess\\". The new two-storey wing added two bays to the five that already existed on the south side, as well as a parapeted prospect tower to its rear. =Art and life= An Angel Playing a Flageolet by Edward Burne- Jones, in the collection of Sudley House George Holt was an art collector whose collection derived mainly from purchases from dealers and at exhibitions rather than from commissions. Among his most significant purchases, which remain in the house today, were J. M. W. Turner's Rosenau, depicting Prince Albert's home in Germany, and Gainborough's Viscountess Folkestone. Also among the collection are paintings by Richard Parkes Bonington, Edwin Landseer, John Everett Millais, Joshua Reynolds, George Romney and the Pre-Raphaelites. George Melly, the jazz singer, critic and art historian, who was related to the Holt family, has described aspects of life at Sudley House during his various childhood visits in the 1930s, when it was owned by George Holt's only child, Emma Georgina Holt. According to Melly, her father, who died in 1896, had left an estate valued at over ¬£600,000. The house and the art collection, which is described by ArtUK as being \\"the only British collection of its kind still in its original setting\\", were bequeathed to the city in 1944 by Emma Holt and is now (2016) managed by National Museums Liverpool. Refurbishment Sudley House closed for two years for a ¬£1 million refurbishment, re-opening on 26 May 2007. This included redecorating in the Aesthetic style of George Holt's era and also significantly modifying the first floor, where three new attractions were incorporated as follows: * Two childhood rooms: how Victorian children learned and played. Exhibits include a huge Victorian dolls' house, educational toys, fashion dolls and pots used at mealtimes by rich and poor children. * Costume room: regularly changing displays of historic clothing. One such exhibition showed a small part of the vast collection of Emily Tinne and her children, which is held by National Museums Liverpool. * A gallery for temporary exhibitions Pevsner says that those modifications create an architectural \\"tension\\" between showing the house as a house and as a museum. The ground floor library now includes a display about the Holt family. This includes an introductory film, family portraits and a model of the steamer Verdi, which belonged to the Lamport and Holt shipping company that George Holt had co-founded in 1845.

The Cyclops64 project aims to create the first \\"supercomputer on a chip\\". History Cyclops64 is part of the Blue Gene effort, to produce the next several generations of supercomputers. The projects were started in response to the announced construction of the Earth Simulator. Cyclops64 is a cooperative project between the United States Department of Energy (which is partially funding the project), the U.S. Department of Defense, industry (IBM in particular), and academia. The architecture was conceived by Seymour Cray Award winner Monty Denneau, who is currently leading the project. Architecture overview Each 64-bit Cyclops64 chip (processor) will run at 500 megahertz and contain 80 processors. Each processor will have two thread units and a floating point unit. A thread unit is an in-order 64-bit RISC core with 32 kB scratch pad memory, using a 60-instruction subset of the Power ISA instruction set. Five processors share a 32 kB instruction cache. The processors will be connected with a 96 port, 7 stage non-internally blocking crossbar switch. They will communicate with each other via global interleaved memory (memory that can be written to and read by all threads) in the SRAM. The theoretical peak performance of a Cyclops64 chip is 80 gigaflops (this assumes a continuous stream of multiply‚Äìaccumulate instructions, each of which are counted as two floating-point operations). A full system (consisting of 2 thread units per processor, 80 processors per chip, 1 chip per board, 48 boards per midplane, 3 midplanes per rack, and 96 (12 x 8) racks per system) would contain 13,824 C64 chips, consisting of 1,105,920 processors capable of running 2,211,840 concurrent threads. Software Cyclops64 exposes much of the underlying hardware to the programmer, allowing the programmer to write very high performance, finely tuned software. One negative consequence is that efficiently programming Cyclops64 is difficult. The system is expected to support TiNy-Threads (a threading library developed at the University of Delaware) and POSIX Threads. Design and fabrication Verification testing and system software development is being done at the University of Delaware.

Born in Halle, Germany, he was arrested by Nazis on the night of 9 November 1938, known as Kristallnacht. Briefly interned at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp (1938‚Äì1939), he escaped with his younger brother Wolfgang to Great Britain, where his parents later joined him. Emil's older brother Ernst-Alexander, who refused to leave Germany, was killed in the Holocaust. Held by the British as an enemy alien after the outbreak of World War II, Fackenheim was sent to Canada in 1940, where he was interned at a remote internment camp near Sherbrooke, Quebec.Chicago Jewish Star, 9 May 2008. He was freed afterward and served as the Interim Rabbi at Temple Anshe Shalom in Hamilton, Ontario, from 1943 to 1948. After this he enrolled in the graduate philosophy department of the University of Toronto and received a PhD from the University of Toronto with a dissertation on medieval Arabic philosophy (1945) and became Professor of Philosophy (1948‚Äì1984). He was among the original Editorial Advisors of the scholarly journal Dionysius. In 1971, he received an honorary doctorate from Sir George Williams University, which later became Concordia University. Fackenheim researched the relationship of the Jews with God, believing that the Holocaust must be understood as an imperative requiring Jews to carry on Jewish existence and the survival of the State of Israel. He emigrated to Israel in 1984. \\"He was always saying that continuing Jewish life and denying Hitler a posthumous victory was the 614th law,\\" referring to the 613 mitzvot given to the Jews in the Torah.  Background Emil Fackenheim created this concept of the \\"614th commandment\\" (or \\"614th mitzvah.\\") The \\"614th Commandment\\" can be interpreted as a moral imperative that Jews not use the facts of the Holocaust to give up on God, Judaism or‚Äîin the case of secular Jews as well‚Äîon the continuing survival of the Jewish people, thereby giving Hitler a \\"posthumous victory\\". The meaning of this imperative has been the subject of serious dialogue both within and beyond the Jewish community. Opposition to the goals of Hitler is a moral touchstone that has implications for several sensitive issues. = A new moral imperative = Traditional Jewish law contains 613 mitzvot (commandments) as compiled by Maimonides. These laws‚Äî365 of which are negative (e.g. \\"Thou shalt not...\\") and 248 of which are positive‚Äîcover all aspects of life. Fackenheim asserted that tradition could not anticipate the Holocaust, so one more law, a 614th Commandment, became necessary. \\"Thou shalt not hand Hitler posthumous victories. To despair of the God of Israel is to continue Hitler's work for him.\\" This proposes that people of Jewish heritage have a moral obligation to observe their faith and thus frustrate Hitler's goal of eliminating Judaism from the earth. Fackenheim came to this conclusion slowly. A professor of philosophy at the University of Toronto and a Reform rabbi, he did not become a Zionist until 1967, when his reaction to the Holocaust and its implications for Jewish law crystallized: > It was at a meeting, just before the Six-Day War. It was a meeting in New > York, and I had to make a speech. Before that, the Holocaust had never been > essential to my ideology. However, when the chairman said, 'You've got to > face it,' I had to face it. I said the most important thing I ever said. = Terminology = In dialogue about this subject, choice of words is a sensitive matter. Within the Jewish community, many reject Fackenheim's assertion that this could be called a commandment. The Torah already forbids adding additional commandments. Wording that expresses this concept in the form of a commandment may also give offense.Deuteronomy 13:1 This becomes a contentious point because references to a \\"614th commandment\\" are not unique to Fackenheim. This concise term has other shortcomings besides the theological objection. To count this as an addition to Jewish law is an implicit statement that it applies only to Jews. Opposition to the goals of Hitler is a universal concept. Gentiles can respect it by studying the Holocaust and opposing antisemitism. In Christian contexts this ideal sometimes appears as the \\"11th commandment.\\" Christians generally recognize 10 commandments of the Old Testament. This may give unintentional offense to Jews who recognize a different 11th commandment and may lead to confusion with other unrelated ideas that Christians have called an 11th commandment. Jesus stated two commandments: \\"Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, soul, mind and strength.\\" and \\"Love thy neighbor as thyself.\\" Although there is no single formulation that expresses this concept in terms that avoid controversy, posthumous victories and Hitler appear in most descriptions. = Implications =  Zionism  Fackenheim applied this reasoning to the state of Israel and its Law of Return as a necessity to prevent a second Holocaust. Had a Jewish state existed in the 1930s, it could have accepted Jewish refugees and rescued large numbers of people. This opinion carries clout with most Jewish people although the specifics of how to apply it in contemporary politics is a subject of debate. Boris Shusteff invokes it in a conservative opposition to Israeli withdrawal from settlements.GAMLA: News & Views from Israel ::: The 614th Commandment Despite the explicit connection to Zionism, few sources mention Hitler and posthumous victories in reference to Islam. Christian Palestinian Sami A. Aldeeb Abu-Sahlieh of the Swiss Institute of Comparative Law in Lausanne paraphrases it ironically in a defense of Palestinian interests. Where a form of it appears in the Asia Times as part of a quote from Robert Novak, the cultural resonance appears to go unnoticed.  Holocaust remembrance  The concept encounters broad acceptance in connection with Holocaust remembrance. In the late twentieth century, efforts to document the memories of remaining Holocaust survivors echoed the notion that preserving these facts for future generations was a way to keep Hitler and his ideas in the grave. A guide for British primary school teachers gives the concept in a guide for informing children about the Holocaust. Richard A. Cohen of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte cites it in an essay, \\"The Holocaust is a Christian Issue.\\"  Caution against antisemitism  The phrase finds resonance within Christian communities as a rebuke against antisemitism. Methodist minister Rev. Robert A. Hill quotes Fackenheim in a sermon with this context: > ...the fact is that Christianity has been pervasively guilty of latent and > patent anti-Semitism and the Gospel of John has been one of its sources. We > have and can learn from this failure, by carefully monitoring our use of > religious language...and our Jewish brothers and sisters can teach us to > continue, with Jacob, to wrestle with God.  Conversion to other religions  Within the broader context of religious tolerance, this concept applies to the sensitive subjects of conversion and intermarriage. Gregory Baum, a German-born Catholic theologian and Professor Emeritus in Religious Studies at McGill University in Montreal, expresses the effect of this concept on Christian views toward conversion. From the perspective of most Christian faiths, whose doctrines normally advocate conversion of nonbelievers, this represents a deep respect for Fackenheim's concept: > After Auschwitz the Christian churches no longer wish to convert the Jews. > While they may not be sure of the theological grounds that dispense them > from this mission, the churches have become aware that asking the Jews to > become Christians is a spiritual way of blotting them out of existence and > thus only reinforces the effects of the Holocaust.Auschwitz: Beginning of a > New Era? p. 113. Fackenheim's affirmation of his Jewish heritage, although embraced by many other Holocaust survivors, was by no means universal. Physicist Lise Meitner had been born and brought up Jewish. She rejected newspaper attempts to characterize her as a Jew following the bombing of Hiroshima when the press learned that she had been the first scientist to recognize nuclear fission. Decades before Hitler rose to power she had become a Lutheran. Although the Nazis stole her savings and ruined her career she refused to work on the bomb or let Hitler define her identity.Lise Meitner: A Life in Science  Intermarriage  Intermarriages between Jews and non-Jews are relatively common in the United States and Canada. Several circumstances complicate these unions from the perspective of the Jewish community. Different movements within Judaism recognize different standards for conversion to Judaism and transmission of their heritage. Social pressure generally falls upon men to marry Jewish women because all movements recognize a Jewish woman's offspring as Jews. (Note: Starting in the late 1960s and lasting until the 90s‚Äì00s, several movements in Judaism ceased recognizing Jewish women's offspring as Jews if the women intermarried. The Reconstructionist movement of the United States, followed by the Reform movement of the U.S. in 1983, declared that they would accept the children of either an intermarried Jewish father or an intermarried Jewish mother as Jews only if the children had been raised as Jews. If the children were not raised as Jews, and later wished to join the Reform or Reconstructionist movements in the U.S., they had to convert. The Society for Humanistic Judaism in the U.S. will accept the children based on their own self-identification. The Orthodox and Conservative movements in the U.S. still require the conversion of patrilineal [Jewish fathers] children, but accept the children of Jewish mothers, regardless of how they are raised. Jewish Renewal rabbis do not have denominational guidelines, and go on a case- by-case basis.) A puzzling twist to this controversy is the fact, apparently not well known, that Prof. Fackenheim himself was intermarried, and the Jewishness of one of his children was rejected by an Israeli Orthodox court, even though that son was converted via Orthodox ritual as a child, and is a citizen of Israel. (See, \\"Rabbinical Court casts doubt on conversion of son of famed Jewish theologian\\" in the Jerusalem Post, January 19, 2009). According to this news article, his wife converted to Judaism some time after the marriage. Jews using Fackenheim's admonition not to give posthumous victories to Hitler as a reason to dissuade people from intermarrying are apparently not aware that Fackenheim was himself intermarried. = Criticism = Rabbi Toba Spitzer finds this idea compelling yet incomplete. In a Passover essay for SocialAction.com she addresses it sympathetically before embracing the Passover tradition and its Seder ritual as a more meaningful story: > ...of a people born in slavery, freed by their God, and taken on a > transformational journey. It is the story of the steps taken towards > becoming a community bound by a holy covenant, where social relationships > are defined by the Godly principles of tzedek and chesed, justice and love. Rabbi Marc Gellman rejects it outright in a 2005 Newsweek column: > I am Jewish because my mother is Jewish, and, more importantly, because I > believe Judaism is loving, just, joyous, hopeful and true. I am not Jewish, > and I did not teach my children or my students to be Jewish, just to spite > Hitler. The same criticism was formulated by Jewish philosopher Michael Wyschogrod in his 1971 review of God's Presence in History. Wyschogrod questioned the value of a definition of Judaism that merely inverts antisemitism into a bigoted \\"semitism.\\" The uniqueness of Auschwitz as a historical event, moreover, is a dubious distinction. \\"It is necessary to recognize that, from any universally humanistic framework, the destruction of European Jewry is one notable chapter in the long record of man's inhumanity against man.\\"Michael Wyschogrod, \\"Faith and the Holocaust: A Review Essay of Emil Fackenheim's God's Presence in History,\\" Judaism 20 (1970‚Äì71). p. 292. Not satisfied with criticism, however, Wyschogrod offered a traditional explanation of the Jewish claim to uniqueness and chosenness formulated in positive terms. > The fate of Israel is of central concern because Israel is the elect people > of God through whom God's redemptive work is done in the world. However > tragic human suffering is on the human plane, what happens to Israel is > directly tied to its role as that nation to which God attaches His name and > through which He will redeem man. He who strikes Israel, therefore, engages > himself in battle with God and it is for this reason that the history of > Israel is the fulcrum of human history. The suffering of others must, > therefore, be seen in the light of Israel's suffering. The travail of man is > not abandoned, precisely because Israel suffers and, thereby, God's presence > is drawn into human history and redemption enters the horizon of human > existence. Focusing not on Fackenheim's conception of Jewish identity but on Zionism, renowned scholar Daniel Shoag presents a critique of this view from within the Jewish community in The Harvard Israel Review: > While Fackenheim's sentiments about the need for Jewish self-reliance in the > form of a Jewish state are immensely popular, Fackenheim fails to locate a > religious or divine source for his moral imperative. For Fackenheim, self- > defense, and its manifestation in Zionism, are not religious values but > rather things that precede religious value or stand outside of it. Thus > Fackenheim locates the significance of the Jewish State in the Holocaust > rather than in traditional Judaism... Perhaps the strongest rejection of Fackenheim's idea of the 614th commandment comes from Rabbi Harold M. Schulweiss: > We abuse the Holocaust when it becomes a cudgel against others who have > their claims of suffering. The Shoah must not be misused in the contest of > one-downsmanship with other victims of brutality. ... The Shoah has become > our instant raison d'etre, the short-cut answer to the penetrating questions > of our children: 'Why should I not marry out of the faith? Why should I join > a synagogue? Why should I support Israel? Why should I be Jewish?' We have > relied on a singular imperative: 'Thou shalt not give Hitler a posthumous > victory.' That answer will not work. To live in spite, to say 'no' to Hitler > is a far cry from living 'yes' to Judaism. Rabbi Michael Goldberg has developed this sort of criticism in his book Why Should the Jews Survive?: Looking Past the Holocaust Toward a Jewish Future. = Conclusion = During Fackenheim's last interview in 2000 he confronted the question, \\"Do you think Israel can ever come to the point where it doesn't have to be in a state of resistance?\\" > I think it will be a very long time. But I would say this. Will the time > ever come when we can say Hitler's shadow is gone? I think, yes, it will > come when Israel is accepted in peace with its neighbor states. But it > doesn't look like it will happen soon.

Tree rings are wider when conditions favor growth, narrower when times are difficult. Other properties of the annual rings, such as maximum latewood density (MXD) have been shown to be better proxies than simple ring width. Using tree rings, scientists have estimated many local climates for hundreds to thousands of years previous. By combining multiple tree-ring studies (sometimes with other climate proxy records), scientists have estimated past regional and global climates. Advantages Tree rings are especially useful as climate proxies in that they can be well-dated via dendrochronology, i.e. matching of the rings from sample to sample. This allows extension backwards in time using deceased tree samples, even using samples from buildings or from archeological digs. Another advantage of tree rings is that they are clearly demarked in annual increments, as opposed to other proxy methods such as boreholes. Furthermore, tree rings respond to multiple climatic effects (temperature, moisture, cloudiness), so that various aspects of climate (not just temperature) can be studied. However, this can be a double-edged sword. Limitations Along with the advantages of dendroclimatology are some limitations: confounding factors, geographic coverage, annular resolution, and collection difficulties. The field has developed various methods to partially adjust for these challenges. =Confounding factors= There are multiple climate and non-climate factors as well as nonlinear effects that impact tree ring width. Methods to isolate single factors (of interest) include botanical studies to calibrate growth influences and sampling of \\"limiting stands\\" (those expected to respond mostly to the variable of interest). Climate factors Climate factors that affect trees include temperature, precipitation, sunlight, and wind. To differentiate among these factors, scientists collect information from \\"limiting stands.\\" An example of a limiting stand is the upper elevation treeline: here, trees are expected to be more affected by temperature variation (which is \\"limited\\") than precipitation variation (which is in excess). Conversely, lower elevation treelines are expected to be more affected by precipitation changes than temperature variation. This is not a perfect work-around as multiple factors still impact trees even at the \\"limiting stand,\\" but it helps. In theory, collection of samples from nearby limiting stands of different types (e.g. upper and lower treelines on the same mountain) should allow mathematical solution for multiple climate factors. Non-climate factors Non-climate factors include soil, tree age, fire, tree-to-tree competition, genetic differences, logging or other human disturbance, herbivore impact (particularly sheep grazing), pest outbreaks, disease, and CO2 concentration. For factors which vary randomly over space (tree to tree or stand to stand), the best solution is to collect sufficient data (more samples) to compensate for confounding noise. Tree age is corrected for with various statistical methods: either fitting spline curves to the overall tree record or using similar aged trees for comparison over different periods (regional curve standardization). Careful examination and site selection helps to limit some confounding effects, for example picking sites undisturbed by modern man. Non-linear effects In general, climatologists assume a linear dependence of ring width on the variable of interest (e.g. moisture). However, if the variable changes enough, response may level off or even turn opposite. The home gardener knows that one can underwater or overwater a house plant. In addition, it is possible that interaction effects may occur (for example \\"temperature times precipitation\\" may affect growth as well as temperature and precipitation on their own. Here, also, the \\"limiting stand\\" helps somewhat to isolate the variable of interest. For instance, at the upper treeline, where the tree is \\"cold limited\\", it's unlikely that nonlinear effects of high temperature (\\"inverted quadratic\\") will have numerically significant impact on ring width over the course of a growing season. Botanical inferences to correct for confounding factors Botanical studies can help to estimate the impact of confounding variables and in some cases guide corrections for them. These experiments may be either ones where growth variables are all controlled (e.g. in a greenhouse), partially controlled (e.g. FACE [Free Airborne Concentration Enhancement] experiments‚Äîadd ref), or where conditions in nature are monitored. In any case, the important thing is that multiple growth factors are carefully recorded to determine what impacts growth. (Insert Fennoscandanavia paper reference). With this information, ring width response can be more accurately understood and inferences from historic (unmonitored) tree rings become more certain. In concept, this is like the limiting stand principle, but it is more quantitative‚Äîlike a calibration. Divergence Problematics  The divergence problem is the disagreement between the temperatures measured by the thermometers (instrumental temperatures) on one side, and the temperatures reconstructed from the latewood density or width of tree rings on the other side, at many treeline sites in northern forests. While the rendering and analysis of data from thermometer records largely suggest a substantial warming trend, tree rings from these particular sites do not display a corresponding change in their maximum latewood density or, in some cases, their width. This does not apply to all such studies. Where this applies, a temperature trend extracted from tree rings alone would not show any substantial warming. The temperature graphs calculated from instrumental temperatures and from these tree ring proxies thus \\"diverge\\" from one another since the 1950s, which is the origin of the term. This divergence raises obvious questions of whether other, unrecognized divergences have occurred in the past, prior to the era of thermometers. There is evidence suggesting that the divergence is caused by human activities, and so confined to the recent past, but use of affected proxies can lead to overestimation of past temperatures, understating the current warming trend. There is continuing research into explanations and ways to reconcile this the discrepancy between analysis of tree ring data and thermometer based data. =Geographic coverage= Trees do not cover the Earth. Polar and marine climates cannot be estimated from tree rings. In perhumid tropical regions, Australia and southern Africa, trees generally grow all year round and don't show clear annual rings. In some forest areas, the tree growth is too much influenced by multiple factors (no \\"limiting stand\\") to allow clear climate reconstruction. The coverage difficulty is dealt with by acknowledging it and by using other proxies (e.g. ice cores, corals) in difficult areas. In some cases it can be shown that the parameter of interest (temperature, precipitation, etc.) varies similarly from area to area, for example by looking at patterns in the instrumental record. Then one is justified in extending the dendroclimatology inferences to areas where no suitable tree ring samples are obtainable. =Annular resolution= Tree rings show the impact on growth over an entire growing season. Climate changes deep in the dormant season (winter) will not be recorded. In addition, different times of the growing season may be more important than others (i.e. May versus September) for ring width. However, in general the ring width is used to infer the overall climate change during the corresponding year (an approximation). Another problem is \\"memory\\" or autocorrelation. A stressed tree may take a year or two to recover from a hard season. This problem can be dealt with by more complex modeling (a \\"lag\\" term in the regression) or by reducing the skill estimates of chronologies. =Collection difficulties= Tree rings must be obtained from nature, frequently from remote regions. This means that special efforts are needed to map sites properly. In addition, samples must be collected in difficult (often sloping terrain) conditions. Generally, tree rings are collected using a hand- held borer device, that requires skill to get a good sample. The best samples come from felling a tree and sectioning it. However, this requires more danger and does damage to the forest. It may not be allowed in certain areas, particularly with the oldest trees in undisturbed sites (which are the most interesting scientifically). As with all experimentalists, dendroclimatologists must, at times, decide to make the best of imperfect data, rather than resample. This tradeoff is made more difficult, because sample collection (in the field) and analysis (in the lab) may be separated significantly in time and space. These collection challenges mean that data gathering is not as simple or cheap as conventional laboratory science. Other measurements Initial work focused on measuring the tree ring width‚Äîthis is simple to measure and can be related to climate parameters. But the annual growth of the tree leaves other traces. In particular maximum latewood density (MXD) is another metric used for estimating environmental variables. It is, however, harder to measure. Other properties (e.g. isotope or chemical trace analysis) have also been tried most notably by L. M. Libby in her 1974 paper \\"Temperature Dependence of Isotope Ratios in Tree Rings\\". In theory, multiple measurements on the same ring will allow differentiation of confounding factors (e.g. precipitation and temperature). However, most studies are still based on ring widths at limiting stands. Measuring radiocarbon concentrations in tree rings has proven to be useful in recreating past sunspot activity, with data now extending back over 11,000 years.

Paleoclimatology Dendrology ","title":"Dendroclimatology"},{"id":"1369241","text":"In mathematics, the polar decomposition of a square real or complex matrix A is a factorization of the form A = U P, where U is a unitary matrix and P is a positive-semidefinite Hermitian matrix, both square and of the same size. Section 2.5 Intuitively, if a real n\\\\times n matrix A is interpreted as a linear transformation of n-dimensional space \\\\mathbb{R}^n, the polar decomposition separates it into a rotation or reflection U of \\\\mathbb{R}^n, and a scaling of the space along a set of n orthogonal axes. The polar decomposition of a square matrix A always exists. If A is invertible, the decomposition is unique, and the factor P will be positive-definite. In that case, A can be written uniquely in the form A = U e^X , where U is unitary and X is the unique self-adjoint logarithm of the matrix P. Theorem 2.17 This decomposition is useful in computing the fundamental group of (matrix) Lie groups. Section 13.3 The polar decomposition can also be defined as A = P U where P is symmetric positive-definite but is in general a different matrix, while U is the same matrix as above. The polar decomposition of a matrix can be seen as the matrix analog of the polar form of a complex number z as z = u r, where r is its absolute value (a non-negative real number), and u is a complex number with unit norm (an element of the circle group). Properties The polar decomposition of the complex conjugate of A is given by \\\\overline{A} = \\\\overline{U}\\\\overline{P}. Note that :\\\\det A = \\\\det U \\\\det P = e^{i\\\\theta}\\\\cdot r gives the corresponding polar decomposition of the determinant of A, since \\\\det U = e^{i\\\\theta} and \\\\det P = r = \\\\det A. In particular, if A has determinant 1 then both U and P have determinant 1. The positive-semidefinite matrix P is always unique, even if A is singular, and is denoted as :P = \\\\left(A^* A\\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{2}, where A denotes the conjugate transpose of A. The uniqueness of P ensures that this expression is well- defined. The uniqueness is guaranteed by the fact that A^* A is a positive- semidefinite Hermitian matrix and, therefore, has a unique positive- semidefinite Hermitian square root. Lemma 2.18 If A is invertible, then P is positive-definite, thus also invertible and the matrix U is uniquely determined by :U = AP^{-1}. =Intuitive interpretation= A real square m\\\\times m matrix A can be interepreted as the linear transformation of \\\\mathbb{R}^m that takes a column vector x to A x. Then, in the polar decomposition A = RP, the factor R is an m\\\\times m real orthonormal matrix. The polar decomposition then can be seen as expressing the linear transformation defined by A into a scaling of the space \\\\mathbb{R}^m along each eigenvector e_i of A by a scale factor \\\\sigma_i (the action of P), followed by a single rotation or reflection of \\\\mathbb{R}^m (the action of R). Alternatively, the decomposition A=P R expresses the transformation defined by A as a rotation (R) followed by a scaling (P) along certain orthogonal directions. The scale factors are the same, but the directions are different. =Relation to the SVD= In terms of the singular value decomposition (SVD) of A, A = W\\\\Sigma V^*, one has :\\\\begin{align} P &= V\\\\Sigma V^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ U &= WV^* \\\\end{align} where U, V, and W are unitary matrices (called orthogonal matrices if the field is the reals \\\\mathbb{R}). This confirms that P is positive- definite and U is unitary. Thus, the existence of the SVD is equivalent to the existence of polar decomposition. One can also decompose A in the form :A = P'U Here U is the same as before and P' is given by :P' = UPU^{-1} = \\\\left(AA^*\\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{2} = W \\\\Sigma W^*. This is known as the left polar decomposition, whereas the previous decomposition is known as the right polar decomposition. Left polar decomposition is also known as reverse polar decomposition. The matrix A is normal if and only if P'=P. Then U\\\\Sigma=\\\\Sigma U, and it is possible to diagonalise U with a unitary similarity matrix S that commutes with \\\\Sigma, giving SUS^*=\\\\Phi^{-1}, where \\\\Phi is a diagonal unitary matrix of phases e^{i\\\\varphi}. Putting Q=VS^*, one can then re-write the polar decomposition as :A = \\\\left(Q \\\\Phi Q^*\\\\right)\\\\left(Q \\\\Sigma Q^*\\\\right),\\\\, so A then thus also has a spectral decomposition :A = Q \\\\Lambda Q^* with complex eigenvalues such that \\\\Lambda\\\\Lambda^* = \\\\Sigma^2 and a unitary matrix of complex eigenvectors Q. The polar decomposition of a square invertible real matrix A is of the form :A = AR where A = \\\\left(AA^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{2} is a positive-definite matrix and R = A^{-1}A is an orthogonal matrix. = Construction and proofs of existence = The core idea behind the construction of the polar decomposition is similar to that used to compute the singular-value decomposition. For any A, the matrix A^* A is Hermitian and positive semi-definite, and therefore unitarily equivalent to a positive semi-definite diagonal matrix. Let then V be the unitary such that A^* A = VDV^*, with D diagonal and positive semi- definite.  Case of A normal  If A is normal, then it is unitarily equivalent to a diagonal matrix: A = V\\\\Lambda V^* for some unitary V and some diagonal matrix \\\\Lambda. We can then writeA = V\\\\Phi_\\\\Lambda \\\\LambdaV^* = \\\\underbrace{\\\\left(V\\\\Phi_\\\\Lambda V^*\\\\right)}_{\\\\equiv U} \\\\underbrace{\\\\left(V \\\\Lambda V^*\\\\right)}_{\\\\equiv P},where \\\\Phi_\\\\Lambda is a diagonal matrix with containing the phases of the elements of \\\\Lambda, that is, (\\\\Phi_\\\\Lambda)_{ii}\\\\equiv \\\\Lambda_{ii}/ \\\\Lambda_{ii} or (\\\\Phi_\\\\Lambda)_{ii} an arbitrary complex number with unit magnitude when \\\\Lambda_{ii}=0. The polar decomposition is thus A=UP, with U and P diagonal in the eigenbasis of A and with eigenvalues equal to the phases and absolute values of the eigenvalues of A, respectively.  Case of A invertible  From the singular-value decomposition, it can be shown that a A is invertible if and only if A^* A (equivalently, AA^*) is. Moreover, this is true if and only if the eigenvalues of A^* A are all not zeroNote how this implies, by the positivity of A^* A, that the eigenvalues are all real and strictly positive.. In this case, the polar decomposition is directly obtained by writing :A = A\\\\left(A^* A\\\\right)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\left(A^* A\\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{2}, and observing that A\\\\left(A^* A\\\\right)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} is unitary. To see this, we can exploit the spectral decomposition of A^* A to write A\\\\left(A^* A\\\\right)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} = AVD^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}V^*. In this expression, V^* is unitary because V is. To show that also AVD^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} is unitary, we can use the SVD to write A = WD^\\\\frac{1}{2}V^*, so that :AV D^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} = WD^\\\\frac{1}{2}V^* VD^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} = W, where again W is unitary by construction. Yet another way to directly show the unitarity of A\\\\left(A^* A\\\\right)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} is to note that, writing the SVD of A in terms of rank-1 matrices as A = \\\\sum_k s_k v_k w_k^*, where s_kare the singular values of A, we have A\\\\left(A^* A\\\\right)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} = \\\\left(\\\\sum_j \\\\lambda_j v_j w_j^*\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\sum_k \\\\lambda_k^{-1} w_k w_k^*\\\\right) = \\\\sum_k \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_k}{\\\\lambda_k} v_k w_k^*, which directly implies the unitarity of A\\\\left(A^* A\\\\right)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} because a matrix is unitary if and only if its singular values have unitary absolute value. Note how, from the above construction, it follows that the unitary matrix in the polar decomposition of an invertible matrix is uniquely defined.  General case  The SVD of A reads A = W D^\\\\frac{1}{2} V^*, with W, V unitary matrices, and D a diagonal, positive semi-definite matrix. By simply inserting an additional pair of Ws or Vs, we obtain the two forms of the polar decomposition of A: : A = WD^\\\\frac{1}{2}V^* = \\\\underbrace{\\\\left(W D^\\\\frac{1}{2} W^*\\\\right)}_P \\\\underbrace{\\\\left(W V^*\\\\right)}_U = \\\\underbrace{\\\\left(W V^*\\\\right)}_U \\\\underbrace{\\\\left(VD^\\\\frac{1}{2} V^*\\\\right)}_{P'}. Bounded operators on Hilbert space The polar decomposition of any bounded linear operator A between complex Hilbert spaces is a canonical factorization as the product of a partial isometry and a non-negative operator. The polar decomposition for matrices generalizes as follows: if A is a bounded linear operator then there is a unique factorization of A as a product A = UP where U is a partial isometry, P is a non-negative self-adjoint operator and the initial space of U is the closure of the range of P. The operator U must be weakened to a partial isometry, rather than unitary, because of the following issues. If A is the one-sided shift on l2(N), then A = {AA}¬Ω = I. So if A = U A, U must be A, which is not unitary. The existence of a polar decomposition is a consequence of Douglas' lemma: :Lemma If A, B are bounded operators on a Hilbert space H, and AA ‚â§ BB, then there exists a contraction C such that A = CB. Furthermore, C is unique if Ker(B) ‚äÇ Ker(C). The operator C can be defined by C(Bh) := Ah for all h in H, extended by continuity to the closure of Ran(B), and by zero on the orthogonal complement to all of H. The lemma then follows since AA ‚â§ BB implies Ker(B) ‚äÇ Ker(A). In particular. If AA = BB, then C is a partial isometry, which is unique if Ker(B) ‚äÇ Ker(C). In general, for any bounded operator A, :A^*A = \\\\left(A^*A\\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(A^*A\\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{2}, where (AA)¬Ω is the unique positive square root of AA given by the usual functional calculus. So by the lemma, we have :A = U\\\\left(A^*A\\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{2} for some partial isometry U, which is unique if Ker(A) ‚äÇ Ker(U). Take P to be (AA)¬Ω and one obtains the polar decomposition A = UP. Notice that an analogous argument can be used to show A = P'U, where P' is positive and U a partial isometry. When H is finite-dimensional, U can be extended to a unitary operator; this is not true in general (see example above). Alternatively, the polar decomposition can be shown using the operator version of singular value decomposition. By property of the continuous functional calculus, A is in the C*-algebra generated by A. A similar but weaker statement holds for the partial isometry: U is in the von Neumann algebra generated by A. If A is invertible, the polar part U will be in the C*-algebra as well. Unbounded operators If A is a closed, densely defined unbounded operator between complex Hilbert spaces then it still has a (unique) polar decomposition :A = U A\\\\, where A is a (possibly unbounded) non- negative self adjoint operator with the same domain as A, and U is a partial isometry vanishing on the orthogonal complement of the range Ran(A). The proof uses the same lemma as above, which goes through for unbounded operators in general. If Dom(AA) = Dom(BB) and AAh = BBh for all h ‚àà Dom(AA), then there exists a partial isometry U such that A = UB. U is unique if Ran(B)‚ä• ‚äÇ Ker(U). The operator A being closed and densely defined ensures that the operator AA is self-adjoint (with dense domain) and therefore allows one to define (AA)¬Ω. Applying the lemma gives polar decomposition. If an unbounded operator A is affiliated to a von Neumann algebra M, and A = UP is its polar decomposition, then U is in M and so is the spectral projection of P, 1B(P), for any Borel set B in [0, ‚àû). Quaternion polar decomposition The polar decomposition of quaternions H depends on the unit 2-dimensional sphere \\\\lbrace x i + y j + z k \\\\in H : x^2 + y^2 +z^2 = 1 \\\\rbrace of square roots of minus one. Given any r on this sphere, and an angle ‚àíœÄ < a ‚â§ œÄ, the versor e^{ar} = \\\\cos (a) + r\\\\ \\\\sin (a) is on the unit 3-sphere of H. For a = 0 and a = œÄ, the versor is 1 or ‚àí1 regardless of which r is selected. The norm t of a quaternion q is the Euclidean distance from the origin to q. When a quaternion is not just a real number, then there is a unique polar decomposition q = t e^{ar}. Alternative planar decompositions In the Cartesian plane, alternative planar ring decompositions arise as follows: Numerical determination of the matrix polar decomposition To compute an approximation of the polar decomposition A = UP, usually the unitary factor U is approximated. The iteration is based on Heron's method for the square root of 1 and computes, starting from U_0 = A, the sequence :U_{k+1} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(U_k + \\\\left(U_k^*\\\\right )^{-1}\\\\right),\\\\qquad k = 0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots The combination of inversion and Hermite conjugation is chosen so that in the singular value decomposition, the unitary factors remain the same and the iteration reduces to Heron's method on the singular values. This basic iteration may be refined to speed up the process: using the Frobenius norm. Including the scale factor, the iteration is now : U_{k+1} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\gamma_k U_k + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma_k} \\\\left(U_k^*\\\\right)^{-1}\\\\right), \\\\qquad k = 0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots  The QR decomposition can be used in a preparation step to reduce a singular matrix A to a smaller regular matrix, and inside every step to speed up the computation of the inverse.  Heron's method for computing roots of x^2 - 1 = 0 can be replaced by higher order methods, for instance based on Halley's method of third order, resulting in : U_{k+1} = U_k\\\\left(I + 3U_k^* U_k\\\\right)^{-1}\\\\left(3I + U_k^* U_k\\\\right),\\\\qquad k = 0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots This iteration can again be combined with rescaling. This particular formula has the benefit that it is also applicable to singular or rectangular matrices A. }} See also *Cartan decomposition *Algebraic polar decomposition *Polar decomposition of a complex measure  References  * Conway, J.B.: A Course in Functional Analysis.

He found extraordinarily rapid success in Hollywood after arriving in his late 40s, but he died unexpectedly in his early 50s. Early life The son of chemist and druggist John G. Stephenson and his wife Emma, Stephenson grew up in the West Riding of Yorkshire and Burnley, Lancashire, with his brothers, Alan and Norman. He became a bank clerk and later had a career as a merchant. In the 1930s, he emigrated to the United States and took U.S. nationality in 1938. Career After acting on the stage, Stephenson made his film debut in 1937 at age 48, initially making films in Britain. Warner Bros. signed him the following year, and he began playing urbane villains and disgraced gentlemen. His big break came when director William Wyler cast him, in spite of studio resistance, in The Letter (1940), opposite Bette Davis. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for this role. Later that year, he played the title role in Calling Philo Vance. In 1941 he was first-billed in Shining Victory, in which he played the character of Dr. Paul Venner. Just as Stephenson's acting career was starting to rise, he died of a heart attack at the age of 52. He is interred at Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

It originated at the University of Ibadan, in Ibadan, Nigeria, in the 1950s, and remained dominant until the 1970s. The University of Ibadan was the first university to open in Nigeria, and its scholars set up the history departments at most of Nigeria's other universities, spreading the Ibadan historiography. Its scholars also wrote the textbooks that were used at all levels of the Nigerian education system for many years. The school's output is often considered to be most clearly embodied in the \\"Ibadan History Series\\". Nwaubani argues that Kenneth Dike (1917‚Äì83) was the first modern scholarly proponent of Africanist history. His publications were a watershed in African historiography. With a PhD from London in 1940, Dike became the first African to complete Western historical professional training. At the University College of Ibadan, he became the first African professor of history and head of a history department. He helped found the Historical Society of Nigeria and the Nigerian National Archives. His book Trade and Politics in the Niger Delta 1830-1885 dealt with 19th- century economic politics in the Niger Delta. He focused on internal African factors, especially defensive measures undertaken by the delta societies against imperialist penetration. Dike helped create the Ibadan School of African history and promoted the use of oral evidence by African historians.Ebere Nwaubani, \\"Kenneth Onwuka Dike, 'Trade And Politics,' and the Restoration of the African in History,\\" History in Africa: A Journal of Method, 2000, Vol. 27, pp 229-248 Other leading scholars of the Ibadan School include Saburi Biobaku, J.F.A. Ajayi, Adiele Afigbo, E.A. Ayandele, O. Ikime and Tekena Tamuno. A number of foreign scholars, many of which came to teach in Nigeria, are also often associated with the school, including Michael Crowder, Abdullahi Amith, J.B. Webster, R.J. Gavin, Robert Smith, and John D. Omer-Cooper. The school was characterized by its overt Nigerian nationalism and it was geared towards forging a Nigerian identity through publicizing the glories of pre-colonial history. The school was quite traditional in its subject matter, being largely confined to the political history that colleagues in Europe and North America were then rejecting. It was very modern, however, in the sources used. Much use was made of oral history and throughout the school took a strongly interdisciplinary approach to gathering information. This was especially true after the founding of the Institute for African Studies that brought together experts from many disciplines. There was some friction between the Ibadan School and the Africanists in Britain and the U.S.. The Africanists felt that the Nigerian scholars should be more objective and less involved in current politics. However, the quality of the methodology and scholarship of the Ibadan scholars was never questioned. Conversely, the African scholars of the Ibadan School saw the American and British universities as bastions of imperialism. As a result, nationalists shunned the western based Journal of African History in favour of the domestic Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria. The Ibadan School began to decline in importance in the 1970s. The Nigerian Civil War led some to question whether Nigeria was in fact a unified nation with a national history. At the same time, rival schools developed. At Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, Nigeria, the Islamic Legitimist school arose that rejected Western models in favour of the scholarly tradition of the Sokoto Caliphate and the Islamic world. From other parts of Africa, the Neo-Marxist school arrived and gained a number of supporters. Social, economic, and cultural history also began to grow in prominence. In the 1980s Nigerian scholarship in general began to decline, and the Ibadan School was much affected. The military rulers looked upon the universities with deep suspicion and they were poorly funded as a result. Many top minds were co-opted with plum jobs in the administration and left academia. Others left the country entirely for jobs at universities in the West. The economic collapse of the 1980s also greatly hurt the scholarly community, especially the sharp devaluation of the Nigerian currency. This made inviting foreign scholars, subscribing to journals, and attending overseas conferences vastly more expensive. Many of the domestic journals, including the Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria, faltered and were only published rarely, if at all.

It is often included in weapon training segments of martial arts. Sometimes referred to as kai or \\"double kai\\", kama made with intentionally dull blades for kata demonstration purposes are referred to as kata kai. History Before being improvised as a weapon, the kama was widely used throughout Asia to cut crops, mostly rice. It is found in many shapes and forms in Southeast Asia and is particularly common in martial arts from Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. It is also used in Chinese martial arts but not often. From one or both of these areas, the kama was brought to Okinawa and incorporated into the martial art of te (hand) and later karate (empty hand). It also spawned the use of the kusarigama and the Kyoketsu Shoge. Technique The kama can be used singly or in pairs. Both the point and sharpened edge of the metal blade are called into use, Okinawan kata suggesting that it could also be used to block, trap and disarm an opponent's weapon. The point at which the blade and handle join in the \\"weapon\\" model normally has a nook with which a staff can be trapped. The edge of a traditional rice sickle, such as one would purchase from a Japanese hardware store, continues to the handle without a notch, as this is unneeded for its intended use. The hard edge of the blade would be kept razor-sharp to enable efficient cutting of crops, though this is sometimes a cause of training accidents by unskilled wielders, for whom blunt training versions of the weapon are created.

Besides its homages to and parodies of science fiction mainstays Star Trek (1966), Star Wars (1977) and Alien (1979), this film also pokes fun at the Western genre. It won the Audience Award at the 1983 Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film.Awards for Galaxina at the Internet Movie Database A film viewed by the characters in Galaxina is a clip from the 1960 Eastern bloc sci-fi film, First Spaceship on Venus. The clip is used because First Spaceship on Venus was a Crown International Picture when first released in the United States in 1962.. Plot In 3008, the crew of the Intergalactic Space Police cruiser Infinity is on patrol duty in deep space. The ship is captained by the incompetent Cornelius Butt (Avery Schreiber) and his crewmen: his first officer, Sgt. Thor (Stephen Macht); pilot \\"space-cowboy\\" Pvt. Robert \\"Buzz\\" McHenry (J.D. Hinton); Maurice (Lionel Mark Smith), a black humanoid alien with pointy ears and bat wings; and Sam (Tad Horino), an Asian man who quotes Confucius. Also aboard is Galaxina (Dorothy Stratten), a voluptuous blonde android servant, and Rock-Eater, a rock-eating alien prisoner confined to the brig. While the Infinity hides behind an asteroid, a suspicious- looking, bird-like ship flies by, and Buzz decides to pursue it. They try to question the ship's pilot, a mysterious masked figure who rudely terminates communications. The two ships exchange laser fire, but the bird-ship gets away. After the encounter, Galaxina serves a dinner of chicken-flavored food pills to Captain Butt, Thor, and Buzz. The three men are stunned by her beauty, and Thor receives an electric shock when he slaps her buttocks. Tired of the pill-food, Captain Butt decides to eat an alien egg confiscated from the rock eater prisoner. The egg sickens him, and, on top of the dinner table mimicking the scene from the movie Alien, he coughs up a baby alien creature that quickly scurries away. Later, the crew receive orders to proceed to the prison planet Altair One to recover a priceless stolen gemstone called the Blue Star; every time the stone is mentioned, an invisible heavenly chorus is heard by the characters. The trip will take the Infinity 27 years to complete, requiring that the crew enter cryogenic sleep. Before doing so, they make a quick stop at an asteroid brothel. Galaxina remains in charge of the ship while the crew is in stasis. While alone, she reprograms herself to become more human. She learns to talk and disables her electrical defense mechanism. She visits Thor's sleep chamber periodically, embracing it and telling the sleeping Thor that she loves him. Later, the baby alien visits Butt's chamber and tampers with the controls. When the crew awakens at their destination, Butt emerges from his pod an old man with shaggy gray hair. Thor is seduced by Galaxina and he falls in love with her. Although she lacks the proper hardware to have sex, she assures Thor that these components can be ordered from the android catalog. Thor can only fantasize about Galaxina until they return home and get her modifications. The ship reaches Altair One and lands. Knowing that the local aliens are hostile to humans, Galaxina volunteers to go look for the Blue Star while the others stay on the ship. She walks into town and enters a \\"human restaurant,\\" and discovers that this means the restaurant serves humans as food to alien creatures. There, she finds Ordric, the masked figure the crew encountered earlier. Ordric possesses the Blue Star and Galaxina attacks him. Galaxina discovers Ordric is a robot when she smashes his head open. Ordric is deactivated and Galaxina takes the Star. As she flees the town, she is captured by a gang of bikers, descendants of the first settlers of Altair One. Their leader announces that he will sacrifice Galaxina to their deity, \\"Harley-David-Son\\", and with the power of the Blue Star he will take control of the universe. Thor and Buzz, who have been looking for Galaxina, rescue her from the bikers and return to the ship. Ordric attacks and boards the Infinity as soon as they reach space. He takes back the Blue Star and confines everyone in the brig. The baby alien, now fully grown, sneaks onto the bridge and attacks Ordric.

Due to unforeseen bad weather, some sets could not be used and so the production lost a few days of filming. As a result, the producers demanded that scenes be cut to keep the shoot on schedule. Because these scenes are missing from the final film, director William Sachs calls the final cut \\"too slow paced\\", as he would have edited it in a faster style had he been able to include the scenes that were never filmed..

Matched grip (also known as parallel grip) is a method of holding drum sticks and mallets to play percussion instruments. In the matched grip each hand holds its stick in the same way, whereas in the traditional grip, each hand holds the stick differently. Almost all commonly used matched grips are overhand grips. Specific forms of the grip are French grip, German grip, and American grip. The matched grip is performed by gripping the drum sticks with one's index finger and middle finger curling around the bottom of the stick and the thumb on the top. This allows the stick to move freely and bounce after striking a percussion instrument. Any of the major grips below can be played with an index finger fulcrum, a middle finger fulcrum, or a combination of both. The fulcrum can also be placed on the first or second knuckles of the primary fulcrum finger. These options lead to many technical variations in playing position. All of the grips, with all of the fulcrum variations, apply to the right hand of traditional grip as well. French grip In French grip, the palms of the hands face directly toward each other and the stick is moved primarily with the fingers rather than the wrist as in German grip. This allows a greater degree of finesse and the addition of forearm rotation to the stroke, which is why many timpanists prefer French grip. This grip uses the smaller and faster finger muscles. It also comes in handy for playing fast tempos, including for swing or jazz on the ride cymbal. For louder strokes, the wrist rotates much in the same way as when hammering a nail. German grip In German grip, the palms of the hands are parallel to the drumhead or other playing surface, and the stick is moved primarily with the wrist. German grip provides a large amount of power, but sacrifices the speed provided by the use of the fingers as in French grip. It is used when power is the primary concern, such as when playing a bass drum. This is also the primary grip for the Moeller method. German grip provides the widest dynamic range, achieving the control necessary for pianissimo passages without the need for much rebound from the drum and also allowing for very loud fortissimo strokes from the arm. American grip American grip is a hybrid of the French grip and German grip. The palms of the hands typically are at about a 45-degree angle, and both the fingers and wrist are used to propel the stick, which is positioned parallel to the forearm. This grip is considered a general-purpose grip by percussionists because it combines the power and larger wrist motion of the German grip with the quick finger strokes of the French grip. Each element of the stroke, finger or wrist motion, can be isolated as needed. Instruments it is used to play include snare drums and xylophones.

Shoemaker is a lunar impact crater located near the southern pole of the Moon, within half a crater diameter of Shackleton. Crater It lies to the south of the crater Malapert, to the east of Haworth, and just to the west of the similar-sized Faustini. The rim of Shoemaker is circular and worn, with some small craters along the inner wall. Due to the lack of illumination (it is a crater of eternal darkness), the albedo of the interior floor surface remains unknown. Prior to being given its current name by the IAU, this formation had been informally named Mawson (after the Antarctic explorer Douglas Mawson). It was officially named Shoemaker in honor of Eugene Shoemaker, the geologist whose remains were on board the Lunar Prospector spacecraft that impacted this crater floor. = Cold trap deposits = This crater became of interest to scientists when the Lunar Prospector detected unusually high concentrations of hydrogen on the floor of this and other nearby craters using a neutron spectrometer. The floor of this crater is kept in permanent shadow from the Sun, and thus maintains a temperature below . Thus the floor forms a cold trap, and any molecules of water that wander into the crater from cometary impacts can deposit on the floor and remain there almost permanently. The instruments on board Lunar Prospector gave a concentration of about 146 ppm of hydrogen, compared to 50 ppm for the average lunar surface. The topography of this crater was subsequently measured using the Goldstone 70 m antenna to irradiate it with 3.5 cm radar. Two 34 m antennae, located 20 km apart, received the echoes, and the results were used to generate a topographic map with 150 m resolution. On July 31, 1999, Lunar Prospector was deliberately crashed into the floor of this crater to determine if a plume of water vapor would be detected. The apparent detection of water and the shallow rim of this crater made it a suitable target for this experiment. However the outcome was unsuccessful. Subsequent tests have failed to confirm the presence of water in the crater floor, so the hydrogen found in the crater bottom is likely to prove more difficult to extract than had been originally hoped.

His most famous role was the guardian angel Clarence Odbody in the 1946 film classic It's a Wonderful Life. He also received an Academy Award nomination for his supporting role in Mrs. Miniver (1942). Travers specialized in portraying slightly bumbling but friendly and lovable old men. Life and career = Early life = Travers was born in Prudhoe, Northumberland, and was the son of Daniel Heagerty, a doctor originally from Ireland, and Ellen Gillman Hornibrook Belcher. His mother was a native of County Cork, Ireland, and was previously married to William H. Belcher, a merchant seaman. He died in 1869. Travers had a half-brother, Samuel William Belcher, by his mother's previous marriage. He also had another brother, Daniel George Belsaigne Heagerty, and a sister, Mary Sophia Maude Heagerty. Travers grew up in Berwick-upon-Tweed, and many biographies wrongly report him as being born there.GRO Register of Births, Marriages and Death and 1881 Census for England & Wales The Travers family lived in Prudhoe for a couple of years before moving from Woodburn, on the A68 road near Corsenside, Northumberland, in about 1866, to Tweedmouth, Berwick-upon-Tweed, in about 1876. Initially, he trained as an architect at Berwick, before taking to the stage under the name Henry Travers. = Acting career = Henry Travers as the Burglar in the Theatre Guild's Broadway production of Heartbreak House (1920) Lynn Fontanne (Eliza) and Henry Travers (Alfred Doolittle) in the Theatre Guild production of Pygmalion (1926) Travers gained early experience acting in repertory theatre in England. He was billed as Travers Heagerty for a December 1895 production. He played character roles almost from the beginning of his acting career in 1894, often figures who were much older than himself. He made his Broadway debut in The Price of Peace (1901) but returned to England. Travers again went to the United States in 1917 after a long and successful theatre career in his homeland. He played frequently from November 1917 until December 1938 on Broadway in over 30 plays. However, his last play on Broadway You Can't Take It with You was his most famous, where he acted in over 380 performances in two years. In the Oscar-winning movie You Can't Take It With You, Lionel Barrymore played the role which Travers had portrayed on Broadway. Like many other theatre actors, he made his first movie only with the advent of sound films. His first was Reunion in Vienna in 1933. In the same year, he played the father of Gloria Stuart in the horror classic The Invisible Man. He often portrayed doctors, judges, and fathers of the main figures in supporting roles. Travers specialized on portraying slightly wry and bumbling but friendly and lovable old men. He appeared with Greer Garson and Ronald Colman in Random Harvest (1942) and with Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman in The Bells of St. Mary's (1945). Alfred Hitchcock used Travers as a Comic relief in Shadow of a Doubt (1943), where he played a bank clerk with a passion for criminal magazines. The character actor also portrayed the Railway Station Master Mr. Ballard with a love for roses who finally wins the annual flower show in his village shortly before dying in a bombardment in Mrs. Miniver. He received an Academy Award-nomination as Best Supporting Actor for this appearance. Travers's most famous role was as James Stewart's somewhat befuddled but kind-hearted guardian angel Clarence Odbody in Frank Capra's 1946 film It's a Wonderful Life. Travers' character saves Stewart's from committing suicide, and shows him how wonderful his life really is. Though the film was a financial flop, it later became a Christmas classic and one of the most beloved films in American cinema. However, despite his long life, Travers would never know that his performance as Clarence would become his most celebrated, as the film only became a Christmas television perennial in the 1970s and 1980s, long after the actor's death. Travers retired in 1949 after his supporting role in The Girl From Jones Beach. Overall, he acted in 52 films. = Personal life and death = Travers' first wife was actress Amy Forrest-Rhodes (1881‚Äì1954). They were married from 1931 until her death in 1954. In 1955, he married Ann G. Murphy (1899‚Äì1983) who survived him. After several years in retirement, Travers died as a result of arteriosclerosis in 1965, at the age of 91. He is buried with his second wife in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale.

As a child, he relocated to Puerto Rico. He always expressed pride in his national background; and he considered himself a Dominican-Puerto Rican. In fact, he usually took both the flags of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic to most of his fights. Boxing career Gervacio had an award winning amateur boxing career. His professional career as a boxer took off onn December 21, 1985, after he knocked out Felix Llanos during the first round at Caguas. After two more wins, he participated, alongside Juan Carazo, at an undercard held in Cura√ßao on May 30, 1986. On June 22, he knocked out Pedro Arroyo in three rounds, as part of an undercard headlined by Azumah Nelson's successful world Featherweight championship defense against Danilo Cabrera.

WBA world Super Bantamweight champion Louie Espinoza of Phoenix, Arizona, had defeated boxer Tommy Valoy by a knockout after a four round match at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum to win the vacant world title. Many fans attended the November 27, 1987, world championship fight between Gervacio and Espinoza. Gervacio became a world champion by defeating Espinoza with a relatively close (scores of 117-114, 116-113 and 116-112) but unanimous decision over Espinoza at San Juan's Roberto Clemente Coliseum. On his first attempt to defend his newly acquired title, his undefeated record and world title were lost to Bernardo Pinango after a split decision (scores of 113-114, 114-115 and 114-113). Despite reeling off four wins in a row after his first defeat, Gervacio's career began to slide after losing to Pinango. In his next world title attempt for the world Super Bantamweight title, he lost by a twelve round unanimous decision to Kenny Mitchell on April 29, 1989. At his next bout held in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico on December 15, 1989, he lost by knockout for the first time in his career, sustaining a broken jaw and requiring hospitalization after being defeated by Orlando Fernandez after nine round match. The days following the fight, Gervacio had to undergo reconstructive jaw surgery, having to be fed with intravenous cables. Although he would never regain his title, Gervacio nevertheless reeled off ten straight wins after that defeat. Among the boxers he beat during that streak were some top ranked fighters such as former Jiro Watanabe world title challenger Julio Soto Solano, Pepillo Valdez, Lee Cargle and Lorenzo Tiznado, among others. When given another chance to win a world title on March 11 of 1995, he lost to WBC Super Bantamweight incumbent Hector Acero Sanchez by a twelve round unanimous decision. His next fight on March 25, 1996 against Sergio Pena was his debut in his birth country and it was for the Dominican Super Bantamweight title. It resulted in a seven round no contest decision. Gervacio lost his next three matches all by knockout, including one against future world champion Juan Manuel M√°rquez At his final professional match held on October 4, 1997 he lost to former Cuban amateur boxer and future world champion Joel Casamayor. Gervacio retired with a record of 32 wins, 7 losses and 1 draw, with 24 wins by knockout. Illegal immigration arrest On June 20, 2011, Gervacio, who identified himself as Julio Antonio Gervacio-Lynch, was arrested in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers after he illegally entered Puerto Rico (and thus also the United States) after crossing the Mona Channel that separates the island from the Dominican Republic aboard a rickety fishing boat commonly known as a yola by locals. Criminal and immigration records showed that Gervacio was convicted by a New York court in 2002 for conspiracy to distribute narcotics and was deported from the United States by orders from an immigration judge in 2009.

Lady Gwen claimed to be a hereditary witch, with connections to the Salem witch trials of 1692, though she could not provide original sources to support these assertions. When she published a supposedly ancient poem called The Rede of the Wiccae, it was believed by some to be partly her own work. Family Phyllis Thompson (n√©e Healy) claimed to be a hereditary witch from New England. She was best known by the pseudonym (or public Craft name) of Lady Gwen Thompson, though she changed the forename to Gwynne in the 1980s. Thompson was her final married surname. According to Thompson, her grandmother Adriana Porter's family were the carriers of a secret tradition of folk witchcraft that had come down through Sarah Arnot Cook and Wealthy Trask (Trash) from the latter's seventeenth-century ancestors. Porter had initiated her and her mother into the family's tradition and given them their \\"Craft Names\\".1 At first Thompson intended to keep the tradition within her family, subsequently initiating her children and grandchildren into them. However, her son and his family left the family tradition, joining the Christian religion and raising their children within it, and her daughter had no children. Fearing that her traditions would be completely lost, she began \\"fostering\\" outsiders into it as family members; she began initiating them in the late 1960s. By 1970 she had informally created the organization now known as the New England Covens of Traditionalist Witches (N.E.C.T.W.) (currently listed in the State of Rhode Island as a subsidiary of Society of the Evening Star.)2 Around 1974 Thompson retired from leading the N.E.C.T.W. and turned it over to two of its early members;3 the leadership has undergone several changes in the intervening years. Thompson's claims to be an hereditary witch have little independent support, since she states that she destroyed the original version of her grandmother's lore-book after copying its contents, and recopied her own book several times throughout her lifetime. While a recent book by Robert Mathiesen and Theitic documents a long history of occultism within Thompson's ancestry, including the seventeenth-century alchemist, Jonathan Brewster, as well as several of the families on both sides of the Salem witch trials of 1692, there is no direct evidence of the veracity of Thompson's claims as she, her mother and any others who could have provided first-hand information are all deceased, and any written documentation has not been made public. The Rede of the Wiccae In 1975, Thompson had an article entitled \\"Wiccan-Pagan Potpourri\\" published in Green Egg magazine issue #69 (Ostara 1975), for which she is best known. A portion of that article included a poem consisting of 26 rhyming couplets entitled The Rede of the Wiccae, stating that > \\"... Our own particular form of the Wiccan Rede is that which was passed on > to her heirs by Adriana Porter, who was well into her nineties when she > crossed over into the Summerland in the year 1946. ...\\"4. Although Thompson wrote that this version of the Rede was in its original form, this declaration is disputed for several reasons, but primarily as the language of the poem refers to Wiccan concepts that are not known to have existed in her grandmother's lifetime. It is sometimes ascribed to Thompson herself. Mathiesen and Theitic concluded that 18 to 20 of the verses are lore which would be common to the area of rural 17th to 19th century New England and compiled by the hand of someone who would have been born no later that the late 19th century, and that at least six of the verses which are deemed ‚ÄúThe Wiccan Verses‚Äù were compiled and added by a second and later hand. Since Thompson was dispensing these 26 as a whole from around 1969 it is a reasonable assumption that hers was that second hand. Another claim is that it is adapted from a speech given by Doreen Valiente at a dinner sponsored by the Witchcraft Research Association and mentioned in volume one (1964) of the Pentagram, a United Kingdom pagan newsletter then being published. Valiente did publish a similarly worded and entitled poem The Witches Creed in her 1978 book, \\"Witchcraft for Tomorrow\\"5. Celtic Traditionalist Wicca The Green Egg publication listed her by-line as \\"Lady Gwen Thompson, Welsh Tradition Wicca\\", which was a tag of their own creation. This sparked a protest by Thompson in issue #71 with a subsequent letter from her and an apology from then-editor Oberon Zell-Ravenheart (then known as Tim Zell) in issue #72. Thompson stated in her opening letter > \\"... For the record, we are not Welsh. I do believe we ran this route a few > years ago, and it seems that once more clarification is needed. We are and > always have been simply Traditionalist. We use the term Celtic > Traditionalist to differentiate us from the ones who claim to be Welsh, and > I know of only one tradition that has the right to use that name. If there > are others, I do not know of them. My apologies, but we are not Welsh. We > prefer to be simply known as \\"Traditionalists. ...\\" While Thompson maintained the use of the term Witch and Witchcraft in her teachings and writings, by this time the term Wicca was becoming more fashionable to use in place of Witch/Witchcraft, as being a \\"less-charged\\" word. This has led to numerous instances of Thompson's Tradition and its practitioners being labeled as Celtic Wicca despite her stated objections and preference for the term Traditionalist. Later life Thompson remained active in teaching her form of witchcraft into the 1980s, carrying on an extensive, worldwide correspondence. Through her letters and teachings she contributed to the development of other traditions, including the Keepers of the Ancient Mysteries, the Georgian Tradition and others. Her own tradition of the N.E.C.T.W. developed offshoots as well, including the and the Groves of the Tuatha de Danaan and others; these offshoots are not recognized as an actual part of the N.E.C.T.W. although their historical connections to it are acknowledged. In the mid-1980s, Thompson was diagnosed with cancer, and subsequently died May 22, 1986 while on a visit to Nova Scotia, Canada.6 Many of Thompson's Craft artifacts, including her personal book, are in the possession of the N.E.C.T.W., having been given them by her daughter, mother and other family members.6 See also *The Wiccan Rede References 1\\\\. 2\\\\.

There it has been discovered that the inhabitants were developing their education in a very progressive manner. From there they became the principal architects and builders of the tombs of the Valley of the Kings. The word \\"Osirica\\" may likely have been the Hellenization of the ancient Egyptian word \\"Asauru\\" which translates \\"followers of Osiris\\". The word is used in many French and Italian references to ancient Egyptian culture and history, but very rarely is found in English. The word was first used in English by George Granville Monah James book Stolen Legacy in 1954. George G.M.

Lately, the Osirica are championed by Afrocentric scholars and students as the original ancient \\"Lodge\\" of the Masonic order (Freemasonry), and the foundation of most modern Masonry orders.

If the pennies do not match (one heads and one tails) Odd keeps both pennies, so receives one from Even (‚àí1 for Even, +1 for Odd).  Theory  Matching Pennies is a zero-sum game because each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. If the participants' total gains are added up and their total losses subtracted, the sum will be zero. The game can be written in a payoff matrix (pictured right - from Even's point of view). Each cell of the matrix shows the two players' payoffs, with Even's payoffs listed first. Matching pennies is used primarily to illustrate the concept of mixed strategies and a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. This game has no pure strategy Nash equilibrium since there is no pure strategy (heads or tails) that is a best response to a best response. In other words, there is no pair of pure strategies such that neither player would want to switch if told what the other would do. Instead, the unique Nash equilibrium of this game is in mixed strategies: each player chooses heads or tails with equal probability. In this way, each player makes the other indifferent between choosing heads or tails, so neither player has an incentive to try another strategy. The best-response functions for mixed strategies are depicted in Figure 1 below: Figure 1. Best response correspondences for players in the matching pennies game. The leftmost mapping is for the Even player, the middle shows the mapping for the Odd player. The sole Nash equilibrium is shown in the right hand graph. x is a probability of playing heads by Odd player, y is a probability of playing heads by Even. The unique intersection is the only point where the strategy of Even is the best response to the strategy of Odd and vice versa. When either player plays the equilibrium, everyone's expected payoff is zero. = Variants = Varying the payoffs in the matrix can change the equilibrium point. For example, in the table shown on the right, Even has a chance to win 7 if both he and Odd play Heads. To calculate the equilibrium point in this game, note that a player playing a mixed strategy must be indifferent between his two actions (otherwise he would switch to a pure strategy). This gives us two equations: * For the Even player, the expected payoff when playing Heads is +7\\\\cdot x -1\\\\cdot (1-x) and when playing Tails -1\\\\cdot x +1\\\\cdot (1-x), and these must be equal, so x=0.2. * For the Odd player, the expected payoff when playing Heads is +1\\\\cdot y -1\\\\cdot (1-y) and when playing Tails -1\\\\cdot y +1\\\\cdot (1-y), and these must be equal, so y=0.5. Note that x is the Heads- probability of Odd and y is the Heads-probability of Even. So the change in Even's payoff affects Odd's strategy and not his own strategy.  Laboratory experiments  Human players do not always play the equilibrium strategy. Laboratory experiments reveal several factors that make players deviate from the equilibrium strategy, especially if matching pennies is played repeatedly: * Humans are not good at randomizing. They may try to produce \\"random\\" sequences by switching their actions from Heads to Tails and vice versa, but they switch their actions too often (due to a gambler's fallacy). This makes it possible for expert players to predict their next actions with more than 50% chance of success. In this way, a positive expected payoff might be attainable. * Humans are trained to detect patterns. They try to detect patterns in the opponent's sequence, even when such patterns do not exist, and adjust their strategy accordingly. * Humans' behavior is affected by framing effects. When the Odd player is named \\"the misleader\\" and the Even player is named \\"the guesser\\", the former focuses on trying to randomize and the latter focuses on trying to detect a pattern, and this increases the chances of success of the guesser. Additionally, the fact that Even wins when there is a match gives him an advantage, since people are better at matching than at mismatching (due to the Stimulus-Response compatibility effect). Moreover, when the payoff matrix is asymmetric, other factors influence human behavior even when the game is not repeated: * Players tend to increase the probability of playing an action which gives them a higher payoff, e.g. in the payoff matrix above, Even will tend to play more Heads. This is intuitively understandable, but it is not a Nash equilibrium: as explained above, the mixing probability of a player should depend only on the other player's payoff, not his own payoff. This deviation can be explained as a quantal response equilibrium. In a quantal-response-equilibrium, the best-response curves are not sharp as in a standard Nash equilibrium. Rather, they change smoothly from the action whose probability is 0 to the action whose probability 1 (in other words, while in a Nash-equilibrium, a player chooses the best response with probability 1 and the worst response with probability 0, in a quantal-response-equilibrium the player chooses the best response with high probability that is smaller than 1 and the worst response with smaller probability that is higher than 0). The equilibrium point is the intersection point of the smoothed curves of the two players, which is different than the Nash-equilibrium point. * The own-payoff effects are mitigated by risk aversion. Players tend to underestimate high gains and overestimate high losses; this moves the quantal-response curves and changes the quantal- response-equilibrium point. This apparently contradicts theoretical results regarding the irrelevance of risk-aversion in finitely-repeated zero-sum games.  Real-life data  The conclusions of laboratory experiments have been criticized on several grounds. * Games in lab experiments are artificial and simplistic, and do not mimic real-life behavior. * The payoffs in lab experiments are small, so subjects do not have much incentive to play optimally. In real-life, the market may \\"punish\\" such irrationality and cause players to behave more rationally. * Subjects have other considerations than maximizing monetary payoffs, such as to avoid looking foolish or to please the experimenter. * Lab experiments are short, and subjects do not have sufficient time to learn the optimal strategy. To overcome these difficulties, several authors have done statistical analysis of professional sports games. These are zero-sum games with very high payoffs, and the players have devoted their lives to become experts. Often such games are strategically similar to matching pennies: * In soccer penalty kicks, the kicker has two options - kick left or kick right, and the goalie has two options - jump left or jump right.There is also the option of kicking/standing in the middle, but it is less often used. The kicker's probability of scoring a goal is higher when the choices do not match, and lower when the choices match. In general, the payoffs are asymmetric because each kicker has a stronger leg (usually the right leg) and his chances are better when kicking to the opposite direction (left). In a close examination of the actions of kickers and goalies, it was found that their actions do not deviate significantly from the prediction of a Nash equilibrium. * In tennis serve-and-return plays, the situation is similar. It was found that the win rates are consistent with the minimax hypothesis, but the players' choices are not random: even professional tennis players are not good at randomizing, and switch their actions too often.  See also  * Odds and evens - a game with the same strategic structure, that is played with fingers instead of coins. * Rock paper scissors - a similar game in which each player has three strategies instead of two. * Parity game - an unrelated (and much more complicated) two-player logic game, played on a colored graph.

Hinton left the group in February 2008 after 18 years to spend more time with his family. History Merv Pepler and Joie Hinton met as drummer and keyboard player (respectively) for Ozric Tentacles, a long-standing psychedelic rock band from Somerset. Although Ozric Tentacles incorporated elements of electronic music, Pepler and Hinton were drawn towards the rave-oriented dance music. In 1988 they collaborated on a project under the name of Wooden Baby which hinted at early rave and acid house sounds as well as numerous other styles, and by 1990, the project had evolved into Eat Static. Pepler explained: \\"There we were in Ozrics doing all this technically impressive, weird music with mad timings, and getting really involved with it, and this experiment that became Eat Static was a good excuse to ignore all that, get the synths out, and be as stupid as we could!\\" The duo toured in parallel with Ozric Tentacles for several years until 1994, when they left the band to pursue Eat Static full-time. Pepler and Hinton are often joined in the studio by Eat Static's third member Steve Everitt. Pepler is featured on the 2006 Ozric Tentacles album The Floor's Too Far Away, playing percussion on the track \\"Armchair Journey\\". Their first album release, Abduction, immediately established the extraterrestrial/U.F.O. theme which is a running motif in their samples, track and album titles, and release artwork. The band's name is taken from a sample (as found on the track \\"Eat Static\\") from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. On 6 February 2008, Pepler announced on the Eat Static website that Hinton was leaving as \\"he has had enough of all the travelling and being away from home and family\\". However, Pepler stated that he would continue to perform and produce under the Eat Static name as a solo project. He also hinted that there would be more scope for collaborations in the future.

The game media also contains the music in Red Book audio format, allowing it to be played back in any standalone CD player. Pepler released a solo album under the name Dendron. The album was called Supernatural Jazz and was released on their own Mesmobeat label. Pepler also teamed up with Steve Jolliffe of Tangerine Dream to form Hi Fi Companions and released the 2004 album Swingers In Paradise on Twisted Records. This project is often classed under lounge music and has a 1950s feel mixed with modern electronica. Jolliffe had previously teamed up with Eat Static appearing on their Crash and Burn! and Science of the Gods albums.

Pepler and White had previously released tracks under the name Champaigne Charlie. Pepler has also teamed up with Shane Thomson and Jamie Nott to form Cosmic Journey Project. Pepler's project with Simon Posford (Hallucinogen, Shpongle) called Metal Sharon has so far released one track, \\"Balloon Dance\\" once again through Twisted Records. Hinton has released an album under the name Nodens Ictus. Hinton teamed up with Ed Wynne from Ozric Tentacles for this ambient project. The album was called Spacelines and was a collection of tracks recorded earlier in their careers, although it featured two tracks written in 2000. Pepler appears in a smaller role on the album and used to play live with Hinton and Ed. Joie is also a member of space rock band Dream Machine, together with former Ozric Tentacles frontman Jon Egan. Hinton also plays live with Ozric's bassplayer Zia's sideproject ZubZub and plays synths for Here & Now.

Traditional grip (detail). Note the signature 'underhand' grip of the style Traditional Grip. This is a good example of the ancient style that Moeller describes. Note the angle of the snare drum, which makes the traditional grip of the left hand necessary, since matched grip would be difficult to use. Also note the positioning of the right hand, which looks like the little finger grip (See Moeller's book for more information, as well as George B. Bruce). Elvin Jones playing drum kit using traditional grip, 1976 Traditional grip (also known as orthodox grip or conventional grip and, to a lesser extent, the jazz grip) is a technique used to hold drum sticks while playing percussion instruments. Unlike matched grip, each hand holds the stick differently. Commonly, the right hand uses an overhand grip and the left hand uses an underhand grip. Traditional grip is almost exclusively used to play the snare drum, especially the marching snare drum, and often the drum kit. Traditional grip is more popular in jazz drumming than in other drum kit styles due to the early jazz drummers evolving their style from marching and military styles and instrumentation,Brown, T, D. (1976). A History and Analysis of Jazz Drumming to 1942. University Microfilms: Ann Arbor, MI. although it is also used by several rock drummers. This grip is called traditional because it descends from military marching drummers who carried a snare drum on a sling hung from the neck or one shoulder, with the drum riding closer to one hip than the other and tilted slightly for easier reach. This allowed the drummer to play the drum and march without banging his knees or thighs into the drum. Because of that drum position, using an overhand grip on the high (left) side of the drum would force the elbow into a very awkward position while an underhand grip is much more comfortable. Even when the drum is on a stand, many drummers will tilt their drum when using traditional grip. Although tilting is not required, it helps align the shoulders and spine and is more ergonomic. Many drummers use traditional grip on drums that are perfectly horizontal, especially in marching percussion. With the underhand grip, there are several different techniques employed which involve slight variations in finger positioning and usage. Common with all techniques is the usage of the wrist in rotating (a motion like turning a door knob) as the fundamental motion of the stick. Once the stick has started moving, more involved techniques require the exclusive use of the thumb for bouncing the stick when playing at a faster tempo. The stick then rests in the space between the thumb and index finger, and the two fingers close around the stick with the thumb atop the index at the first knuckle. The middle finger then rests slightly on the top side of the stick (typically the side fingertip is the only contact made). The stick then rests on the cuticle of the ring finger with the little finger supporting the ring finger from below. Sanford A. Moeller (whose book discusses the Moeller method or Moeller technique) suggests that one should learn the traditional grip 'ancient style', as well ... where the overhand grip should hold or grip the drumstick almost entirely with the little finger.Sanford A. Moeller, the Moeller book, P. 4 Some Scottish pipe band players have a variation on the traditional left hand grip in which the underhand grip is played entirely with the thumb https://www.rhythm-monster.com/blog/scottish-pipe-band-drumming on top of the stick, http://ddpb.org/about-scottish-drumming/ utilizing no other fingers for downward pressure. This suits the pipe band‚Äôs light and snappy style of playing well, but is not as suitable for American style drum corps playing or jazz drumming on a full kit. Traditional grip can also be useful when playing with brushes in a stirring motion. Normally this style is used in a jazz context. The underhand grip naturally angles the left hand farther away from the right hand than would matched grip and allows more room for crossovers and sweeping maneuvers across the surface of the drum. Physiologically, the traditional left underhand hand grip uses fewer muscles than the right overhand grip and this causes each muscle to do a larger percentage of the work. Matched grip is therefore technically easier to play, though for reasons stated above, not always the superior choice for every application.

Vaqueiros have a culture separate from their non-Vaqueiro Asturian and Leonese neighbors and can often be distinguished by their last names, many of which are unique to Vaqueiros including Acero, Alonso, Ant√≥n, Ardura, Arnaldo, Berdasco, Boto, Calz√≥n, Cano, Feito, Gancedo, Garrido, Gavil√°n, Gayo, Parrondo, Redruello, Riesgo, Rubio, Sirgo, and Verdasco among others.Asociaci√≥n Cultural Vaqueiros de Alzada La Bra√±ina  Distribution  The ancestral territory of the Vaqueiros is in western Asturias and northwestern Le√≥n. The traditional communities, or bra√±as (es), of the Vaqueiros can be found in the Asturian municipalities of Belmonte de Miranda, Cangas del Narcea, Cudillero, Gij√≥n, Goz√≥n, Llanera, Navia, Oviedo, Pravia, Las Regueras, Salas, Siero, Somiedo, Teverga, Tineo, Vald√©s, Asturias, and Villay√≥n and the Leonese comarcas of Laciana and Babia (es).S√°nchez G√≥mez, Luis Angel (1990). ‚ÄúConsideraciones sobre la doble residencia entre los vaqueiros de alzada‚Äù (in Spanish)\\"Asociaci√≥n Ruta Vaqueros de Alzada Torrest√≠o\\" (in Spanish) There is a diaspora throughout Spain, Latin America, and the United States with a particularly large diasporic community in Madrid. Large areas of Vaqueiro immigration can be found in Cuba, Argentina, Mexico, and France with substantial populations in the states of Florida, New York, West Virginia, and the Western United States, especially Nevada.Millariega 2019. p. 275.Garc√≠a, Gustavo. ‚Äú‚ÄôLos buckaroos usan palabras vaqueiras las vacas van atadas con una ‚Äúriata‚Äù‚Äô, dice Concha‚Äù.

Concejo de Cultura Vaqueira, May 2018.  History  = Name = The word Vaqueiro is an exonym and until more recent years, this term was not frequently used by Vaqueiros themselves. In Vaqueiro Territory and surrounding areas, the term Vaqueiro is used exclusively to refer to the Vaqueiros de Alzada and has connotations of race and ethnicity instead of a profession.C√°tedra 1992. p. 7. De Alzada was added by Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos to help distinguish the Vaqueiros from the non-Vaqueiro cattle herding population. It comes from the Asturian verb alzar, to raise or to go up, after Jovellanos observed that the Vaqueiros raised, or brought their homes up, every summer to the higher summer bra√±as.Acevedo y Huelves 1915. p. 20. The full name Vaqueiros de Alzada, which is used most often in outside sources, is not often used in Asturias and Le√≥n. Vaqueiros refer to valley-dwelling non-Vaqueiros as xaldos and coastal- dwelling non-Vaqueiros as marnuetos, maranuetos, or marinuetos, though in more recent years the term marnueto has fallen more out of use in favor of referring to all non-Vaqueiros as xaldos.Acevedo y Huelves 1915. p. 22. = Origins = The exact origins of the Vaqueiros are unknown. The non-Vaqueiro population historically considered the Vaqueiros to be descendants of Muslim Moriscos, particularly Moriscos from Alpujarras, though most anthropologists consider this unlikely.Ur√≠a R√≠u 1976. p. 32. = Early accounts = Vaqueiros do not have a tradition of writing and therefore lack their own early written documents. The first specific written mention of the Vaqueiros is in 1433 CE in a receipt by the Count of Luna (es), detailing his payments to a group of Vaqueiros migrating to Laciana. 52 years later in 1485 CE, in a written account of attacks against Vaqueiros and their cattle, it is mentioned that the Vaqueiros consider themselves a people.C√°tedra 1992. p. 9. Most of early written Vaqueiro history is recorded in civil cases brought up by Vaqueiros against discrimination, physical attacks, and land theft. = Contemporary = The drafting of Vaqueiru men has been a major early cause of assimilation of Vaqueiros into non-Vaqueiro society.C√°tedra 1992. p. 135 During the Spanish Civil War, important Vaqueiro bra√±as were burned in the fighting, including El Puerto (Somiedo)Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez 2009. p. 592 and Torrest√≠o (es) in Babia which burned in 1937. The first Vaqueiro Wedding and Festival was held in 1958. From the 1960s to the 1980s, the last of the nomadic bra√±as became sedentary. Although few entire bra√±as are still nomadic, transhumance still exists within the Vaqueiro community in Vaqueiro Territory.‚ÄúII Foro de Cultura Vaqueira‚Äù. Concejo de Cultura Vaqueira, May 2017. The Council of Vaqueiro Culture was founded in 2016 in the bra√±a of El Pevidal in Salas and held its first Forum of Vaqueiro Culture that year.‚ÄúDesarrollo‚Äù. Concejo de Cultura Vaqueira. Accessed 22 Jul 2020.  Demographics  The exact number of Vaqueiros, in Vaqueiro Territory and abroad, is uncertain and the majority of the last estimates come from the end of the 20th century. An estimate from 1965 put the Vaqueiro population at around 15,000 in AsturiasSoto V√°zquez (1956), p. 174-75, cited in C√°tedra (1992), p. 7. and another from 1980 estimated 6,448 Vaqueiros in Asturias. There are more Vaqueiros in diaspora than remaining in Vaqueiro Territory and there are estimated to be more Vaqueiros in Madrid alone.  Transhumance  A house in the summer bra√±a of Las Tabiernas, 1927 Traditionally, the Vaqueiro people practice transhumance with their cattle, the vaca roxa, the Asturian Valley cattle, but most Vaqueiros today have become sedentary and many have assimilated into non-Vaqueiro society.C√°tedra 1992. p. 14. Vaqueiros spend the summer months in the summer bra√±as in the Cantabrian Mountains and the winter months in the winter bra√±as, closer to the coast of the Cantabrian Sea. Vaqueiro transhumance can be differentiated from non-Vaqueiro transhumance in that all Vaqueiros traditionally lived in the bra√±as year-round which they considered their true home and ancestral land where as non-Vaqueiro transhumant herders did not live with their families in their bra√±as which just served as seasonal pastures.Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez 2009. p. 25. Vaqueiros who live in the bra√±as further east spend more time in the summer bra√±as, from April to October, while Vaqueiros who live in the more western bra√±as spend more time in the winter bra√±as, only spending June to August in the summer bra√±as.Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez 2009. p. 44-47. There are a minority of Vaqueiros who participate in a shorter distance transhumance, with summer bra√±as also located near the coast and nearer to the winter bra√±as, particularly in Tineo and Cangas del Narcea. = Arrier√≠a = A significant minority of Vaqueiros participated in trading and hauling goods by mule, called arrier√≠a and trajiner√≠a. Vaqueiros who participated in arrier√≠a transported goods between Asturias and Castile while Vaqueiros who participated in trajiner√≠a worked shorter routes.Fern√°ndez Rodr√≠guez 2017. p. 282. In later centuries, the Vaqueiros who participated in arrier√≠a also transported travelers between Madrid and Asturias on foot or by mule.  Economy  Vaqueiros traditionally made their living off the sale of calves at cattle fairs. Extra money was made by selling linen, butter, milk, and cheeses in the markets of non-Vaqueiro towns.C√°tedra 1992. p. 13-14.  Culture  = Religion = Though Vaqueiros consider themselves to be Roman Catholic, Vaqueiros traditionally practice a mix of Roman Catholicism and a traditional folk religion.C√°tedra 1992. p.6. Vaqueiros have been historically considered ‚Äúbad Christians‚Äù for their beliefs and for their dedication to their animals and have been persecuted by the Church.C√°tedra 1992. p.10-11. Vaqueiros venerate their patron saint, la Virgen del Acebo, the Virgin of the Holly Tree, whose shrine is in Cangas del Narcea, alongside Saint Anthony (both Anthony of Padua and Anthony the Great).C√°tedra 1992. p. 32. Vaqueiro beliefs also incorporate ancestor worship of the √°nimas, the souls of the dead.C√°tedra 1992. p. 300-301 Vaqueiro religion designates creatures and objects as blessed or cursed and divides the world into three domains: the sky, the earth, and the underground, into which every living thing and non-living things including natural phenomena, days of the week, and phases of the moon, are divided into.C√°tedra 1992. p. 31 Sickness and misfortune are caused by the disorder of these domains.C√°tedra 1992. p. 38. Vaqueiro healing implements spiritual healers and traditional medicine to maintain universal order.C√°tedra 1992. p. 15. The Christian concept of Hell is a foreign concept to Vaqueiros.C√°tedra 1992. p. 289. Although the Vaqueiro world is divided into sky, earth, and the underground, hell is not associated with the underground and has no spatial location. Instead, the ‚Äúbad place‚Äù is associated with the suffering and misfortunes of life.C√°tedra 1992. p. 333 = Kinship = Vaqueiro graves with the family house and bra√±a in Bra√±alonga Vaqueiro society is largely patrilineal and patrilocal.Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez 2009. p. 741-758 It relies on the system of casa, or the house, as a system of inheritance and as a broader spiritual concept. The house includes its living members, deceased members, ancestors, the physical houses, the land associated with the physical houses, the animals of the house, and all the physical belongings of the house. The head of the house is responsible for making leadership and financial decisions for the house and leadership is passed down completely when the previous head dies or partially when the previous head is unable to carry out the responsibilities as the head of the house.C√°tedra 1992. p. 15-16. The house can only be inherited by one person as not to divide the house and the head may choose anyone to pass the house on to, regardless of age or gender, though it is almost always passed down to the oldest son.C√°tedra 1992. p. 129. Marriages were traditionally arranged and the goal of the family of the bride was to marry her into a house of greater prestige than their own.Gayo, Gonzalo. ‚ÄúLos vaqueiros de alzada: un pueblo ejemplar, libre y solidario‚Äù (in Spanish). 17 Aug 2011. p.5.V√°zquez, Aitor Merino (2019). ‚ÄúVisibilidad de la mujer en los vaqueiros de alzada. Una interpretaci√≥n de los estudios etnogr√°ficos‚Äù (in Spanish). p.16.Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez 2009. p. 746-748. Marriages were arranged with a neutral intermediary and the bride's family gave a dowry, which often consisted of livestock or agricultural products, but never land. Vaqueiros are traditionally endogamous within their ethnic group, only marrying other Vaqueiros, and exogamous between houses, only marrying outside the house. Vaqueiro houses have names which are separate from their surnames.Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez 2009. p. 56. Outside the house, Vaqueiros are called by the name of their house, and at their death, the name of their house along with the name of their bra√±a is listed on their grave alongside their given name and surnames.C√°tedra 1992. p. 226. A dance group of Vaqueiros in Gij√≥n, early 1920s = Music = The most popular form of Vaqueiro music is vaqueirada, verses usually arranged into 3/8 or 6/8 time and characterized by complex rhythms on the pandeiru, a traditional frame drum. A popular instrument unique to the Vaqueiros is the paye·∏∑·∏∑a or payetsa, an iron pan whose long handle is stroked with a large metal key to create sound, usually played by a Vaqueira elder.41\\\\.

Aproximaci√≥n multidisciplinar al estudio de las √°reas de pasto en la edad media‚Äù. Debates de Arqueolog√≠a Medieval N√∫m. 3, Nov 2013. Vaqueiros commonly grow clover, wheat, alfalfa, rye, maize, and potatoes.C√°tedra 1992. p. 13. The introduction of maize greatly impacted Vaqueiro agriculture for maize grows faster than wheat or other staple foods.Fern√°ndez Rodr√≠guez 2017. p. 279-280.Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez 2009. p. 473. Much of what Vaqueiros grow is to be consumed by their cattle. Vaqueiro houses traditionally kept two pigs and slaughtered one once a year on a feast day. Vaqueiros did not often slaughter their own cattle except for ritual sacrifices.C√°tedra 1992. p. 360. The most emblematic food of Vaqueiro culture is gurupu, a mix of maize flour, soup, and bacon. Pulientas, a dish of maize flour mixed with potatoes and water is also a popular Vaqueiro food. Cuayada is a common dairy product eaten among Vaqueiro families. Because wheat flour was often prohibitively expensive to Vaqueiros, wheat breads were eaten on special occasions, such as pan del choru, a wheat bread eaten on wedding days.Gayo 2011. p. 18.  Discrimination & racism  Discrimination against Vaqueiros has been recorded since nearly the first written record of Vaqueiros. Vaqueiros were segregated in most public places, particularly the Church, and were banned from running for local office or from voting. Because Vaqueiros were nomadic and lived in the bra√±as, some Vaqueiros did not pay taxes or tithes which led to the forced sedentarization of Vaqueiros for purposes of tax collection.C√°tedra 1992. p. 9-11. The church of Bra√±alonga with a filled-in door on the left which was formerly the door for Vaqueiros For most of their known history, Vaqueiros were considered a separate and inferior race to non-Vaqueiro Asturians and Leonese and the concept of purity of blood was evoked to oppress Vaqueiros on the basis that they were an inferior race.C√°tedra 1992. p. 11-13 In 1551, Vaqueiru men were ordered to be castrated by regidor Don Diego das Marinas to prevent Vaqueiros from reproducing.Acevedo y Huelves 1915. p. 33. Vaqueiros were the subjects of scientific racism, in particular a case in the early 20th century in which the Vaqueiros of the bra√±a of Buspol in Salas were the subjects of phrenological studies in which they were deemed ‚Äòmongoloids‚Äô.Roso de Luna, Mario (1916). El tesoro de los lagos de Somiedo (in Spanish). Madrid: Librer√≠a de la Viuda de Pueyo. p.269 & 345 The Vaqueiros were considered by race scientists and their non-Vaqueiro neighbors to be brachycephalic due to inbreeding, though they have proven to be no more brachycephalic than nearby non-Vaqueiro populations.Acevedo y Huelves 1915. p. 29-30. Segregation of Vaqueiros occurred in churches, cemeteries, bars, and holiday festivals. Early church segregation most often presented as class segregation between nobles, peasants, and Vaqueiros, with Vaqueiros at the bottom of the hierarchy and eventually evolved into ethnic segregation, dividing non-Vaqueiros and Vaqueiros.Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez 2009. p. 471. In bars, Vaqueiros were not allowed to drink out of glasses and instead were made to drink from cups made of animal horns.C√°tedra 1992. p. 11. In 1844, a law was passed to make segregation illegal, however it was largely ignored and did little to curb the segregation of Vaqueiros. It is difficult to tell when exactly the segregation of Vaqueiros ended, but there are reports of segregated churches as late as 1955.C√°tedra 1992. p. 358. A suicide epidemic among the Vaqueiros has been active since at least the 1960s and the Vaqueiros have one of the greatest suicide rates in Europe at least 28.C√°tedra 1992.McDonald, Charles J-H. ‚ÄúUrug.

Genetics  A study of Vaqueiro mitochondrial DNA by Pedro Mercader G√≥mez et al. in 2013 suggests that the Vaqueiros are native to western Asturias and share a common background with non-Vaqueiros but have evolved to become genetically distinct from the non- Vaqueiro Asturian and Leonese population.Mercader G√≥mez, Pedro et al. ‚ÄúEffect of mitochondrial, APOE.

He has also caused no small amount of controversy in his career, specifically related to legal issues regarding his publishing new adventures of the 1950s character Marvelman, as well as charges of plagiarism about Skinn's 2004 book Comix: The Underground Revolution.  Fandom  Skinn first came to prominence in the world of British comics fandom. As a teenager he contributed articles to the seminal fanzine Fantasy Advertiser, published by Frank Dobson (known as the \\"Godfather of British Fandom\\").Skinn, Dez. \\"Early days of UK comics conventions and marts,\\" DezSkinn.com. Accessed Mar. 3, 2013. When Dobson left for Australia in 1970, he handed the zine on to two contributors, Skinn and Paul McCartney, to continue. As editors, Skinn and McCartney expanded the magazine to include more articles and artwork. (Skinn stayed on at Fantasy Advertiser even after starting his professional career at IPC Magazines; finally leaving the fanzine in 1976.)Dez Skinn, \\"Fantasy Advertiser: the Big One!\\" In 1971 Skinn and Bram Stokes produced Comicon '71 (the British Comic Art Convention) at the Waverley Hotel in London; the guest of honor was Frank Bellamy and other guests include Frank Dickens, Mick Farren, and Edward Barker. Skinn returned in 1981 to produce the final incarnation of Comicon, co-organized with Frank Dobson.

(Under Skinn's editorship, Mad UK also won the 1977 Eagle Award for Favourite Black & White Comicbook - Humour.) = Starburst = In January 1978, Skinn independently created the science fiction monthly Starburst, published under Skinn's own Starburst Publishing Ltd. Sporting the tagline \\"Science Fantasy in Television, Cinema and Comix,\\" Starburst contained news, interviews, features and reviews of science fiction material in various media (including TV, film, soundtracks, multimedia, comics and \\"collectibles\\").

(With issue #4, Marvel also bought and began to publish Starburst.) In his 15 months as editorial director for Marvel UK, Skinn reported directly to Lee; he reformatted the existing titles Marvel Comic, Star Wars Weekly, and Spider-Man Comics Weekly, plus the monthlies Rampage and Savage Sword of Conan. In addition, Skinn launched Doctor Who WeeklySkinn bio, Starburst International Film Festival website (8 January 2018). and Hulk Comic, among many other titles ‚Äî Frantic Magazine, Marvel Pocket Books, Star Heroes, TV Heroes, summer specials, winter specials, etc. In 2010 Skinn received a Guinness World Records certificate and credit for creating the world's longest-lasting TV tie-in magazine for Doctor Who Weekly.John, Andrew. \\"Guinness World Record for Doctor Who Magazine,\\" Digital Journal (3 April 2010). = Quality Communications = Leaving Marvel in 1980 for his own company, the London West End Studio System, Skinn worked primarily in advertising design for both the film and fashion industry. In 1982 he returned to publishing with his own company, Quality Communications, where Skinn founded and edited the comics anthology Warrior. Warrior went on to win 17 Eagle Awards, introduce V for Vendetta, and revive Marvelman/Miracleman. In 1990, Quality Communications launched the comics trade magazine Comics International, which Skinn published and edited for the following 16 years. His \\"Sez Dez\\" column was a regular feature in issues #100‚Äì#200, at which point Skinn sold the magazine in 2006 to Cosmic Publications. Since 2005, Quality has published The Jack Kirby Quarterly and The Art of John Watkiss. = Columnist = Skinn now writes a column called \\"The Skinny\\" for Future plc's comics trade magazine Comic Heroes. Because of his strong beliefs in education through entertainment and the increasing world levels in illiteracy, he has recently begun working with the Abu Dhabi Music and Arts Foundation, initially chairing a discussion there on comics and literacy in the Middle East, which led to his becoming curator of the Middle East Film and Comic Con, which debuted in 2012.  Controversy  = Marvelman (a.k.a. Miracleman) = Before launching Warrior, Skinn contacted writer Alan Moore, telling him that \\"Marvelman's copyright had belonged to the publisher L. Miller & Son, ... that they had gone bankrupt in 1963[,] and that the rights to Marvelman had passed to the Official Receiver [and therefore] could be purchased for a very small amount...\\"; and asked Moore if he \\"would ... like to ... contribute to this new retelling of Marvelman.\\"Amacker, Kurt. ‚ÄúAlan Moore Reflects on Marvelman,‚Äù Mania.com (3 September 2009) A quarter-century later Moore found out that Marvelman creator \\"Mick Anglo had always owned the copyright, that it had never been owned by L. Miller & Son, and that they had not gone bankrupt, but had concluded their affairs quietly in 1963 .... Basically, Mick Anglo had been robbed of his ownership of [Marvelman].\\" According to Moore, \\"I was not on the best of terms with Dez Skinn by the end of the Warrior experience. I didn't trust the man, and my opinion ‚Äì for what that is worth ‚Äì is that there was knowing deceit involved in the Marvelman decision.\\" But according to Skinn, he had met with Anglo three times before assigning creators to Marvelman and Anglo had expressed no problem with the relaunch then or for the following 20+ years. Skinn cites quotes by Mick Anglo from George Khoury's 2001 book Kimota!: The Miracleman Companion, \\"[Regarding ownership] I don't know; that was Miller's sort of thing ... Dez contacted me and he wanted to revive it and I said go ahead and do what you like.\\"Khoury, George. Kimota!: The Miracleman Companion (TwoMorrows Publishing; 1st edition, 1 September 2001), p.10. After Warrior magazine folded due to poor sales, Skinn signed a deal with independent American publisher Eclipse Comics to reprint the Marvelman stories (under the title Miracleman) before continuing the storyline with new material by Moore and later Neil Gaiman. According to an editorial by then-Eclipse editor Cat Yronwode in Miracleman #24: For Kimota!: The Miracleman Companion George Khoury interviewed both Skinn and Yronwode ‚Äî separately ‚Äî and asked each about the claims published in Miracleman No. 24. Skinn claimed to Khoury that \\"[a]bout ten years after that Miracleman No. 24 letters page,\\" he and Yronwode had a \\"conversation via e-mail about that outrageous stuff.\\" According to Skinn, Yronwode informed him that \\"Dean [Mullaney, Eclipse Comics co-founder,] had filled her head with those stories\\" and apologised to him.Khoury, Kimota!, p.47. But when Khoury relayed this to Yronwode during his interview with her she denied it, maintaining that the \\"conversation with Dez Skinn about that\\" never happened and that she never apologised.Khoury, Kimota!, p.117. = Comix: The Underground Revolution = In 2004 Collins & Brown published Skinn's book Comix: The Underground Revolution. Skinn's authorship of the book was contested by Patrick Rosenkranz and Trina Robbins. Rosenkranz alleged that \\"Skinn's book extensively \\"borrowed\\" from [his own book] Rebel Visions: The Underground Comix Revolution 1963‚Äì1975\\" by using as its title \\"the same four words, cleverly rearranged, [used] as the subtitle of [his] book,\\" \\"helping himself to quotes from many interviews [he] conducted, repeating facts and figures that [he] dug up,\\" and \\"reprint[ing] seven of [his] photographs without permission.\\" Skinn responded by insisting that \\"No theft was intended\\". Skinn claims that those seven photographs had been implemented by one of the ghost writers subcontracted by him and when he found out about it, he apologised to and paid Rosenkranz. Skinn claims also that the book title was chosen by the commissioning publisher. Robbins noted that she wrote Chapter 6, \\"Girls on Top?\\" for Comix: The Underground Revolution but was not given credit. \\"... Dez e-mailed me with a request to contribute a chapter on women in the underground ... I did get paid for it ... one usually expects to be credited for what one writes\\". Skinn claims that he informed Robbins that no sub-contractors were credited in any of the publisher's titles, and that as the chapter was primarily about her, any such credit would have completely undermined its purported objectivity.

Beginning as a classical scholar, his later work branched into wide-ranging, erudite, and intellectually sophisticated considerations of history, literature, psychology, culture, and other topics. Brown advanced some novel theses and in his time achieved some general notability. Life Brown's father was an Anglo-Irish mining engineer. His mother was a Cuban of Alsatian and Cuban origin. He was educated at Clifton College, \\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p418: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 then Balliol College, Oxford (B.A., M.A., Greats; his tutor was Isaiah Berlin) and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison (Ph.D., Classics). In 1938, Brown married Elizabeth Potter. During the Second World War, he worked for the Office of Strategic Services as a specialist on French culture. His supervisor was Carl Schorske, and his colleagues included Herbert Marcuse and Franz Neumann. His other friends included the historians Christopher Hill and Hayden White as well as the philosopher Stuart Hampshire. At Wesleyan University, he befriended the composer John Cage, an association that proved fruitful to both.http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/cage-radio.html Brown became a professor of classics at Wesleyan. During Brown's tenure there, Schorske became a professor of history and the two engaged in a mutually beneficial interdisciplinary discourse. In 1970, Brown was interviewed by Warren Bennis and Sam Keen for Psychology Today. Bennis asked him whether he lived out the vision of polymorphous perversity in his books. He replied, > I perceive a necessary gap between seeing and being. I would not be able to > have said certain things if I had been under the obligation to unify the > word and the deed. As it is I can let my words reach out and net impossible > things - things that are impossible for me to do. And this is a way of > paying the price for saying or seeing things. You will remember that I > discovered these things as a late learner. Polymorphous perversity in the > literal, physical sense is not the real issue. I don't like the suggestion > that polymorphous perversity of the imagination is somehow second-best to > literal polymorphous perversity. Work Brown's commentary on Hesiod's Theogony and his first monograph, Hermes the Thief: The Evolution of a Myth, showed a Marxist tendency. Brown supported Henry A. Wallace's Progressive Party candidacy for president in 1948.Obituary in the New York Times Following Brown's disenchantment with politics in the wake of the 1948 presidential election, he studied the works of Sigmund Freud. This culminated in his classic 1959 work, Life Against Death. The book's fame grew when Norman Podhoretz recommended it to Lionel Trilling. In May 1960 Brown, who was then teaching at Wesleyan University, delivered a Phi Beta Kappa Address to Columbia University.Michael S. Roth, EDUCATION, FREEDOM AND DISTINCTION Remarks at the Phi Beta Kappa Initiation (2008) http://www.wesleyan.edu/president/text/2008_phibetakappa.html Love's Body, published in 1966, examines \\"the role of erotic love in human history, describing a struggle between eroticism and civilization.\\" In the late 1960s, following a stay at the University of Rochester, Brown moved to the University of California, Santa Cruz, as professor of humanities, teaching in the History of Consciousness and Literature departments. He was a highly popular professor, known to friends and students alike as \\"Nobby\\". The range of courses he taught, while broadly focused around the themes of poetics, mythology, and psychoanalysis, included classes on Finnegans Wake, Islam, and, with Schorske, Goethe's Faust. Apocalypse and/or Metamorphosis, published in 1991, is an anthology that includes many of Brown's later writings. In The Challenge of Islam, a collection of lectures given in 1981 and published in 2009, Brown argues that Islam challenges us to make life a work of art. Drawing on Henri Corbin's The Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn ‚ÄòArabi, he argues that \\"Muhammad is the bridge between Christ and Dante and Blake.\\" Influence on Ernest Becker The Denial of Death is a 1973 work of psychology and philosophy by Ernest Becker, in which the author builds on the works of Brown, S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Sigmund Freud, and Otto Rank.* It was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction in 1974.Pulitzer Prizes website  See also  *Freudo-Marxism Books *1947.

It is traditionally flavoured with tea, dried fruits and mixed spices, and is served sliced and buttered at tea time. A decrease in its popularity led to supermarket Morrisons removing it from their shelves in 2006, and a year later a survey showed that 36% of teenagers in Wales had never tried it. It has been subsequently championed by celebrity chefs such as Bryn Williams. Several variations on bara brith have been made, including changing it into a chocolate and into ice cream. History Bara brith derived its name from the Welsh language, meaning bread and translating as speckled. It is claimed to have been invented by a Welsh chef who added dried fruit and spices to a bread dough, creating the first version of the traditional Welsh tea loaf. It has subsequently been used as a colloquialism ‚Äì to \\"over spice the bara brith\\" means to do something to excess. In 2006, British supermarket chain Morrisons withdrew bara brith from sale at 19 of its Wales-based stores. Complaints were issued in the press, but the company insisted that the bread was removed because of lack of sales. A survey conducted by British supermarket chain Sainsbury's in 2006 showed that 36% of teenagers in Wales surveyed had never tried bara brith. When responses across the UK were viewed, some 85% of teenagers had never tried the traditional Welsh bread. Celebrity chef Phil Vickery cooked bara brith in , Anglesey, in 2011 for a segment on the ITV television series This Morning. He used a traditional recipe which had been handed down to local chef Nerys Roberts through her family. Her bakery had previously supplied British supermarket chain Safeway with bara brith, before it was bought out by Morrisons. Beca Lyne-Pirkis baked a bara brith for one her entries during the fourth season of the BBC television series The Great British Bake Off in 2013. Although she based it on her grandmother's recipe, she found it difficult to complete within the three hours allocated for that round. But, it won praise from judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry. Recipe The bread is made by mixing flour (either white or self raising), yeast (if not using self-raising flour), butter, mixed dried fruit (such as raisins, currants and sultanas), mixed spices and an egg. Some recipes favour soaking the dried fruit in tea overnight before the baking. This mixture is then proofed to allow fermentation to take place. After an initial period, the air is knocked out of the mixture and it is allowed to proof once more. This period of preparation can take up to two hours, including the resting time for the bread mixture. It is then baked in an oven. Bara brith is traditionally served at tea time, alongside tea. It is normally served in slices with butter spread on one side. =Variations= In Argentina, bara brith is also known as (\\"black cake\\"). One of the most traditional foods coming out of the Chubut valleys, it was brought by the Welsh settlers who started arriving in the country in 1865. Other variations exist within Wales. Lyne-Pirkis' version of the bara brith on The Great British Bake Off substituted a tea oil to replace the overnight soaking process for the fruit. In E. Smith Twiddy's The Little Welsh Cookbook, a cup of cold tea is included in the mixture, and marmalade is used as a glaze. Celebrity chef Bryn Williams uses lard in his recipe, and a combination of raisins and candied peel as the mixed fruit. The flavours of a bara brith have also been made into other types of food. Pemberton's Victorian Chocolates in Llanboidy, Carmarthenshire, developed a Bara Brith-inspired chocolate in 2009, using a tea-flavoured cream-filled chocolate complemented with dried fruit and possessing a cake-like texture. When Charles, Prince of Wales visited Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, in 2011, he tried bara brith ice-cream. It had been created by a local ice-cream parlour who knew of the Prince's fondness for the bread.

Having a thriving silk industry in the 19th century, the village was named in 1852 after Florence, Italy, for its own thriving silk trade in Europe. History =The naming of Florence= The name \\"Florence\\" was suggested by neurologist Dr. Charles Munde, who also operated a hydropathic establishment there, named Florence Water-Cure. > From the very early days of Northampton till 1847, the locality now called > Florence was known as \\"Broughton's Meadow.\\" Soon after 1810 another name was > applied commonly to this region, namely the \\"Warner School District.\\" The > Northampton Association of Education and Industry was started in 1842, and > while it existed, the common term given to the settlement was \\"The > Community.\\" In 1848 these three names gave way to Bensonville, and when two > years later Mr. Benson failed, and the old appellation became objectionable, > the village was called Greenville, from the new cotton company. In the fall > of 1852 a meeting of the villagers was held in the South schoolhouse to > choose a name for the place. Postal communication was soon to be established > and a new name was desired. \\"Shepherd's Hollow\\" with its woolen mills, had > been named \\"Leeds\\" after the city of Leeds in England, and the name of the > great silk emporium of Italy was offered by Dr. Munde as a suitable > appellation for this place.

Later, Whitmarsh's silk mill (in nearby Leeds, Massachusetts) was briefly run as a communal project by the Northampton Association of Education and Industry, a utopian community of abolitionists, who believed that the rights of all should be \\"equal without distinction of sex, color or condition, sect or religion.\\" Sojourner Truth, a former slave who became a nationally known advocate for equality and justice, was a member of this community (she had moved to Florence in 1843). After the community dissolved in 1846, she bought a house on Park Street, where she lived until 1857. A memorial statue was erected in her honor in Florence in 2002. Samuel L. Hill, the spiritual leader of the Northampton Association of Education and Industry, invented a machine that could spin silk smooth enough to be used in sewing machines. After the commune dissolved, Hill took over the factory and ran it as the Nonotuck Silk Company. Hill's home at 31-35 Maple Street in Florence served as a stop for the Underground Railway. The company changed its name again, and, as the Corticelli Silk Company, grew to be one of the world's largest producers of silk thread, made with raw silk imported from Japan. In New York City, the Corticelli logo‚Äîa kitten playing with a spool of thread‚Äîloomed over Broadway from a huge electrical sign at 42nd Street between 1910 and 1913 . The company went out of business in 1930. David Ruggles was an \\"African-American printer in New York City during the 1830s\\", who \\"was the prototype for black activist journalists of his time\\". He had edited a New York paper called The Mirror. In 1841, his father died, and as he was himself ailing and almost blind, friends arranged for him to join a commune in Northampton, Massachusetts. Applying home treatment upon hydropathic principles, he regained his health to some degree, but not his eyesight. He began practicing hydropathy, and by 1845, had established a water cure hospital in the area now known as Florence. This was one of the earliest in the United States, although others, notably Joel Shew, and Russell Thacher Trall (R.T. Trall), had preceded him. Charles Munde emigrated from Germany. He became familiar with the water cure methods of Vincent Priessnitz around 1836, and treated scarlet fever cases in Dresden during the winter of 1845-46. From childhood recollections of one of his sons, Paul F. Munde, the family went to the area now (but not then, per Sheffeld) called Florence \\"in the early fifties\\", after his father had struggled \\"for nearly a year in New York in search of a practice\\". After the death of David Ruggles in 1849, Charles Munde learned \\"of the opportunity to take up his favorite method\\", which led him to pick up where Ruggles left off, thence to the naming of Florence, and accordingly, the name of the Florence Water Cure, also called the Munde Water Cure. =Recent history= Mirage Studios, the creative force behind the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic books was based out of a renovated factory space in Florence. Florence was the filming location for the 1999 movie, \\"In Dreams.\\" Landmarks include the Miss Florence Diner, a 1950s style diner famous for its milkshakes and pies, as well as Cooper's Corner.

Also whatever more there may be of my Estate than the said Three Hundred Thousand, (300,000,) Dollars, after the said payments at my decease, I hereby appropriate for the same object, that is to say, said excess shall be added to the said Three Hundred Thousand, (300,000,) Dollars, for the establishment and maintenance of said College, but if at my decease there shall not be remaining, after said payments, the sum of Three Hundred Thousand, (300,000,) Dollars, then I order and direct that whatever sum shall remain after said payments, shall be put at interest, till such time as it shall amount to Three Hundred Thousand, (300,000,) Dollars, after which said College shall be immediately founded and put in operation. *Article 3: Sensible of what the Christian Religion has done for my sex, and believing that all education should be for the glory of God, and the good of man, I direct that the Holy Scriptures be daily and systematically read and studied in said College, and without giving preference to any sect or denomination, all the education and all the discipline shall be pervaded by the Spirit of Evangelical Christian Religion. I direct, also, that higher culture in the English Language and Literature be given in said College; also, in Ancient and Modern Languages, in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences, in the Useful and the Fine Arts, in Intellectual, Moral and Aesthetic Philosophy, in Natural Theology, in the Evidences of Christianity, in Gymnastics and Physical Culture, in the Sciences and Arts, which pertain to Education, Society, and Government, and in such other studies as coming times may develop or demand for the education of women and the progress of the race. I would have the education suited to the mental and physical wants of woman. It is not my design to render my sex any the less feminine, but to develop as fully as may be the powers of womanhood, and furnish women with the means of usefulness, happiness and honor, now withheld from them. *Article 4: I appoint the following persons to be the first Trustees of said College, to-wit: Hon. Charles E. Forbes and Hon. Osmyn Baker, both of Northampton, Rev. John M. Greene, of South Hadley, Profs. Wm. S. Tyler, and Julius H. Seelye, both of Amherst, Hon. Wm. B. Washburn, of Greenfield, Prof. Edwards A. Park, of Andover, Hon. Joseph White of Williamstown, Rev. B. G. Northrop of New Haven, Conn., Hon. Edward B. Gillett of Westfield. and George W. Hubbard, of Hatfield. *Article 5: The above-mentioned Trustees, and their associates and successors, shall have full power to increase their number, to fill vacancies, invest and expend this money, and to found and set in operation the Institution, as soon as may be after my decease, and order all its concerns, in such manner as they may judge best calculated to accomplish the objects before stated. Only I direct that not more than one-half of the sum appropriated by me to this object, shall be invested in buildings and grounds, the other half or more shall be invested by the Trustees in a safe manner, to be a permanent fund, the interest of which alone shall be used forever for furnishing teachers, library, and apparatus, for the higher education of young women, and for the general purposes and objects of the Institution. It is my wish that the Institution be so conducted, that during all coming time it shall do the most good to the greatest number. I would have it a perennial blessing to the country and the world. FOURTEENTH: I hereby order and direct that said College shall be located in the Town of Northampton, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, provided the citizens of said Town of Northampton shall within two years after the probate of this Will raise and pay over or cause to be raised and paid over to the said Charles E. Forbes and George W. Hubbard, Trustees as aforesaid, or the Board of Trustees of said College, if the same shall have been incorporated and organized, the sum of Twenty Five Thousand, (25,000,) Dollars, to be added to the permanent fund of said College, and subject to all the regulations, requirements and restrictions, hereinbefore made, for the investment and expenditure of said fund. But if said Twenty Five Thousand, (25,000,) Dollars shall not be raised and paid over as aforesaid, then I order and direct that said College shall be located in the Town of Hatfield, aforesaid, and the provisions and directions hereinbefore made for the establishment of said College, for its regulation and management, the investment and expenditure of its funds shall be applicable to the same so located in said Town of Hatfield.  Awards and achievements  In 1942, the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College was established as a repository of manuscripts, archives, photographs, periodicals, and other primary sources in women's history. Its first director was Margaret Storrs Grierson. In 2000, Smith was inducted posthumously to the National Women's Hall of Fame.

His combat with Priscus was the highlight of the opening day of the games conducted by Titus to inaugurate the Flavian Amphitheatre (later the Colosseum) in AD 80, and recorded in a laudatory poem by Martial -- the only detailed description of a gladiatorial fight that has survived to the present day. Both gladiators were declared victors of the combat, and were awarded their freedom by the Emperor in a unique outcome. Martial, Liber de Spectaculis, XXIX: { As Priscus and Verus each lengthened the contest, And for a long time the battle was equal on each side, Repeatedly loud shouts petitioned for the men to be released; But Titus followed his own law; -- It was the law to fight without shield until a finger was raised: -- He did what was allowed, often gave dishes and gifts. But an end was found to the equal division: Equals to fight, equals to yield. Titus sent wooden swords to both and palms to both: Thus skillful courage received its prize. This took place under no prince except you, Titus: When two fought, both were the victor. Cum traheret Priscus, traheret certamina Verus, esset et aequalis Mars utriusque diu, missio saepe uiris magno clamore petita est; sed Titus legi paruit ipse suae; -- lex erat, ad digitum posita concurrere parma: -- quod licuit, lances donaque saepe dedit.

In the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Nations the equivalent term is active service. India The Indian Armed Forces are considered to be one of the largest active service forces in the world, with almost 1.42 million Active Standing Army. An additional 2.20 million reserve forces can be activated in a few weeks as per the situation under the order of the President of India who is the Commander and Chief of the Armed Forces of India. This does not include the additional 1 million troops of the Paramilitary who too are an active force whose full-time responsibility is to guard the sovereignty of the nation from internal and external threats. Israel In the Israel Defense Forces, there are two types of active duty: regular service (), and active reserve duty (, abbr. Shamap). Regular service refers to either mandatory service (), according to the laws of Israel, or standing army service (), which consists of paid NCOs and officers. Active reserve service refers to the actual time in which reservists are called up. This varies from once every few years to a month every year. During active reserve duty, military law can be applied to reservists, similarly to regular soldiers. Pakistan The Pakistan Armed Forces are one of the largest active service forces in the world, with almost 654,000 full-time personnel, due to the complex and volatile nature of Pakistan's relationship with India and the Kashmir region, and its porous border with Afghanistan. An additional 550,000 part-time reservists (including armed civilians of FATA) can be activated in a few weeks as per the situation under the order of the President of Pakistan who is the Commander and Chief of the Armed Forces of Pakistan. This does not include the additional 482,000 troops of the Paramilitary who too are an active force whose full-time responsibility is to guard the sovereignty of the nation from internal and external threats. United States In the United States military, active duty refers to military members who are currently serving on full-time status in their military capacity. Full-time status is not limited to members of the active components of the military services; members of any of the three components (active, reserve, and the National Guard) may be placed into active status. All personnel in the active components are in active status. Reservists may be placed into active status as units or individuals. Units may be mobilized in support of operations, such as the reserve units that have been deployed in support of the Global War on Terror or those called up within the United States to provide support to civil authorities. Individuals may be placed in active status as part of the Active Guard Reserve program, as augmentees to active or reserve component units, or to attend full-time military training.

This new system is more precise in defining magic cubes. But possibly of more importance, it is consistent for all orders and all dimensions of magic hypercubes. Minimum requirements for a cube to be magic are: All rows, columns, pillars, and 4 triagonals must sum to the same value.  The six classes * Simple: The minimum requirements for a magic cube are: All rows, columns, pillars, and 4 triagonals must sum to the same value. A Simple magic cube contains no magic squares or not enough to qualify for the next class. The smallest normal simple magic cube is order 3. Minimum correct summations required = 3m2 \\\\+ 4 * Diagonal: Each of the 3m planar arrays must be a simple magic square. The 6 oblique squares are also simple magic. The smallest normal diagonal magic cube is order 5. These squares were referred to as ‚ÄòPerfect‚Äô by Gardner and others! At the same time he referred to Langman‚Äôs 1962 pandiagonal cube also as ‚ÄòPerfect‚Äô. Christian Boyer and Walter Trump now consider this and the next two classes to be Perfect. (See Alternate Perfect below). A. H. Frost referred to all but the simple class as Nasik cubes. The smallest normal diagonal magic cube is order 5. See Diagonal magic cube. Minimum correct summations required = 3m2 \\\\+ 6m + 4 * Pantriagonal: All 4m2 pantriagonals must sum correctly (that is 4 one-segment, 12(m-1) two-segment, and 4(m-2)(m-1) three-segment). There may be some simple AND/OR pandiagonal magic squares, but not enough to satisfy any other classification. The smallest normal pantriagonal magic cube is order 4. See Pantriagonal magic cube. Minimum correct summations required = 7m2. All pan-r-agonals sum correctly for r = 1 and 3. * PantriagDiag: A cube of this class was first constructed in late 2004 by Mitsutoshi Nakamura. This cube is a combination Pantriagonal magic cube and Diagonal magic cube. Therefore, all main and broken triagonals sum correctly, and it contains 3m planar simple magic squares. In addition, all 6 oblique squares are pandiagonal magic squares. The only such cube constructed so far is order 8. It is not known what other orders are possible. See Pantriagdiag magic cube. Minimum correct summations required = 7m2 \\\\+ 6m * Pandiagonal: ALL 3m planar arrays must be pandiagonal magic squares. The 6 oblique squares are always magic (usually simple magic). Several of them MAY be pandiagonal magic. Gardner also called this (Langman‚Äôs pandiagonal) a ‚Äòperfect‚Äô cube, presumably not realizing it was a higher class then Myer‚Äôs cube. See previous note re Boyer and Trump. The smallest normal pandiagonal magic cube is order 7. See Pandiagonal magic cube. Minimum correct summations required = 9m2 \\\\+ 4. All pan-r-agonals sum correctly for r = 1 and 2. * Perfect: ALL 3m planar arrays must be pandiagonal magic squares. In addition, ALL pantriagonals must sum correctly. These two conditions combine to provide a total of 9m pandiagonal magic squares. The smallest normal perfect magic cube is order 8. See Perfect magic cube. Nasik; A. H. Frost (1866) referred to all but the simple magic cube as Nasik! C. Planck (1905) redefined Nasik to mean magic hypercubes of any order or dimension in which all possible lines summed correctly. i.e. Nasik is a preferred alternate, and less ambiguous term for the perfect class. Minimum correct summations required = 13m2. All pan-r-agonals sum correctly for r = 1, 2 and 3. Alternate Perfect Note that the above is a relatively new definition of perfect. Until about 1995 there was much confusion about what constituted a perfect magic cube (see the discussion under diagonal:) . Included below are references and links to discussions of the old definition With the popularity of personal computers it became easier to examine the finer details of magic cubes. Also more and more work was being done with higher dimension magic Hypercubes. For example, John Hendricks constructed the world's first Nasik magic tesseract in 2000. Classed as a perfect magic tesseract by Hendricks definition. Generalized for All Dimensions A magic hypercube of dimension n is perfect if all pan-n-agonals sum correctly. Then all lower dimension hypercubes contained in it are also perfect. For dimension 2, The Pandiagonal Magic Square has been called perfect for many years. This is consistent with the perfect (nasik) definitions given above for the cube. In this dimension, there is no ambiguity because there are only two classes of magic square, simple and perfect. In the case of 4 dimensions, the magic tesseract, Mitsutoshi Nakamura has determined that there are 18 classes. He has determined their characteristics and constructed examples of each. And in this dimension also, the Perfect (nasik) magic tesseract has all possible lines summing correctly and all cubes and squares contained in it are also nasik magic. Another definition and a table Proper: A Proper magic cube is a magic cube belonging to one of the six classes of magic cube, but containing exactly the minimum requirements for that class of cube. i.e. a proper simple or pantriagonal magic cube would contain no magic squares, a proper diagonal magic cube would contain exactly 3m + 6 simple magic squares, etc. This term was coined by Mitsutoshi Nakamura in April, 2004. Image:MinimumLines-b.png Notes for table # For the diagonal or pandiagonal classes, one or possibly 2 of the 6 oblique magic squares may be pandiagonal magic. All but 6 of the oblique squares are ‚Äòbroken‚Äô. This is analogous to the broken diagonals in a pandiagonal magic square. i.e. Broken diagonals are 1-D in a 2_D square; broken oblique squares are 2-D in a 3-D cube. # The table shows the minimum lines or squares required for each class (i.e. Proper). Usually there are more, but not enough of one type to qualify for the next class.  See also  * Magic hypercube * Nasik magic hypercube * Panmagic square * Space diagonal * John R.

Development Sea Shadow was built in 1984 to examine the application of stealth technology on naval vessels, and was used in secret until a public debut in 1993. In addition, the ship was designed to test the use of automation to reduce crew size. The ship was created by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the U.S. Navy and Lockheed. Sea Shadow was developed and built at Lockheed's Redwood City, California facility, inside the Hughes Mining Barge (HMB-1), which functioned as a floating drydock during construction and testing. History Sea Shadow had a SWATH (small-waterplane-area twin hull) design. Below the water were submerged twin hulls, each with a propeller, aft stabilizer, and inboard hydrofoil. The portion of the ship above water was connected to the hulls via the two angled struts. The SWATH design helped the ship remain stable in rough water up to sea state 6 (wave height of 18 feet (5.5 m) or \\"very rough\\" sea). The shape of the superstructure was sometimes compared to the casemate of the ironclad ram of the American Civil War.. Sea Shadow had 12 bunks, one small microwave oven, a refrigerator and table. It was not intended to be mission-capable and was never commissioned, although it is listed in the Naval Vessel Register. Sea Shadow was revealed to the public in 1993, and was housed at the San Diego Naval Station until September 2006, when it was relocated with the Hughes Mining Barge to the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet in Benicia, California. Until 2006, Sea Shadow and the HMB-1 were maintained and operated by Lockheed Martin for the US Navy. The vessels were available for donation to a maritime museum. The USNS Impeccable and Victorious ocean surveillance ships have inherited the stabilizer and canard method to help perform their stability-sensitive intelligence collection missions. In 2006, the U.S. Navy tried to sell Sea Shadow to the highest bidder; after the initial offering met with a lack of interest, it was listed for dismantling sale on gsaauctions.gov. The US government mandated that the buyer not sail the ship and be required to scrap it.

He was twice offered the throne of Albania. From 1911 until his death he was a Conservative Member of Parliament. His eldest half-brother was George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon (1866‚Äì1923), the famous Egyptologist who discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun, who predeceased him by five months, by legend due to the \\"curse of the pharaohs\\". He suffered during most of his life from poor eyesight and was almost blind by his early 40s. Origins Aubrey Herbert was born at Highclere Castle in Hampshire, the second son of Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, a wealthy landowner, British cabinet minister, and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. His mother (his father's second wife and cousin) was Elizabeth Catherine Howard (1856‚Äì1929Per inscribed brass tablet in Brushford Church) (\\"Elsie\\"), a daughter of Henry Howard of Greystoke Castle, near Penrith, Cumberland, a son of Lord Henry Howard-Molyneux-Howard, younger brother of Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk. Elizabeth Howard's brother was Esm√© Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Penrith. Aubrey Herbert was a younger half-brother of George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, the noted Egyptologist who in 1922, together with Howard Carter, discovered Tutankhamen's tomb. From early childhood Aubrey was afflicted with eye problems which left him nearly blind, and resulted in a total loss of sight before the age of 40. Early life Herbert was educated at Eton College. He obtained a first class degree in modern history from Balliol College, Oxford. He was famous for climbing the roofs of the university buildings, despite his near blindness. He numbered among his friends Adrian Carton De Wiart, Raymond Asquith, John Buchan, and Hilaire Belloc. Reginald Farrer remained close throughout his life. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Nottinghamshire (Sherwood Rangers) Yeomanry Cavalry on 12 January 1900, and promoted to lieutenant on 11 June 1902. His poor eyesight, however, prevented him from taking part in the South African War. Herbert received as a gift from his father the estate of Pixton Park in Somerset, with 5,000 acres (20 km2) of land, inherited by the Herbert family from Elizabeth Kitty Acland, wife of Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon. His friendship with Middle Eastern traveller and advisor Sir Mark Sykes dates from his entry into parliament in 1911 when, with George Lloyd, they were the three youngest Conservative MPs. They shared an interest in foreign policy and worked closely in the Arab Bureau (1916). He was also a close friend of T. E. Lawrence; their letters do not feature in the standard Lawrence collections, but are quoted by Margaret Fitzherbert in her biography of her grandfather, The Man Who Was Greenmantle. Languages and travels Herbert was in his own right a considerable Orientalist, and a linguist who spoke French, Italian, German, Turkish, Arabic, Greek, and Albanian as well as English. A renowned traveller, especially in the Middle East, his trips include journeys through Japan, Yemen, Turkey, and Albania. Herbert often dressed as a tramp on his travels. During the period 1902‚Äì04, he was an honorary attach√© in Tokyo, then in Constantinople (1904‚Äì05). He was much more interested in the Middle East than in the Far East. Albania Herbert became a passionate advocate of Albanian independence, having visited the country in 1907, 1911, and 1913. During a stay in Tirana (1913), he befriended Essad Pasha. When the Albanian delegates to the 1912‚Äì13 London Balkan Peace Conference arrived, they secured Herbert's assistance as an advisor. He was very active fighting for their cause and is regarded as having considerable influence on Albania's success at obtaining eventual independence in the resulting Treaty of London (1913). One of his constant correspondents on Albania was Edith Durham. He was twice offered the throne of Albania. On the first occasion in 1914, just before the outbreak of World War I, he was interested, but Prime Minister H.H. Asquith, a family friend, dissuaded him. The offer remained unofficial and was rejected by the Foreign Office. The Albanian crown went to William of Wied. The second occasion the crown was offered was after the defeat of the Italian Army by the Albanians in September 1920. Again the offer was unofficial, although it was made on behalf of the Albanian Government. Herbert discussed the offer with Philip Kerr and Maurice Hankey, pursuing the idea of perhaps acting under the banner of the League of Nations; Eric Drummond, Herbert's friend, had become its first secretary general, and by lobbying led to Albania's acceptance as a member in the League of Nations in December 1920.Margaret Fitzherbert, The Man Who Was Greenmantle: A Biography of Aubrey Herbert, John Murray, London, 1983.Fitzherbert, Chapter 14: \\"The dear journey's end\\". With a change of foreign ministers in the Albanian Government, Herbert's chance of gaining a crown greatly diminished. In April 1921, the crown was, even more unofficially, offered to the Duke of Atholl by Jim Barnes of the British Friends of Albania residing in Italy.S.J. Hetherington, Katharine Atholl (1874‚Äì1960) Against the Tide, pp. 88-90, Aberdeen University Press, 1989; . Parliament Herbert was an independent- minded Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for the Southern division of Somerset from 1911 to 1918, and for Yeovil from 1918 to his death. Always an advocate of the rights of smaller nations, he opposed the British Government's Irish policy. The First World War =1914‚Äì1915= Despite very poor eyesight, Herbert was able, at the outbreak of World War I in 1914, to join the Irish Guards, in which he served in a supernumerary position. He did this by purchasing a uniform and boarding a troopship bound for France. During the Battle of Mons, he was wounded, taken prisoner, and escaped. After a convalescence in England and unable to rejoin due to his ocular disability, Aubrey was proposed for service in military intelligence in Egypt by Kitchener's military secretary, Oswald FitzGerald, via Mark Sykes (see Baghdad Railway). In January 1915, Herbert was attached to the Intelligence Department in Cairo under Colonel Gilbert Clayton. In mid-February, he was sent on an intelligence mission into the eastern Mediterranean aboard the cruiser . When the Gallipoli Campaign started, General Alexander Godley, formerly of the Irish Guards and second in command to General Birdwood of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, now commanding the New Zealanders, offered him an appointment as liaison officer and interpreter on the general's staff. His pre-war contacts (including Rƒ±za Tevfik B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ±) and ability to speak Turkish were to prove useful. He became famous for arranging a truceLord Kinross Atat√ºrk: The Rebirth of a Nation, K. Rustem & Brother, Nicosia 1984 of eight hours, on Whit Monday, 24 May, with the Turkish commander Mustafa Kemal, for the purpose of burying the dead. This episode appears, with him as \\"the Honourable Herbert\\", in Louis de Berni√®res's novel.Birds Without Wings pp. 366‚Äì68. In Eastern Mediterranean Intelligence, he worked with Compton Mackenzie.Fitzherbert, Chapter 9: \\"Anzac 1915\\". In October 1915, on sick leave in England, Herbert carried with him a memorandum, stating in part: \\"They [FO] trust Egypt with the running of the Arabian Question...\\",H.V.F. Winstone, Gertrude Bell, Jonathan Cape, 1978; , p. 171 from the Cairo Intelligence Department from Colonel Clayton to the Foreign Office explaining the situation in the Middle East. In November, the memorandum, at first favourably received, became obsolete after the visit of Fran√ßois Georges-Picot and his subsequent negotiations with Mark Sykes. It would appear that the Arab Bureau continued working along the lines of the memorandum,Compare: Lord Hardinge's letter on the memorandum to Wingate of 28 November 1915 in Winstone 1978, Gertrude Bell, pp. 171‚Äì72. which led to contrary promises ensuing accusations of bad faith.FitzHerbert, Chapter 10: \\"Kut 1916\\". In November 1915, Herbert was in Paris and Rome on a secret mission related to Albania. Following the plan to evacuate Anzac Cove beginning the following month, he volunteered to return to ANZAC to stay with the rear guard, convinced that his knowledge of language and his network of acquaintances would greatly benefit that body if captured. The 20 December successful evacuation of ANZAC and Suvla Bay and the good prospects for Cape Helles countered his proposal. =1916= Impatient with the Foreign Office indecision over Albania, at the start of 1916, Herbert went prospecting for new opportunities. Admiral Sir Rosslyn Wemyss proposed a job for him as a captain in intelligence. When in February the War Office cleared him from involvement in Albania, he took up the offer and found himself in charge of Naval intelligence in Mesopotamia (now Iraq) and the Gulf. Following the critical situation of British troops at Kut-al-Amara, the War Office was instructed to offer Herbert's services to General Townshend to negotiate terms with the Turks. T. E. Lawrence was sent on behalf of the Arab Bureau while Colonel Beach acted for Indian Expeditionary Force Intelligence. Together they were to oversee the exchange of prisoners and wounded, and eventually to offer the commander Khalil Pasha up to ¬£2 million for the relief of Kut. Enver Pasha rejected the offer, and the evacuation of the wounded was severely hampered through lack of transport. The situation at Kut led Aubrey to send a telegram to Austen Chamberlain, Secretary of State for India, with the support of General Lake but still in breach of army regulations, condemning incompetence in the handling of the Mesopotamian campaign. The Government of India ordered a court martial, but the War Office refused. Admiral Wemyss, who travelled to Simla for the purpose, supported him throughout. Back in England in July 1916, Herbert started asking in the House of Commons for a Royal Commission to inquire into the conduct of the Mesopotamian campaign. He opposed the routine evasiveness of Prime Minister Asquith, (a close friend), by speaking in the House four times on Mesopotamia. His critics saw in his obstinacy a personal vendettaA letter from George Lloyd to Wingate of 27 May 1915 reads :\\"...the Government of India seem to be doubly cursed with a Commander in Chief with too little grip and a Finance Member called Mayer with too much...\\" in: Winstone 1978, Gertrude Bell p. 177. \\"Aubrey Herbert's interventions in the House of Commons date 12th, 17th, 18th, 20th, 26th July\\" ref: FitzHerbert 1985 against Sir Beauchamp Duff, the commander-in-chief in India, and Sir William Meyer, the financial secretary, but his persistence paid off, and a Special Commission Mesopotamia was subsequently appointed. In October 1916, Herbert started his post as a liaison officer with the Italian army, whose front line lay in Albania. He apparently was unaware of the clause partitioning Albania signed with Italy in the secret Treaty of London on 26 April 1915. When the Bolsheviks published its secret provisions in 1917, he rejected the idea of Albania as merely a small Muslim state, the fiefdom he believed of Essad Pasha. In December, he was back in England.Fitzherbert, Chapter 11: \\"Balkan soldiering and Swiss Peacemaking\\". =1917‚Äì1918= The year 1917 saw him working, under Military Intelligence Director George MacDonogh, on plans for a separate peace with Turkey. On 16 July, he conducted a series of meetings with the Turks in Geneva, Interlaken, and Bern, among them a (secret) representative of an influential anti-Enver group.Fitzherbert 1985, Chapter 11. Mustafa Kemal, whom Aubrey knew from Gallipoli, had fallen out with Enver Pasha over the way that - by the Sultan's personal order - his command over the Seventh Army opposite Allenby in Syria had been bestowed on him on 5 July (he had been a staff captain with the Fifth Army in Damascus in 1905).Lord Kinross, Atat√ºrk: The Rebirth of a Nation, Rustem & Brother Nicosia 1984, Chapter 14. Aubrey took his notes to the Inter-Allied Conference in Paris. In a memorandum to the Foreign Office, he said \\"If we get the luggage it does not matter very much if the Turks get the labels. When Lord Kitchener was all- powerful in Egypt his secretary was wearing a fez. Mesopotamia and Palestine are worth a fez.\\"Mem. 26 July 1917. F.O. 371/3057 No. 148986 see: Notes: Fitzherbert, The Man who Was Greenmantle, p. 193. In November 1917, Herbert was again sent to Italy under orders from General Macdonogh. Now he was in charge of the British Adriatic Mission,FitzHerbert, Chapter 12: \\"Rebellious MP\\". with Samuel Hoare coordinating the Mission's special intelligence in Rome.J.A. Cross, Sir Samuel Hoare - A Political Biography, Jonathan Cape, 1977; . An earlier Pan-Albanian Federation of America (Vatra) proposal of raising an Albanian regiment under Aubrey's command had been renewed. The matter was a contentious one for the Italians, as Vatra became increasingly anti-Italian. On 17 July 1918, the proposal was formally approved in Boston, and the Italian Consulate accepted, provided it became a unit in the Italian Army. The end of the war prevented the issue from growing more complex.Fitzherbert, Chapter 12. Herbert ended the war as head of the British mission to the Italian army in Albania with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Aftermath Unclear policy led to nationalist criticism from imperial bases such as EgyptKeith Jeffery, The British army and the crisis of empire 1918‚Äì22, Manchester University Press, Studies in Military History, 1984; (see Saad Zaghlul, 1919) at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, nor was the resulting political handling cause for much optimism to privileged witnesses such as Aubrey, T. E. Lawrence or Gertrude Bell. At the conference, there was a glimpse of further prospect for Aubrey Herbert when the Italian delegates proposed to assume shared responsibilityChapter 8: Persia and Mesopotamia, p. 136 over the Caucasus, an area of vital strategic importancePeter Hopkirk, On Secret Service East of Constantinople, Oxford University Press, 1995; . ‚Äì the Baku oilfields, access from the north to Mosul and Kirkuk. By May 1919, the proposal appeared to be quite empty. By May 1919, the Intelligence Directorate had changed hands, on the authority of Lord Curzon (acting foreign secretary while Arthur Balfour was negotiating in Paris) from Aubrey's chief General George MacDonogh to Sir Basil Thomson of Scotland Yard Special Branch i.e. from military to civilian in view of the Bolshevik threat on the home front.Christopher Andrew, Secret Service: The Making of the British Intelligence Community, Sceptre, 1986; , p. 336 Thus it was possible for Aubrey in February 1921 to amaze a friend he could confide to, Lord Robert Cecil, that he was going abroad as a Scotland Yard inspector: he went to Berlin to interview Talaat Pasha for intelligence. Villa in Portofino Villa Altachiara or Villa Carnarvon, Portofino From his mother Elsie Howard he inherited Villa Alta Chiara (an Italian rendering of \\"Highclere\\", the English seat of the Earldom) at Portofino in Italy, inherited by her from, and built in 1874 by, her husband and Aubrey's father the 4th Earl. It had been a favoured retreat of Aubrey's elder brother the 5th Earl, but following their father's death it became the property of his step-mother Elsie Howard, who died there, having frequently entertained \\"eminent folks from the world of politics, religion (mainly Catholic, of course) and science\\".Cross, William, The Life and Secrets of Almina Carnarvon Aubrey declared: \\"if a man can have a second country, Italy is my second country\\". Aubrey bequeathed the Villa to his wife Mary Vesey, and it later became \\"a veritable literary colony for poets, painters and writers\\", including their son-in-law Evelyn Waugh, Alfred Duggan, Peter Acton and Brooke Astor.http://blog.abodeitaly.com/2010/06/villa- altachiara-in-portofino_18.html quoting in comments: William Cross, FSA, Scot, The Life and Secrets of Almina Carnarvon \\"a candid biography of the 5th Countess of Carnarvon of Tutankhamun fame\\".

Waugh's first wife, from whom he was divorced, was Evelyn Gardner, a half first-cousin of Laura and Auberon, and a niece of the 5th Earl of Carnarvon. The marriage was opposed by her brother Auberon. She was the mother of the journalist Auberon Waugh (1939‚Äì2001) (born at Pixton and named after his maternal uncle) and the grandmother of Daisy Waugh and Alexander Waugh. Death and burial Chest tomb and recumbent effigy of Hon. Aubrey Herbert in the Herbert Chapel, Brushford Church Toward the end of Herbert's life, he became totally blind. He received very bad medical advice which persuaded him to have all his teeth extracted to help restore his sight. The dental operation resulted in blood poisoning from which he died in London on 26 September 1923. This was five months after the death of his elder half-brother, George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, the famous Egyptologist, said by legend to have died from the \\"curse of Tutankhamun\\", whose tomb he had discovered five months earlier.Discovery of the first step leading down to the tomb 4 November 1922 In 1924 Herbert's estate was valued for probate at ¬£49,970 (equivalent to about ¬£2,563,461 in 2016). His full-length recumbent effigy on a chest tomb with ceremonial sword above, survives in the Herbert Chapel in the Church of St Nicholas, Brushford, Somerset, near his seat at Pixton Park. Above it on decoratively sculpted wooden panelling are displayed six heraldic shields describing his ancestry and marriage. Model for Literature The cameo character of the \\"'Honourable Herbert\\" in Louis de Berni√®res's novel Birds Without Wings is based on Herbert. He appears as a British liaison officer with the ANZAC troops serving in the Gallipoli campaign. A polyglot officer able to communicate with both sides, he arranges the burial of the dead of both sides, achieving great popularity with both sides - a description that mirrors his role in the 1915 truce.Birds Without Wings, pp 366-68 Herbert was also, in part, the model for John Buchan's Sandy Arbuthnot.

Their sister school in Dublin is CBC Monkstown.  History  Saint Patrick's Place building In the mid 19th century the Vincentian Fathers maintained a seminary at Saint Patrick's Place in Cork, known as the Cork Diocesan Seminary. In 1888 a new seminary with residential accommodation was completed at Farranferris, and the Vincentian ecclesiastical students transferred there. The then bishop of Cork, Most Rev. Dr O'Callaghan, invited the Christian Brothers to take charge of the St Patrick's Place establishment. From the beginning, CBC was principally involved in preparing pupils for university entry, and operated on St Patrick's Place for one hundred years.  Recent development  Marking the centenary in 1988, the College moved from its original site to a new location, one hundred metres away, atop Sidney Hill. In 1994, the school appointed its first lay principal, Dr. Laurence Jordan, who held the position until 2018. In the same period (1996-1998) modernisation works took place on the sports facilities at Lansdowne, and an extension to the College complex itself included improved dining facilities and the creation of a complex for sixth year students. By 2008, the school's annual fees were ‚Ç¨3,100 for first year and ‚Ç¨2,850 for subsequent years. Though the Christian Brothers retain a presence on the Board of Management, as Trustees, CBC is now staffed entirely by lay teachers, and is recognised as one of Ireland's leading educational establishments at secondary level. In the 2016 Sunday Times Schools League Table, CBC was listed 13th among the country's top boys schools. As of January 2019, CBC had over 1000 students in the college, with over 900 at Secondary Level, and approximately 150 at Primary Level in the Preparatory School. The principal of the college (both secondary and preparatory) is Mr. David Lordon.  Extracurricular activities  CBC rugby team at Sanix World Rugby Youth Tournament, Global Arena, 2006 The school is one of Cork's \\"rugby union nurseries\\" and have won the Munster Schools' Senior Cup twenty nine times - a record unbeaten by any other school in the competition. The most recent Senior Cup title wins were in 2009 (in a final against Rockwell College), and in 2016 (in a close final against Crescent College). The college's main rivals are Presentation Brothers College (as the two main fee paying all-boys schools in Cork, both share similar histories, student bases, and sporting and academic traditions). A number of CBC past pupils have been members of the Munster Rugby squad, including Darragh Hurley, Tom√°s O'Leary, and Donncha O'Callaghan. The school also participates in other extracurricular activities, including debating, charitable activities, basketball and others. The school also participates in other sports, including soccer (association football) and GAA (Gaelic football and hurling) - with CBC winning the Junior Cup for soccer in 2003 and 2008, and reaching the final of the Dr. Harty Cup (hurling) in 2019. Through several fundraising efforts, including the annual Christmas appeal, CBC supports charities including SHARE, Saint Vincent de Paul, HOPE, Tr√≥caire and Concern. Among the school's charitable activities is the \\"Zambia Immersion Project\\", which involves students travelling to Zambia to observe and assist with development work.

Rose's work is marked by its treatment of controversial social and political issues. His realistic approach was particularly influential in the anthology programs of the 1950s. He is best known for writing the courtroom drama Twelve Angry Men. Personal life Rose was born in Manhattan, the son of Alice (Obendorfer) and William Rose, a lawyer. Rose attended Townsend High School and briefly attended City College (now part of the City University of New York) before serving in the U.S. Army in 1942-46, where he became a first lieutenant. Rose was married twice: to Barbara Langbart in 1943, with whom he had four children, and to Ellen McLaughlin (not the playwright and actress) in 1963, with whom he had two children. He died in 2002 from complications of heart failure. Television He sold Bus to Nowhere, his first teleplay, in 1950 to the live dramatic anthology program Studio One, for which he wrote Twelve Angry Men four years later. This latter drama, set entirely in a room where a jury is deliberating the fate of a teenage boy accused of murder, was inspired by Rose's service on just such a trial. The play later was made into the 1957 film of the same name. IMDb quotes Rose's memories of this experience: \\"It was such an impressive, solemn setting in a great big wood-paneled courtroom, with a silver-haired judge, it knocked me out. I was overwhelmed. I was on a jury for a manslaughter case, and we got into this terrific, furious, eight-hour argument in the jury room. I was writing one-hour dramas for Studio One then, and I thought, wow, what a setting for a drama.\\" Rose received an Emmy for his teleplay and an Oscar nomination for its 1957 feature-length film adaptation. Rose wrote for all three of the major broadcast networks from 1950 to 1980. He created and wrote for The Defenders in 1961, a weekly courtroom drama spun off from one of Rose's episodes of Studio One; The Defenders won two Emmy awards for dramatic writing. Rose co-wrote the 1986 TV movie My Two Loves, starring Mariette Hartley and Lynn Redgrave. Twilight Zone His teleplay The Incredible World of Horace Ford was the basis for an episode of The Twilight Zone in 1963 starring Pat Hingle, Nan Martin, and Ruth White. The episode was broadcast on April 18, 1963, on CBS as Episode 15 of Season Four. The theme was how the past is always glorified due to the repression and self-censorship of the negative aspects: we remember the good while we forget the bad. The teleplay had originally appeared as a Studio One episode in 1955. Films Rose was a screenwriter of many dramas, beginning with Crime in the Streets (1956), an adaptation of his 1955 teleplay for The Elgin Hour. He made four movies with the British producer Euan Lloyd: The Wild Geese, The Sea Wolves, Who Dares Wins and Wild Geese II.

Most often antagonists of Captain America, the roster has changed through various incarnations. Publication history The original team first appeared in Captain America #163, and was created by Steve Englehart. Fictional group history The Serpent Squad was founded by the original Viper after escaping prison with his brother, the Eel, and Cobra. Their plot involved ruining Captain America's reputation using false advertisements. Captain America soon caught on to their scheme, and along with the Falcon defeated the trio and sent them back to prison.Captain America #163 (1973) Madame Hydra later assassinated the original Viper and took his name. She then reunited the Serpent Squad, urging the Eel to avenge his brother's death. At this time, Princess Python joined the group. Cobra was not willing to serve Viper, and challenged her to a battle, but he was easily defeated. Working with the warlord Krang in an attempt to raise the lost continent Lemuria, the Serpent Squad were ambushed by Captain America, then in his Nomad identity, who defeated the Eel and Princess Python. After Cobra eventually turned on Viper, she shot him in the back and managed to escape, while Nomad rushed Cobra to the hospital.Captain America #180-182 (1974‚Äì1975) A third Serpent Squad appeared much later, under the employ of Roxxon Oil executive Hugh Jones.Marvel Two-In-One #64 The field leader Sidewinder, along with his teammates Anaconda, Black Mamba, and Death Adder, was ordered to retrieve the Serpent Crown and return it to Jones. After a battle with the Thing and Stingray, the Serpent Squad accomplished their task. However, Triton joined the battle, and the three heroes were able to defeat Anaconda, Death Adder, and Black Mamba and trap them under the sea.

While the Serpent Society was active, a new Serpent Squad suddenly appeared in Las Vegas. The members, Copperhead, Fer-de-Lance, Puff Adder, and Black Racer, committed acts of terrorism and theft in various casinos.Captain America #337-338 (1988) Sidewinder noticed the group, and after they were defeated by Captain America, he freed them from prison and invited them to join his group. However, they were actually in the employ of the Viper, and she used them to commence her takeover of the Serpent Society. The mission was a failure, but Copperhead, Fer-de-Lance, Puff Adder, and Black Racer decided to stay with the Serpent Society. Copperhead soon left after a conflict with the Cobra. Most recently, a new Serpent Squad surfaced with Sin as the leader, a new Viper, the Eel, and the Cobra.Captain America #28 (2007) They attacked the White House under the orders of the Red Skull, but Bucky, the new Captain America, attacked and defeated them all except for Sin.

He was born in South Vietnam, and lived for most of his adult life in Southern California. Biography Yen Ngoc Do was born on May 25, 1941, in Saigon, Vietnam. He was one of five children (three boys, two girls). His father was a tailor who supported the Vi·ªát Minh in its war for independence against France. His mother was a devout Roman Catholic. Do placed 20th out of 3,000 applicants in an examination to enter Saigon's most prestigious high school. On campus, he demonstrated both his intellectual and leadership abilities, and rose to numerous positions. He became editor of the school newspaper. This was during a period of historic political and social turmoil in Vietnam. The country's long struggle for autonomy against French colonialism would soon erupt into Vietnamese triumph only to have the U.S. begin its controversial military involvement. While the French still ruled Vietnam, Do agitated and organized student protests for freedom, and printed and distributed clandestine communications in support of the liberation movement. Eventually, he began to write, edit, publish and organize public rallies around-the-clock of students and the community-at-large. He captured the attention of public figures, politicians, Western journalists and government officials. Professional journalists began to solicit Do's skill for their own newspapers. At the same time, he diversified his activism to include lobbying and petitioning for more student aid and scholarships, and improved educational resources. The scope of his influence and the impact caused by his relentless advocacy resulted in the government's attempt to remove him from school and to arrest him. Thus, Do became a teenager on the run. For a year, he bicycled throughout the South to escape arrest. He could not contact his family, who had no knowledge about his safety and welfare. Without food or shelter from loved ones, Do survived, depending on the mercy and compassion of strangers. He had no essentials. Pedaling from city to village to town to forest to jungle and back to city, he sought rest and comfort where he could. In the process, he had the opportunity to witness the beauty of his native land, the people, and the ravages of war. After he had exhausted his energy and ideas, and when he could continue no more, Do returned home. For the first time in a year, Do embraced his parents and family. All was not at peace, however. The government had filed a lawsuit against Do for his social activism. On the day of trial, he walked to the courthouse. Lining the streets of Saigon all the way to the door of the courthouse were family, friends, neighbors and strangers who had turned out en masse to support him. When he entered the courtroom, the judge announced that, due to the popular support of the people, the case would be dismissed. That was Do's first taste of the law‚Äîhe would always remember it. Do would later obtain a high school diploma after a program of self-study. In his late teens through college and up until his escape from Vietnam, Do worked as a reporter and editor for several newspapers in South Vietnam and an interpreter for American and French journalists. Like many of his generation, he was fluent in French. In his lifetime, Do would master five languages. It was during college at the University of Saigon that Do met his wife, Loan, a fellow student. They were married, both at the age of 22, on January 21, 1964 in Saigon. Loan supported her husband in his writings and the increasingly visible role he began to play in the fight against communism. Their support network extended beyond writers and included professionals, Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese, of all backgrounds united in the cause for a free and autonomous Vietnam. One such friend was a long-time American advisor from the Rand Corporation, a California-based think tank. When Do and his wife made their successful escape to America, it was due in large part to him. Four days before the Fall of Saigon, the friend offered Do commercial airline tickets he had purchased for Do and his family. They had mere hours to pack. By this time, the U.S. military had become firmly ensconced in Vietnam. The French war had turned into the American war. Like the French, the Americans, too, would be defeated. Indeed, on April 30, 1975, the communist North Vietnamese Army defeated the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Saigon fell to communist control. Americans were evacuating everywhere‚Äîthe photographs of them jumping into and clinging onto helicopters as they took off from the rooftop of the American Embassy are unforgettable. Four days earlier, on April 26, 1975, the Do family left their homeland. Do, Loan, and their three children Anh, Dao and Tung, all left on a plane bound for America. Loan was then pregnant with their fourth child. The parents had told the children to pack for the beach. Because they would be searched and valuables would be absconded, the Do family took only $300 with them. They abandoned their home and their country forever. Do would never again see his mother alive, and he would never again set foot on native soil. However, the Do family was fortunate that they were not to be counted among the thousands who would later be known as \\"the boat people.\\" These were Vietnamese who, having no other option, turned to the open seas. Many died. Many were subject to pirate attacks. And many were subject to other unknown consequences. After a brief stop in Guam, the Do family arrived at Camp Pendleton, the Marine Corps base outside of San Diego, California. They were among the first political refugees from Vietnam to arrive at a resettlement camp in 1975. Indeed, they were among the first of all Vietnamese immigrants into America and would, later, become among the first to settle Little Saigon, Orange County. At Camp Pendleton, Do continued his leadership by founding a library. He solicited books and other reading material from U.S. Marines on base. Because he spoke fluent English, American military and civilian authorities who were involved in the Vietnamese resettlement endeavor began to turn to Do for guidance. The refugees relied on him to be their spokesman and advisor. Inspired partly by this stewardship of common interests and goals, but mainly due to his love for writing and news, Do founded Nguoi Viet Daily News in 1978 in Orange County, California. Nguoi Viet translates into \\"Vietnamese People.\\" Three years after his arrival on American soil, Do had resumed his lifelong passion. Nguoi Viet started small. Do began writing, editing and publishing the newspaper in his garage. He now had a fourth child, Lin (born six months after the family settled in America). Do, his wife and children worked on Nguoi Viet in the early stages. It was a four-page weekly. Do was writer, editor, publisher, circulation manager and page designer. He delivered copies of his publication without charge door-to-door. Eventually, friends who were also Vietnamese refugees joined his cause. Not all were writers, but they signed up, drawn by Do's zeal and drive. Do opened up his home and wallet to help these friends and other newly arrived refugees. Do and his wife provided them with food, clothing and shelter under their own roof. Do and his wife also paid for and helped with the continuing education of refugees and struggling students. Over the years, under Do's leadership, Nguoi Viet grew into one of the most prestigious ethnic publications in history, having earned its founder and its immigrant community worldwide recognition. Today, the newspaper has a daily circulation of 18,000 across the globe. The newspaper has 50 full-time employees and more than a dozen stringers and correspondents worldwide, based in areas with large Vietnamese enclaves. In the beginning, Do sought to inform and educate his fellow refugees about the American way of life while providing accurate, timely and in-depth news about the Vietnamese homeland under communist rule. Today, Nguoi Viet is a trusted news source for Vietnamese, Vietnamese-Americans, and the community-at-large. Its web site is located at www.nguoi-viet.com. Many non-Vietnamese working or interacting with immigrants also rely on the newspaper for coverage and the insider's view. In 2004, Nguoi Viet launched Nguoi Viet 2, a weekly English- language section targeted at the younger generation. Its web site is located at www.nguoi-viet.com/nv2. Do's eldest daughter, Anh, founded and steers this publication. Like her father, she is an award-winning journalist and helps to manage and build the publication today. Among many honors, in 1999, Do received the Sky Dunlap Lifetime Achievement Award from the Orange County Press Club. In 2003, he received the Asian American Journalists Association's Lifetime Achievement Award. Do has also been recognized with an Ethics in Business Award from the Chamber of Commerce in the city of Westminster, home to Little Saigon. Throughout the years, he has also received dozens of citations given in thanks for personal and newspaper donations to community projects, scholarships, internships and to fund fine arts and performing arts programs. In 2005, a $30,000 Yen Do Scholarly Research Grant was launched at California State University, Fullerton, to foster faculty research into the Vietnamese and Southeast Asian communities. In 2006, the $25,000 Yen Do Vietnam Fellowship was established at the University of Southern California to fund research and publication of original immigrant stories written by students following an internship at Do's paper. On August 17, 2006, Do died in Orange County, California, due to complications from diabetes and kidney failure. He was 65. More than 3,000 people attended his viewing and funeral services held over four days, with President George W. Bush and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger sending published condolences. The California Legislature adjourned in Do's honor, along with the City Council in his hometown of Garden Grove. In 2008, the world's only museum of news, the Newseum located in Washington, DC, dedicated a permanent exhibit to Do and his lifelong work. Do is survived by his wife of 42 years, Loan; his daughter Anh, her husband and their daughter; his daughter Dao, her husband and their son; his only son Tung; and his daughter Lin. Anh carries on her Dad's legacy as a journalist. Dao is a lawyer licensed to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, DC. Tung serves the Federal Government. Lin works in real estate.

It is produced in Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic by the Jan Becher company. The brand is owned by Pernod Ricard. It is made from a secret recipe based on more than twenty types of herbs and spices. Becherovka is often described as having a gingery or cinnamon flavor. Its alcohol content is 38% ABV (76 proof), and it is usually served chilled.  History  The inventor of Becher Bitter was Josef Vitus Becher (1769‚Äì1840) of Karlovy Vary. Apart from trading in spices and colonial goods in his shop, \\"D≈Øm U T≈ô√≠ sk≈ôivan≈Ø\\" (\\"House of the Three Woodlarks\\"), he also produced alcoholic beverages. In 1794, he rented a still-house and began to experiment with hard alcohol. In 1805 Prince Maxmillian Friedrich von Plettenberg arrived in Karlovy Vary for his medical treatment, he was accompanied by his personal physician, Dr. Christian Frobrig from England. Frobrig with Josef Becher discussed the strength of herbs and the recipe for a new liqueur. Josef Becher tested this recipe for two years after which he started to sell this new \\"English Bitter\\" liqueur which was intended for the treatment of diseases of the stomach. Josef married twice (his first wife died of pneumonia) and had a total of 16 children, though only five daughters and two sons outlived him. Josef's son, Johann (Jan) Nepomuk Becher, took over the still-house in 1838. He built a new factory and is considered as the founder of the company. Speaking approximately, his product was sold under the name of \\"Becher Carlsbad Bitter Liqueur\\" from the thirties of the 19th century. During the first World War, his Karlsbader Becherbitter was sold in Bohemia, Austria, Germany, Poland, Spain, Italy, Turkey and Egypt. After the end of the alcohol prohibition in the US, the Becherbitter finally arrived in that country and four years later also to England. After World War II, Karlsbader Becherbitter became known as Becherovka following the dispossession and forceful expulsion of the German population of Karlsbad by the Czech state (see Bene≈° decrees). Becherovka became one of the most popular export items of Czechoslovakia. From 1998 to 2003, a Slovak version also started selling. This was manufactured by Zdenƒõk Hoffmann domestically Doma≈ælice and sold in Slovak shops. He claimed that Alfred Becher had given his grandfather the recipe in 1939, with the right to manufacture the product since he had been worried that the secret of his recipe might not survive the war. However Hoffmann was unable to prove this in court, and in 2008 was sentenced for one and a half years in jail by the district court. The Czech producer says that only two people know the secret of the entire production process and are allowed to enter the Drogikamr room ‚Äî where, once a week, they mix the herbs and spices used in the drink. Some of the herbs are imported from abroad and some grow around Karlovy Vary. Lemond Becherovka Lemond Becherovka Lemond is the commercial name of a liqueur which has been produced by Becherovka since 2008. It is based on the traditional Becherovka, but has a lower alcohol content (20% ABV). Lemond is usually consumed straight and takes its name from the drink's citrus taste. Its recipe is also kept secret, just like the recipe of the traditional Becherovka. Cocktails Some serve it with tonic water, making a drink called a beton (becherovka and tonic), which means \\"concrete\\" in Czech and many other languages. This cocktail was originally created for Expo '67 in Montreal as a refreshment to be served in the Czech Pavilion. It also proved to be very popular in the Czech Republic during the 90s.

During a battle with Iron Fist, Sabretooth, and Choshin's samurais, Asp was knocked out of the battle.Iron Fist #74-75 (2018) Powers and abilities Asp has the ability to generate a unique form of radiant bioelectricity that she can channel as lightning-like blasts. This energy does not affect inanimate matter, but upon striking a living being causes a rapid paralysis of the nervous system similar to the effect of the neurotoxic bite of certain venomous snakes. Her body constantly generates and stores this energy, but it can be temporarily expended after firing several \\"venom-bolts\\" in rapid succession, requiring her to recharge. Asp can accelerate the speed at which her body regenerates energy by engaging in physical activity that increases her heart rate and metabolism. Asp's \\"venom-bolts\\" have different effects, depending on how far they travel before reaching a target, and on how much power she uses in a single bolt. A full-force blast can instantly kill an adult human. Normally, however, her bolts paralyze her victims for several hours, but cause no lasting damage. She can also release blasts of lower intensity that do not instantly paralyze targets, but instead cause neural delays which result in a loss of muscular control and coordination. Her energy bolts can travel roughly twenty-five feet before dissipating. When fully charged, the Asp's body releases low levels of energy at all times, making prolonged physical contact with her fatal. She can also apparently release a blast of paralytic energy through physical contact without any visible effect. The Asp is also an accomplished dancer with superb muscular control.

Powers and abilities Black Mamba possesses two separate superhuman abilities which she most often uses in tandem for a unique result. Her powers are both presumably the result of a cranial implant given to her by Roxxon. Black Mamba has limited telepathic abilities that allow her to scan the minds of others nearby. The extent of her telepathy is unrevealed; it is unknown if she possesses other abilities possessed by most telepaths, such as mental communication. She uses this power to extract and project illusions of loved ones into her victims' minds while placing her target in a sedated trance-like state in which they are fixated upon the mental image she has created. Mamba's second ability allows her to generate a cloud of tangible Darkforce energy that she uses to ensnare her victim, constricting them with potentially fatal force. The victim, however, is unaware, and views the Darkforce energy as the loved one she has projected into their mind. Trapped in Mamba's ecstatic trance, the victim is completely unaware that they are being strangled and can die in minutes. Mamba can generate Darkforce without first using her telepathic power on an opponent, but with much less efficiency as the target is aware and can avoid the relatively slow-moving Darkforce cloud easier. The full extent of Mamba's control over Darkforce energy has not been revealed. She can also use her Darkforce to surround herself, disguising herself as whomever she wishes to look like. She can use this ability on others, though the field begins to dissipate when it leaves her sight. Beings with sufficient willpower can break free of Mamba's telepathic grasp, and physical attacks of sufficient force can dispel her Darkforce manifestations. Because of this, Black Mamba usually employs her powers on those who are unaware of her presence. Other versions =Ultimate Marvel= Black Mamba appears in the Ultimate Marvel universe as a member of the Serpent Squad, a group of female mercenaries. After having the Serpent Crown stolen from them, they battle the Fantastic Four. Black Mamba was knocked out of the fight by the Thing early on, and was taken into custody.

The most well-known Cobra is Klaus Voorhees, now known as the King Cobra. He first appeared in Journey into Mystery #98 (Nov. 1963) created by writer Stan Lee and artist Don Heck. His nephew, Piet Voorhees, became the second Cobra and first appeared in White Tiger #1 (Jan. 2007) in a story written by Tamora Pierce and drawn by Timothy Liebe. Marvel has also used the moniker \\"Cobra\\" for two World War II Nazi villains and also a mercenary enemy of Moon Knight. Klaus Voorhees was a laboratory assistant, working with a professor trying to find a cure for various venomous snake bites. A combination of a bite from a radioactive cobra and the experimental anti-venom granted him superpowers, which led to him becoming the supervillain briefly known as the Human Cobra and then as the Cobra. The Cobra and Mister Hyde formed a criminal team for years, fighting various heroes such as Thor and Daredevil. He later became a member of the Serpent Squad and a member of Sidewinder's Serpent Society. During a takeover attempt by the Viper, the Cobra actually opposed her rule and sided with Captain America to depose the Viper and foil her plans. The Cobra later took the name \\"the King Cobra\\" as he assumed leadership of the Serpent Society. When the Serpent Society became Serpent Solutions under the leadership of the Viper (Jordan Stryke, a different Viper) the King Cobra became a member of the group.

Unsatisfied with his lower position, and intent on stealing Schecktor's discoveries, Voorhees killed the professor by using a cobra and, in order to make himself look less guilty, let the cobra bite him as well. He used an experimental anti-venom for snake venom to cure himself, but denied it to Schecktor. The cobra was radioactive due to experimentation, and in a process similar to that which granted Spider-Man his powers, Voorhees gained superhuman abilities similar to a cobra's. Thor's mortal form, Don Blake, had encountered Schecktor and, as Thor, he met the dying man and learned what had happened and that the Cobra was travelling to America. The Cobra attempted to manufacture a cobra-serum to transform others into similarly-powered slaves, but was thwarted by Thor although he escaped, using Jane Foster as a hostage.Journey into Mystery #98.

In this appearance, the Cobra was identified by Arcade as the King Cobra.Amazing Spider-Man (vol. 5) #16. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Klaus Voorhees gained superhuman powers due to the combined mutagenic effects of the venom of a radioactive cobra and an experimental anti-venom. The King Cobra is double-jointed, can dislocate and snap back into place his shoulders and hips at will, and has a phenomenal mastery of his musculature. Most notably, his amazing contortionist powers and slithery body let him break in, and escape from, buildings. He also has the ability to stick to walls or ceilings. Combined with his superstrength, agility, reflexes and reactions, coordination, balance, and endurance, they make him a formidable wrestler. The King Cobra's bones are flexible and nearly impossible to break. The King Cobra has moderate knowledge of street-fighting techniques. The King Cobra wears a bodysuit made of reinforced synthetic stretch material; the torso section, helmet, and tail are made of a bendable plastoid and the entire costume is coated with silicon and graphite dust compound to make it slippery. The King Cobra is also armed with special gadgets that complete his cobra likeness: he is equipped with a \\"cobra cord\\" (an unbreakable cable) to tie up his enemies (it is solid enough to resist even Thor's strength), can launch \\"cobra darts\\" (venom-filled projectiles) out of his wrists and release toxic \\"cobra gas\\". He wears spring-loaded wrist-shooters propelling \\"cobra-bite\\" projectiles containing a poison derived from cobra venom. He uses cartridge projectiles filled with various substances: acid, smoke, nerve gas, plastic explosives, etc. He wears micro-suction cups on his fingertips and toes, permitting him to cling to walls and ceilings. In the miniseries Toxin: The Devil You Know, the King Cobra himself says: Piet Voorhees possesses certain unusual physical powers derived from his mutagenically altered physiology which, among other things, help him simulate the movement of a snake by using his great degree of independent control over every muscle in his body, enabling him to slither across the ground (at up to 50 miles per hour) without using his arms and legs, simply by muscle contraction. All of the bones in his body, including his skull, are malleable and his muscle tissue is exceedingly resilient, making his body very flexible and pliant. It is nearly impossible for him to break a bone or tear a muscle.F.B.I. Agent Coville revealed in White Tiger #1 that Piet has all of the same superpowers that his uncle possesses. The Cobra's flexibility enables him to slither into and out of very tight and small places. Through compressing his body, the Cobra can fit into any hole or slot down to four inches (102 mm) in diameter. By using his flexibility to wrap himself about a victim's body and then exerting his full strength, the Cobra traps that victim within his \\"cobra grip\\". Unlike his uncle, however, Piet also possesses enhanced olfactory senses, which enables him to track his targets by way of their scent. He can also produce a toxic substance from his body which he calls his \\"cobra venom\\". He projects his venom at selected targets by spitting at them.

Blaming Marc Spector, he launched a grenade at Marc's mansion, yet Marc survived. James later launched a grenade at Ravencrag Asylum. Meanwhile, Marc received Amos Lardner's corpse and went to Ravencrag to see if there was a connection. Marc Spector was present when James Lardner attacked. Marc changed into the Moon Knight and went after James Lardner, who used a gas grenade to escape. When in Paris, James went after Charles le Blanc, who was the head of Operation: Cobra. Marc Spector also investigated Charles le Blanc and encountered James Lardner. Marc Spector pursued James Lardner in a high-speed chase, where they were knocked unconscious upon colliding. The agents that worked for Operation: Cobra managed to capture James and Marc, only for Marc to escape. James, however, became the successful test subject that was dubbed the Cobra. The next night when the Moon Knight went to investigate Charles le Blanc, Operation: Cobra sent the Cobra to dispose of the Moon Knight. The Moon Knight had a hard time fighting off the Cobra, until he spotted Charles le Blanc using his remote control and shot a dart at it. The dart shorted out the remote control, causing the Cobra to go berserk. Charles le Blanc escaped to his car and started to drive off, only for the Moon Knight to fire another dart at one of the tires, which caused the car to swerve and catch on fire upon colliding with a tree. When the Cobra wanted to seek vengeance and started to lift the front part of Charles le Blanc's car into the air, it exploded and killed both the Cobra and Charles le Blanc.Marvel Preview #21.

This led, in part, to a confrontation between the Serpent Society and the X-Men.X-Men Annual #13 Diamondback later alerted Captain America to the Bloodstone Hunt.Captain America #357 She aided Captain America in combat with Batroc, Machete, Zaran, and Baron Helmut Zemo.Captain America #358‚Äì361 She also encountered Crossbones for the first time.Captain America #362 Diamondback later accompanied Captain America to the Red Skull's Skullhouse.Captain America #370 Diamondback and Captain America eventually went on their first date, aided by Rachel's friends in the Serpent Society, Asp, Black Mamba, and Anaconda.Captain America #371 She then battled the Black Widow, and acquired a new costume.Captain America #373‚Äì374 Diamondback was eventually put on trial by the Serpent Society for her consorting with the enemy (most of the Society assuming, incorrectly, that Diamondback had betrayed their secrets to Captain America) and found guilty for her actions, and almost executed.Captain America #380 She escaped with Captain America and Paladin's help, and later hired Paladin to help get revenge on the Serpent Society.Captain America #381‚Äì382 Along with her best friends Black Mamba and Asp, she formed \\"BAD Girls, Inc.\\"Captain America #385 After a failed kidnapping attempt from Anaconda, Diamondback was taken aboard Superia's ship, and joined her Femizons under duress. While aboard Superia's ship, she was attacked by the Femizon Snapdragon, of whom Diamondback developed a phobia. After being rescued and then being used as a test subject by the Red Skull to see if the blood packets that Crossbones brought was really Captain America's blood, the super-soldier serum enhanced Diamondback tracked down and confronted Snapdragon, who died in the fight. Later, there was a glitch discovered in the super-soldier serum that Cap was suffering from and Diamondback went to Superia in hopes for a cure. Using her as a test subject, there was a 50/50 chance that the cure would either work or kill Diamondback. As an added stipulation, if the test was successful, Diamondback had to serve Superia as the second Snapdragon. The experiment was a success, but she later got out of this deal when Superia was killed. BAD Girls disbanded after that. Some time later, Diamondback was infected with \\"mind-control nanoprobes\\" by Baron Zemo. Diamondback suffered extensive neurological damage from the experience and spent an extended period of time recovering in S.H.I.E.L.D. care. BAD Girls, Inc. reappeared in Cable & Deadpool, with the original lineup intact.Cable & Deadpool #20 Rachel's brother Danny is also known as Cutthroat. It was Danny and another of her brothers, Ricky, who originally fell in with a gang led by a man known as \\"Bing.\\" Yearning to be included, she approached Bing alone. Upon claiming she would do anything to join the gang, Rachel was beaten and possibly raped by Bing, who years later became Crossbones, kidnapped her, starved her and abused her until she agreed, with ulterior motive, to steal packages of Captain America's blood from Avengers Mansion. Bing/Crossbones murdered Danny/Cutthroat, who was attempting to replace him as aid to the Red Skull, and also killed Rachel's third brother, Willy, when, despite being crippled in the military, he sought revenge by rifle for the brutality inflicted on his sister soon after she was originally mistreated. Diamondback later turned up along with Asp and Black Mamba during the \\"Civil War\\" as a member of the Secret Avengers.Civil War #5 She took part in the final battle of the \\"war\\", but did not accept the offer of amnesty that came with Captain America's surrender. Later Diamondback and the other BAD Girls were captured by the Mighty Avengers in a New York City street mall.

Storms as the main character. It is a frequently dark spoof of the politics of Florida and the United States' involvement in the Balkans.  Explanation of the title  The \\"Orange Crush\\" is the name given to the second-hand motorhome purchased by the main character, since it is painted bright orange and was previously used in a short-lived advertising campaign for the soft drink. Plot summary Marlon Conrad, a \\"spoiled rich kid\\", enters the political arena in a career carefully managed by his wealthy father. He becomes the lieutenant governor of Florida, a plush job he can exploit mercilessly. When the elected governor dies in a plane crash, Marlon automatically assumes the office. At the outset of his tenure, Marlon is apathetic and corrupt, riding in the pockets of special interest groups. However, he is suddenly recruited into active duty during the Kosovo War and a bureaucratic tangle prevents him from ducking his responsibility as expected. His experiences in the military change his outlook, his fundamental character, and even his political views. He returns to Florida, determined to make a difference in the state. But first, Marlon faces a reelection battle against dim-witted Democratic candidate Gomer Tatum, the state House Speaker. Alternating between manic attentiveness to his official duties and depressed apathy, Marlon eventually becomes disgusted with the inertia of politics in Tallahassee and purchases a second-hand motorhome. Marlon's Chief of Staff, Gottfried Escrow, converts Marlon's road trip into an impromptu campaign tour. Hijinks ensue as Tatum, egged on by his hyper-ambitious fiancee, Jackie, follows Marlon's trail around Florida, doing their best to outshine or sabotage Marlon's popularity. Along the way, Escrow is alarmed to discover that Marlon's Press Secretary, Jack Pimento, is actually notorious criminal Serge A. Storms, suffering from amnesia; Escrow tries various schemes to have Serge arrested or removed from the campaign without risking public exposure. At the same time, Detective Mahoney, an agent of the FDLE, becomes obsessed with capturing Serge. Marlon's newfound candor and lack of fealty to Florida's \\"fat cats\\" leads to several attempts to assassinate him, several of which are stopped by Jack/Serge. His change of heart also wins over Elizabeth Sinclair, a former aide at the public relations firm owned by Marlon's father's best friend. She and Marlon fall in love, and a potentially messy break-up with Marlon's fiancee, Babs Belvedere, is averted when she ends up falling for Jack/Serge instead. On election night, Serge regains his memory and tackles Marlon's last would-be assassin, a young Latin American woman who escaped to the U.S. and found the men who had gang- raped and tortured her living well in South Florida under false identities supplied by the CIA (one of several callous acts that Marlon rubber stamped before his reformation). Serge convinces her to direct her wrath at Frank Lloyd Sirocco, a convicted murderer scheduled for execution who faked evidence of his innocence, won a last-minute exoneration from Marlon, then called to rub his guilt in the governor's face. Marlon loses the election to Tatum by a slim margin, and concedes defeat, departing Tallahassee with Elizabeth. Escrow's efforts on Marlon's behalf end with Escrow being arrested with illicit heroin and bags full of stolen ballots. In the epilogue, Marlon and Elizabeth marry, and continue to tour the country in the motorhome, holding jobs as guest political commentators on CNN; a few months later, a documentary on the campaign wins Best Documentary at the Academy Awards; watching the ceremony on television, Detective Mahoney sees Serge mount the stage to accept the award, and takes off after him once more.

He first appeared in Captain America vol. 1 #310 (October 1985), created by writer Mark Gruenwald and artist Paul Neary. The name Rattler was also used by two Marvel comics characters from the Wild West era, both enemies of the Rawhide Kid. A fourth Rattler appeared in the Spider-Man newspaper comic strip, who gained power by being bitten by a snake and then treated with an experimental anti-venom. Krueger, as Rattler, was given a long bionic tail that emits sonic shockwaves to mimic his reptile namesake. He first showed up as part of the Serpent Society, a team of snake- themed villains for hire. During their first mission they were opposed by Captain America who would have several run-ins with the Serpent Society. Rattler was one of the Society Members who sided with Viper when she took over the Serpent Society, but remained with the group after she was deposed. At one point he was part of the Thunderbolts, but returned to the Serpent Society. He remained a member when the Society was reorganized into Serpent Solutions. Publication history Rattler first appeared in Captain America vol. 1 #310 (October 1985), created by writer Mark Gruenwald and artist Paul Neary. Fictional character biography Hailing from Germany,more than one Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe source lists him as being born in \\"Breslau, Germany\\". In 1945, the city became part of Poland as Wroc≈Çaw. Therefore, in his lifetime there was no such place as \\"Breslau, Germany,\\" making his known birthplace apparently erroneous. Rattler was given a bionic tail which he uses to create shockwaves and vibrations. This proved very useful in his first confrontation with Captain America, during the Rattler's initiation into the Serpent Society. He and his fellow Serpents Cobra and Anaconda were ambushed by the hero, but Rattler was able to use his tail to stop Captain America's shield from doing any damage.Captain America #310-311 With the other Serpent Society members, he was hired by A.I.M. to hunt down MODOK.Captain America #313 He later battled Captain America again after being tricked by the Porcupine, along with Diamondback, Death Adder, and Cottonmouth. During the ensuing fight with Captain America, Rattler used his bionic tail to send vibrations coursing through the hero's body, disorienting him. However, he was eventually thrown into a pillar by his tail, knocking him out for the battle. Rattler, Cottonmouth, and Death Adder were sent to jail, but freed from jail by Sidewinder.Captain America #315 Alongside Cottonmouth, Rattler confronted Kingpin's men over the Death Adder's murder.Captain America #319 The Rattler joined Viper during her invasion of the Serpent Society, and battled the Falcon.Captain America #341-343 He subsequently followed Cobra's instructions when he became leader. He participated in the Serpent Society mission to recover mystic objects for Ghaur and Llyra. During the battle with the X-Men after Longshot had found the missing artifact they were searching for, Rattler created an avalanche by rattling his tail, though this took both Longshot and Rattler out in the process.Uncanny X-Men Annual #13 Rattler voted against Diamondback during the Serpent Society's trial of her; alongside the Serpent Society, he then battled Captain America, Paladin, and Diamondback.Captain America #380-382 The Rattler also participated in the battle against Force Works, where he initiated use of his \\"Rattling Gun\\", a gun that could supposedly create enough seismic waves to rattle someone's ribcage apart.

Rattler is 85% deaf in both ears and wears electronic hearing aids in his cowl. He possesses fang-like teeth. Other characters named Rattler =Heath Benson= In the Wild West, Heath Benson was a part of a group of aerialists until he ended up injured in a fall. Unable to continue the act, he was hired as a ringmaster for a traveling circus. At some point, he used his talents in a career of crime and became Rattler. Rattler began to loot towns and other settlers in the vicinity of the circus. After Rattler nearly killed one of his victims, Two-Gun Kid was drafted to bring him in. Rattler bested Two-Gun Kid and escaped after the first encounter. Two-Gun Kid suspected that Rattler was someone that worked in the circus. Two-Gun Kid suspected the aerialist Whirlo of being Rattler and challenged him to aerial combat which ended with Two-Gun Kid winning. Just then, the real Rattler shows up and challenges Two-Gun Kid to a rematch. Two-Gun Kid succeeded in knocking him out in aerial combat and unmasked him to be the circus ringmaster. Rawhide Kid claimed to have known it all the time upon seen the ringmaster's picture in the weekly gazette a few back.Rawhide Kid #37 Rattler later escaped from prison and Whirlo used this information to pose as Rattler to commit crimes while the original one was blamed.Two-Gun Kid #88 In 1876, Rattler joined forces with Iron Mask, Hurricane, Red Raven, Dr. Danger, and Fat Man in organizing a large number of criminals based on the exploits of the cowboy heroes and some time-traveling modern age heroes that have fought Kang the Conqueror. The West Coast Avengers traveled back in time and assisted Rawhide Kid, Two-Gun Kid, and Phantom Rider (Lincoln Slade) into bringing them in. Rattler tried to ambush Tigra, only for her to throw him into Hurricane forcefully enough to knock both of them out.West Coast Avengers Vol. 2 #18 Rattler's real name was revealed in Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files. =Whirlo= As mentioned above, Whirlo was an aerialist who was suspected by Two-Gun Kid to be the Rattler. He was challenged to an aerial battle by Two- Gun Kid and was defeated When Rattler had escaped from prison, Whirlo learned about this. When Two-Gun Kid visited the circus where Whirlo worked, Whirlo claimed that Rattler is after him for revenge after failing to defeat Rawhide Kid. Two-Gun Kid figured out that Whirlo was acting as Rattler, tracked him down to the circus, and unmasked him. Whirlo claimed that he did it for revenge on Rattler for having framed him before. =Henry Bingham= Henry Bingham made his life devenomizing snakes until he was bitten by a particular specimen. He rushed to Curtis Chemicals where a chemist analyzed his blood and offered him an experimental anti-venom serum to save his life. He was cured, but began to change into the Rattler. However, Henry found that the changes weren't permanent and he began seeking more samples of the anti-venom serum to maintain his Rattler form. Exercising his idea of hiding in plain sight, Rattler walked through the streets wearing a sign that was advertising Reptile World. He walked right into Curtis Chemicals, fought right past the guards, and stole some of the anti-venom serum. He returned to Reptile World and took the samples to perpetuate his powers, but Mary Jane Watson took a picture of Peter Parker in front of the store just as Rattler walked by. Not wanting to have his secret lair discovered, Rattler plotted to steal the film that was used. Rattler followed Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson back to Peter's apartment and ambushed them. Peter only feigned unconsciousness and then changed into Spider-Man to follow Rattler. Peter arrived at Reptile World and was zapped from behind while looking around. Upon regaining consciousness while tied to a chair, Peter is confronted by Rattler who tells him his origin as Peter claims that the serum is killing him. Rattler left Peter behind with some poisonous snakes and went to get more serum. Peter escaped, changed into Spider-Man, and began tracking Rattler. Upon finding Rattler, Spider-Man fought with him which ended with the serum's destruction. As the serum's effects began to fade, Rattler changed back to Henry Bingham who regained his sanity at last. Before dying from the side effects of the serum, Henry thanked Spider-Man for preventing him from being Rattler forever.Amazing Spider-Man Newspaper Strip In other media =Television= * The Rattler appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episodes \\"Ultron-5\\", \\"Along Came a Spider...\\", and \\"Yellowjacket\\", voiced by Chris Cox.

The Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church had been built for its black members by the First Presbyterian Church of Princeton. Biography He was born into slavery as William Drew Robeson in 1844 to Benjamin Robeson (1820 ‚Äì c. 1889) and Sabra (1825 ‚Äì c. 1885). They were enslaved on the Roberson plantation near Cross Road township in Martin County, North Carolina. He was a descendant of the Igbo people. In 1860, when he was 15 years old, Robeson escaped slavery with his brother Ezekiel through the Underground Railroad and they made their way to Philadelphia in the free state of Pennsylvania. During the American Civil War, Robeson served in the Union Army as a laborer, entering in 1861 at the age of 16 to join the effort to end slavery in the South. Afterward, Robeson studied at Lincoln College (now a university), where he earned an A.B. in 1873 and Bachelor of Sacred Theology in 1876.

It was built for the black members of the First Presbyterian Church of Princeton (now known as Nassau Presbyterian Church). Robeson was ousted as minister by his church after 20 years of service. He was said to have aligned himself \\"on the wrong side of a church fight,\\" having refused to bow to pressure from the \\"white residents of Princeton\\" that he cease to \\"speak out against social injustice.\\" Upon his dismissal, Reverend William Drew Robeson bypassed any need \\"to recriminate and rebuke ... As I review the past,\\" he said, \\"and think upon many scenes, my heart is filled with love.\\" In closing his last address to his Princeton congregation, he implored them, \\"Do not be discouraged, do not think your past work is in vain.\\"Duberman, Martin, Paul Robeson 1989, pp. 6‚Äì7, Boyhood He moved to Westfield, New Jersey to be the pastor of the Downer Street Saint Luke African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church from 1907 to 1910. He led the congregation through construction of their church, completed in 1908. The younger children attended the Washington School at Elm and Orchard streets. The Robesons lived on the south side of Spring Street, where it intersects with Rahway Avenue. The street is now called Watterson Street, and the house was taken down. =Westfield to Somerville= In 1910 Robeson moved to Somerville, New Jersey, where he led the congregation at the Saint Thomas African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church.

The start-up was originally led by editor-in-chief Valarie Jones (Eclipse, First Comics, Majestic), who left at the end of 1995. She was followed by Steven Wardlaw. The comics are aimed toward adult readers as they often contain imagery of a sexual and/or violent nature. 'Verotik' is a portmanteau created by Glenn Danzig from the words 'violent' and 'erotic'.  History  Since childhood, Glenn Danzig had been an avid comic book collector with frustrated aspirations of being a comic book writer and artist. His fascination with horror is expressed through his music and comic books. The Verotik title Grub Girl was developed into a pornographic movie in 2006, starring Brittney Skye and Eva Angelina. The movie was directed by Craven Moorehead, who would later go on to direct Danzig's music video for \\"Crawl Across Your Killing Floor\\". The soundtrack features a remix of the Danzig song \\"Unspeakable\\". Glenn Danzig is working on a movie adaptation of the Verotik title Ge Rouge, which he will also direct.

The top of the 'L-Tower' is visible to the right Flak towers () were large, above-ground, anti-aircraft gun blockhouse towers constructed by Nazi Germany. There were 8 flak tower complexes in the cities of Berlin (3), Hamburg (2), and Vienna (3) from 1940 onwards. Other cities that used flak towers included Stuttgart and Frankfurt. Smaller single- purpose flak towers were built at key outlying German strongpoints, such as at Angers in France, Helgoland in Germany. The towers were operated by the Luftwaffe to defend against Allied strategic air raids against these cities during World War II. They also served as air-raid shelters for tens of thousands of local civilians. History and uses Flak tower during construction (1942). A 12.8 cm FlaK 40, the main guns of the Flak-towers, and its crew After the RAF's raid on Berlin in 1940, Adolf Hitler ordered the construction of three massive flak towers to defend the capital from air attack. Each tower had a radar installation with a radar dish which could be retracted behind a thick concrete and steel dome for protection. Hitler was interested in the design of the towers, and even made some sketches. They were constructed in six months. The priority of the project was such that the German national rail schedule was altered to facilitate the shipment of concrete, steel and timber to the construction sites. With concrete walls up to thick, flak towers were considered by their designers to be invulnerable to attack by the standard ordnance carried by RAF heavy bombers at the time of their construction. The towers were able to sustain a rate of fire of per minute from their multi-level guns (albeit mostly smaller-caliber shells, such as the 2cm FlaK 30), with a range of up to in a field of fire. However, only the FlaK 40 guns had effective range to defend against the RAF and USAAF heavy bombers. The three flak towers around the outskirts of Berlin created a triangle of anti-aircraft fire that covered the centre of Berlin. The flak towers had also been designed with the idea of using the above-ground bunkers as a civilian shelter, with room for and a hospital ward inside. During the Battle of Berlin, occupants formed their own communities, with up to taking refuge in one tower during the battle. These towers, much like the keeps of medieval castles, were some of the safest places in a fought-over city and so the flak towers were some of the last places to surrender to the Red Army, eventually being forced to capitulate as supplies dwindled. The Soviets, in their assault on Berlin, found it difficult to inflict significant damage on the flak towers, even with some of the largest Soviet guns, such as the 203 mm M1931 howitzers. Soviet forces generally manoeuvred around the towers, and eventually sent in envoys to seek their surrender. Unlike much of Berlin, the towers tended to be fully stocked with ammunition and supplies, and the defenders used 2 cm Flak cannon to defend against assault by ground units . The Zoo Tower was one of the last points of defence, with German armoured units rallying near it at Tiergarten, before trying to break out of the encircling Soviet Red Army. Humbolthain Flak tower today in Berlin After the war, the demolition of the towers was often considered not feasible and many remain to this day, with some having been converted for alternate use.

The term is used in heraldry, but also commonly used to refer to a type of national insignia used on military aircraft, generally circular in shape and usually comprising concentric rings of different colours. Other symbols also often use round shapes. Heraldry In heraldry, a roundel is a circular charge. Roundels are among the oldest charges used in coats of arms, dating from at least the twelfth century. Roundels in British heraldry have different names depending on their tincture. Thus, while a roundel may be blazoned by its tincture, e.g., a roundel vert (literally \\"a roundel green\\"), it is more often described by a single word, in this case pomme (literally \\"apple\\", from the French) or, from the same origins, pomeis‚Äîas in \\"Vert; on a cross Or five pomeis\\".Scottish Public Register vol. 32, p. 26 One special example of a named roundel is the fountain, depicted as a roundel barry wavy argent and azure, that is, containing alternating horizontal wavy bands of blue and silver (or white). Military aircraft Hawker Hurricane showing a Second World War-era Royal Air Force roundel The French Air Service originated the use of roundels on military aircraft during the First World War. The chosen design was the French national cockade, whose colours are the blue-white-red of the flag of France. Similar national cockades, with different ordering of colours, were designed and adopted as aircraft roundels by their allies, including the British Royal Flying Corps and the United States Army Air Service. After the First World War, many other air forces adopted roundel insignia, distinguished by different colours or numbers of concentric rings. The term \\"roundel\\" is often used even for those military aircraft insignia that are not round, like the Iron Cross-Balkenkreuz symbol of the Luftwaffe or the red star of the Russian Air Force. Flags Among flags which display a roundel are the flag of Bangladesh, flag of Japan, and the flag of Palau. Flags for British Overseas Territories used a British Blue Ensign defaced with a white roundel displaying the arms or badge of the dependency until 1999. The same pattern is still used for all the states of Australia except Victoria. In popular culture The Who logo incorporates the roundel symbol used by mods * The roundel, especially that used by the Royal Air Force, has been associated with pop art of the 1960s, appearing in paintings by Jasper Johns. It became part of the pop consciousness when British rock group The Who wore RAF roundels (and Union Flags) as part of their stage apparel at the start of their career. Subsequently it came to symbolise Mods and the Mod revival. * Some of Paul Weller's material involves the use of a roundel in psychedelic colours. * Ben Harper's album Fight For Your Mind uses roundels from several air forces as graphics in the liner notes. * In the British television series Doctor Who, the circular decorations on the interior walls of the TARDIS control room are known as roundels.

The entity is now known as LCL (Le Cr√©dit Lyonnais). *In 2003, advised Deutsche Telekom in its ‚Ç¨2.3 billion bond offer. *Retained as legal counsel by Euronext NV in its ‚Ç¨15 billion merger of equals with the New York Stock Exchange in 2006. *In 2007, legal adviser to T-Mobile in its $2.4 billion merger with SunCom Wireless. *Defended the Republic of Congo in litigation in the United States arising from attempts to garnish Congo's oil royalties. *Represented Mittal Steel Czech subsidiary in ICC arbitration claim brought by Dutch contractor. *Advised Google in its acquisition of Motorola Mobility. *In 2012, provided legal counsel to T-Mobile US and Deutsche Telekom in connection with T-Mobile US's merger with Sprint Corporation. *In 2012, international counsel to Greece in a liability management exercise, its financing transactions with the European Financial Stability Facility which involve debt facilities in excess of ‚Ç¨150 billion as well as other transactions, such as the ‚Ç¨35 billion securities purchase transaction between Greece and the European Central Bank. *In 2012, international counsel to The Hellenic Republic in connection with its invitation, launched on February 24, relating to approximately ‚Ç¨206 billion face amount of Greek bonds held by private sector holders, the largest ever sovereign debt restructuring and the largest ever bond exchange. *In 2014, represented Russia in the case of Yukos, a company that the Russian government had broken up in 2003, after arresting its owner, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, on charges of tax evasion. Courts in several countries later ruled that the Russian government's real intent was to destroy Yukos, seize its assets, and punish Khodorkovsky, a political enemy. The largest arbitration award in history, $50 billion, was won by Yukos' former owners against Russia. In April 2016, a Dutch Court of the Hague overturned the award. *In 2014, retained by the government of Puerto Rico, to help in the restructuring of its $72 billion public debt *In 2017, represented The Dow Chemical Company on the antitrust aspects of its $130 billion merger of equals with DuPont, the third-largest ever. *In 2018, represented the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox on antitrust matters related to Disney‚Äôs $71.3 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets. *In 2018, advised on the $146 Billion Sprint T-Mobile merger. Buchheit and collective action \\"Much of Cleary Gottlieb's success in sovereign debt,\\" according to Reuters, \\"is based on the work of partner Lee Buchheit, who has led restructuring negotiations for 20 countries.\\" Buchheit‚Äôs \\"academic papers, books and legal briefs over the past three decades fill much of the void where no formal law exists.\\" For example, in 2002, \\"Buchheit developed a collective action clause, which says that if a supermajority of bondholders votes in favor of a restructuring, it becomes legally binding for everyone, even for those who voted against it.\\" Buchheit was a lead author of a 2013 Brookings committee report that proposed changes in the approach to sovereign debt, including the collective action clause. Awards and recognition *Law360 recognized Cleary in its \\"Global 20\\" List of Preeminent Global Law Firms, 2014 *Cleary was selected as the Americas Law Firm of the Year for 2015 and the Russian Law Firm of the Year from in 2013, 2014, and 2015 by the International Financial Law Review. *Legal Business ranked Cleary as its Law Firm of the Year in 2013. *Vault ranked Cleary Gottlieb as the #8 Best Law Firm in 2016, based on prestige to work for from branche-internal surveys. This was a decline from its position of #7 in 2015. *The Chambers USA Guide gave Cleary Gottlieb the Chambers & Partners' inaugural International Law Firm of the Year award in 2016. * In 2016, the website Vault.com ranked Cleary Gottlieb #3 for International Practice and #9 overall in its \\"Vault Law 100\\" list. Television producer Doug Liman has cited the firm as an inspiration for the T.V. series Suits. Controversies *In August 2007, Manhattan federal judge Loretta Preska sanctioned Cleary Gottlieb for improperly trying to dissuade a witness, French-Congolese businessman Medard Mbemba, from testifying in Kensington International Ltd. v. Republic of Congo, in which Kensington, which was trying to collect on a nearly $57 million judgment against Congo and Cleary Gottlieb was representing Congo. The firm, Preska wrote, \\"has shown a willingness to operate in the murky area between zealous advocacy and improper conduct, and here it crossed the line.\\" She imposed monetary sanctions on the firm and ordered that a formal reprimand be circulated to all of Cleary's 950 lawyers, and officially reminded Clearly \\"that it has obligations beyond representing its client.\\" *In addition, Cleary attorneys have at various times taken controversial positions in front of U.S. courts. During an October 2013 hearing, Cleary partner, Johnathan Blackman, stated that if the court came to an unfavorable ruling Argentina would not \\"voluntarily obey.\\" One observer noted that \\"Argentina's pronouncements, at the very least, have put Cleary Gottlieb in the awkward position of trying to explain to Judge Griesa why he should disregard the public proclamations of its client.\\" Cleary has faced criticism from other commentators who have urged Argentina to fire Cleary Gottlieb, saying the firm failed to protect the national interest. * In August 2014, Argentina published a two-page ad in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal stating that it had not defaulted on its debt obligations. Judge Griesa called this a \\"false and misleading\\" statement and said that Argentina's lawyers were responsible for monitoring Argentina's statements. One report stated that Griesa, at a meeting in his office in Manhattan, \\"railed at Argentina‚Äôs lawyers from Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton following the publication of another so-called legal notice insisting the government has met its payment requirements and was therefore not in default.\\" *The U.S. Department of Justice stated in 2014 that Cleary Gottlieb had given incorrect legal advice to BNP Paribas in regard to international transactions, resulting in penalization by US authorities that might otherwise be avoided.

The work discusses what is honorable (Book I), what is to one's advantage (Book II), and what to do when the honorable and private gain apparently conflict (Book III). For the first two books Cicero was dependent on the Stoic philosopher Panaetius, but wrote more independently for the third book.  Background  De Officiis was written in October‚ÄìNovember 44 BC, in under four weeks.Marcus Tullius Cicero and P. G. Walsh. On Obligations. 2001, p. ix This was Cicero's last year alive, and he was 62 years of age. Cicero was at this time still active in politics, trying to stop revolutionary forces from taking control of the Roman Republic. Despite his efforts, the republican system failed to revive even upon the assassination of Caesar, and Cicero was himself assassinated shortly thereafter.  Writing  De Officiis is written in the form of a letter to his son with the same name, who studied philosophy in Athens. Judging from its form, it is nonetheless likely that Cicero wrote with a broader audience in mind. The essay was published posthumously. Although Cicero was influenced by the Academic, Peripatetic, and Stoic schools of Greek philosophy, this work shows the influence of the Stoic philosopher Panaetius.Cicero, Miller: On Duty, iii. 23 Panaetius was a Greek philosopher who had resided in Rome around eighty years previously. He wrote a book On Duties () in which he divided his subject into three parts but had left the work unfinished at the third stage. Although Cicero draws from many other sources, for his first two books he follows the steps of Panaetius fairly closely. The third book is more independent, and Cicero disclaims having been indebted to any preceding writers on the subject. Michael Grant tells us that \\"Cicero himself seems to have regarded this treatise as his spiritual testament and masterpiece.\\"Cicero, Grant: \\"Selected Works\\", p. 158 Cicero urged his son Marcus to follow nature and wisdom, as well as politics, and warned against pleasure and indolence. Cicero's essay relies heavily on anecdotes, much more than his other works, and is written in a more leisurely and less formal style than his other writings, perhaps because he wrote it hastily. Like the satires of Juvenal, Cicero's De Officiis refers frequently to current events of his time. Contents From a German edition ‚Äì 1531 The work discusses what is honorable (Book I), what is expedient or to one's advantage (Book II), and what to do when the honorable and expedient conflict (Book III). Cicero says they are the same and that they only appear to be in conflict. In Book III, Cicero expresses his own ideas.Cicero, Grant: \\"Selected Works\\", p. 157 =Book 1= The first book treats of what is honorable in itself. He shows in what true manner our duties are founded in honor and virtue. The four constituent parts of virtue are truth, justice, fortitude, and decorum, and our duties are founded in the right perception of these. =Book 2= The second book enlarges on those duties which relate to private advantage and the improvement of life. The book focuses on political advancement, and the means employed for the attainment of wealth and power. The honorable means of gaining popularity include generosity, courtesy, and eloquence. =Book 3= The third book discusses the choice to be made when there is an apparent conflict between virtue and expediency. True virtue can never be put in competition with private advantage. Thus nothing should be accounted useful or profitable if not strictly virtuous, and there ought to be no separation of the principles of virtue and expediency. Cicero proposes some rules for cases of doubt, where seeming utility comes into competition with virtue. He examines in what situations one may seek private gain with honour. He takes his examples from Roman history, such as the case of Marcus Atilius Regulus who was released by the Carthaginians to negotiate a peace, advised the Roman Senate to reject the proposals, and fulfilled his oath by returning to Carthage. Themes De Officiis has been characterized as an attempt to define ideals of public behavior.Marcus Tullius Cicero and P. G. Walsh. On Obligations. 2001, p. xxx It criticizes the recently overthrown dictator Julius Caesar in several places, and his dictatorship as a whole. Cicero claims that the absence of political rights corrupts moral virtues. Cicero also speaks of a natural law that is said to govern both humans and gods alike.Cicero, Miller: On Duty, Book III. v. 23  Legacy  The work's legacy is profound. Although not a Christian work, St. Ambrose in 390 declared it legitimate for the Church to use (along with everything else Cicero, and the equally popular Roman philosopher Seneca, had written). It became a moral authority during the Middle Ages. Of the Church Fathers, St. Augustine, St. Jerome and even more so St. Thomas Aquinas, are known to have been familiar with it.Hannis Taylor, Cicero: A Sketch of His Life and Works, A.C. McClurg & Co. 1916, p. 9 Illustrating its importance, some 700 handwritten copies remain extant in libraries around the world dating back to before the invention of the printing press. Only the Latin grammarian Priscian is better attested to with such handwritten copies, with some 900 remaining extant. Following the invention of the printing press, De Officiis was the third book to be printed‚Äîthird only to the Gutenberg Bible and Donatus's \\"Ars Minor\\", which was the first printed book.'The first printed book was not Gutenberg's famed forty-two-line Bible but rather Donatus's Ars Mino, which Gutenberg, correctly sizing up the market, hoped to sell in class sets to schools.' Thus, J√ºrgen Leonhardt, \\"Latin: A World Language\\" (Belknap Press 2013) p. 99. Petrarch, the father of humanism and a leader in the revival of Classical learning, championed Cicero. Several of his works build upon the precepts of De officiis. The Catholic humanist Erasmus published his own edition in Paris in 1501. His enthusiasm for this moral treatise is expressed in many works.Erasmus' Epistolae 152 The German humanist Philip Melanchthon established De officiis in Lutheran humanist schools. Henry VIII's childhood copy of De Officiis, bearing the inscription \\"Thys boke is myne\\" in his hand, from the collection of the Folger Shakespeare Library. T. W. Baldwin said that \\"in Shakespeare's day De Officiis was the pinnacle of moral philosophy\\".T.W.Baldwin, \\"William Shakspere's Small Latine & lesse Greeke\\", Vol. 2, University of Illinois Press, 1944, p. 590, Available online Sir Thomas Elyot, in his popular Governour (1531), lists three essential texts for bringing up young gentlemen: Plato's works, Aristotle's Ethics, and De Officiis.Sir Thomas Elyot, The Boke named the Governour, Vol. 1, Kegan Paul, Trench, & Co. 1883 pp. 91‚Äì94 In the 17th century it was a standard text at English schools (Westminster and Eton) and universities (Cambridge and Oxford). It was extensively discussed by Grotius and Pufendorf. Hugo Grotius drew heavily on De officiis in his major work, On the Law of War and Peace.Cicero; Walsh: \\"On Obligations\\" pp. xliii‚Äìxliv It influenced Robert Sanderson and John Locke.John Marshall, \\"John Locke: Resistance, Religion, and Responsibility\\", Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp. 162, 164, 299 In the 18th century, Voltaire said of De Officiis \\"No one will ever write anything more wise\\".Voltaire, Cicero, Philosophical Dictionary Part 2 Orig. Published 1764 Frederick the Great thought so highly of the book that he asked the scholar Christian Garve to do a new translation of it, even though there had been already two German translations since 1756. Garve's project resulted in 880 additional pages of commentary. In 1885, the city of Perugia was shaken by the theft of an illuminated manuscript of De Officiis from the city's Library Augusta. The chief librarian Adamo Rossi, a well-known scholar, was originally suspected but exonerated after a lengthy administrative and judicial investigation. The culprit in the theft was never found. Suspicion fell on a janitor who a few years later became well-to-do enough to build for himself a fine house. The former janitor's house was nicknamed \\"Villa Cicero\\" by residents of Perugia. De Officiis continues to be one of the most popular of Cicero's works because of its style, and because of its depiction of Roman political life under the Republic.

History The beginnings of the band stemmed from singer Daryl Palumbo's interests in the hip hop and Britpop genres. Palumbo felt that the material that was inspired by these genres did not fit into Glassjaw's spectrum and so Head Automatica was created to showcase this. The band's debut album, Decadence, was released August 17, 2004. Charting on the Billboard 200 and Top Heatseekers charts,[] the album was the brainchild of Palumbo, who was known better for his work in post- hardcore music, and Dan 'The Automator' Nakamura, famous for his production work with groups including Gorillaz and Handsome Boy Modeling School. The two allegedly met at a party and worked on what later became the album. Palumbo then recruited the other current members as a touring group, and toured the United States, playing with bands such as Interpol, The Rapture, The Used and The Cure. The band released their second album, entitled Popaganda, on June 6, 2006. This album was produced by Howard Benson, who had already worked with Head Automatica on several tracks from Decadence. With the departure of Nakamura, the band took a more organic, classic power-pop approach citing Squeeze and Elvis Costello as influences. In 2006, the band toured with Avenged Sevenfold and Coheed and Cambria, and joined Taking Back Sunday, Angels & Airwaves, and The Subways for a month of touring on June 22. In October 2006, drummer and founding member Larry Gorman was fired from the band for undisclosed reasons, with Brandon Reid being announced as his replacement. The band scheduled a headlining fall tour with Rock Kills Kid, but chose to cancel it after playing only a few dates. Instead, they supported Thirty Seconds to Mars on their Welcome to the Universe Tour along with The Receiving End of Sirens, Cobra Starship, and Rock Kills Kid. In early 2007, Head Automatica played direct support on The West Coast Winter Tour with Jack's Mannequin, We Are The Fury, and The Audition. The band visited the UK for the first time for a headlining tour that started at Southampton University on May 23, 2007, and performed at Rock Am Ring festival in N√ºrburg, Germany on June 1. August 2007 saw yet another change in the line up, with New York hardcore veteran Sammy Siegler taking over the drum kit. Head Automatica started pre- production on their third album in late September 2007, aiming for a \\"darker\\" sound and \\"grimy, dancefloor-friendly\\" songs.Alternative Press #234, January 2008, p. 95 The band recorded half of the material with producer Jason Lader and the other with The Brothers (the production team of Josh Topolsky and Eric Emm). Sammy Siegler handled the drumming duties, and Albert Wing, Bruce Fowler and Gary Grant recorded the brass section. The band appeared in a Christmas- themed skit on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on December 18, 2008 and went on a short North American tour with Radio 4 in January 2009. On May 27, 2009, Daryl Palumbo confirmed in a tweet that Head Automatica had entered the mixing phase of the album, entitled Swan Damage. In an interview with Revolt online magazine Palumbo stated that the record \\"captures everything we ever intended Head Automatica to be. It covers the genre spectrum; there are powerful clubby tracks, garage-pop tracks, and body-rocking tracks. This album really reflects the full spectrum of music this band is capable of playing.‚Äù The band have been performing songs from Swan Damage live, working titles including \\"Can't Stand Amadeus\\", \\"End of Heat\\", \\"Too Ashamed\\", \\"Face Upon the Floor\\", \\"Spitzer\\", \\"Sega\\", \\"It's a Lie\\" and \\"Hard as Mud\\". In July 2009 Head Automatica played a string of US dates with Cubic Zirconia and have gone missing from the public eye for more than a year, with no announcements regarding Swan Damage. The band re-emerged with a new rhythm section of drummer Guy Licata (Cold Cave, Hercules & Love Affair) and bassist Rick Penzone (Men, Women & Children) to perform at the Music Hall of Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York on October 20, 2010. On October 21, 2010 Palumbo tweeted a link to the Cubic Zirconia remix of the still-to-be-released track \\"Can't Stand Amadeus\\". On May 30, 2012, Palumbo revealed via Twitter that Warner Bros. Records have effectively shelved the masters for Swan Damage. July 2012 issue of Southampton Music featured an interview with Palumbo, in which he cited legal issues (that supposedly arose when he decided to end his contract with the label) as the reason for the three-year delay, but expressed confidence in the album being released \\"soon\\". In August 2012 Head Automatica toured the UK as a four-piece, performing material from Swan Damage and new versions of songs from their first two records.

The subway was constructed in the bed of the old Erie Canal, which allowed the route to be grade-separated for its entire length. of the route through downtown were constructed in a cut-and- cover tunnel that became Broad Street, and the only underground portion of the subway. The Rochester Subway was designed to reduce interurban traffic on city streets, and to facilitate freight interchange between the railroads. The line was operated on a contract basis by New York State Railways until Rochester Transit Corporation (RTC) took over in 1938. The last day of passenger service was June 30, 1956. Portions of the right-of-way were used for expressway construction, while the rest was abandoned and filled in over the years. The largest remaining section is a stretch of tunnel under Broad Street from Exchange Street to the intersection of Court Street and South Avenue. History In 1918, the Erie Canal was re-routed to bypass downtown Rochester, and in 1919 the abandoned portion of the canal was bought to serve as the route of the subway. The subway was built below, and Broad Street above. Only were in the tunnel, the rest of the route in open cut. The term \\"subway\\" did not refer to the tunnel, but to the route being grade-separated and operated as rapid transit. Interurban lines were also run through the subway and off city streets, easing growing congestion. The segment over the Genesee River utilized the former Erie Canal: Second Genesee Aqueduct. See also: New York State Railways (1927-1938) Rochester subway entrance Court Street postcard Construction was completed and operations began in 1927, under contract with New York State Railways. Ten former Utica and Mohawk Valley Railway 2000-series cars were transferred from the Utica Lines to provide dedicated service in the Rochester subway. New York State Railways entered receivership in 1929, but continued to operate the subway on a contract basis with the city of Rochester. Interurban railways began using the new subway almost immediately. Starting in 1927, the Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway connected at Rowlands and terminated at City Hall station. The Rochester and Syracuse Railroad began using the subway in 1928, using a new connection established just east of Winton Road station. The Rochester, Lockport and Buffalo Railroad entered from the west side starting in 1928 using a ramp constructed at Lyell Avenue. In 1929, a special subway‚Äìsurface operation began using a ramp at Emerson station to connect with the Dewey Avenue line to provide rush-hour service to Kodak Park, a major employer in the city. On June 1, 1929, local service on the Rochester subway was extended from Winton Road to Rowlands loop. When the remainder of the Utica & Mohawk Valley Railway was abandoned, New York State Railways transferred the relatively new and faster steel cars to Rochester to replace the older 2000-series center-door cars that had been in service since the opening of the subway. They were brought to Rochester and reconditioned in 1937. In the aftermath of the Great Depression, New York State Railways fell into bankruptcy along with other railroads that operated interurban lines in the area. By 1931, all of the connecting interurban railways had ceased operation leaving the subway as an east‚Äìwest line with no rail connections outside the line. Rochester Transit Corp. (1938-1956) The former Rochester Lines of New York State Railways were reorganized as the Rochester Transit Corporation on August 2, 1938, and operation of the subway was transferred to the new company. In an effort to cut costs, weekday service was reduced and Sunday service was eliminated in 1952. The service contract was awarded on a month-to-month basis until the city council voted in 1955 to end all subway service on June 30, 1956. Freight service was operated by RTC until 1957, when the remaining rail operations were turned over to the connecting New York Central (NYC) and Baltimore and Ohio (B&O;) railroads. Expressways and freight (1956-1996) The former Utica cars ran until the end of passenger service. Car 60 was set aside for preservation in 1956, and was donated to the Rochester Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society. The trolley car was loaned to other organizations and returned to the Rochester & Genesee Valley Railroad Museum in 1998 where it is undergoing an evaluation for restoration. Locomotive L-2 was rescued from a Rochester scrap yard in the 1970s, and has been set aside for a potential future restoration by the New York Museum of Transportation. The subway bed from Court Street to Winton Road was used for the construction of a portion of the Eastern Expressway (I-490) in 1959, with the section from Winton Road to Rowlands used for I-590. Limited freight service operated by connecting railroads lasted on the western portion of the subway route from Court Street to General Motors until 1976, when the city of Rochester elected to fill the cut to eliminate maintenance on the numerous bridges. Rail freight deliveries in the subway tunnel continued until 1996, when Gannett Newspapers moved its printing operations from the Gannett Building which the subway ran under to another location. Capelli Sport Stadium was constructed on a portion of the filled-in cut in 2006. Salvage and preservation The aqueduct in 2015 In 1976, after the announcement of the fill, the City of Rochester allowed the New York Museum of Transportation to collect the rail from the portion of the line being filled. The former rail is still in use by the museum. In 2010, when the city decided to fill the portion of the tunnel between Brown and the B&O; ramp, the museum was allowed to collect the remaining rail, surviving switches and other railroad fixtures from the tunnel. Rochester subway car 60 is at the Rochester and Genesee Valley Railroad Museum, where it is undergoing a formal evaluation for cosmetic restoration. Built in 1916 for Utica Railways and moved to Rochester in 1936, car 60 is the only surviving example from the 12-car fleet that served the subway.

There is much controversy over what should be done with it. In the words of Laurie Mercer, \\"It‚Äôs either a giant hole waiting to be filled with dirt or an impressive asset in a city that needs to revitalize its downtown.\\" Rochester officials want to do something with the tunnels, because it cost an estimated $1.2 million in repairs and shoring up every year to maintain them. There were proposals to use some of the tunnels in a new rapid transit system. Another proposal was to transform the Broad Street Aqueduct into an underground walkway connecting the Rochester Riverside Convention Center with the Blue Cross Arena. A component of this walkway would include a Rochester Transportation Museum. Some suggested filling the remaining subway tunnel with water, re-routing the Erie Canal and restoring the aqueduct to its original purpose. In 2004, Rochester city officials decided to fill the remaining subway tunnel with earth. This decision caused public outcry, since residents regard the subway as part of their history. On June 15, 2006, the city promised to form a committee to investigate all possible options. In July 2008, the city voted to fill in a portion of the tunnel, citing safety concerns. The westernmost end of the tunnel was filled as part of the Broad Street Tunnel Improvement project. Work began in spring 2010 at a cost between $14 and $16 million. The city removed the Broad Street section from East Main to Brown Street and filled that section of the subway tunnel, but rebuilt the former B&O; ramp into what remains of the subway, making that ramp the western access point into the subway. The remains of the Rochester Subway run from the B&O; ramp just east of East Main Street to Court Street. In 2017, the site of Court Street station was demolished to make way for a mixed-use commercial and luxury residential highrise eliminating the Court Street tunnel entrance. The city maintains a maintenance doorway underneath the Gannett Building. This entrance is not open to the public. In 2018, a plan dubbed ROC the Riverway was unveiled that proposes removing the Broad Street level of the aqueduct and re-flooding the former canal and subway bed on the aqueduct with water similar to what was done with the historic canals at Canalside in Buffalo, NY. Also in 2018, the city solicited bids to turn a remaining segment of tunnel between Main Street and Exchange Street into underground parking. There were no interested buyers.

The title refers to the town of Statesboro, Georgia. In 1968, Taj Mahal recorded a popular blues rock adaptation of the song with a prominent slide guitar part by Jesse Ed Davis. His rendition inspired a recording by the Allman Brothers Band, which is ranked number nine on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\\". In 2005, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution ranked \\"Statesboro Blues\\" number 57 on its list of \\"100 Songs of the South\\".Perry, Bryan (producer); Harrison, Shane; Murray, Sonia; Marino, Nick; and Ellison, Soyia. 100 Songs of the South. Retrieved 2009-10-11. Original song Although McTell was born in Thomson, Georgia, in an interview he called Statesboro \\"my real home.\\" He made the first recording of the song for Victor, on October 17, 1928 (Victor #38001). The eight sides he recorded for Victor, including \\"Statesboro Blues\\", have been described as \\"superb examples of storytelling in music, coupled with dazzling guitar work.\\" Lyrics The lyrics, a first-person narrative, appear to relate the story of a man pleading with a woman to let him in her house; the speaker calls himself \\"Papa McTell\\" in the first stanza (\\"Have you got the nerve to drive Papa McTell from your door?\\"). Throughout the song, the woman, addressed as \\"mama,\\" is alternately pleaded with (to go with the speaker \\"up the country\\") and threatened (\\"When I leave this time, pretty mama, I'm going away to stay\\"). Throughout the non-linear narrative, the \\"Statesboro blues\\" are invoked‚Äîan unexplained condition from which the speaker and his entire family seem to be suffering (\\"I woke up this morning / Had them Statesboro blues / I looked over in the corner: grandma and grandpa had 'em too\\"). Later versions, such as the one by the Allman Brothers Band, have shorter, simplified lyrics. As with many blues lyrics, it can be difficult to establish a definitive narrative order for the stanzas. In the case of \\"Statesboro Blues,\\" Richard Blaustein attempted a structural analysis of McTell's song in an approach influenced by Claude L√©vi-Strauss; it is unclear whether his results are applicable to other blues songs. In 2016, the song was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry due to its \\"cultural, historic, or artistic significance\\". It is included on several compilations of McTell's recordings. Taj Mahal adaptation In 1967, Taj Mahal recorded a \\"wonderful modernized version\\" of \\"Statesboro Blues\\" for his eponymous 1968 debut album. He had recorded the song earlier as a member of the group Rising Sons in 1965 or 1966; however, it was not released until 1992. His 1967 rendition reached a wide audience by being included on the best-selling Columbia/CBS sampler album The Rock Machine Turns You On. Taj Mahal's arrangement is credited with inspiring the Allman Brothers Band. According to Pete Carr, who was a member of Hour Glass with brothers Duane and Gregg Allman, a performance by Mahal made a big impression on Duane: \\"We went to see Taj Mahal, and he had Jesse Ed Davis with him. They did 'Statesboro Blues,' and Davis played slide on it. After hearing that, Duane started practicing slide all the time.\\" Another Hour Glass member, Paul Hornsby, added: The Allman Brothers Band version The Allman Brothers Band recorded the song at the Fillmore East in March 1971 and first released it on the 1971 album At Fillmore East. Duane Allman contributes the slide guitar, which Rolling Stone later described as featuring \\"the moaning and squealing opening licks [that] have given fans chills at live shows.\\" The Tedeschi Trucks Band performing \\"Statesboro Blues\\" in tribute fashion in 2018 Allman's slide riffs on \\"Statesboro Blues\\" have been analyzed and transcribed in guitar magazines and the tones of Allman's and Dickey Betts's guitars on the song were described by Guitar Player as among the \\"50 Greatest Tones of All Time.\\" Allman's version comes from when his brother Gregg gave him a record by Taj Mahal (containing his version of \\"Statesboro Blues\\") and a bottle of Coricidin pills, both for his birthday and as Duane had a cold that day; a short while later, Duane, who had never played slide guitar before, washed the label from the Coricidin bottle after emptying out the pills and learned how to play the song, even exhibiting it to Gregg. After Allman's death in a motorcycle crash in 1971, the performance from the Fillmore East was included on the 1972 album An Anthology. In 2008, Rolling Stone magazine ranked the Allman Brothers Band's version of \\"Statesboro Blues\\" number nine in its list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\\". The song was still a staple of the Allman Brothers Band's live shows in later years, with either Derek Trucks or Warren Haynes playing slide guitar. Dickey Betts also continues to play the song live. It can also be found on the compilation album The Road Goes On Forever. Following the death of his uncle Butch Trucks in 2017, Derek Trucks often led the Tedeschi Trucks Band in tribute performances of \\"Statesboro Blues\\", with the band onstage reduced in size to match the original Allmans lineup and Trucks facing the drum position where his uncle had played.

He is the frontman of the bands Glassjaw, Head Automatica and Color Film. As a youth he was a member of the Long Island straight edge band XbustedX. In 1993 he met guitarist Justin Beck, who would become his good friend. Together they formed Glassjaw. Palumbo has Crohn's disease, which has acted as inspiration for much of his musical output, most notably in the lyrical content of Glassjaw's major label debut Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence. His affliction has affected his bands' ability to tour, including the cancellation of a tour with The Used in 2005. Collaborations Palumbo as front man for Head Automatica Palumbo has worked with many different artists including Alien Ant Farm (performing live with them on their cover of Bad Brains' \\"Gene Machine\\"), The Movielife (on the track, \\"Another Friend\\"), Ray Cappo (on Glassjaw's cover of the Youth of Today song, \\"Modern Love Story\\"), The Rondo Brothers (on the tracks \\"Hey Stewardess\\", \\"Whispering Reef\\", and \\"Take Me Back\\"), Silent Majority (on the track \\"Popular Opinion\\"), Every Time I Die (on the track \\"Champing at the Bit\\" from Gutter Phenomenon), Finch (on the tracks \\"Project Mayhem\\" and \\"Grey Matter\\" from What It Is to Burn), Cage Kennylz (on the track \\"Shoot Frank\\" from Hell's Winter) and Dan the Automator's Handsome Boy Modeling School. In interviews Palumbo has expressed an interest to work with British singer/songwriter and producer Nick Lowe. In 2004, Palumbo made a brief appearance in the Lostprophets music video for their track \\"Last Summer\\", alongside Head Automatica bassist Jarvis Holden. In October 2005, Palumbo appeared as a guest vocalist on the track, \\"No Way Out\\" on the album Roadrunner United: The All Star Sessions. The album was a collaboration between past and current bands signed to Roadrunner Records. This release was significant as it showed a new, positive attitude towards the label from Palumbo. Previously, he and Justin Beck had voiced negative statements regarding the label relating to their treatment by Roadrunner and subsequent move to Warner Bros.. Palumbo also provided guest vocals on the track \\"Procession Commence\\" on the 2006 album Sundowning by the Long Island hardcore punk band This Is Hell. He also provided backing vocals on their previous EP. Palumbo was also a judge for the 8th annual Independent Music Awards, to support independent artists. Palumbo contributed guitar, bass and synthesizer to, and also co-produced Cold Cave's second full-length album, Cherish the Light Years. Palumbo announced on his Twitter account that he and friend/ex- Men, Women and Children member Rick Penzone were entering the mixing stages of their first LP with a new project, called Color Film. The duo were featured on the track \\"It's A Sin\\" off of Nick Hook's Without You EP. On October 18, 2012, Color Film played their first show at Irving Plaza, New York. Along with the announcement of the show, the band's site went online, revealing their debut full-length details and a download of the track \\"52 Minds\\" in exchange for a scratch off ticket code. The album, titled Living Arrangements, was produced by the duo and mixed by Gareth Jones and was expected for a 2013 release. \\"Bad Saint\\", another track from the record, is available for streaming and download on Color Film Soundcloud page. In April 2013, Palumbo released an electro house track titled \\"Don't Leave Me\\". September 2013 saw the release of \\"It's A Sin\\" video by Nick Hook featuring Color Film. Color Film released their debut EP Until You Turn Blue on October 22, 2013 on Calm + Collect. The band also released a live video for their track \\"Small Town\\".

He served as the first U.S. Children's Poet Laureate (now called the Young People's Poet Laureate) from 2006-08 when the Poetry Foundation established the award. Jack Prelutsky was born on September 8, 1940 in Brooklyn, New York to Charles Prelutsky, an electrician, and Dorothea Prelutsky, a homemaker. While he was still a baby, a fire killed his family and he was saved by his Uncle Charlie, who was a father of the age of 56. He attended local public schools in the Bronx, hated the experience, and was bored in class. Prelutsky claims to have hated poetry when he was younger.Academy of American Poets He stated that \\"sometime in elementary school I had a teacher who, in retrospect, did not like poetry herself. She was determined to inflict violent punches and deadly blows so you can believe her views on her captives that were locked in the basement. The syllabus told her she had to recite a poem once a week. She would pick a boring poem from a boring book and read it in a boring voice, looking bored while she was doing it.\\"Biography Today, p.127 After teachers discovered he had musical talents, they suggested that he attend The High School of Music & Art. The moment he was there, he was happy and was able to train his beautiful singing voice and even took part in the musicals. He graduated in 1958, and went on to Hunter College for two years. He studied philosophy, psychology, and flunked English three times before dropping out. Before becoming a writer, he worked odd jobs including driving a cab, moving furniture, busboy, potter, woodworker, and door-to-door salesman. In the late 1960s, he was working in a bookstore in Greenwich Village and at Izzy Young's Folklore Center, singing in coffeehouses under the name Jack Ballard. While doing the latter he met Bob Dylan, became friends, and Dylan even stated that Prelutsky sounded \\"like a cross between Woody Guthrie and Enrico Caruso.\\"USA Today Prelutsky also loved to draw imaginary turtle animals, and a friend of his encouraged him to send it to a publisher in New York. He wrote poems to go with the drawings last minute. He met with Susan Hirschman, and was amazed when they wanted his work; not the drawings that took six months to draw, but the poems which took two hours. He was 24 at the time, and the poems appeared in his first book, A Gopher in the Garden and Other Animal Poems, in 1967. Hirschman told him he was a natural poet, published his book, and remained his editor until she retired 37 years later. Poetry Prelutsky has written more than 50 poetry collections, including Nightmares: Poems to Trouble Your Sleep (1976), It's Halloween (1977), The Mean Old Mean Hyena (1978), and Something BIG Has Been Here (1990). Nilsen, A. P. and Nilsen, D.L.F. (2000). Encyclopedia of 20th- Century American Humor [Electronic version]. Phoenix, AZ: Oryx Press. He has also compiled numerous children's anthologies comprising poems of others. He has also set his poems to music on the audio versions of his anthologies. He often sings and plays guitar on them. In 2006, the Poetry Foundation named Prelutsky the inaugural winner of the Children's Poet Laureate award. In 1996, he appeared on the popular animated television series Arthur, in the episode \\"I'm a Poet\\". His book Behold the Bold Umbrellaphant and Other Poems (illustrated by Carin Berger) won the 2007 Scandiuzzi Children's Book Award of the Washington State Book Awards in the Picture Book category. In 1993, his poetry collection The New Kid on the Block was made into an interactive story book by Br√∏derbund's Living Books series. Prelutsky has garnered many awards in his long career including citations as: New York Times Outstanding Book of the Year, School Library Journal Best of the Best Book, International Reading Association/Children's Book Council Children's Choice, Library of Congress Book of the Year, Parents' Choice Award, American Library Association Notable Children's Recording, an Association for Library Services to Children Notable Book and Booklist Editor's Choice, among others. His combined works have sold over a million copies and been translated into many languages. In 2018, his poem \\"Homework! Oh, Homework!\\" was featured in a national commercial for Apple's iPad. Personal life Prelutsky married his wife in the Bronx in 1979. They met when he was on a book tour in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and she was a children's librarian who was tasked with showing him around town. He claims it was love at first sight and even asked for her hand in marriage the first day he met her. They have lived in Arizona, Boston, New York City, and Olympia, Washington. They currently live in downtown Seattle and have a house on Bainbridge Island.Biography Today, p.134 Bibliography * A Gopher in the Garden and Other Animal Poems (1967) (illustrated by Robert Leydenfrost) * The Terrible Tiger (1970) (illustrated by Arnold Lobel) * Toucans Two and Other Poems (1970) (illustrated by Jos√© Aruego) * Circus (1974) (illustrated by Arnold Lobel) * Nightmares: Poems to Trouble Your Sleep (1976) (illustrated by Arnold Lobel) * It's Halloween (1977) (illustrated by Marylin Hafner) * The Mean Old Mean Hyena (1978) (illustrated by Arnold Lobel) * The Queen of Eene (1978) (illustrated by Victoria Chess) * Rainy Rainy Saturday (1980) (illustrated by Marilyn Hafner) * The Headless Horseman Rides Tonight: More Poems to Trouble Your Sleep (1980) (illustrated by Arnold Lobel) * It's Christmas (1981) (illustrated by Marylin Hafner) * It's Thanksgiving (1982) (illustrated by Marylin Hafner) * Kermit's Garden of Verses (1982) (illustrated by Bruce McNally) * The Baby Uggs Are Hatching (1982) (illustrated by James Stevenson) * It's Valentine's Day (1983) (illustrated by Yossi Abulafia) * Zoo Doings (1983) (illustrated by Paul O.

She was originally built by Burrard-Yarrows Corporation in Canada in 1983 as part of an Arctic drilling system developed by BeauDril, the drilling subsidiary of Gulf Canada Resources. After the offshore oil exploration in the Beaufort Sea ended in the early 1990s, she was first leased and then sold to the Canadian Coast Guard. Terry Foxs sister ship, Kalvik, is today owned by the Russian Murmansk Shipping Company as Vladimir Ignatyuk.  Development and construction  In the mid-1970s, Gulf Canada Resources began developing an Arctic drilling system consisting of two mobile drilling units: a Mobile Arctic Caisson (MAC) that could be submerged and filled with gravel to form an artificial drilling island in waters up to in depth and a floating Conical Drilling Unit (CDU) designed for drilling in water depths between while afloat. The intention of this development was to overcome the relatively short operating window of drillships during the ice-free season (100 to 110 days a year) and the water depth limitations of artificial dredged islands in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea. The drilling units, each capable of completing one exploration well per year, would be supported by four Arctic Class 4 vessels: two large icebreakers providing 24-hour ice management and standby services on the drilling site and two smaller icebreaking vessels responsible for anchor handling and supply runs between the drilling rigs and coastal bases. By 1982, both drilling units and all four icebreaking vessels were under construction in Canada and Japan for BeauDril, Gulf Canada's drilling subsidiary, and the company had committed itself to a billion-dollar exploration program between 1983 and 1988. The icebreaker design was provided by the Montreal-based engineering company German & Milne. During the development phase, the hull form was extensively tested at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA) ice tank with particular emphasis of preventing broken ice floes from flowing under the hull and into the propellers. The result was a production-friendly fully-developable hull form with a semi-spoon bow and large ice plough. The construction of the two icebreakers was awarded to Burrard-Yarrows Corporation in December 1979 and the work was split between the company's Victoria and Vancouver divisions. In order to expedite the delivery of the vessels, Gulf Canada had already purchased the engines, gearboxes, shaft lines and propellers before signing the C$79 million shipbuilding contract for two hulls. The keel of newbuilding number 107 was laid at the Burrard-Yarrows Vancouver shipyard on 15 June 1982 and the vessel was launched on 23 April 1983 as Terry Fox. While the other BeauDril icebreakers and drilling units were given names drawn from the Northern Territories native languages, Terry Fox was named after Terrance Stanley \\"Terry\\" Fox (1958‚Äì1981), a Canadian athlete, humanitarian and cancer research activist known for his 1980 Marathon for Hope, an attempted cross-Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research, after losing his right leg to osteosarcoma. The icebreaker was completed on 16 September 1983, slightly behind the original schedule which called for delivery in April when Gulf Canada's exploratory drilling program was set to begin. Terry Foxs sister ship, Kalvik, had been delivered by Victoria shipyard in July of the same year. At the time, Beaudril's two icebreakers were the most powerful privately-owned icebreaking vessels in the world.  Design  = General characteristics = Terry Fox is long overall and between perpendiculars. She has a beam of and draws of water when fully laden. While the crew's common spaces such as mess rooms and lounges are arranged on the main deck, the accommodation is arranged in the box-shaped deckhouse. In the Canadian Coast Guard service, Terry Fox has a complement of 10 officers and 14 crew, and 10 additional berths. The towing gear consists of an 80-ton winch holding of wire and a separate 200-ton double-drum anchor-handling winch. Unlike her sister ship, Terry Fox has not been retrofitted with a helideck. However, her cargo- handling capability has been increased with a 40-tonne cargo crane and a cargo hold in place of the original bulk cargo tanks. = Power and propulsion = Terry Fox has a diesel-mechanical propulsion system consisting of four main engines driving two shafts through twin input-single output gearboxes. The prime movers are eight-cylinder Stork-Werkspoor 8TM410 medium-speed diesel engines producing at 600rpm in continuous service. Each pair of main engines is coupled to a Lohmann & Stolterfoht Navilus GVE 1500 A single-stage reduction gearbox via flexible couplings designed to automatically disengage if the propellers are blocked by ice. However, each propeller shaft is also fitted with a heavy flywheel in diameter and in thickness to increase rotational inertia and absorb shocks from propeller-ice interaction. Unlike the other Canadian offshore icebreakers built in the 1980s, Terry Fox does not have a propeller nozzles to shroud her propellers. Her LIPS Canada nickel aluminium bronze controllable pitch propellers are designed to transmit of power per shaft to the water and produce a combined static bollard pull of about . For onboard electricity production, the ship has two Caterpillar 3512 series ship service diesel generators and a single Caterpillar 3406 DITA emergency diesel generator. In addition, both reduction gearboxes are fitted with clutched power take-offs for 1,250kVa shaft alternators that supply power to the stern thruster and air bubbling system compressors. In line with her original Canadian Arctic Shipping Pollution Prevention Regulations (CASPPR) Arctic Class 4 rating, Terry Fox is designed to break at least first-year level ice with a continuous speed of . During icebreaking operations, the ice friction is reduced by lubricating the hull-ice interface with a low-pressure air bubbling system developed by W√§rtsil√§. In open water, the system can also act as a bow thruster and used for maneuvering together with the ship's single centerline rudder and a transverse stern thruster. When operating in ice-free waters, the ship was designed transit at an economical speed of about with just two main engines, but her maximum speed is quoted as .

Twelve wells alone were drilled in the Amauligak prospect, the most significant oil and gas field discovered in the region, but the high expectations for the Beaufort Sea were not met: the area was characterized by a large number of small, widely scattered resources. Molikpaq was mothballed after completing the last well in 1990.Callow, L. (2013): Oil and Gas Exploration & Development Activity Forecast - Canadian Beaufort Sea 2013‚Äì2028.

On 1 November 1991, Terry Fox was leased to the Canadian Coast Guard for two years to replace the decommissioned during the extensive modernization of . During the leasing period, the icebreaker was found to meet Canadian Coast Guard's needs satisfactorily, and the vessel was purchased from Gulf Canada Resources on 1 November 1993. Around the same time, the majority of BeauDril's fleet was purchased by Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the drilling subsidiary of Dome Petroleum (later Amoco Canada) that had been Gulf Canada's main competitor in the Beaufort Sea for more than a decade. = CCGS Terry Fox (1991‚Äìpresent) = Under the Canadian Coast Guard, CCGS Terry Fox is classified as a heavy icebreaker. She is homeported in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador and operates in the Gulf of St. Lawrence during the winter ice season and in Canada's eastern Arctic during the summer shipping season, assisting in escorting the annual Arctic summer sealift to coastal communities. In 2014, Terry Fox and Louis S. St-Laurent travelled to the Canadian Arctic to map the undersea continental shelf. In August, they became the first Canadian government ships to reach the North Pole in 20 years. Terry Fox ran aground in April 2018 near Bide Arm but managed to return to port under her own power. While Terry Fox has been scheduled for decommissioning in 2020, the repeated delays of the proposed polar icebreaker may postpone this. , the Canadian Coast Guard has no other newbuilding plans approved as a potential replacement for the 1983-built heavy icebreaker.

It was commissioned by the Carolingian king Charlemagne and his wife Hildegard on October 7, 781 and completed on April 30, 783.De Hamel (1986), 45. The Evangelistary is the earliest known manuscript produced at the scriptorium in Charlemagne's Court School in Aachen.Stockstad (1986), 117. The manuscript was intended to commemorate Charlemagne's march to Italy, his meeting with Pope Adrian I, and the baptism of his son Pepin. The crediting of the work to Godescalc and the details of Charlemagne's march are contained in the manuscript's dedication poem. Description The manuscript, a product of the Carolingian Renaissance, is the earliest example of a Carolingian illumination style. This style was characterized by naturalist motifs in the decoration, and a fusion of Insular Anglo-Saxon/Irish, early Christian (late Classical) and Byzantine styles. The ornamental motifs on the opening page of each Gospel rely heavily on the interlaces of Hiberno-Saxon origin.Zarnecki (1975), 119. The portraits of the Evangelists and Christ are based on Byzantine models, such as the mosaics of San Vitale at Ravenna.Zarnecki (1975), 120. The artist used natural illusionistic techniques to create the appearance of volume in the characters, and used elaborate shadings in light and dark to give characters depth. The Carolingian illumination style was the earliest style to regularly utilize Caroline minuscule script, the precursor to our modern lower case letters. The Godescalc Evangelistary is illuminated in the same style as the Dagulf Psalter. Both manuscripts seem to belong in a group of works known as the ‚ÄúAda School‚Äù or Court School of Charlemagne.De Hamel (1986), 45-46. Contents The Godescalc Evangelistary outlines prayer services and contains selections from the Gospels designed to be read at Mass through the liturgical year.Stockstad (1986), 117. The content of the Godescalc Evangelistary is a reminder of Charlemagne's intention to renew culture of the past rather than to create a new one.Robb (1973), 104. There was a movement to correct Psalters, Gospel books, and other works to provide easier understanding of texts that had become unclear over time.Robb (1973), 104. The Godescalc Evangelistary is written in gold and silver ink on purple vellum in uncial characters except the dedication, which is written in Caroline minuscule.Diringer (1967), 203. The codex is decorated by six miniature figures. The first four are Evangelist portraits, of the authors of the Gospels. The fifth is a Christ in Majesty. The sixth image is of the Fountain of Life, or fons vitae. Miniatures =The Four Evangelists= St. Luke with his symbol, the ox. He is one of the four Evangelists featured in the Godescalc Evangelistary. Like other gospel books, the Godescalc Evangelistary includes portraits of the four Evangelists. The number of Evangelists was settled c. 200 when Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons in Gaul decreed that the four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, were the Canonical Gospels. The four Evangelists‚Äô accounts were said to ‚Äútell the same, doctrinally correct story.‚ÄùKessler, in Brown (2006), 90. They are all pictured with their respective emblems in the miniatures. Each portrait features one of the Evangelists with a stylus and a book. This is symbolic of the power of God and gives the religious message a scholarly context. Through this presentation, the miniatures present the elevated value of learning which Charlemagne wished to convey through his campaign to reform education. Furthermore, all four Evangelists are looking up, away from their books. This is an ‚Äúiconographic motif‚Äù indicating inspiration.Nees, in Lowden and Bovey (2007), 22 This motif links the Godescalc figures to those of the Egino Codex, an example of the last remains of Lombard luxury art obtained in 774 with the conquering of the kingdom of the Lombards.Nees, in Lowden and Bovey (2007), 22. This is written as a comparison between Ambrose in the Egino Codex and St. Mark of the Godescalc Evangelistary. Nees argues that the Egino Codex was one of the few remaining examples of the lost Lombard production of luxury manuscripts that influenced Charlemagne and his counselors. He writes that the Carolingians adopted and elaborated on Lombard art to create their Carolingian art. =Christ in Majesty= Christ in Majesty; miniature of Jesus Christ in the Godescalc Evangelistary. The miniature of Christ in Majesty depicts a young Jesus Christ holding a book in his left arm and making the sign of a blessing with his right. The golden words etched behind Christ are strongly linked to the following text in the Evangelistary about Christ's life which includes the same words. Christ in Majesty was probably based on a famous painting known as the Acheropita, located in the Lateran Basilica in Rome.Kessler, in Brown (2006), 78. This is the same Lateran where Pope Adrian I baptized Charlemagne's son, Pepin. In its treatment of form, the miniature is elongated between shoulders and hip. This shows possible influence from the style of the icon of the Virgin crowned as Queen (also known as Queen of Heaven); located in the Santa Maria in Trastevere, executed for Pope John VII (705-707). The round face and the large eyes of the youthful Christ recall the image of the Virgin in the Mount Sinai icon.Stockstad (1986), 117. =St. John the Evangelist facing Christ in Majesty= St. John is given special status mainly because his portrait is placed on the same opening as that of Christ in Majesty (St. John the Evangelist on the left and Christ in Majesty on the right).Suggested in Kessler, in Brown (2006), 92. The two images present notable contrasts. Jesus sits on a cushioned bench whereas St. John is seated on a throne-like chair. The throne is traditionally regarded as a representation of the four Evangelists but it represents another layer of meaning in these images. The throne is also a representation of Charlemagne. Thus, St. John seated on a throne facing the image of Jesus Christ is a display of imperial authority presiding over Church.Morison (1972), 131. St. John is presented with a stylus that he is dipping in ink and pages which he will write on. Christ merely holds a closed book to his breast. The suggestion is that in Christ's life, he adds little creative content and does his job of conveying the message written by the Evangelists.Morison (1972), 132. =The Fountain of Life, fons vitae= The Fountain of Life (left), commemorating the baptism of Charlemagne's son Pepin faced by the Initial page to the Vigil for Christmas (right). The origin of the image of the Fountain of Life is much older than the Godescalc Evangelistary. Earlier examples come from Eastern manuscripts, where the fons vitae was a symbol of the Gospels as ‚Äúthe font of eternal life‚Äù.Gaehde (1976), 34. The meaning was modified in the Evangelistary and because of its placement and heading; the miniature refers to Christ's birth as the Fountain of Life.Gaehde (1976), 34. The Fountain of Life takes up a full page in the Evangelistary and is significantly located on the verso with Christ in a garden.Kessler, in Brown (2006), 88. The miniature contains a depiction of a shrine that is topped by a cross. The shrine's circular form with a conical roof is a reference to the Holy Sephulchre from the Crucifixion miniature in the Rabula Gospels.Robb (1973), 105. The shrine is a lively representation of the baptistery of the Lateran church in Rome.De Hamel (1986), 45. The heavenly image of the birds and plants employs the fountain ‚Äúas the source of the four rivers of paradise‚Äù,Stockstad (1986), 118. which evokes the four Gospels. The peacocks are a symbol of immortality and the birds around them are waterfowls. The waterfowls are identified in Eastern theological commentaries as ‚Äúsymbols of the apostles‚Äî‚Äúfishers of men‚Äù‚Äî who look back at the cocks symbolizing the Old Testament prophets in whose sayings the coming of Christ was foretold.‚ÄùRobb (1973), 105. The deer is a hart, an animal traditionally linked to the baptismal ritual from the passage in Psalm 42:1 (quoted below from the King James version). It is symbolic of a human thirsting for salvation.Stockstad (1986), 119. ::As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.Robb (1973), 105. On the facing page to the Fountain of Life lies the Initial Page to the Vigil for Christmas. Presented in contrast to each other, the Fountain of Life offers colorful images while the lines of the periscope of the Vigil of Nativity Robb (1973), 105. provide a beautiful image of silver(now oxidized to black) and golden letters on a purple background, reading In illo tempore (Matt. 1:18-21).Robb (1973), 105. The golden letters and the golden words show a promise of a golden kingdom. Precious materials like gold were believed to be gifts of God in the Middle AgesGaehde (1976), 35. and Godescalc uses golden letters in his poem to emulate eternal life. The image of the Fountain of Life and the gold script on the facing page show the perceptions of eternal life in the Carolingian kingdom.Gaehde (1976), 35. Text and script The manuscript was written in gold and silver ink on 127 pages of purple parchment. Godescalc described his book in a dedication poem at the end of the Evangelistary: ::Golden words are painted [here] on purple pages, ::The Thunderer‚Äôs shining kingdoms of the starry heavens, ::Revealed in rose-red blood, disclose the joys of heaven, ::And the eloquence of God glittering with fitting brilliance ::Promises the splendid rewards of martyrdom to be gained. Dutton, in Brown (2006), 77. The gold and silver letters Godescalc uses show that the image of the letters is as important as the message they display. Silver and gold are long-lasting metals and their longevity is a reflection of the idea of an ‚Äúimage of the incarnate God‚Äù. The idea of words being as important as their physical depiction is rooted in John 1:1 where Saint John describes Christ as the Word. Hence, the iconography of Gospel books elaborated on the relationship between their physical grandeur and spiritual content.Kessler, in Brown (2006), 80. The manuscript is a key component in the reform of handwriting as it is the first to contain the new Carolingian minuscule script which became a fundamental theme in Carolingian book production thereafter.De Hamel (1986), 45. Purpose The Godescalc Evangelistary was an important part of Charlemagne's educational and ecclesiastical reforms. The manuscript was a preliminary attempt to standardize language in the Carolingian kingdom and this cultural achievement of replacing the Merovingian script was lasting. The Carolingian minuscule was so successful that after the year 800, most of France had adopted the new way of writing.Nordenfalk, in Grabar (1957), 137. Although the Evangelistary is named after Godescalc, the production involved a team of writers, editors, Godescalc himself (who was a poet and scribe), parchment makers, an illuminator, a painter, and a book binder.Schutz, Herbert, \\"The Carolingians in Central Europe, their history, arts, and architecture: cultural history of Central Europe, 750-900.\\" Leiden, Netherlands: Brill, 2004. Godescalc began a trend of luxuriously decorated Bible manuscripts in the Carolingian world. His Evangelistary was a richly decorated work worthy of matching the desires of the commissioning monarch. The Evangelistary offered not only a new alternative for illuminators and scribes of the Carolingian era, but a form of writing that would be adopted and stay in effect until today.Nordenfalk, in Grabar (1957), 137.

G. Wodehouse. He is the butler at Blandings Castle, seat of Lord Emsworth and his family, where he serves for over eighteen years. Inspiration Beach's name was inspired by Beach Road, a road in the town of Emsworth, England, that leads to the seashore. The road is located near a cottage called Threepwood, which Wodehouse rented in the early 1900s. Background and character Like all butlers in properly run Edwardian homes, Beach is always known by his surname. He is a heavy-set man, whose favourite pastime is drinking port in the pantry, though he occasionally switches to brandy during crises. He has a pleasant singing voice, a mellow baritone reminiscent of a cask of very old, dry sherry. He is somewhat more emotional than Wodehouse's other famous domestic servant, Jeeves, although, when in the company of his masters, Beach generally limits himself to a slightly raised eyebrow, even when strongly moved. According to Richard Usborne, Beach is a hypochondriac in Something Fresh and complains about corns, an ingrowing toenail, swollen joints, nervous headaches, and the lining of his stomach. However, this is not the case in the later books. Before joining the staff at Blandings, he was once employed by the somewhat eccentric Major-General Magnus. He has grown very proud of the castle and of its museum. A discerning man, he regrets Lady Constance's fondness for artistic types, finding their dress sense inappropriate. He is also very proud of the Hon. Galahad, who, in the general opinion of the Servants' Hall, sheds lustre on the Castle. He is very fond of Ronnie Fish, whom he has known from childhood and used to take fishing on the lake; he is particularly malleable to that youth's persuasions. Ever grateful for Ronnie's reliable racing tips, he is at one point persuaded to assist Ronnie in keeping the Empress of Blandings in a cottage in the woods. The strain on his conscience is, however, grave. He later repeats the feat, helping Fish load the pig into the dicky of his car. He has similar relationships with Angela, whom he has also known since her childhood and for whose entertainment he (quite convincingly) impersonated a hippopotamus, as well as with Millicent, who also sported in Beach's pantry when a child; he cut elephants out of paper for her and taught her tricks with pieces of string. His mother lives in Eastbourne; and his niece, Maudie, the bohemian of the family, ran away from home to become a barmaid at the old Criterion (where she was familiar with Galahad and Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe) under the name of Maudie Montrose; she later married several times before getting back together with her old flame \\"Tubby\\" Parsloe. As mentioned in Galahad at Blandings, Beach won a choir boys' bicycle race in his youth, and recently won the Market Blandings Darts Tournament. He inherits the library of thriller novels that Freddie Threepwood collected before his marriage. Appearances Beach plays some part in almost all of the Blandings stories. In early stories, such as Something Fresh and Leave It to Psmith, he is required to do little more than buttle, which he of course does with effortless dignity; in later works, he plays a more significant role in the action. He decides to give notice on one occasion, because of Lord Emsworth's beard, an admittedly dubious fixture which Beach fears will ruin Emsworth's respectability in the community. Since he cannot honorably criticise his employer while serving as a butler, Beach makes the painful decision to resign first, but is prevented from doing so by his master's decision to shave, in \\"Lord Emsworth Acts for the Best\\". He is placed in a similar position soon afterward, when Emsworth expects him to stand in the moonlight practising pig-calls, a practice he considers beneath his dignity, but is persuaded to overcome his foibles by the presence of young Angela, in \\"Pig-hoo-o-o-o-ey\\". His strength of character is sorely tested, when called upon by Ronnie Fish to help in his schemes involving the Empress, in Summer Lightning and Heavy Weather; he later does indeed resign, after shooting Rupert Baxter with an air gun. However, Emsworth cannot do without his butler, and he assures his faithful servant of continued employment, in \\"The Crime Wave at Blandings\\". He buttles on quietly through Uncle Fred in the Springtime and Full Moon, but returns to the fore in Pigs Have Wings, where not only does he celebrate a birthday, but he is also called on once again to assist in the affairs of the Empress and her challengers, feeding one of Parsloe-Parsloe's pigs when it has been kidnapped by Galahad, and moving it when its location has been discovered by the enemy camp. His pantry is the scene for several councils of war between Gally, Beach and Penelope Donaldson, while his niece Maudie pays a visit to the castle under an assumed name. In the later short \\"Sticky Wicket at Blandings\\", his position at the castle is again threatened, when Lady Constance decides he has become rather slow and wheezy in his old age, and considers replacing him with a younger, smarter butler. Her scheme is foiled after Gally persuades Beach to undertake a daring and dangerous night-time rescue of his master from the clutches of Colonel Fanshawe.

This is usually achieved by using two or more independent audio channels through a configuration of two or more loudspeakers (or stereo headphones) in such a way as to create the impression of sound heard from various directions, as in natural hearing. Thus the term \\"stereophonic\\" applies to so-called \\"quadraphonic\\" and \\"surround-sound\\" systems as well as the more common two-channel, two-speaker systems. It is often contrasted with monophonic, or \\"mono\\" sound, where audio is heard as coming from one position, often ahead in the sound field (analogous to a visual field). Stereo sound has been in common use since the 1970s in entertainment systems such as broadcast radio, TV, recorded music, internet, computer audio, and cinema. 250px Etymology The word stereophonic derives from the Greek (stere√≥s, \\"firm, solid\\")œÉœÑŒµœÅŒµœåœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library \\\\+ (ph≈çn·∏ó, \\"sound, tone, voice\\")œÜœâŒΩŒÆ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library and it was coined in 1927 by Western Electric, by analogy with the word \\"stereoscopic\\". Description Two microphones set up to record a piano simultaneously, which creates a stereo sound. Stereo sound systems can be divided into two forms: the first is \\"true\\" or \\"natural\\" stereo in which a live sound is captured, with any natural reverberation or ambience present, by an array of microphones. The signal is then reproduced over multiple loudspeakers to recreate, as closely as possible, the live sound. Secondly \\"artificial\\" or \\"pan-pot\\" stereo, in which a single-channel (mono) sound is reproduced over multiple loudspeakers. By varying the relative amplitude of the signal sent to each speaker an artificial direction (relative to the listener) can be suggested. The control which is used to vary this relative amplitude of the signal is known as a \\"pan-pot\\" (panoramic potentiometer). By combining multiple \\"pan-potted\\" mono signals together, a complete, yet entirely artificial, sound field can be created. In technical usage, true stereo means sound recording and sound reproduction that uses stereographic projection to encode the relative positions of objects and events recorded. During two-channel stereo recording, two microphones are placed in strategically chosen locations relative to the sound source, with both recording simultaneously. The two recorded channels will be similar, but each will have distinct time-of-arrival and sound-pressure-level information. During playback, the listener's brain uses those subtle differences in timing and sound level to triangulate the positions of the recorded objects. Stereo recordings often cannot be played on monaural systems without a significant loss of fidelity. Since each microphone records each wavefront at a slightly different time, the wavefronts are out of phase; as a result, constructive and destructive interference can occur if both tracks are played back on the same speaker. This phenomenon is known as phase cancellation. History Diagram of Cl√©ment Ader's th√©atrophone prototype at the Opera during the World Exhibition in Paris (1881) =Early work= \\"Wandering Dragon Plays with Phoenix\\" Part One of Twelve, possibly the earliest \\"accidental stereo\\", made as a field recording by Berthold Laufer for Franz Boaz in 1901. Cl√©ment Ader demonstrated the first two-channel audio system in Paris in 1881, with a series of telephone transmitters connected from the stage of the Paris Opera to a suite of rooms at the Paris Electrical Exhibition, where listeners could hear a live transmission of performances through receivers for each ear. Scientific American reported: :\\"Every one who has been fortunate enough to hear the telephones at the Palais de l'Industrie has remarked that, in listening with both ears at the two telephones, the sound takes a special character of relief and localization which a single receiver cannot produce.... This phenomenon is very curious, it approximates to the theory of binauricular audition, and has never been applied, we believe, before to produce this remarkable illusion to which may almost be given the name of auditive perspective.\\"\\"The Telephone at the Paris Opera\\", Scientific American, December 31, 1881, pages 422‚Äì23. This two-channel telephonic process was commercialized in France from 1890 to 1932 as the Th√©√¢trophone, and in England from 1895 to 1925 as the Electrophone. Both were services available by coin- operated receivers at hotels and caf√©s, or by subscription to private homes.\\"Court Circular\\", The Times (London), Nov. 6, 1895, p. 7. \\"Post Office Electrical Engineers. The Electrophone Service\\", The Times (London), Jan. 15, 1913, p. 24. \\"Wired Wireless\\", The Times (London), June 22, 1925, p. 8. There have also been cases in which two recording lathes (for the sake of producing two simultaneous masters) were fed from two separate microphones; when both masters survive, modern engineers have been able to synchronize them to produce stereo recordings from a time before stereophonic recording technology existed (e.g., Elgar Remastered, Somm CD 261, and Accidental Stereo, Pristine Classical CD PASC422). =Modern stereophonic sound= Modern stereophonic technology was invented in the 1930s by British engineer Alan Blumlein at EMI, who patented stereo records, stereo films, and also surround sound. In early 1931, Blumlein and his wife were at a local cinema. The sound reproduction systems of the early \\"talkies\\" invariably only had a single set of speakers - which could lead to the somewhat disconcerting effect of the actor being on one side of the screen whilst his voice appeared to come from the other. Blumlein declared to his wife that he had found a way to make the sound follow the actor across the screen. The genesis of these ideas is uncertain, but he explained them to Isaac Shoenberg in the late summer of 1931. His earliest notes on the subject are dated 25 September 1931, and his patent had the title \\"Improvements in and relating to Sound-transmission, Sound-recording and Sound-reproducing Systems\\". The application was dated 14 December 1931, and was accepted on 14 June 1933 as UK patent number 394,325. The patent covered many ideas in stereo, some of which are used today and some not. Some 70 claims include: * A \\"shuffling\\" circuit, which aimed to preserve the directional effect when sound from a spaced pair of microphones was reproduced via stereo headphones instead of a pair of loudspeakers; * The use of a coincident pair of velocity microphones with their axes at right angles to each other, which is still known as a \\"Blumlein Pair\\"; * Recording two channels in the single groove of a record using the two groove walls at right angles to each other and 45 degrees to the vertical; * A stereo disc-cutting head; * Using hybrid transformers to matrix between left and right signals and sum and difference signals; Blumlein began binaural experiments as early as 1933, and the first stereo discs were cut later the same year, twenty-five years before that method became the standard for stereo phonograph discs. These discs used the two walls of the groove at right angles in order to carry the two channels. Much of the development work on this system for cinematic use did not reach completion until 1935. In Blumlein's short test films (most notably, \\"Trains at Hayes Station\\", which lasts 5 minutes 11 seconds, and, \\"The Walking & Talking Film\\"), his original intent of having the sound follow the actor was fully realised.Robert Alexander (2013). \\"The Inventor of Stereo: The Life and Works of Alan Dower Blumlein\\". p. 83. CRC Press, In 1934, Blumlein recorded Mozart's Jupiter Symphony conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham at Abbey Road Studios in London using his vertical-lateral technique. In the United States, Harvey Fletcher of Bell Laboratories was also investigating techniques for stereophonic recording and reproduction. One of the techniques investigated was the \\"wall of sound\\", which used an enormous array of microphones hung in a line across the front of an orchestra. Up to 80 microphones were used, and each fed a corresponding loudspeaker, placed in an identical position, in a separate listening room. Several stereophonic test recordings, using two microphones connected to two styli cutting two separate grooves on the same wax disc, were made with Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra at Philadelphia's Academy of Music in March 1932. The first (made on March 12, 1932), of Scriabin's Prometheus: Poem of Fire, is the earliest known surviving intentional stereo recording.Fox, Barry ). \\"A hundred years of stereo: fifty of hi-fi\\", p 911. Scientific American, December 24‚Äì31, 1981. Retrieved March 1, 2012. The performance was part of an all Russian program including Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition in the Ravel orchestration, excerpts of which were also recorded in stereo. See: Stokowski, Harvey Fletcher, and the Bell Labs Experimental Recordings, stokowski.org, rccessed March 1, 2012. Bell Laboratories gave a demonstration of three- channel stereophonic sound on April 27, 1933, with a live transmission of the Philadelphia Orchestra from Philadelphia to Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. over multiple Class A telephone lines. Leopold Stokowski, normally the orchestra's conductor, was present in Constitution Hall to control the sound mix. Five years later, the same system would be expanded onto multichannel film recording and used from the concert hall in Philadelphia to the recording labs at Bell Labs in New Jersey in order to record Walt Disney's Fantasia (1940) in what Disney called Fantasound. Bell Labs demonstration of stereo at World's Fair Later that same year, Bell Labs also demonstrated binaural sound, at the Chicago World's Fair in 1933 using a dummy with microphones instead of ears, .B.B. Bauer, \\"Some Techniques Toward Better Stereophonic Perspective\\", IEEE Transactions on Audio, May‚ÄìJune 1963, p. 89. The two signals were sent out over separate AM station bands.\\"Radio Adds Third Dimension\\", Popular Science, Jan. 1953, p. 106. =Carnegie Hall demonstration= Utilizing selections recorded by the Philadelphia Orchestra, under the direction of Leopold Stokowski, intended for but not used in Walt Disney's Fantasia, the Carnegie Hall demonstration by Bell Laboratories on April 9 and 10, 1940, used three huge speaker systems. Synchronization was achieved by making the recordings in the form of three motion picture soundtracks recorded on a single piece of film with a fourth track being used to regulate volume expansion. This was necessary due to the limitations of dynamic range on optical motion picture film of the period, however the volume compression and expansion were not fully automatic, but were designed to allow manual studio \\"enhancement\\"; i.e., the artistic adjustment of overall volume and the relative volume of each track in relation to the others. Stokowski, who was always interested in sound reproduction technology personally participated in the \\"enhancement\\" of the sound at the demonstration. The speakers produced sound levels of up to 100 decibels, and the demonstration held the audience \\"spellbound, and at times not a little terrified\\", according to one report.\\"Sound Waves 'Rock' Carnegie Hall as 'Enhanced Music' is Played\\", The New York Times, April 10, 1940, p. 25. Sergei Rachmaninoff, who was present at the demonstration, commented that it was \\"marvellous\\" but \\"somehow unmusical because of the loudness.\\" \\"Take that Pictures at an Exhibition\\", he said. \\"I didn't know what it was until they got well into the piece. Too much 'enhancing', too much Stokowski.\\" =Motion picture era= In 1937, Bell Laboratories in New York City gave a demonstration of two-channel stereophonic motion pictures, developed by Bell Labs and Electrical Research Products, Inc.\\"New Sound Effects Achieved in Film\\", The New York Times, Oct. 12, 1937, p. 27. Once again, conductor Leopold Stokowski was on hand to try out the new technology, recording onto a special proprietary nine-track sound system at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia, during the making of the movie One Hundred Men and a Girl for Universal Pictures in 1937, after which the tracks were mixed down to one for the final soundtrack.Nelson B. Bell, \\"Rapid Strides are Being Made in Development of Sound Track\\", The Washington Post, April 11, 1937, p. TR1.Motion Picture Herald, September 11, 1937, p. 40. A year later, MGM started using three tracks instead of one to record the musical selections of movie soundtracks, and very quickly upgraded to four. One track was used for dialogue, two for music, and one for sound effects. The purpose for this form of multitrack recording was to make mixing down to a single optical track easier and was not intended to be a recording for stereophonic purposes. The very first two-track recording MGM made (although released in mono) was \\"It Never Rains But What It Pours\\" by Judy Garland, recorded on June 21, 1938, for the movie Love Finds Andy Hardy. =Fantasound= Walt Disney began experimenting with multichannel sound in the early 1930s as noted above.T. Holman, Surround Sound: Up and Running, Second Edition, Elsevier, Focal Press (2008), 240 pp. The first commercial motion picture to be exhibited with stereophonic sound was Walt Disney's Fantasia, released in November 1940, for which a specialized sound process (Fantasound) was developed. As in the Carnegie Hall demonstrations six months earlier, Fantasound used a separate film containing four optical sound tracks. Three of the tracks were used to carry left, center and right audio, while the fourth track carried three tones which individually controlled the volume level of the other three.Andrew R. Boone, \\"Mickey Mouse Goes Classical\\", Popular Science, January 1941, p. 65.\\"Fantasound\\" by W.E, Garity and J.N.A.Hawkins. Journal of the SMPE Vol 37 August 1941 The film was not a financial success, however, and after two months of road-show exhibition in selected cities, its soundtrack was remixed into mono sound for general release. It was not until its 1956 re-release that stereo sound was restored to the film. In the early 1940s, composer-conductor Alfred Newman directed the construction of a sound stage equipped for multichannel recording for 20th Century Fox studios. Several soundtracks from this era still exist in their multichannel elements, some of which have been released on DVD, including How Green Was My Valley, Anna and the King of Siam, The Day the Earth Stood Still and Sun Valley Serenade which, along with Orchestra Wives, feature the only stereophonic recordings of the Glenn Miller Orchestra as it was during its heyday of the Swing Era. =Cinerama= Motion picture theatres, however, are where the real introduction of stereophonic sound to the public occurred. Amid great fanfare, Stereo sound was officially proven commercially viable for the public on September 30, 1952 with the release of a Cinerama demonstration film by Lowell Thomas and Mike Todd titled This is Cinerama. The format was a spectacular widescreen process featuring three separate 35mm motion picture films (plus a separate sound film) running in synchronization with one another at 26 fps, adding one picture panel each to the viewer's left and right at 45-degree angles, in addition to the usual front and center panel, creating a truly immersive panoramic visual experience, comparable in some ways to today's curved screen IMAX OMNI. Similarly, the Cinerama audio soundtrack technology, developed by Hazard E. Reeves, a pioneer in magnetic recording, utilized seven discrete sound tracks on full-coat magnetic 35mm film, in order to envelop the theatregoer in an aural experience just as spectacular as that playing on the screen: five main channels behind the screen, two surround channels in the rear of the theater, plus a sync-track to interlock the 4 machines, which were specially outfitted with aircraft servo-motors made by Ampex. The advent of multitrack magnetic tape and film recording made high fidelity synchronized multichannel recording more technically straightforward, though costly. By the early 1950s, all of the major studios were recording on 35mm magnetic film for mixing purposes, and many of these so-called individual angles still survive, allowing for soundtracks to be remixed into Stereo or even Surround. In April 1953, while This is Cinerama was still playing only in New York City, most moviegoing audiences heard stereophonic sound for the first time with House of Wax, an early 3-D film starring Vincent Price and produced by Warner Bros. Unlike the 4-track mag release-print stereo films of the period which featured four thin strips of magnetic material running down the length of the film, inside and outside the sprocket holes, the sound system developed for House of Wax, dubbed WarnerPhonic, was a combination of a 35 mm fully coated magnetic film that contained the audio tracks for Left-Center-Right, interlocked with the two dual-strip Polaroid system projectors, one of which carried a mono optical surround track and one that carried a mono backup track, should anything go wrong. Only two other films featured this strange hybrid WarnerPhonic sound: the 3-D production of The Charge at Feather River, and Island in the Sky. Unfortunately, as of 2012, the stereo magnetic tracks to both these films are considered lost forever. In addition, a large percentage of 3-D films carried variations on three-track magnetic sound: It Came from Outer Space; I, the Jury; The Stranger Wore a Gun; Inferno; Kiss Me, Kate; and many others. =Widescreen= Inspired by Cinerama, the movie industry moved quickly to create simpler and cheaper widescreen systems, the first of which, Todd-AO, was developed by Broadway promoter Michael Todd with financial backing from Rodgers and Hammerstein, to use a single 70mm film running at 30 frames per second with 6 magnetic sound tracks, for their screen presentation of \\"Oklahoma!\\". Major Hollywood studios immediately rushed to create their own unique formats, such as Warner Bros. Panavision, Paramount Pictures' VistaVision and Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation's CinemaScope, the latter of which used up to four separate magnetic sound tracks. VistaVision took a simplified, low-cost approach to stereophonic sound; its Perspecta system featured only a monaural track, but through subaudible tones, it could change the direction of the sound to come from the left, right or both directions at once. Because of the standard 35 mm-size film, CinemaScope and its stereophonic sound was capable of being retrofitted into existing theaters. CinemaScope 55 was created by the same company in order to use a larger form of the system (55 mm instead of 35 mm) to allow for greater image clarity onscreen, and was supposed to have had 6-track stereo instead of four. However, because the film needed a new, specially designed projector, the system proved impractical, and the two films made in the process, Carousel and The King and I, were released in 35 mm CinemaScope reduction prints. To compensate, the premiere engagement of Carousel used a six-track magnetic full-coat in an interlock, and a 1961 re-release of The King and I, featured the film \\"printed down\\" to 70 mm, used a six-track stereo soundtrack as well. Eventually, 50 complete sets of combination 55/35 mm projectors and \\"penthouse\\" reproducers were completed and delivered by Century and Ampex, respectively, and 55 mm release print sounding equipment was delivered by Western Electric. Several samples of 55 mm sound prints can be found in the Sponable Collection at the Film and Television Archives at Columbia University. The subsequently abandoned 55/35 mm Century projector eventually became the Century JJ 70/35MM projector. =Todd-AO= After this disappointing experience with their proprietary \\"wide gauge\\" system, Fox purchased the Todd-AO system and re-engineered it into a more modern 24 fps system with brand-new 65MM self-blimped production cameras (Mitchell BFC ... \\"Blimped Fox Camera\\") and brand-new 65MM MOS cameras (Mitchell FC ... \\"Fox Camera\\") and brand-new Super Baltar lenses in a wide variety of focal lengths, first employed on South Pacific. Essentially, although Todd-AO was also available to others, the format became Fox's premier origination and presentation apparatus, replacing CinemaScope 55. Current DVDs of the two CinemaScope 55 feature titles were transferred from the original 55mm negatives, often including the separate 35MM films as extras for comparison. =Back to mono= However, beginning in 1957, films recorded in stereo (except for those shown in Cinerama or Todd-AO) carried an alternate mono track for theatres not ready or willing to re-equip for stereo. From then until about 1975, when Dolby Stereo was used for the first time in films, most motion pictures‚Äîeven some from which stereophonic soundtrack albums were made, such as Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet‚Äîwere still released in monaural sound, stereo being reserved almost exclusively for expensive musicals such as West Side Story, My Fair Lady, or Camelot; epics such as Ben-Hur or Cleopatra. Stereo was also reserved for dramas with a strong reliance on sound effects or music, such as The Graduate, with its Simon and Garfunkel score. =Dolby Stereo= Today, virtually all films are released in stereophonic sound as the Westrex Stereo Variable-Area system developed in 1977 for Star Wars, which was no more expensive to manufacture in stereo than it was for mono. The format employs the same Western Electric/Westrex/Nuoptix RA-1231 recorder, and coupled with QS quadraphonic matrixing technology licensed to Dolby Labs from Sansui, this SVA system can produce the same Left, Center, Right and Surround sound of the original CinemaScope system of 1953 by using a single standard- width optical track. This important development finally brought stereo sound to so-called \\"flat\\" (non-anamorphic) widescreen films, most commonly projected at aspect ratios of 1.75:1 or 1.85:1. Producers often took advantage of the six magnetic soundtracks available for 70mm film release prints, and productions shot in either 65MM or to save money, in 35MM and then blown up to 70MM. In these instances, the 70MM prints would be mixed for stereo, while the 35MM reduction prints would be remixed for mono. Some films shot in 35MM, such as Camelot, featured four-track stereophonic sound and were then \\"blown-up\\" to 70MM so that they could be shown on a giant screen with six-track stereophonic sound. Unfortunately however, many of these presentations were only pseudo stereo, utilizing a somewhat artificial six-track panning method. A process known somewhat derogatorily as the \\"Columbia Spread\\" was often used to synthesize Left Center and Right Center from a combination of Left and Center and Right and Center, respectively, or, for effects, the effect could be \\"panned\\" anywhere across the five stage speakers using a one-in/five-out pan pot. Dolby, who did not approve of this practice, which results in loss of separation, instead used the Left Centre and Right Centre channels for LFE (low-frequency enhancement) utilizing the bass units of the otherwise redundant intermediate front speakers, and later the unused HF capacity of these channels to provide for stereo surround in place of the mono surround. Dolby Stereo was succeeded by Dolby Digital 5.1 in the cinema, which retained the Dolby Stereo 70mm 5.1 channel layout, and more recently with the introduction of digital cinema, Dolby Surround 7.1 and Dolby Atmos in 2010 and 2012 respectively. Modern home audio and video Domestic stereo system, having two speakers. The progress of stereophonic sound was paced by the technical difficulties of recording and reproducing two or more channels in synchronization with one another, and by the economic and marketing issues of introducing new audio media and equipment. A stereo system cost up to twice as much as a monophonic system, since a stereo system contains two preamplifiers, two amplifiers, and two speaker systems. In addition, the user would need an FM stereo tuner, to upgrade any tape recorder to a stereo model, and to have their phonograph fitted with a stereo cartridge. In the early days it was not clear whether consumers would think the sound was so much better as to be worth twice the price. Stereo experiments on disc =Early lateral, vertical and double-sided stereo= Edison had been recording in a hill-and- dale or vertically modulated format on his cylinders and discs since 1877, and Berliner had been recording in a side-to-side or lateral format since shortly thereafter. Each format developed on its own trajectory until the late 1920s when electric recording on disc, utilizing a microphone surpassed acoustic recording where the performer needed to shout or play very loudly into what basically amounted to a megaphone in reverse. At that time, AM radio had been around for roughly a decade, and broadcasters were looking for both better materials from which to make phonograph records as well as a better format in which to record them to play over the narrow and thus inherently noisy radio channel. As radio had been playing the same shellac discs available to the public, it was found that, even though the playback system was now electric rather than acoustic, the surface noise on the disc would mask the music after just a few plays. The development of acetate, bakelite, and vinyl, and the production of radio broadcast transcriptions helped to solve this. Once these considerably quieter compounds were developed, it was discovered that the rubber-idler-wheel driven turntables of the period had a great deal of low- frequency rumble - but only in the lateral plane. So, even though with all other factors being equal, the lateral plane of recording on disc had the higher fidelity, it was decided to record vertically to produce higher- fidelity recordings on these new 'silent-surface' materials, for two reasons, the increase in fidelity and the incompatibility with home phonographs which, with their lateral-only playback systems would only produce silence from a vertically modulated disc. After 33 RPM recording had been perfected for the movies in 1927, the speed of radio program transcriptions was reduced to match, once again to inhibit playback of the discs on normal home consumer equipment. Even though the stylus size remained the same as consumer records at either 3 mils or 2.7 mils, the disc size was increased from 12-inches to the same 16-inches as those used in early talking pictures in order to prevent the practice even further. Now, not only could the records not be played on home equipment due to incompatible recording format and speed, they wouldn't even fit on the player either, which suited the copyright holders. =Two- channel high fidelity and other experiments= During the same period engineers got a bright idea. Split the signal into two parts, bass and treble, and record the treble on its own track near the edge of the disc in a lateral format so that there would be no high-frequency distortion, and then record the bass on its own track in a vertical fashion to get rid of the rumble. Unfortunately, vertical grooves take up more space than lateral grooves; so when the bass track was full, starting halfway through the disc and ending up at the center, the treble track had a large amount of unused space at the end. The alternative was to record it at a wider pitch i.e. lines-per-inch in order to match up with the bass track and keep both styli in the same place, limiting the playing time to slightly longer than a single even at 33 RPM on a 12-inch disc. Another failed experiment in the late 1920s and early '30s involved recording the left channel on the left side of the disc (when held vertically with its edge facing the user) and recording the right channel on the right side of the disc. These were manufactured on twin film-company recording lathes which ran in perfect sync with one another with no variation, and were capable of, not only outside-in as well as inside-out recordings (see Radio Programming Vinyl Sequence under Gramophone record), but also counter- clockwise as well as conventional clockwise recording by mounting the cutting head wrong-way-out with a special adapter. One master was recorded conventionally and the other was recorded counterclockwise, each master was run separately through the plating process, lined up to match, and subsequently mounted in a press. This recording method was later used to record counter-clockwise discs by Mattel for one of its answers to the GAF Talking View Master in the mid-60s. The dual-sided stereo disc was then played vertically, first in a system that featured two tonearms on the same post facing one another, and later on in an offset system where one tonearm was placed conventionally and the other tonearm was placed opposite, i.e. not only on the other side of the mechanism, but facing the other way as well so that both tonearms could start at the edge and play to the center. But, even with playing the disc vertically in a rotating clamp, the same trouble was observed with keeping the two tonearms in their respective synchronous revolutions. The system was developed further however and adapted so that a single tonearm could play one side of a record or the other in jukeboxes of the late 1930s and early '40s. Five years later, Bell Labs was experimenting with a two- channel Lateral-Vertical system, where the left channel was recorded laterally and the right channel was recorded vertically, still utilizing a standard 3-mil 78-RPM groove, over three times larger than the modern LP stylus of the late 20th Century. The trouble with that was, once again, all the low- frequency rumble was in the left channel and all the high-frequency distortion was in the right channel. Over a quarter of a century later, it was decided to tilt the recording head 45 degrees off to the right side so that both the low frequency rumble and high frequency distortion were shared equally by both channels, producing the 45/45 system we know today. =Emory Cook= In 1952, Emory Cook (1913‚Äì2002), who already had become famous by designing new feedback disk-cutter heads to improve sound from tape to vinyl, took the two- channel high-fidelity system described above and developed a somewhat misnamed \\"binaural\\" record out of it, which consisted of the same two separate channels cut into two separate groups of grooves running next to each other as described above, i.e. one running from the edge of the disc to halfway through and the other starting at the halfway point and ending up towards the label, but he used two lateral grooves with a 500 Hz crossover in the inner track to try and compensate for the lower fidelity and high frequency distortion on the inner track. Each groove needed its own monophonic needle and cartridge on its own branch of tonearm, and each needle was connected to a separate amplifier and speaker. This setup was intended to give a demonstration at a New York audio fair of Cook's cutter heads rather than to sell the record; but soon afterward, the demand for such recordings and the equipment to play it grew, and Cook Records began to produce such records commercially. Cook recorded a vast array of sounds, ranging from railroad sounds to thunderstorms.The term \\"binaural\\" that Cook used should not be confused with the modern use of the word, where \\"binaural\\" is an inner-ear recording using small microphones placed in the ear. Cook used conventional microphones, but used the same word, \\"binaural\\", that Alan Blumlein had used for his experimental stereo records almost 20 years earlier. By 1953, Cook had a catalog of about 25 stereo records for sale to audiophiles.\\"Commercial Binaural Sound Not Far Off\\", Billboard, Oct. 24, 1953, p. 15. Magnetic tape recording The first stereo recordings using magnetic tape were made in Germany in the early 1940s using Magnetophon recorders. Around 300 recordings were made of various symphonies, most of which were seized by the Red Army at the end of World War II. The recordings were of relatively high fidelity, thanks to the discovery of AC bias. A 1944 recording of Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 8 directed by Herbert von Karajan and the Orchester der Berliner Staatsoper and a 1944 or 1945 recording of Walter Gieseking playing Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (with flak fire audible in the background) are the only recordings still known to exist. In the US, stereo magnetic tape recording was demonstrated on standard 1/4-inch tape for the first time in 1952, using two sets of recording and playback heads, upside-down and offset from one another.\\"Adventures in Sound\\", Popular Mechanics, September 1952, p. 216. A year later, Remington Records began recording a number of its sessions in stereo, including performances by Thor Johnson and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. Later that same year, more experimental stereo recordings were conducted with Leopold Stokowski and a group of New York studio musicians at RCA Victor Studios in New York City. In February 1954, the label also recorded a performance of Berlioz' masterpiece The Damnation of Faust by the Boston Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Charles Munch, the success of which led to the practice of regularly recording sessions in stereo. Shortly afterwards, RCA Victor recorded the last two NBC Radio broadcast concerts by famed conductor Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra, on stereophonic magnetic tape, however they were never officially released, though they have long been available on pirated LPs and CDs. In the UK, Decca Records began recording sessions in stereo in mid-1954, and by that time even smaller labels in the U.S. such as Concertapes, Bel Canto and Westminster along with major labels such as RCA Victor began releasing stereophonic recordings on two-track prerecorded reel-to-reel magnetic tape, priced at twice or three times the cost of monaural recordings, which retailed for around $2.95 to $3.95 apiece for a standard monaural LP. Even two-track monaural tape which had to be flipped over halfway through and carried exactly the same information as the monaural LP - but without the crackles and pops - were being sold for $6.95.\\"Tape Trade Group to Fix Standards\\", Billboard, July 10, 1954, p. 34. The additional cost of stereo sound must be weighed against the economy of the time. In 1954 United States, the average weekly salary was $60. Apartment rent approximated $75‚Äì$100 a month for a two-room. Therefore, many of the two-track stereo tape recordings of the period were priced at a premium, upwards of $12.95-$18.95 a piece. A full-length album, when the corresponding mono LP was only $3.95, was cost prohibitive. In addition, the price of the stereophonic recorder upon which to play the records may have been equal to, or greater than, the cost of a new car. However, audiophiles, with little or no regard for the cost, bought them and the players anyway, and stereophonic sound came to at least a select few living rooms of the mid-1950s.\\"Hi-Fi: Two-Channel Commotion\\", The New York Times, November 17, 1957, p. XX1. Stereo recording became widespread in the music business by the 3rd quarter of 1957. Stereo on disc Label and sleeve from Audio Fidelity Records' second stereo demonstration record, ca. 1958. In November 1957, the small Audio Fidelity Records label released the first mass- produced stereophonic disc. Sidney Frey, founder and president, had Westrex engineers, owners of one of the two rival stereo disk-cutting systems, cut a disk for release before any of the major record labels could do so. Side 1 featured the Dukes of Dixieland, and Side 2 featured railroad and other sound effects designed to engage and envelop the listener. This demonstration disc was introduced to the public on December 13, 1957 at the Times Auditorium in New York City.\\"Mass Produced Stereo Disc is Demonstrated,\\" Billboard, Dec. 16, 1957, p. 27. Only 500 copies of this initial demonstration record were pressed and three days later, Frey advertised in Billboard Magazine that he would send a free copy to anyone in the industry who wrote to him on company letterhead.Audio Fidelity advertisement, Billboard, Dec. 16, 1957, p. 33.\\"Mass Produced Stereo Disk is Demonstrated\\", Billboard, Dec. 16, 1957, p. 27. The move generated such a great deal of publicityAlfred R. Zipser, \\"Stereophonic Sound Waiting for a Boom\\", The New York Times, August 24, 1958, p. F1. that early stereo phonograph dealers were forced to demonstrate on Audio Fidelity Records. Also in December 1957, Bel Canto Records, another small label, produced its own stereophonic demonstration disc on multicolored vinyl so that stereo dealers would have more than one choice for demonstration. With the supplied special turntables featuring a clear platter lighted from underneath to show off the color as well as the sound, the stunt worked even better for Bel Canto, whose roster of jazz, easy listening and lounge music, pressed onto their trademark Caribbean-blue vinyl sold well throughout 1958 and early into 1959. =Affordable cartridges= When Audio Fidelity released its stereophonic demonstration disc, there was no affordable magnetic cartridge on the market capable of playing it. After the release of other demonstration discs and the respective libraries from which they were culled, the other spur to the popularity of stereo discs was the reduction in price of a stereo cartridge, for playing the discs‚Äìfrom $250 to $29.95 in June 1958.\\"Audio Fidelity Bombshell Had Industry Agog\\", Billboard, Dec. 22, 1962, p. 36.

By the end of March, the company had four more stereo LPs available, interspersed with several Bel Canto releases.\\"CBS Discloses Stereo Step,\\" Billboard, March 31, 1958, p. 9. Although both monaural as well as stereo LP records were manufactured for the first ten years of stereo on disc, the major record labels issued their last monaural albums in 1968, relegating the format to 45 RPM singles, flexidiscs and radio promotional materials which continued until 1975.Sylvan Fox, \\"Disks Today: New Sounds and Technology Spin Long-Playing Record of Prosperity\\", The New York Times, August 28, 1967, p. 35.RCA Victor Red Seal Labelography (1950‚Äì1967).\\"Mfrs.

Early broadcasting =Radio= In December 1925, the BBC's experimental transmitting station, 5XX, in Daventry, Northamptonshire, made radio's first stereo broadcast‚Äîa concert from Manchester, conducted by Sir Hamilton Harty‚Äîwith 5XX broadcasting the right channel nationally by long wave and local BBC stations broadcasting the left channel by medium wave. The BBC repeated the experiment in 1926, using 2LO in London and 5XX at Daventry. Following experimental FM stereo transmissions in the London area in 1958 and regular Saturday morning demonstration transmissions using TV sound and medium wave (AM) radio to provide the two channels, the first regular BBC transmissions using an FM stereo signal began on the BBC's Third Programme network on August 28, 1962.Start of experimental stereo broadcasting 28 August 1962, BBC Chicago AM radio station WGN (and its sister FM station, WGNB) collaborated on an hourlong stereophonic demonstration broadcast on May 22, 1952, with one audio channel broadcast by the AM station and the other audio channel by the FM station.W-G-N and WGNB to Unveil New 'Visual' Sound\\", The Chicago Tribune, May 19, 1952, p.

The Legacy of Broadcast Stereo Sound. Journal of Sonic Studies. Oct. 2012 at http://journal.sonicstudies.org/vol03/nr01/a03 With the advent of FM stereo in 1961, a small number of music-oriented TV shows were broadcast with stereo sound using a process called simulcasting, in which the audio portion of the show was carried over a local FM stereo station.For example: Jack Gould, \\"TV: Happy Marriage With FM Stereo\\", The New York Times, Dec. 26, 1967, p. 67. In the 1960s and 1970s, these shows were usually manually synchronized with a reel-to-reel tape delivered by mail to the FM station (unless the concert or music originated locally). In the 1980s, satellite delivery of both television and radio programs made this fairly tedious process of synchronization unnecessary. One of the last of these simulcast programs was Friday Night Videos on NBC, just before MTS stereo was approved by the FCC. The BBC made extensive use of simulcasting between 1974 and around 1990. The first such transmission was in 1974, when the BBC broadcast a recording of Van Morrison's London Rainbow Concert simultaneously on BBC2 TV and Radio 2. After that it was used for many other music programmes, live and recorded, including the annual BBC Promenade concerts and the Eurovision Song Contest. The advent of NICAM stereo sound with TV rendered this unnecessary. Cable TV systems delivered many stereo programs utilizing this method for many years until prices for MTS stereo modulators dropped. One of the first stereo cable stations was The Movie Channel, though the most popular cable TV station that drove up usage of stereo simulcasting was MTV. Japanese television began multiplex (stereo) sound broadcasts in 1978,\\"Japan's Stereo TV System\\", The New York Times, June 16, 1984. and regular transmissions with stereo sound came in 1982.Chronomedia: 1982. By 1984, about 12% of the programming, or about 14 or 15 hours per station per week, made use of the multiplex technology. West Germany's second television network, ZDF, began offering stereo programs in 1984. =MTS: Stereo for television= In 1979, The New York Times reported, \\"What has prompted the [television] industry to embark on establishing high-fidelity [sound] standards now, according to engineering executives involved in the project, is chiefly the rapid march of the new television technologies, especially those that are challenging broadcast television, such as the video disk.\\"Les Brown, \\"Hi-fi Stereo TV Coming in 2 to 4 Years\\", The New York Times, Oct. 25, 1979, p. C-18. Multichannel television sound, better known as MTS (often still as BTSC, for the Broadcast Television Systems Committee that created it), is the method of encoding three additional audio channels into an NTSC-format audio carrier. It was adopted by the FCC as the United States standard for stereo television transmission in 1984. Sporadic network transmission of stereo audio began on NBC on July 26, 1984, with The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson‚Äîalthough at the time, only the network's New York City flagship station, WNBC, had stereo broadcast capability.Peter W. Kaplan, \\"TV Notes\\", New York Times, July 28, 1984, sec. 1, p. 46. Regular stereo transmission of programs began in 1985. Recording methods =A-B technique: time-of-arrival stereophony= A-B stereo microphone placement. This uses two parallel omnidirectional microphones some distance apart, capturing time-of-arrival stereo information as well as some level (amplitude) difference information‚Äîespecially if employed in close proximity to the sound source(s). At a distance of about , the time delay (time-of-arrival difference) for a signal reaching the first microphone and then the other one from the side is approximately 1.5 ms (1 to 2 ms). If you increase the distance between the microphones, you effectively decrease the pickup angle. At a distance, it is approximately equivalent to the pickup angle of the near-coincident ORTF setup. This technique can produce phase issues when the stereo signal is mixed to mono. =X-Y technique: intensity stereophony= X-Y stereo microphone placement. Here, two directional microphones are at the same place, typically pointing at an angle between 90¬∞ and 135¬∞ to each other. The stereo effect is achieved through differences in sound pressure level between two microphones. A difference in levels of 18 dB (16 to 20 dB) is needed for hearing the direction of a loudspeaker. Due to the lack of differences in time-of-arrival/phase ambiguities, the sonic characteristic of X-Y recordings has less sense of space and depth when compared to recordings employing an A-B setup. When two figure-eight microphones are used, facing ¬±45¬∞ with respect to the sound source, the X-Y setup is called a Blumlein Pair. The sonic image produced is realistic. =M/S technique: mid/side stereophony= Mid-Side stereo microphone technique. This coincident technique employs a bidirectional microphone facing sideways and another microphone at an angle of 90¬∞, facing the sound source. The second microphone is generally a variety of cardioid, although Alan Blumlein described the usage of an omnidirectional transducer in his original patent. The left and right channels are produced through a simple matrix: Left = Mid + Side; Right = Mid ‚àí Side (the polarity-reversed side signal). This configuration produces a completely mono-compatible signal and, if the Mid and Side signals are recorded (rather than the matrixed Left and Right), the stereo width can be manipulated after the recording has taken place. This makes it especially useful for film-based projects. =Near-coincident technique: mixed stereophony= ORTF stereo microphone technique. These techniques combine the principles of both A-B and X-Y (coincident pair) techniques. For example, the ORTF stereo technique of the Office de Radiodiffusion T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise (Radio France) calls for a pair of cardioid microphones placed 17 cm apart at a total angle between microphones of 110¬∞, which results in a stereophonic pickup angle of 96¬∞ (Stereo Recording Angle, or SRA). In the NOS stereo technique of the Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (Dutch Broadcasting Organisation), the total angle between microphones is 90¬∞ and the distance is 30 cm, thus capturing time-of-arrival stereo information as well as level information. It is noteworthy that all spaced microphone arrays and all near-coincident techniques use a spacing of at least 17 cm or more. 17 cm roughly equals the human ear distance and therefore provides the same interaural time difference (ITD) or more, depending on the spacing between microphones. Although the recorded signals are generally intended for playback over stereo loudspeakers, reproduction over headphones can provide remarkably good results, depending on the microphone arrangement. =Pseudo-stereo= In the course of restoration or remastering of monophonic records, various techniques of \\"pseudo-stereo\\", \\"quasi-stereo\\", or \\"rechanneled stereo\\" have been used to create the impression that the sound was originally recorded in stereo. These techniques first involved hardware methods (see Duophonic) or, more recently, a combination of hardware and software. Multitrack Studio, from Bremmers Audio Design (The Netherlands), uses special filters to achieve a pseudo-stereo effect: the \\"shelve\\" filter directs low frequencies to the left channel and high frequencies to the right channel, and the \\"comb\\" filter adds a small delay in signal timing between the two channels, a delay barely noticeable by ear,The comb filter allows range of manipulation between 0 and 100 milliseconds. but contributing to an effect of \\"widening\\" original \\"flattiness\\" of mono recording.Hyperprism Manipulation Process‚ÄîQuasi stereo A Review and an Extension of Pseudo-Stereo... According to Sweetwater Sound, \\"As the cost of processing technology dropped manufacturers were able to include dual processors in equipment. One of these processors could be dedicated to each input allowing two different effects to be used at once (one on each input). These processors could often have their control signals ganged together so they would act as one true stereo processor.\\" This led to the phrase true stereo, \\"used to describe the architecture of modern effect units that can truly process a stereo input as two discrete channels.\\" The special pseudo-stereo circuit‚Äîinvented by Kishii and Noro, from Japan‚Äîwas patented in the United States in 2003, with already previously issued patents for similar devices. Artificial stereo techniques have been used to improve the listening experience of monophonic recordings or to make them more \\"saleable\\" in today's market, where people expect stereo. Some critics have expressed concern about the use of these methods. Binaural recording Engineers make a technical distinction between \\"binaural\\" and \\"stereophonic\\" recording. Of these, binaural recording is analogous to stereoscopic photography. In binaural recording, a pair of microphones is put inside a model of a human head that includes external ears and ear canals; each microphone is where the eardrum would be. The recording is then played back through headphones, so that each channel is presented independently, without mixing or crosstalk. Thus, each of the listener's eardrums is driven with a replica of the auditory signal it would have experienced at the recording location. The result is an accurate duplication of the auditory spatiality that would have been experienced by the listener had he or she been in the same place as the model head. Because of the inconvenience of wearing headphones, true binaural recordings have remained laboratory and audiophile curiosities. However \\"loudspeaker-binaural\\" listening is possible with Ambiophonics. Numerous early two-track-stereo reel- to-reel tapes as well as several experimental stereo disc formats of the early 1950s branded themselves as binaural, however they were merely different incarnations of the above-described stereo or two-track mono recording methods (lead vocal or instrument isolated on one channel and orchestra on the other sans lead.) Playback Stereophonic sound attempts to create an illusion of location for various sound sources (voices, instruments, etc.) within the original recording. The recording engineer's goal is usually to create a stereo \\"image\\" with localization information. When a stereophonic recording is heard through loudspeaker systems (rather than headphones), each ear, of course, hears sound from both speakers. The audio engineer may, and often does, use more than two microphones (sometimes many more) and may mix them down to two tracks in ways that exaggerate the separation of the instruments, in order to compensate for the mixture that occurs when listening via speakers. Descriptions of stereophonic sound tend to stress the ability to localize the position of each instrument in space, but this would only be true in a carefully engineered and installed system, where speaker placement and room acoustics are taken into account. In reality, many playback systems, such as all-in-one boombox units and the like, are incapable of recreating a realistic stereo image. Originally, in the late 1950s and 1960s, stereophonic sound was marketed as seeming \\"richer\\" or \\"fuller-sounding\\" than monophonic sound, but these sorts of claims were and are highly subjective, and again, dependent on the equipment used to reproduce the sound. In fact, poorly recorded or reproduced stereophonic sound can sound far worse than well done monophonic sound. Nevertheless, many record companies released stereo \\"demonstration\\" records to help promote stereo. These records often included instructions for setting up a stereo system, 'balancing' the speakers, and a variety of ambient recordings to show off the stereo effect. When playing back stereo recordings, the best results are obtained by using two identical speakers, in front of and equidistant from the listener, with the listener located on a center line between the two speakers. In effect, an equilateral triangle is formed, with the angle between the two speakers around 60 degrees as seen from the listener's point of view. Many higher quality multichannel (two-channel and beyond) speaker systems, then and now, include detailed instructions specifying the ideal angles and distances between the speakers and the listening position to maximize the effect based on, often extensive, testing of the particular system's design. Vinyl records Although Decca had recorded Ansermet's conducting of Antar in stereo May 1954 it took four years for the first stereo LPs to be sold.Grammy pulse - Volumes 2 √† 3 - Page vi National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (U.S.) - 1984 \\"After all, stereo sound was developed in 1931, but it took until 1958 for the first stereo LPs to be sold. Keeping in mind corporate and bureaucratic red tape, we could easily be in for a long haul before stereo TV is as natural as having two ears.\\" In 1958, the first group of mass-produced stereo two-channel vinyl records was issued, by Audio Fidelity in the USA and Pye in Britain, using the Westrex \\"45/45\\" single-groove system. Whereas the stylus moves horizontally when reproducing a monophonic disk recording, on stereo records, the stylus moves vertically as well as horizontally. One could envision a system in which the left channel was recorded laterally, as on a monophonic recording, with the right channel information recorded with a \\"hill and dale\\" vertical motion; such systems were proposed but not adopted, due to their incompatibility with existing phono pickup designs (see below). In the Westrex system, each channel drives the cutting head at a 45-degree angle to the vertical. During playback, the combined signal is sensed by a left-channel coil mounted diagonally opposite the inner side of the groove and a right-channel coil mounted diagonally opposite the outer side of the groove. The Westrex system provided for the polarity of one channel to be inverted: this way large groove displacement would occur in the horizontal plane and not in the vertical one. The latter would require large up-and-down excursions and would encourage cartridge skipping during loud passages. The combined stylus motion is, in terms of the vector, the sum and difference of the two stereo channels. Effectively, all horizontal stylus motion conveys the L+R sum signal, and vertical stylus motion carries the L‚àíR difference signal. The advantages of the 45/45 system are that it has greater compatibility with monophonic recording and playback systems. Even though a monophonic cartridge will technically reproduce an equal blend of the left and right channels, instead of reproducing only one channel, this was not recommended in the early days of stereo due to the larger stylus (1.0 mil vs 0.7 mil for stereo) coupled with the lack of vertical compliance of the mono cartridges available in the first ten years of stereo. These factors would result in the stylus 'digging into' the stereo vinyl and carving up the stereo portion of the groove, destroying it for subsequent playback on stereo cartridges. This is why one often notices the banner PLAY ONLY WITH STEREO CARTRIDGE AND STYLUS on stereo vinyl issued between 1958 and 1964. Conversely, and with the benefit of no damage to any type of disc even from the beginning, a stereo cartridge reproduces the lateral grooves of monophonic recording equally through both channels, rather than through one channel. Also, it gives a more balanced sound, because the two channels have equal fidelity as opposed to providing one higher-fidelity laterally recorded channel and one lower-fidelity vertically recorded channel. Overall, this approach may give higher fidelity, because the \\"difference\\" signal is usually of low power, and is thus less affected by the intrinsic distortion of \\"hill and dale\\"-style recording. Additionally, surface noise tends to be picked up in a greater capacity in the vertical channel, therefore a mono record played on a stereo system can be in worse shape than the same record in stereo and still be enjoyable. (See Gramophone record for more on lateral and vertical recording.) This system was conceived by Alan Blumlein of EMI in 1931 and was patented in the U.K. the same year, but was not reduced to actual practice as was a requirement for patenting in the U.S. and elsewhere at that time. (Blumlein was killed in a plane crash while testing radar equipment during WW-II, and he, therefore, never reduced the system to actual practice through both a recording and a reproducing means.) EMI cut the first stereo test discs using the system in 1933, but it was not applied commercially until a quarter of a century later, and by another company (Westrex division of Litton Industries Inc, as a successor to Western Electric Company), and dubbed StereoDisk. Stereo sound provides a more natural listening experience, since the spatial location of the source of a sound is (at least in part) reproduced. In the 1960s, it was common practice to generate stereo versions of music from monophonic master tapes, which were normally marked \\"electronically reprocessed\\" or \\"electronically enhanced\\" stereo on track listings. These were generated by a variety of processing techniques to try to separate out various elements; this left noticeable and unsatisfactory artifacts in the sound, typically sounding \\"phasey\\". However, as multichannel recording became increasingly available, it has become progressively easier to master or remaster more plausible stereo recordings out of the archived multitrack master tapes. Compact disc The Red Book CD specification includes two channels by default, and so a mono recording on CD either has one empty channel, or else the same signal being relayed to both channels simultaneously. However, noncommercial CDs in other formats such as White Book or Orange Book can feature up to four hours of stereo music on one CD for the purposes of extended programming in public spaces, such as malls. These formats slightly reduce both the sampling frequency from 44.1 kHz as well as the word length from 16-bit and employ other proprietary technologies in order to increase the time on the disc and, as in the 16-inch transcriptions above - render them unplayable on the vast majority of consumer equipment. Broadcasting =Radio= In FM broadcasting, the Zenith-GE pilot-tone stereo system is used throughout the world. Because of the limited audio quality of the majority of AM receivers, and also because AM stereo receivers are relatively scarce, relatively few AM stations employ stereo. Various modulation schemes are used for AM stereo, of which the best-known is Motorola's C-QUAM, the official method for most countries in the world that transmit in AM stereo. More AM stations are adopting digital HD Radio, which allows the transmission of stereo sound on AM stations; HD Radio's lack of compatibility with C-QUAM along with other interference issues has hindered HD Radio's use on the AM dial. For Digital Audio Broadcasting, MP2 audio streams are used. DAB is one of the Digital Radio formats that is used to broadcast Digital Audio over terrestrial broadcast networks or satellite networks. DAB is extended to video, and the new format is called DMB. In Sweden, Televerket invented a different stereo broadcasting system called the Compander System. It had a high level of channel separation and could even be used to broadcast two mono signals - for example for language studies (with two languages at the same time). But tuners and receivers with the pilot-tone system were sold so people in southern Sweden could listen to, for example, Danish radio. At last Sweden (the Televerket) decided to start broadcasting in stereo according to the pilot-tone system in 1977. But stereo radio was delayed in Sweden because of the two competing systems. =Television= For analog TV (PAL and NTSC), various modulation schemes are used in different parts of the world to broadcast more than one sound channel. These are sometimes used to provide two mono sound channels that are in different languages, rather than stereo. Multichannel television sound is used mainly in the Americas. NICAM is widely used in Europe, except in Germany, where Zweikanalton is used. The EIAJ FM/FM subcarrier system is used in Japan. For Digital TV, MP2 audio streams are widely used within MPEG-2 program streams. Dolby Digital is the audio standard used for Digital TV in North America, with the capability for anywhere between 1 and 6 discrete channels. Common usage Label for 2.0 sound (stereo). In common usage, a \\"stereo\\" is a two-channel sound reproduction system, and a \\"stereo recording\\" is a two-channel recording. This is cause for much confusion, since five (or more)-channel home theater systems are not popularly described as \\"stereo\\". Most multichannel recordings are stereo recordings only in the sense that they're stereo \\"mixes\\" consisting of a collection of mono and/or true stereo recordings. Modern popular music, in particular, is usually recorded using close miking techniques, which artificially separate signals into several tracks. The individual tracks (of which there may be hundreds) are then \\"mixed down\\" into a two-channel recording. The audio engineers determine where each track will be placed in the stereo \\"image\\", by using various techniques that may vary from very simple (such as \\"left-right\\" panning controls) to more sophisticated and extensively based on psychoacoustic research (such as channel equalization, mid-side processing, and the use of delay to exploit the precedence effect). The end product using this process often bears little or no resemblance to the actual physical and spatial relationship of the musicians at the time of the original performance; indeed, it is not uncommon for different tracks of the same song to be recorded at different times (and even in different studios) and then mixed into a final two-channel recording for commercial release. Classical music recordings are a notable exception. They are more likely to be recorded without having tracks dubbed in later as in pop recordings, so that the actual physical and spatial relationship of the musicians at the time of the original performance can be preserved on the recording. Balance Balance can mean the amount of signal from each channel reproduced in a stereo audio recording. Typically, a balance control in its center position will have 0 dB of gain for both channels and will attenuate one channel as the control is turned, leaving the other channel at 0 dB.

In the United States government, the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, is a component of the larger National Strategy for Homeland Security. The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace was drafted by the Department of Homeland Security in reaction to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Released on February 14, 2003, it offers suggestions, not mandates, to business, academic, and individual users of cyberspace to secure computer systems and networks. It was prepared after a year of research by businesses, universities, and government, and after five months of public comment. The plan advises a number of security practices as well as promotion of cyber security education. The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace identifies three strategic objectives: (1) Prevent cyber attacks against America's critical infrastructures; (2) Reduce national vulnerability to cyber attacks; and (3) Minimize damage and recovery time from cyber attacks that do occur. To meet these objectives, the National Strategy outlines five national priorities: The first priority, the creation of a National Cyberspace Security Response System, focuses on improving the government's response to cyberspace security incidents and reducing the potential damage from such events. The second, third, and fourth priorities (the development of a National Cyberspace Security Threat and Vulnerability Reduction Program, the creation of a National Cyberspace Security Awareness and Training Program, the necessity of Securing Governments' Cyberspace) aim to reduce threats from, and vulnerabilities to, cyber attacks. The fifth priority, the establishment of a system of National Security and International Cyberspace Security Cooperation, intends to prevent cyber attacks that could impact national security assets and to improve the international management of and response to such attacks. Ultimately, the National Strategy encourages companies to regularly review their technology security plans, and individuals who use the Internet to add firewalls and anti-virus software to their systems. It calls for a single federal center to help detect, monitor and analyze attacks, and for expanded cyber security research and improved government-industry cooperation.

The wife of the play's tragic hero, Macbeth (a Scottish nobleman), Lady Macbeth goads her husband into committing regicide, after which she becomes queen of Scotland. She dies off-stage in the last act, an apparent suicide. Lady Macbeth is a powerful presence in the play, most notably in the first two acts. Following the murder of King Duncan, however, her role in the plot diminishes. She becomes an uninvolved spectator to Macbeth's plotting and a nervous hostess at a banquet dominated by her husband's hallucinations. Her sleepwalking scene in the fifth act is a turning point in the play, and her line \\"Out, damned spot!\\" has become a phrase familiar to many speakers of the English language. The report of her death late in the fifth act provides the inspiration for Macbeth's \\"Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow\\" speech. The role has attracted countless notable actors over the centuries, including Sarah Siddons, Charlotte Melmoth, Helen Faucit, Ellen Terry, Jeanette Nolan, Vivien Leigh, Simone Signoret, Vivien Merchant, Glenda Jackson, Francesca Annis, Judith Anderson, Dame Judi Dench, Renee O'Connor, Keeley Hawes, Alex Kingston, Marion Cotillard, and Hannah Taylor- Gordon. Origins Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth appeared to be a composite of two personages found in the account of King Duff and in the account of King Duncan in Holinshed's Chronicles (1587). Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth appears to be a composite of two separate and distinct personages in Holinshed's work: Donwald's nagging, murderous wife in the account of King Duff and Macbeth's ambitious wife, Gruoch of Scotland, in the account of King Duncan.In the account of King Duff, one of his captains, Donwald, suffers the deaths of his kinsmen at the orders of the king. Donwald then considers regicide at \\"the setting on of his wife\\", who \\"showed him the means whereby he might soonest accomplish it.\\" Donwald abhors such an act, but perseveres at the nagging of his wife. After plying the king's servants with food and drink and letting them fall asleep, the couple admit their confederates to the king's room, where they then commit the regicide. The murder of Duff has its motivation in revenge rather than ambition. In Holinshed's account of King Duncan, the discussion of Lady Macbeth is confined to a single sentence: Not found in Holinshed are the invocation to the \\"spirits that tend on mortal thoughts\\", the sleepwalking scene, and various details found in the drama concerning the death of Macbeth. According to some genealogists, King Duncan's wife was Lady Macbeth's grandmother where Duncan's wife had a stronger claim to the throne than Lady Macbeth. It was this that incited her jealousy and hatred of Duncan. Role in the play Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth by John Singer Sargent, 1889. Lady Macbeth makes her first appearance late in scene five of the first act, when she learns in a letter from her husband that three witches have prophesied his future as king. When King Duncan becomes her overnight guest, Lady Macbeth seizes the opportunity to effect his murder. Aware her husband's temperament is \\"too full o' the milk of human kindness\\" for committing a regicide, she plots the details of the murder; then, countering her husband's arguments and reminding him that he first broached the matter, she belittles his courage and manhood, finally winning him to her designs. The king retires after a night of feasting. Lady Macbeth drugs his attendants and lays daggers ready for the commission of the crime. Macbeth kills the sleeping king while Lady Macbeth waits nearby. When he brings the daggers from the king's room, Lady Macbeth orders him to return them to the scene of the crime. He refuses. She carries the daggers to the room and smears the drugged attendants with blood. The couple retire to wash their hands. Following the murder of King Duncan, Lady Macbeth's role in the plot diminishes. When Duncan's sons flee the land in fear for their own lives, Macbeth is appointed king. Without consulting his queen, Macbeth plots other murders in order to secure his throne, and, at a royal banquet, the queen is forced to dismiss her guests when Macbeth hallucinates. In her last appearance, she sleepwalks in profound torment. She dies off-stage, with suicide being suggested as its cause when Malcolm declares that she died by \\"self and violent hands.\\"Macbeth, Act 5, Scene 8, Line 71. In the First Folio, the only source for the play, she is never referred to as Lady Macbeth, but variously as \\"Macbeth's wife\\", \\"Macbeth's lady\\", or just \\"lady\\". Sleepwalking scene The Sleepwalking Lady Macbeth by Johann Heinrich F√ºssli, late 18th century. (Mus√©e du Louvre) The sleepwalking sceneMacbeth, Act 5, Scene 1. is one of the more celebrated scenes from Macbeth, and, indeed, in all of Shakespeare. It has no counterpart in Holinshed's Chronicles, Shakespeare's source material for the play, but is solely the bard's invention. A.C. Bradley notes that, with the exception of the scene's few closing lines, the scene is entirely in prose with Lady Macbeth being the only major character in Shakespearean tragedy to make a last appearance \\"denied the dignity of verse.\\" According to Bradley, Shakespeare generally assigned prose to characters exhibiting abnormal states of mind or abnormal conditions such as somnambulism, with the regular rhythm of verse being inappropriate to characters having lost their balance of mind or subject to images or impressions with no rational connection. Lady Macbeth's recollections ‚Äì the blood on her hand, the striking of the clock, her husband's reluctance ‚Äì are brought forth from her disordered mind in chance order with each image deepening her anguish. For Bradley, Lady Macbeth's \\"brief toneless sentences seem the only voice of truth\\" with the spare and simple construction of the character's diction expressing a \\"desolating misery.\\"A.C. Bradley. Shakespearean Tragedy. Palgrave Macmillan; 4th edition, 2007. Lady Macbeth's compulsive washing of her hands to rid them of blood is reminiscent of hand washing common among sufferers from obsessive-compulsive disorder. Analyses of the role =Lady Macbeth as anti-mother= Stephanie Chamberlain in her article \\"Fantasizing Infanticide: Lady Macbeth and the Murdering Mother in Early Modern England\\" argues that though Lady Macbeth wants power, her power is ‚Äúconditioned on maternity‚Äù, which was a \\"conflicted status in early modern England.\\" Chamberlain argues that the negative images of Lady Macbeth as a mother figure, such as when she discusses her ability to \\"bash the brain of the babe that sucks her breast\\", reflect controversies concerning the image of motherhood in early modern England. In early modern England, mothers were often accused of hurting the people that were placed in their hands. Lady Macbeth then personifies all mothers of early modern England who were condemned for Lady Macbeth's fantasy of infanticide. Lady Macbeth's fantasy, Chamberlain argues, is not struggling to be a man, but rather struggling with the condemnation of being a bad mother that was common during that time.Chamberlain, Stephanie. \\"Fantasizing Infanticide: Lady Macbeth and the Murdering Mother in Early Modern England.\\" College Literature. Vol. 32.2. West Chester University, 2005. pp. 72‚Äì91. A print of Lady Macbeth from Mrs. Anna Jameson's 1832 analysis of Shakespeare's Heroines, Characteristics of Women. Jenijoy La Belle takes a slightly different view in her article, \\"A Strange Infirmity: Lady Macbeth‚Äôs Amenorrhea.\\" La Belle states that Lady Macbeth does not wish for just a move away from femininity; she is asking the spirits to eliminate the basic biological characteristics of womanhood. The main biological characteristic that La Belle focuses on is menstruation. La Belle argues that by asking to be \\"unsex[ed]\\" and crying out to spirits to ‚Äúmake thick [her] blood / Stop up th‚Äô access and passage to remorse,‚Äù Lady Macbeth asks for her menstrual cycle to stop. By having her menstrual cycle stop, Lady Macbeth hopes to stop any feelings of sensitivity and caring that is associated with females. She hopes to become like a man to stop any sense of remorse for the regicide. La Belle furthers her argument by connecting the stopping of the menstrual cycle with the persistent infanticide motifs in the play. La Belle gives examples of \\"the strangled babe\\" whose finger is thrown into the witches‚Äô cauldron (4.1.30); Macduff's babes who are \\"savagely slaughter‚Äôd\\" (4.3.235); and the suckling babe with boneless gums whose brains Lady Macbeth would dash out (1.7.57‚Äì58) to argue that Lady Macbeth represents the ultimate anti-mother: not only would she smash in a baby's brains but she would go even further to stop her means of procreation altogether.La Belle, Jenijoy. \\"A Strange Infirmity: Lady Macbeth's Amenorrhea.\\" Shakespeare Quarterly, Vol. 31.3. Folger Shakespeare Library, 1980. pp. 381‚Äì386. =Lady Macbeth as witch= Some literary critics and historians argue that not only does Lady Macbeth represent an anti-mother figure in general, she also embodies a specific type of anti-mother: the witch. Modern day critic Joanna Levin defines a witch as a woman who succumbs to Satanic force, a lust for the devil, and who, either for this reason or the desire to obtain supernatural powers, invokes (evil) spirits. English physician Edward Jorden published Briefe Discourse of a Disease Called the Suffocation of the Mother in 1603, in which he speculated that this force literally derived from the female sexual reproductive organs. Because no one else had published any other studies on the susceptibility of women, especially mothers, to becoming both the witch and the bewitched (i.e. demonically possessed), Jorden's findings helped create the foundation for the views popularized during the Renaissance about the relationship between women and witchcraft. Levin refers to Marianne Hester's Lewd Women and Wicked Witches: A Study of Male Domination, in which Hester articulates a feminist interpretation of the witch as an empowered woman. Levin summarises the claim of feminist historians like Hester: the witch should be a figure celebrated for her nonconformity, defiance, and general sense of empowerment; witches challenged patriarchal authority and hierarchy, specifically \\"threatening hegemonic sex/gender systems.\\" This view associates witchcraft ‚Äî and by extension, Lady Macbeth ‚Äî not with villainy and evil, but with heroism. Jenijoy La Belle assesses Lady Macbeth's femininity and sexuality as they relate to motherhood as well as witchhood. The fact that she conjures spirits likens her to a witch, and the act itself establishes a similarity in the way that both Lady Macbeth and the Weird Sisters from the play \\"use the metaphoric powers of language to call upon spiritual powers who in turn will influence physical events ‚Äî in one case the workings of the state, in the other the workings of a woman's body.\\" Like the witches, Lady Macbeth strives to make herself an instrument for bringing about the future She proves herself a defiant, empowered nonconformist, and an explicit threat to a patriarchal system of governance in that, through challenging his masculinity, she manipulates Macbeth into murdering King Duncan. Despite the fact that she calls him a coward, Macbeth remains reluctant, until she asks: \\"What beast wasn't, then, that made you break this enterprise to me? / When you durst do it, then you were a man; / And to be more than what you were, you would / Be so much more the man.\\" Thus Lady Macbeth enforces a masculine conception of power, yet only after pleading to be unsexed, or defeminised. The Weird Sisters are also depicted as defeminised, androgynous figures. They are bearded (1.3.46), (which may also be associated with Lady Macbeth's amenorrhea). Witches were perceived as an extreme type of anti-mother, even considered capable of cooking and eating their own children. Although Lady Macbeth may not express violence toward her child with that same degree of grotesqueness, she certainly expresses a sense of brutality when she states that she would smash the baby's head. Performance history John Rice, a boy actor with the King's Men, may have played Lady Macbeth in a performance of what was likely Shakespeare's tragedy at the Globe Theatre on 20 April 1611. The performance was witnessed and described by Simon Forman in his manuscript The Book of Plays and Notes thereof per Formans for Common Policy. His account, however, does not establish whether the play was Shakespeare's Macbeth or a work on the same subject by another dramatist.Bevington, David. Four Tragedies. Bantam, 1988. The role may have been beyond the talents of a boy actor and may have been played by a man in early performances.Braunmiller, A. R. Macbeth. Cambridge University Press, 1997. In the mid-18th century, Hannah Pritchard played Lady Macbeth opposite David Garrick's Macbeth. She was, in Thomas Davies' words, \\"insensible to compunction and inflexibly bent on cruelty.\\" Sarah Siddons in the sleepwalking scene Sarah Siddons starred in John Philip Kemble's 1794 production at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and offered a psychologically intricate portrait of Lady Macbeth in the tradition of Hannah Pritchard. Siddons was especially praised for moving audiences in the sleepwalking scene with her depiction of a soul in profound torment. Siddons and Kemble furthered the view established by Pritchard and Garrick that character was the essence of Shakespearean drama. William Hazlitt commented on Siddons' performance: Helen Faucit was critiqued by Henry Morley, a professor of English literature in University College, London, who thought the actress \\"too demonstrative and noisy\\" in the scenes before Duncan's murder with the \\"Come, you spirits\\" speech \\"simply spouted\\" and its closing \\"Hold! Hold!\\" shouted in a \\"most unheavenly manner.\\" In the \\"I have given suck\\" speech, he thought Faucit \\"poured out\\" the speech in a way that recalled the \\"scold at the door of a gin-shop.\\" Faucit, he believed, was \\"too essentially feminine, too exclusively gifted with the art of expressing all that is most beautiful and graceful in womanhood, to succeed in inspiring anything like awe and terror.\\" He thought her talents more congenial to the second phase of the character, and found her \\"admirably good\\" in the banquet scene. Her sleepwalking scene, however, was described as having \\"the air of a too well- studied dramatic recitation.\\"Morley, Henry. The Journal of a London Playgoer from 1851 to 1866. London: George Routledge & Sons, 1866. pp. 350‚Äì354 Photograph of Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth, an 1888 production In 1884 at the Gaiety Theatre, Sarah Bernhardt performed the sleepwalking scene barefoot and clad in a clinging nightdress, and, in 1888, a critic noted Ellen Terry was \\"the stormy dominant woman of the eleventh century equipped with the capricious emotional subtlety of the nineteenth century.\\" In 1915 and 1918, Sybil Thorndike played the role at Old Vic and then at the Prince's Theatre in 1926. Flora Robson played the role in Tyrone Guthrie's Old Vic production in 1934. In 1955, Vivien Leigh played Lady Macbeth opposite Laurence Olivier at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. In 1977 at The Other Place in Stratford, Judi Dench and Ian McKellen played the infamous husband and wife in Trevor Nunn's production. Other notable Lady Macbeths in the late 20th century included Judith Anderson, Pamela Brown, Diana Wynyard, Simone Signoret, Vivien Merchant, Jane Lapotaire, Helen Mirren and Janet Suzman. Jeanette Nolan in the Banquet Scene from Orson Welles' Macbeth (1948) Jeanette Nolan performed the role in Orson Welles' 1948 film adaptation and was critiqued by Bosley Crowther in the New York Times of 28 December 1950: \\"The Lady Macbeth of Jeanette Nolan is a pop-eyed and haggard dame whose driving determination is as vagrant as the highlights on her face. Likewise, her influence upon Macbeth, while fleetingly suggested in a few taut lines and etched in a couple of hot embraces, is not developed adequately. The passion and torment of the conflict between these two which resides in the play has been rather seriously neglected in this truncated rendering.\\"Crowther, Bosley. \\"Orson Welles' Interpretation of Shakespeare's 'Macbeth' at the Trans-Lux 60th St.\\" New York Times, 28 December 1950. Michael Costello of Allmovie has described her performance as \\"uneven\\" and has also stated, \\"Her unique Lady Macbeth is either an exhibition of rank scenery-chewing or a performance of intriguingly Kabuki-like stylization.\\" In 2009, Pegasus Books published The Tragedy of Macbeth Part II, a play by American author and playwright Noah Lukeman, which endeavoured to offer a sequel to Macbeth and to resolve its many loose ends, particularly Lady Macbeth's reference to her having had a child (which, historically, she did - from a previous marriage, having remarried Macbeth after being widowed.) Written in blank verse, the play was published to critical acclaim. In 2010, Gloria Carre√±o's play \\"A Season Before The Tragedy Of Macbeth\\" was produced by British Touring Shakespeare and received the plaudits of critics for \\"its amazing grasp of language\\". It was deemed \\"a feat\\" and a must-see for fans of Shakespeare. The dramatist Gloria Carre√±o describes events from the murder of \\"Lord Gillecomgain\\", Gruoch Macduff's first husband, to the fateful letter in the first act of Shakespeare's tragedy. Alex Kingston starred as Lady Macbeth opposite Kenneth Branagh in his and Rob Ashford's adaption of Macbeth. The play was first performed at the Manchester Festival in 2013 and then transferred to New York for a limited engagement in 2014. Marion Cotillard played the character in Justin Kurzel's 2015 film adaptation opposite Michael Fassbender. In popular culture Gabriel von Max's depiction of Lady Macbeth. * During former United States President Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign for the American presidency, Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article \\"The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock\\", and some twenty other articles in major publications drew comparisons between his wife and Lady Macbeth,  p. 142 questioning Hillary Clinton's ideological and ethical record in comparison to Shakespeare's famous character and suggesting parallels. * The Simpsons twentieth episode of its twentieth season, \\"Four Great Women and a Manicure\\" is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is frustrated by everything around her. She not only has to clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated over the fact that Homer doesn't have any interest in auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that no one cares for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to pin the blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge and points out that they knew he was a victim himself in her devious ambitions. The angry spirits get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson the hard way when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer. * In 2008, Three Rivers Press published Lady Macbeth by Susan Fraser King. The novel is original fiction, based on source material regarding the period and person of Lady Macbeth. * Julia Gillard was compared to Lady Macbeth after she ousted Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister of Australia in June 2010. The most often cited parallels between Gillard and Lady Macbeth being that Gillard was a red-haired and 'deliberately barren' woman, while the event itself occurred late in the evening, much like King Duncan's murder. Additionally, the perpetrator succeeded the victim, Julia Gillard became the Prime Minister after \\"killing\\" Kevin Rudd's career while the Macbeths were proclaimed King and Queen after King Duncan's death. Additional parallels to the play Macbeth, more broadly, include the fact that Gillard was labelled a witch, was the recipient of misogynistic attitudes, and Gillard's statement to Senator Kim Carr that the Labor Government was sleepwalking to defeat.

The southern third of the peninsula is used as a firing range by the New York City Police Department; the remaining wooded section is part of Pelham Bay Park. The north side is joined to what used to be Hunters Island and Twin Island to form Orchard Beach and a parking lot. Rodman's Neck has three meadows. One is a natural salt water meadow; the other two are manmade freshwater meadows, one of which was created by Robert Moses' projects. The City Island Traffic Circle and several small ballfields also exist, while every original building has been razed. A landfill area for City Island Road crosses Turtle Cove Saltwater Marsh with a culvert made of concrete pipes connecting it to the salt water Eastchester Bay. A second land berm built for horsecars had its always-clogged three foot diameter culvert removed, and a trench with a stainless steel bridge was installed.  History  Rodman's Neck US Naval Reserve Training Station at Rodman's Neck Rodman's Neck is part of the historic manor of Thomas Pell, who bought the land in 1654. Rodman's Neck is named after a local man, Samuel Rodman, while the southern tip, known as \\"Pell's Point\\", is where the British landed during the Revolutionary War's Battle of Pell's Point. It was originally named \\"Anne's Hoeck\\" (or Ann Hook's Neck) after Anne Hutchinson and her killer, Wampage I, who took the name Anh√µ√µke after the massacre, which took place near Split Rock. Rodman had owned a ferry that ran between Minneford Island (now known as City Island) and Anne's Hoeck where the bridge is now. Then L.R. Marshall built a Southern- style mansion on his estate, renamed \\"Hawkswood\\", at the southernmost tip of Rodman's Neck. His mansion was converted and used as an inn until 1888, when the New York City Parks Department acquired the property for Pelham Bay Park. A dock for the eastern shore of Rodman's Neck was approved in 1891, with funds appropriated for said dock. Due to overcrowding at the nearby Hunter Island campsite, NYC Parks opened a campsite in 1906 at Rodman's Neck on the south tip of the island, with 100 bathhouses. The land was first used as a United States Army training location from 1917 to 1919, during World War I, when it was used by the 105th and 108th Infantry Regiments. It became parkland in the 1920s, but was seldom utilized. Between 1930 and 1936, the southern tip of the peninsula was used by the New York City Police Academy for summer training and explosives detonation. It was also part of Camp Mulrooney, a summer camp for the NYPD, and was used in that sense until 1936. In 1941, during World War II, the U.S. Department of War began to use the area as a Navy base. The Army used Rodman's Neck again in the 1950s during the Cold War, building a radar fire control center there. In 1959, the peninsula's operation was transferred to the NYPD who built the current firing range at the peninsula's southern tip. Early signs at the entrance said, \\"NYPD Pistol Range\\". In 1976, one NYPD Officer was killed and another was badly injured in The Pit when a bomb went off accidentally.* Ex-Tenant Is Sought in Bomb Case * THE CITY; Explosives Found In Bronx Home * Lets Get Outta Here * Bomb Kills NYPD Officer  NYPD firing range  A 54-acre police training facility is operated by the NYPD Firearms and Tactics Section and is used for handgun and rifle practice and qualification by the NYPD, the FBI,Fire Department Fire Marshals, Correction Department, ICE, and training probationary police officers, as well as for antiterrorist, disorder control, Emergency Service Units, and OCCB training. The base has seven rifle ranges with a 230 total firing points for trainees. The base has a school with lecture hall and seven classrooms with teachers. The base also has training area designed to look like a city neighborhood for practical training exercises. It has one of the world's largest police armories and a firearms machine shop for maintenance and experimental weapons development. The grounds include mock buildings called Urban Training Center /Tactical Village and Tactics House used for urban training scenarios, and a FireArms Training Simulator building (FATS) including an interactive video simulator that was all paid for by the FBI. There is also a specially equipped vehicle armed for disorder control nicknamed \\"The War Wagon\\" in case of rioting. The base was used during the 1960s by the National Guard to train riot troops and was an emergency base of operations during the September 11, 2001 attacks. This area is restricted for police and military use only. It has a helipad and police boat docks. The area is also used for destroying unexploded bombs. Many bombs have been detonated since 1930, including ones made by George Metesky, the Weathermen, the Black Panthers, the Animal Liberation Front, al-Qaeda, and serial bomber Cesar Sayoc. These explosives are always detonated at the southernmost point that juts out into Eastchester Bay in a crater called \\"The Pit\\". Around July 2 every year, impressive impromptu volcanic displays are put on as seized illegal fireworks are destroyed. The range was intended as a temporary facility, according to the plans laid out by Robert Moses and Mayors Robert F. Wagner, Jr., John Lindsay, and Abraham D. Beame. However, Mayor Ed Koch favored it becoming permanent. The range was previously part of Pelham Bay Park. In the late 1980s, Governor Mario Cuomo signed an eminent domain law separating this land from the park and giving the NYPD the right to stay permanently. The range was to have been converted into the Olympic Firing Range for the unsuccessful New York City 2012 Olympic bid. The range has Biohazard Safety Level 4 lab facilities to deal with radiological devices, bioweapon bombs and gas chemical weapons. A widely used paper target figure officially known as \\"Advanced Silhouette SP-83A\\" or target \\"B-60\\" may have been developed in the early 1960s as a likeness of Sergeant Fred V. Worell, an instructor at the range. The target is colloquially known as \\"The Thug\\".\\"Cops' Favorite Target Thug, but Just Who Was the Guy\\", The New York Times, February 17, 2005 In April 2007, the NYPD announced that all gun practice would move to a new indoors facility in College Point, Queens.* Rodmans Neck Range Closing? * Rodmands Neck Range Closing? * Truck Bomb Detonated in 2006 Due to shortages in funding, the move was canceled and it was deemed cheaper to renovate Rodman's Neck for $275 million. Controversy Local birdwatchers say that allowing saltwater flow into northern Turtle Cove is chasing away freshwater drinking birds. Also, locals are bewildered that the parks department would waste money to build a pedestrian bridge, instead of removing the unused land berm. Many residents dislike the parks department's plans to restore all flora and animals to indigenous species that are pre-Columbus. Additionally, City Island residents have been complaining for years about the noise from gunfire and the detonation of weapons at NYPD's Rodman's Neck Firing Range. In March 1998, city officials determined there was no solution to the noise problem, as there was no other practical venue at which to locate the NYPD range.

Searching on one number is a solved problem; searching on two or more, and asking for locations that are nearby in both x and y directions, requires craftier algorithms. Fundamentally, an R+ tree is a tree data structure, a variant of the R tree, used for indexing spatial information. Difference between R+ trees and R trees R+ trees are a compromise between R-trees and kd-trees: they avoid overlapping of internal nodes by inserting an object into multiple leaves if necessary. Coverage is the entire area to cover all related rectangles. Overlap is the entire area which is contained in two or more nodes. Minimal coverage reduces the amount of \\"dead space\\" (empty area) which is covered by the nodes of the R-tree. Minimal overlap reduces the set of search paths to the leaves (even more critical for the access time than minimal coverage). Efficient search requires minimal coverage and overlap. R+ trees differ from R trees in that: nodes are not guaranteed to be at least half filled, the entries of any internal node do not overlap, and an object ID may be stored in more than one leaf node. Advantages Because nodes are not overlapped with each other, point query performance benefits since all spatial regions are covered by at most one node. A single path is followed and fewer nodes are visited than with the R-tree. Disadvantages Since rectangles are duplicated, an R+ tree can be larger than an R tree built on same data set. Construction and maintenance of R+ trees is more complex than the construction and maintenance of R trees and other variants of the R tree. Notes References * T. Sellis, N. Roussopoulos, and C.

The Republic's national anthem was written by Iskhak Shumafovich Mashbash; music-- by Umar Khatsitsovich Tkhabisimov. Recorded Adygean music began prior to World War I, when folk musicians across the North Caucasus and Central Asia were commercially recorded. Many of these musicians, including the Adygean Magomet Khfgfudzh, an accordionist, have become cultural heroes to modern inhabitants. Adygean music is closely related to Kabardian, Cherkess and Shapsugh music. The four groups are the main constituents of the Adiga (Circassian) nation. In the olden days, the musical lore was preserved and disseminated by the roving minstrels (Jegwak'we).  1990s renaissance  Aslhencheriy Nexay, People's Artist of the Russian Federation, graduated in composition from the Tbilisi Conservatoire in 1983. He composed the first Adigean opera 'The Sound of Distant Thunder' and wrote a number of songs and symphonies. He founded the Adigean State Folk Song Ensemble Islamey (–ò—Å–ª—ä–∞–º—ã–π) in 1991. It is one of a number of folk song groups that keep the old bard traditions alive, boasting of a rich repertoire of ancient and traditional songs. The Ensemble's mission also includes the rearrangement of folk songs and chants into modern formats to bestow contemporary relevance on them without sacrificing their authenticity and historical value. The Ensemble displayed its artistic wares in many festivals held in countries across Europe and Asia, and made several tours in countries where Circassian diasporas are concentrated. The Ensemble boasts of a number of world-class singers, including Susanna X'wak'we, Shemsudin Qwmiqw, and Rim Schawe. The choreography of the Ensemble is designed by Viktoria Yedij. Zchiw Song Ensemble a.k.a. Jiu Ensemble (–ñ—ä—ã—É; literally: Chorus) is an Adigean group that utilizes ancient musical instruments (no accordion or baraban), and plays authentic songs of the bards as they would have been heard prior to the 19th century. Its directors and principal personnel are Zamudin Ghwch'e and Zawir Neghwey, both singers of considerable talent. Neghwey also plays the shich'epshine (Circassian violin). Other singers of note include Artur Abida. In the early 1990s Adygea saw the formation of a number of new musical institutions. These include two orchestras, one of which (Russkaya Udal), uses folk instruments (the other is the Adygeya Republic National Symphony Orchestra), and a chamber music theater. The Nalmes ensemble is a folk dance organization that has been dedicated to promoting and preserving Adygean music and dance since 1936. The Union of Composers of the Republic of Adigea was established in 1992 under the leadership of Qaplhen Tiqwe. Member composers include Cheslav Anzeroqwe (Anzarokov), Aslhencheriy Nexay, Alla Sokolova, Bayzet Qeghezezh (Kagazezhev), Aslhen Gwt'e (Gotov), Tatyana Sukhova, and Murat X'wpe (Khupov). Their compositions and publications are detailed (in Russian) on the website of the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Adigea.

R*-trees have slightly higher construction cost than standard R-trees, as the data may need to be reinserted; but the resulting tree will usually have a better query performance. Like the standard R-tree, it can store both point and spatial data. It was proposed by Norbert Beckmann, Hans- Peter Kriegel, Ralf Schneider, and Bernhard Seeger in 1990. Difference between R*-trees and R-trees ELKI). There is little overlap in this tree, resulting in good query performance. Red and blue MBRs are index pages, green MBRs are leaf nodes. Minimization of both coverage and overlap is crucial to the performance of R-trees. Overlap means that, on data query or insertion, more than one branch of the tree needs to be expanded (due to the way data is being split in regions which may overlap). A minimized coverage improves pruning performance, allowing exclusion of whole pages from search more often, in particular for negative range queries. The R*-tree attempts to reduce both, using a combination of a revised node split algorithm and the concept of forced reinsertion at node overflow. This is based on the observation that R-tree structures are highly susceptible to the order in which their entries are inserted, so an insertion-built (rather than bulk-loaded) structure is likely to be sub-optimal. Deletion and reinsertion of entries allows them to \\"find\\" a place in the tree that may be more appropriate than their original location. When a node overflows, a portion of its entries are removed from the node and reinserted into the tree. (In order to avoid an indefinite cascade of reinsertions caused by subsequent node overflow, the reinsertion routine may be called only once in each level of the tree when inserting any one new entry.) This has the effect of producing more well-clustered groups of entries in nodes, reducing node coverage. Furthermore, actual node splits are often postponed, causing average node occupancy to rise. Re-insertion can be seen as a method of incremental tree optimization triggered on node overflow. Performance *Improved split heuristic produces pages that are more rectangular and thus better for many applications. *Reinsertion method optimizes the existing tree, but increases complexity. *Efficiently supports point and spatial data at the same time. Algorithm and complexity * The R*-tree uses the same algorithm as the regular R-tree for query and delete operations. * When inserting, the R*-tree uses a combined strategy. For leaf nodes, overlap is minimized, while for inner nodes, enlargement and area are minimized. * When splitting, the R*-tree uses a topological split that chooses a split axis based on perimeter, then minimizes overlap. * In addition to an improved split strategy, the R*-tree also tries to avoid splits by reinserting objects and subtrees into the tree, inspired by the concept of balancing a B-tree. Worst case query and delete complexity are thus identical to the R-Tree. The insertion strategy to the R*-tree is with \\\\mathcal{O}(M \\\\log M) more complex than the linear split strategy (\\\\mathcal{O}(M)) of the R-tree, but less complex than the quadratic split strategy (\\\\mathcal{O}(M^2)) for a page size of M objects and has little impact on the total complexity. The total insert complexity is still comparable to the R-tree: reinsertions affect at most one branch of the tree and thus \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log n) reinsertions, comparable to performing a split on a regular R-tree. So on overall, the complexity of the R*-tree is the same as that of a regular R-tree. An implementation of the full algorithm must address many corner cases and tie situations not discussed here.

It is produced by WNET in New York City. The show debuted on PBS in 1986. Groups or organizations featured include: Actors Studio, Algonquin Round Table, Group Theatre, Sweet Honey in the Rock, Women of Tin Pan Alley, Negro Ensemble Company, Juilliard School, the Beat Generation, the singer-songwriters of the 1970s, Sun Records, vaudeville, and Warner Bros. History American Masters, a series \\"devoted to America's 'greatest native-born and adopted' artists\\", was originally scheduled to premiere in September 1985; for \\"logistical scheduling reasons\\" the premiere was delayed until summer 1986, though on October 16, 1985, an American Masters \\"special\\" called Aaron Copland: A Self-Portrait was aired. The first of the 15 first-season episodes was Private Conversations, a \\"cinema-verite documentary by Christian Blackwood done in that trickiest of cinematic forms: a film about a film, in this instance the television version of Death of a Salesman, directed by Volker Schl√∂ndorff\\". It aired on June 23, 1986, as one of two episodes not specifically commissioned for the show's first season. Susan Lacy, American Masters creator and executive producer, selected each subject, matched them to the specific filmmakers, and oversaw a first-season budget of $8 million. Before creating the series Lacy had been the senior programmer for Great Performances and one of the \\"architects\\" of American Playhouse, having written the original proposal for the latter. At the time of the show's premiere, she was also the East Coast head of the Sundance Institute. After the show's first two seasons, American Masters began producing most of its episodes; in those cases, it hires directors, arranges for funding, manages the budget, and supervises the editing; the show reserves the right to make the final cut on every film it produces. The American Masters production company occasionally plays a more limited role and co-produces some of its episodes, such as the 2005 documentary on Bob Dylan, No Direction Home, and then in 2010 The Doors, When You're Strange.

Baxter is a fictional character in the Blandings stories by P. G. Wodehouse. Often called The Efficient Baxter, although disparagingly referred to as Mr. Nosey Parker by the castle staff, he is Lord Emsworth's secretary, and an expert on many things, including Egyptian scarabs. He invariably wears his rimless spectacles, suspects everyone of being an impostor, and is, as his epithet suggests, extremely efficient. Character Baxter is an efficient and practical individual. He likes order, and despises Lord Emsworth's fuzzy mind and lifestyle. He sees himself as a man destined to bring order to Blandings, and is proud of his position as de facto ruler of one of England's largest houses. It is this pride which brings him back time and again to Blandings, despite the better pay and working conditions available to him in the household of Mr J. Horace Jevons, his employer before and after his reigns at Blandings, a man who treats him with the respect, and even obsequiousness, he demands; Mr Jevons' financial advice also allows Baxter to treble his savings. Not the most emotional of men, his head is rarely turned by women, although on one occasion, meeting Sue Brown but believing her to be Myra Schoonmaker, he finds himself approving very much of the idea of an heiress to sixty million dollars. He is a good chess player, and also enjoys bezique. His weak stomach is his achilles heel. Appearances Baxter appears in four novels and a single short story: * Something Fresh (1915) * Leave it to Psmith (1923) * Summer Lightning (1929) * \\"The Crime Wave at Blandings\\", featured in the collection Lord Emsworth and Others (1937) * Uncle Fred in the Springtime (1939) He also receives mentions in Heavy Weather (1933), Service with a Smile (1962) and Galahad at Blandings (1965). Career At some point prior to working at Blandings, Baxter worked for Sir Ralph Dillingworth, the Yorkshire baronet, who shot mice in the drawing room with an elephant gun; Baxter had to call in, and thus met, Sir Roderick Glossop, a fact which came in useful when Uncle Fred visited the castle impersonating Glossop. Baxter first appears in Something Fresh; a man perfectly suited to his job, he \\"had no vices, but he sometimes relaxed his busy brain with a game of solitaire.\\" Lord Emsworth finds him invaluable, but begins to question his trust when Baxter is discovered in the middle of the night, in the midst of a sea of upset tables, broken china, and food. By the time of Leave it to Psmith, Baxter's efficiency has become a bane to the sunshine-loving Lord, and when he finds himself locked out of the castle wearing lemon-coloured pyjamas in the early morning, and throws flowerpots at Emsworth's bedroom window in an attempt to wake him, Emsworth decides he is insane and sacks him, replacing him with Rupert Psmith. He returns to the employ of J. Horace Jevons, a Chicago millionaire for whom he had worked prior to coming to the castle. Despite his being sacked, Baxter longs to organize the affairs of the absent-minded Emsworth, and remains a faithful friend and ally of Lady Constance. He returns for a time in Summer Lightning, while Hugo Carmody occupies his former position. He is called back by Lady Constance to steal Galahad's scandalous memoirs, and arrives at the castle in a caravan, pretending to be passing by on a caravaning tour. Not long after he arrives, he is disturbed while searching for the manuscript, and leaps from the library window to land in a flowerbed at Lord Emsworth's feet, adding to the Earl's poor opinion of Baxter's sanity, an opinion worsened further when, at the climax of proceedings, he is found hiding under Sue Brown's bed (a young girl for whom he had developed some affection, on the basis that she was a wealthy heiress, and was disgusted to find was an impostor). In Heavy Weather, days after Baxter has left, Galahad and Lord Emsworth are led to believe that he had been employed by Sir Gregory Parsloe- Parsloe to steal Emsworth's prize pig, Empress of Blandings. Baxter returns briefly to Blandings in \\"The Crime Wave at Blandings\\", at first as a stop on motorcycle tour of England, but he soon becomes a prospective tutor for George, Lord Bosham's second son and Lord Emsworth's grandson. However, when several members of the Blandings household shoot him in the hind parts with young George's air gun, he is cured of his longing, despite Emsworth's offer of a return to his old post, and decides to leave Blandings permanently to work for Mr. Jevons. Unable to stay away, Baxter returns again in Uncle Fred in the Springtime, where he is employed by the grouchy Duke of Dunstable, who visits the castle as a friend of Lady Constance. He works for Dunstable helping to compile the Dunstable family history, but is poorly treated by the Duke, who suspects him of going on \\"toots\\", and hits him in the face with a well-thrown egg when he hears him singing on the lawn outside his rooms, and also has him help steal Empress of Blandings, a task which sorely tries Baxter's nerve; he is later slipped a Mickey Finn by Uncle Fred. He is last mentioned in Galahad at Blandings as being in the employ of an American millionaire in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Between September 1934 and March 1936, Leo Genn was a member of the Old Vic Company where he appeared in many productions of Shakespeare. In 1934 he featured in R.J. Minney's Clive of India. In 1937 he was Horatio in Tyrone Guthrie's production of Hamlet, with Laurence Olivier as Hamlet, in Elsinore, Denmark. In 1938 Genn appeared in the theatrical hit, The Flashing Stream by Charles Langbridge Morgan and went with the show to America and Broadway.

In 1959 Genn gave a reading in Chichester Cathedral. In 1974, a recording of The Jungle Book was released with Genn as narrator and Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa conducting The Frankenland Symphony Orchestra with the music from the film. =Film career= Genn's first film role was as Shylock in Immortal Gentleman (1935), a biography of Shakespeare. Douglas Fairbanks Jr hired Genn as a technical adviser on the film Accused (1936). He was subsequently given a small part in the film on the strength of a \\"splendid voice and presence\\". Genn received another small role in Alexander Korda's The Drum (1938) and was the young man who danced with Eliza Doolittle at the duchess's ball in Pygmalion, a film made in the same year, although he was uncredited.

It was established in 1961 as a repository for artifacts relating to the history of Rutherford and the New Jersey Meadowlands region. History A group of parents who belonged to the Rutherford Parent-Teacher Association founded the museum. They collected artifacts of natural history, including local mineral specimens, as well as items relating to the area's Native American heritage. The Yereance-Berry House, 1938. The first location for the museum was a room at Rutherford's Sylvan School, and the collection was known as the Sylvan School Museum and open to students in the Rutherford public schools. In the late 1960s, the school district needed the classroom space once again, and the museum relocated to an office building on Ames Avenue and called itself the Rutherford Museum. In 1974, the museum purchased the Yereance-Berry House at Crane Avenue and Meadow Road. The house, most of which was built in the early 19th century, is on the National Register of Historic Places, although a portion of the house was removed when Crane Avenue was built through to Meadow Road in the 1930s. The museum today The museum's primary mission is to interpret the region's history through educational programs and displays of items relating to that history. As of 2005, the museum has four permanent exhibits: an antique toy room featuring items from the 19th and early 20th century; an exhibit of local rocks and minerals, including fluorescent minerals; a pre-electric kitchen, designed to resemble a kitchen of the early 20th century; and the \\"homespun\\" room, featuring early- to mid-19th-century items such as spinning wheels, dishes, and clothes.

President Clinton had campaigned heavily on health care in the 1992 presidential election. The task force was created in January 1993, but its own processes were somewhat controversial and drew litigation. Its goal was to come up with a comprehensive plan to provide universal health care for all Americans, which was to be a cornerstone of the administration's first-term agenda. The president delivered a major health care speech to the US Congress in September 1993. During his speech he proposed an enforced mandate for employers to provide health insurance coverage to all of their employees. Opposition to the plan was heavy from conservatives, libertarians, and the health insurance industry. The industry produced a highly effective television ad, \\"Harry and Louise\\", in an effort to rally public support against the plan. Instead of uniting behind the original proposal, many Democrats offered a number of competing plans of their own. Hillary Clinton was drafted by the Clinton Administration to head a new Task Force and sell the plan to the American people, which ultimately backfired amid the barrage from the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries and considerably diminished her own popularity. On September 26, 1994, the final compromise Democratic bill was declared dead by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell.  Provisions  left According to an address to Congress by then- President Bill Clinton on September 22, 1993, the proposed bill would provide a \\"health care security card\\" to every citizen that would irrevocably entitle him or her to medical treatment and preventative services, including for pre- existing conditions. To achieve this, the Clinton health plan required each US citizen and permanent resident alien to become enrolled in a qualified health plan on his or her own or through programs mandated to be offered by businesses with more than 5,000 full-time employees. Subsidies were to be provided to those too poor to afford coverage, including complete subsidies for those below a set income level. Users would choose plans offered by regional health alliances to be established by each state. These alliances would purchase insurance coverage for the state's residents and could set fees for doctors who charge per procedure. The act provided funding to be sent to the states for the administration of the plan, beginning at $14 billion in 1993 and reaching $38 billion by 2003. The plan also specified which benefits must be offered; a National Health Board to oversee the quality of health care services; enhanced physician training; the creation of model information systems; federal funding in the case of the insolvency of state programs; rural health programs; long-term care programs; coverage for abortions, with a \\"conscience clause\\" to exempt practitioners with religious objections; malpractice and antitrust reform; fraud prevention measures; and a prescription drug benefit for Medicare, among other features.  Task Force  Bill Clinton made health care reform one of his highest priorities; the First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton chaired the Task Force on National Health Care Reform. Once in office, Bill Clinton quickly set up the Task Force on National Health Care Reform, headed by First Lady Hillary Clinton, to come up with a comprehensive plan to provide universal health care for all Americans, which was to be a cornerstone of the administration's first-term agenda. He delivered a major health care speech to a joint session of Congress on September 22, 1993.Clinton, Bill Address to Joint Session of Congress as Delivered (September 22, 2003). In that speech, he explained the problem: Her leading role in the project was unprecedented for a presidential spouse.Hodgson, Godfrey. The Gentleman from New York: Daniel Patrick Moynihan: a Biography, page 349 (2000): \\"Hillary Clinton was out in front on this project to a degree unprecedented among presidential wives.\\"Bok, Derek. \\"Political Leadership in the Great Health Care Debate of 1993‚Äì1994\\" in Public Discourse in America: Conversation and Community in the Twenty-First Century by Stephen P. Steinberg, Judith Rodin, page 96 (2003): \\"the President took the unprecedented step of naming his wife.\\" This unusual decision by the president to put his wife in charge of the project has been attributed to several factors, such as his desire to emphasize his personal commitment to the enterprise.

Accessed June 10, 2007. Opponents of the bill organized against it before it was presented to the Democratic-controlled Congress on November 20, 1993. The bill was a complex proposal of more than 1,000 pages, the core element of which was an enforced mandate for employers to provide health insurance coverage to all of their employees. The full text of the November 20 bill (the Health Security Act) is available online. H.R.3600 - Health Security Act < (November 20, 1993). Prominent opposition to the Clinton plan was led by William Kristol and his policy group Project for the Republican Future, which is widely credited with orchestrating the plan's defeat through a series of now legendary \\"policy memos\\" faxed to Republican leaders. Conservatives, libertarians, and the health insurance industry proceeded to campaign against the plan, criticizing it as being overly bureaucratic and restrictive of patient choice. The conservative Heritage Foundation argued that \\"the Clinton Administration is imposing a top-down, command-and-control system of global budgets and premium caps, a superintending National Health Board and a vast system of government sponsored regional alliances, along with a panoply of advisory boards, panels, and councils, interlaced with the expanded operations of the agencies of Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor, issuing innumerable rules, regulations, guidelines, and standards.\\"Moffit, Robert. \\"A Guide to the Clinton Health Plan\\" , Heritage Foundation (November 19, 1993) The effort also included extensive advertising criticizing the plan, including the famous \\"Harry and Louise\\" ad, paid for by the Health Insurance Association of America, which depicted a middle-class couple despairing over the plan's complex, bureaucratic nature.Cohn, Jonathan. \\"Hillary was Right ‚Äì The health care plan that dares not speak its name,\\" The New Republic, June 5, 2007.

Meanwhile, instead of uniting behind the President's original proposal, other Democrats offered a number of competing plans of their own. Some criticized the plan from the left, preferring a single-payer healthcare system. Litigation The First Lady's role in the secret proceedings of the Health Care Task Force also sparked litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in relation to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which requires openness in government. The Clinton White House argued that the Recommendation Clause in Article II of the US Constitution would make it unconstitutional to apply the procedural requirements of FACA to her participation in the meetings of the Task Force. Some constitutional experts argued to the court that such a legal theory was not supported by the text, the history, or the structure of the Constitution. Ultimately, Hillary Clinton won the litigation in June 1993, when the D.C. Circuit ruled narrowly that the First Lady could be deemed a government official (and not a mere private citizen) for the purpose of not having to comply with the procedural requirements of FACA.Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, Inc. v.

Also in February 1993, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, along with several other groups, filed a lawsuit against Hillary Clinton and Donna Shalala over closed-door meetings related to the health care plan. The AAPS sued to gain access to the list of members of the task force. In 1997, Judge Royce C.

However, \\"even with Mitchell‚Äôs bill, there were not enough Democratic Senators behind a single proposal to pass a bill, let alone stop a filibuster.\\"Pantel, Kant and Rushefsky, Mark.Politics, Power, and Policy Making: The Case of Health Care Reform in the 1990s (1997). A few weeks later, Mitchell announced that his compromise plan was dead and that health care reform would have to wait at least until the next Congress. The defeat weakened Clinton politically, emboldened Republicans, and contributed to the notion that she was a \\"big-government liberal\\" as decried by conservative opponents.\\"The Evolution of Hillary Clinton,\\" The New York Times, July 13, 2005.

Comprehensive health care reform in the United States was not seriously considered or enacted by Congress until Barack Obama's election in 2008.  Controversy in retrospect and perspective  In 1997, the Clinton administration supported an experimental program in New York that paid medical schools to train fewer doctors to reduce a \\"glut of physicians\\".

For example, politicians were not eager to confront the forces that successfully frustrated the Clinton effort, health maintenance organizations were able to limit cost increases to some extent, and a conservative Republican majority in Congress or a conservative Republican president was in power or in office.Krugman, Paul, and Wells, Robin. \\"The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It\\" , New York Review of Books, March 23, 2006.

It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 10, 1983 and is currently home to the Meadowlands Museum. The house, 91 Crane Avenue at the corner of Meadow Road at the edge of the New Jersey Meadowlands, was inventoried by the Historic American Buildings Survey of the Library of Congress in 1938. At that time, the house was believed to have been built in 1804 and was known variously as the John W. Berry House or the Juria Jurianson House. The Yereance name came from the Yereance family, which at one time owned much of the property in the vicinity of the house. (There is a now- decommissioned Yereance Avenue two blocks north of the house.) However, Rutherford historian Frederick Bunker, in a 1979 report to the Meadowlands Museum, indicated that there was no evidence that a Yereance had ever owned the house. The Historic American Buildings Survey report (#6-468) said that the house was built by John W. Berry, a direct descendant of Major John Berry, who obtained land grants from Governor of New Jersey Philip Carteret in 1668. Berry had previously lived in Barbados and named his grants New Barbadoes, a name that remained in official use until 1826. Berrys Creek is also named after Major Berry. Bunker undertook a deed search of the property at the museum's request. While Bunker was unable to determine an actual construction date, he concluded that the house was likely built in 1818 by Brant Van Blarcom and his wife, the former Getty Van Riper, a daughter of the previous landowner Jacob Van Riper, who died on or about July 8, 1807. The Van Riper homestead was near the Passaic River, across a ridge from Meadow Road. Getty Van Blarcom received the property in 1817 as the result of an orphan's court proceeding that divided Jacob's property. William Berry, who was a direct descendant of John Berry, purchased the property in 1867 for his son Stephen and his wife Margaret. Stephen died in 1872 and Margaret died in 1882; the house was sold at auction in 1891 and was owned by Charles Smithson at the time of the Historic American Buildings Survey. By that time, a new kitchen had been built on the west side of the house, replacing a kitchen that was removed because it was in the right of way of Crane Avenue, which was officially extended east to Meadow Road in the 1930s. The house was purchased by the Rutherford Museum (now the Meadowlands Museum) in 1974, and the museum has maintained the house in addition to commissioning research on its provenance. In 1983, the house was re-surveyed for the Bergen County Stone House Survey (#0256-1), through which it achieved its placement on the National Register of Historic Places. The structure is composed of a brownstone foundation, with brownstone extending up to the water table and brick above it. The interior walls are brick, covered with plaster, and there are interior chimneys made of brick. The house has a gambrel roof.

He is the younger brother of Gawain and Agravain, and the older brother of Gareth and half-brother of Mordred. In Thomas Malory's popular Le Morte d'Arthur, Gaheris is little more than a supporting character to Gawain and Gareth, with the murder of Morgause an odd exception, but his role is greater in the French prose cycles. He and Gareth are both killed by Lancelot during his rescue of Guinevere. A different knight known as Gaheris of Karaheu also appears in the legend.  Origin  It is likely that Gaheris and Gareth were actually the same character in origin, as their names in French sources are easy to confuse Guerrehet (Gareth) and Gaheriet (Gaheris), and adventures ascribed to the brothers are often interchangeable. Furthermore, only one brother is ever named for Gwalchmai ap Gwyar, the character from Welsh mythology traditionally identified with Gawain. This character (Gwalchafed, Gwalhafed, Gwalhavet, Old Welsh for \\"Hawk of Summer\\") is a likely source for Gaheris and Gareth, if Gawain was indeed derived from Gwalchmai. In medieval literature Several of his adventures are narrated in the Lancelot-Grail (Vulgate Cycle). In the Prose Lancelot, Gaheris (Gaheriet) is described as valiant, agile, and handsome (even as \\"his right arm was longer than the left\\"), but reticent in speech and prone to excess when angered. As such, he \\"was the least well spoken of all his peers.\\" In the Vulgate Merlin, he is described as the best warrior among the brothers, and the Prose Tristan notes him as a far better knight than Gawain but nevertheless all the siblings are knighted at once. He is, however, the first of the Orkney clan to be knighted by King Arthur in the Post-Vulgate Cycle. When Gaheris is given flowers sent by the Queen of the Fairy Isle, it is prophesied that he would surpass in goodness and valor all the Knights of the Round Table save for two (presumably Galahad and Lancelot) were it not for the death of his mother which Gaheris will cause through his sin. The young knight sets out in quest of Gawain and Morholt, during which he is twice attacked by his envious brother Agravain but soundly defeats him on each occasion, and eventually rescues both Gawain and Morholt, later accompanying the latter to Ireland. In Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, based on the Post-Vulgate, Gaheris is at first a squire to his elder brother Gawain, whose fiery temper he helps moderate, before being knighted himself. Gaheris later marries the sister of his brother Gareth's wife Lyonors, the haughty damsel Lynette. The Lancelot and the Mort Artu (Death of Arthur) sections of the Lancelot-Grail cycle differ in their characterisation of Gaheris. In the Lancelot, his younger brother Gareth is Gawain's most cherished brother. In the Mort Artu, Gaheris is represented as the most cherished, and his death anguishes Gawain profoundly.Norris J. Lacy, ed., Lancelot-Grail: Lancelot Parts III and IV, pp. 393‚Äì4. \\"They fought with him on foot more than three hours.\\" N. C. Wyeth's The Slaying of Sir Lamorak in The Boy's King Arthur (1922) In the Post-Vulgate tradition, Gaheris participates in the revenge killing of King Pellinore, the slayer of his father King Lot. More notorious is his beheading of his own mother Morgause after catching her in flagrante delicto with Lamorak, Pellinore's handsome son and one of the greatest knights of Arthur. Lamorak meanwhile escapes, but is later hunted down by all of the Orkney brothers except Gareth, believing him to be their mother's murderer, and they fight him until Mordred stabs him in the back; the act that is deemed cowardly and a blot on their honour. When Arthur discovers that Gaheris is Morgause's killer, he is banished from court. Gaheris is then himself nearly beheaded in revenge for their mother's death by Mordred and Agravain when Gareth convinces Gawain to order them to stop. Despite being exiled, Gaheris appears later in the narrative as a one-time companion of Percival on the Grail Quest. He is also a friend of Tristan in the Prose Tristan. Its Belarusian version Povest' o Tryschane features him as Arthur's son rather than his nephew, by the name Garnet. \\"Queen Guenever's Peril.\\" Alfred Kappes' illustration for The Boy's King Arthur (1880) His death during Lancelot's rescue of Queen Guinevere from being burned at the stake is related in the Mort Artu, the final volume of the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate prose cycles.Norris J. Lacy, ed. and trans., Lancelot-Grail: The Death of Arthur, Volume 7 of Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2010, p. 69-70. . While Gawain and Gareth will have nothing to do with Agravain and Mordred's plot to entrap Lancelot and Guinevere (in the English Stanzaic Morte Arthur, Gaheris also sides with them), Arthur asks the all brothers of Mordred to help guard the queen's execution. Gaheris and Gareth reluctantly agree, though Gawain refuses. When Lancelot rushes to save the woman whom he loves, he cuts down the Orkney princes; in the Vulgate Mort Artu, Gaheris' helmet is first knocked off by Hector de Maris and then his head is split by Lancelot himself. The surviving brother Gawain's fury is terrible and the resulting feud leads to the destruction of Arthur's kingdom. In the Post-Vulgate version of the Mort Artu, a knight from North Wales confusingly also named Gaheris takes the vacant Round Table seat that had belonged to Gaheris of Orkney after the death of the latter. That \\"new\\" Gaheris participates in the following civil war on Arthur's side.  Gaheris of Karaheu  Gaheris, the brother of Gawain, should not be confused with a different character in the Mort Artu, Gaheris of Karaheu (Carahan, Caraheu, Carehew, Karehan), a minor Knight of the Round Table and brother of Mador de la Porte. In the Vulgate Lancelot, Gawain saves him from Galehaut, while the White Knight (that is, Lancelot) rescues him from the Dolorous Prison near Dolorous Gard and then again from the Vale of No Return. Later, in the Vulgate Mort Artu, he dies from eating a poisoned fruit that was destined for Gawain by the knight named Avarlan and was offered to him unknowingly by Guinevere.Frappier, pp 75‚Äì6, 291. This episode is also included in Stanzaic Morte Arthur and in Le Morte d'Arthur, however in these texts the victim is, respectively, either an unnamed visiting Scottish knight or a certain Patrise of Ireland (the poisoner is also renamed by Malory as Pionel). The story might have been inspired by account of the poisoning death of Walwen (the later Gawain) as told in the chronicle Gesta Regum Anglorum.  In modern stories * T. H. White's The Once and Future King attributes the act of matricide to Agravaine instead of Gaheris. White gives his own individual interpretation to the story, depicting Agravaine as having an unhealthy love/lust obsession for his own mother, and repeatedly describes Gaheris as \\"dull\\" or \\"dull-witted\\". * In the film First Knight (1995), Gaheris is portrayed by Alexis Denisof. He participates at the final battle for Camelot and survives against Malagant and his army. * In Gerald Morris' The Squire's Tales, Gaheris is one of the main heroes, a witty, quietly brave man who prefers agriculture to sword fighting.

The album sold 10,000 copies its first day and became Lookout!'s biggest selling release. After debuting it to their fans in the Berkeley, California, area and receiving much approval from the critical 924 Gilman Street crowd, the band packed up in a cramped, converted Bookmobile and headed east. Green Day developed a fan base on the east coast by way of the determined grassroots efforts of lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong. The opportunity paid off as album sales reached over 50,000 copies. Along with the successful live shows, major labels took notice of Kerplunk's phenomenal popularity. As a result, many labels approached the band. Green Day realized that they had outgrown their record distribution capacity with Lookout! and eventually signed with Reprise Records. With Reprise, Green Day recorded and released their next album Dookie (1994). Kerplunk officially includes only 12 tracks, but the versions released on CD and cassette also include the 4 tracks from the Sweet Children EP. One of those tracks is a cover of The Who's \\"My Generation\\".

There were no official singles released from the album, although \\"2000 Light Years Away\\" and \\"Christie Road\\" were released as mock-up singles in a Green Day singles box set entitled Green Day: Ultimate Collectors. In November 2017, to coincide with the band's second compilation Greatest Hits: God's Favorite Band, a music video was released for \\"2000 Light Years Away\\". As of November 2013, Kerplunk has sold more than 1,000,000 copies in the United States and more than 4,000,000 copies worldwide. The album has gone on to be among the best selling independently released albums of all time.  Artwork  Kerplunk was banned from certain stores because of the cover art. The cover features a mostly white picture (with some green added in) of a high school girl with a gun that has been fired. On the back cover, there is a boy lying on the ground with a gunshot wound on his back.  Reception  AllMusic regards Kerplunk as the \\"perfect dry run\\" for the band's later mainstream appeal, saying it contains \\"both more variety and more flat-out smashes than previous releases had shown.\\" Pitchfork Media states \\"All in all, it's a magnitude better than its predecessor and only a hair behind the follow up.\\" In December 2007, Blender magazine ranked the album number 47 on their \\"The 100 Greatest Indie Rock Albums Ever\\" list.

Population: It was previously known as Kudelka (Sliver) (until 1928). Etymology The town is named for its asbestos industry. History It was founded in 1889 as Kudelka (). It was given its present name in 1928 and granted town status in 1933. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of the administrative divisions, it is, together with the work settlements of Malysheva and Reftinsky and five rural localities, incorporated as the Town of Asbest‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #30-OZ As a municipal division, Asbest and two rural localities are incorporated as Asbestovsky Urban Okrug.Law #85-OZ The urban-type settlement of Malysheva, together with three other rural localities, is incorporated separately as Malyshevsky Urban Okrug, and the urban-type settlement of Reftinsky is incorporated separately as Reftinsky Urban Okrug. Economy Today's Asbest is a large industrial center. Joint-stock company Uralasbest is the main industrial enterprise. The chrysotile (asbestos) mine adjacent to the town is the subject of published, peer-reviewed scientific investigations about its detrimental health impact on the local population and is said to be the world's largest. The adjacent open-pit Uralasbest mine is said to be \\"seven miles (11 km) long and 1 to 1.5 miles (2.5 km) wide, (and) it is nearly half the size of Manhattan ‚Äî and more than a thousand feet (300 meters) deep\\". Other factories include UralATI, Zarechny, Asbostroy, Asbestovskaya poultry processing plant, and a ferroconcrete production factory. Asbestos, bricks, porcelain, furniture, metal constructions, and other products are produced in Asbest. Education and recreation The town is home to the Uralasbest stadium, which seats ten thousand people. Educational facilities include music schools, a school of art, an Olympic school, an institute of science and research, professional schools, and colleges of mining and economics. There are two museums: a geological museum and a museum of local lore. History Walter Arnold Rukeyser, an engineer with extensive experience with asbestos in Quebec, worked in Asbest in 1929, and again in 1930. His memoir of his times there, Working for the Soviets ; an American engineer in Russia, was published in 1932 and reprinted in 1952. Following World War II, the Soviet Union operated the prisoner-of-war camps 84 and 314 near Asbest. In addition, from May 1950 until April 1953, up to 7700 inmates were imprisoned in the Bazhenovsky ITL gulag. Inmates had to work for the local asbestos industry, more than 15,000 died due to the conditions, including asbestos-related diseases.

The first lineup of the band also included guitarist Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski. This lineup released two albums, Saturate (2002) and We Are Not Alone (2004), before Hummel was replaced by Chad Szeliga in 2005. The band released two more studio albums, Phobia (2006) and Dear Agony (2009), before entering an extended hiatus in early 2010 due to Burnley's recurring illnesses.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music- features/breaking-benjamin-battle-mystery-illness-on-painful-road-to-number- one-40812/ The release of a compilation album amid the hiatus, Shallow Bay: The Best of Breaking Benjamin (2011), unauthorized by Burnley, brought about legal trouble within the band resulting in the dismissal of Fink and Klepaski. Szeliga later announced his departure in 2013 citing creative differences. Burnley remained the sole member of the band until late 2014, when the current lineup was announced, including bassist and backing vocalist Aaron Bruch, guitarist and backing vocalist Keith Wallen, guitarist Jasen Rauch, and drummer Shaun Foist. The band afterward released Dark Before Dawn (2015) and Ember (2018), which debuted at number one and three on the Billboard 200, respectively. Following these albums, the band released another compilation, Aurora (2020), featuring reworked acoustic versions of past songs along with one original new song. Despite significant lineup changes, the band's musical style and lyrical content have remained consistent, with Burnley serving as the primary composer and lead vocalist since the band's inception. The band has commonly been noted for its formulaic hard rock tendencies with angst- heavy lyrics, swelling choruses, and \\"crunching\\" guitars. In the United States alone, the band has sold more than 7 million units and yielded three RIAA- certified platinum records, two gold records, and several certified singles, including two multi-platinum, two platinum, and five gold. The band has also produced one number one record on the Billboard 200. History =Formation and Saturate (1998‚Äì2003)= Benjamin Burnley was originally in a band named Breaking Benjamin in 1998 that played \\"softer music\\" such as Weezer and The Beatles covers, and was \\"nothing like\\" subsequent lineups. The name originates from an incident in which Burnley broke a borrowed microphone, prompting its owner to retort, \\"Thanks to Benjamin for breaking my fucking mic.\\" This band included guitarist Aaron Fink, bassist Nick Hoover, and drummer Chris Lightcap, but soon broke up when Burnley moved to California. After returning to Pennsylvania with drummer Jeremy Hummel, Burnley formed Plan 9, which also included bassist Jason Davoli. Plan 9, a reference to Plan 9 from Outer Space, was continually misnamed as \\"Planet 9\\", therefore the group reclaimed the name Breaking Benjamin from the previous band, as Burnley still had promotional stickers with that name. The three-piece first gained attention when Freddie Fabbri, a DJ for active rock radio station WBSX, put the group's track \\"Polyamorous\\" in rotation. After it became the number one requested track on the station, Fabbri financed the recording of the group's eponymous EP, which sold all 2,000 copies that were printed in 2001. Jonathan \\"Bug\\" Price was credited on bass, replacing Davoli. After growing dissatisfied with their previous band, former bandmate Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski joined Breaking Benjamin. In early 2002, over a dozen record companies visited a two- night showcase where Breaking Benjamin was playing, and the group subsequently signed with Hollywood Records. Shortly afterward, Breaking Benjamin began recording their first full-length major-label record, Saturate, which was released on August 7, 2002 and produced by Ulrich Wild. It peaked at No. 136 on the Billboard 200, and was later certified gold on September 25, 2015. In early 2003, Breaking Benjamin participated in the J√§germeister Music Tour, then toured as a supporting act for Godsmack. Of the little media coverage received, Saturate garnered positive reception, with Jason Taylor from AllMusic stating that the album \\"has serious potential to become one of 2002's most successful debuts,\\" feeling that \\"although it is repetitive and generic, it is undeniably addictive\\", ultimately scoring the album 2.5 out of 5. The disc received a favorable review from Schwegweb's Vin Cherubino, who noted, \\"The music has just as much quality as any popular artist in the same genre. Influences from bands such as Tool can be heard, making the music seem all so familiar and palatable.\\" =We Are Not Alone (2003‚Äì2005)= Breaking Benjamin returned to the studio in October 2003 with producer David Bendeth for their second album We Are Not Alone. Burnley also worked with The Smashing Pumpkins front man Billy Corgan over the course of six days in December 2003 to write the songs \\"Rain\\", \\"Forget It\\", and \\"Follow\\". Despite initially being nervous, Burnley felt it was one of the highlights of his career. Breaking Benjamin performing at the Minnesota State Fair on August 25, 2005. The album was released on June 29, 2004 and sold 48,000 copies in its first week, peaking at No. 20 on the Billboard 200. It was later certified gold on October 21, 2004, then platinum on June 13, 2005. It was also certified gold in New Zealand on August 29, 2005. The record features singles such as \\"So Cold\\" and \\"Sooner or Later\\", both of which peaked at No. 2 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart. \\"So Cold\\" became a platinum single on September 25, 2015. MTV writer Jon Wiederhorn writes that the initial commercial success of the album can be attributed to a tour two weeks prior to the album's debut which \\"generated prerelease buzz\\". They later co-headlined a tour with Evanescence, Seether, and Three Days Grace. We Are Not Alone garnered mixed reviews. It was met with high acclaim from IGN's Colin Moriarty, who felt \\"extremely satisfied,\\" saying \\"safely and confidently\\" that it \\"might be my personal favorite album of the year,\\" giving it a score of 9.3 out of 10. Conversely, Exclaim! writer Amber Authier felt that, \\"On first listen its simply generic sound did nothing for me,\\" though later admitted, \\"I listened to Breaking Benjamin several times over a week and several elements of the disc started to grow on me, even appeal to me.\\" The writer concluded, \\"Breaking Benjamin created a standard of quality for themselves that they simply couldn't meet on the entire disc.\\" On November 3, 2004, a non-album single named \\"Blow Me Away\\" was released, to commercial success, ultimately going gold on November 24, 2015. On November 23, 2004, Breaking Benjamin released the So Cold EP, which features live versions of the songs \\"Away\\" and \\"Breakdown\\", a live acoustic version of \\"So Cold\\", and studio acoustic recordings of \\"Blow Me Away\\" and \\"Lady Bug\\". In late 2005, drummer Hummel filed a federal lawsuit against Breaking Benjamin. According to the lawsuit, Hummel requested earlier that year to take a paternity leave to be with his wife during the birth of their first child, to which all members of the band agreed and hired Kevin Soffera as a temporary substitute on drums. However, Burnley later called Hummel and terminated him, citing chemistry issues. In the lawsuit, Hummel contended wrongful termination and lack of compensation for profits accrued by We Are Not Alone and other non-album tracks that appeared in Halo 2 and National Treasure: Book of Secrets. The band's manager, Larry Mazer (who was also named in the lawsuit), asserted that the lawsuit was \\"totally frivolous\\" and his termination had \\"nothing to do with the paternity leave.\\" Mazer said the band received no payment for the Halo 2 appearance, adding that the song was included for promotional reasons and Burnley was happy to have it in the video game. The band received minimal payment for the National Treasure 2 appearance, and Mazer stated that otherwise, \\"[Hummel] is 100 per cent current.\\" Ben \\"B.C.\\" Vaught served as a sit-in drummer for the band, and they later toured with 3 Doors Down and Staind in November 2005. The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount in April 2006. =Phobia (2005‚Äì2007)= After the departure of Jeremy Hummel, Breaking Benjamin auditioned fifteen drummers, of whom Chad Szeliga stood out for his ability as a stage performer and the fact that he had \\"serious problem-solving skills\\", according to Burnley. The group's next album, Phobia, was again produced by Bendeth and was the first to be recorded with Szeliga. The concept of the album is dedicated to Burnley's various phobias. The cover of the album depicts a winged man suspended over a runway, which represents the singer's fear of flying. Burnley also suffers from death anxiety, a fear of the dark, driving anxiety, and hypochondriasis. Burnley cites his fear of flying as for why he did not perform overseas, saying, \\"I'll go as far as a boat will take me\\", though at the time the band's record label had not facilitated travel by boat. Phobia's \\"Intro\\" and \\"Outro\\" tracks feature sound effects of an airport intercom, airplane turbulance, car doors, and crowd panic. Phobia was released on August 8, 2006 to commercial success. The album sold more than 131,000 copies in its first week of sales and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. It went gold on November 8, 2006, then platinum on May 21, 2009. Its lead single, \\"The Diary of Jane\\", peaked at No. 2 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart and was the fastest single added to radio playlists in the history of Hollywood Records, later receiving a double platinum certification on November 24, 2015. \\"Breath\\", the record's second single, spent seven weeks at No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart, and went platinum on November 24, 2015. The third single, \\"Until the End\\", peaked at No. 6 on the same chart, and became a gold single on February 11, 2014. In February 2007 in support of Phobia, AXS TV (then known as HDNet) aired a one- hour Breaking Benjamin concert from Stabler Arena in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The broadcast recording was included on the re-released Phobia DVD in April, billed as \\"The Homecoming\\". A music video was created for \\"Breath\\" which was made from footage of the song's performance at the show. Breaking Benjamin followed with Spring and Fall tours alongside Three Days Grace, accompanied by Puddle of Mudd during the Spring tour, and Seether, Skillet, and Red during the Fall tour. Phobia received mixed critical reception. It received praise for general composition and musicianship but received criticism for a lack of originality. AllMusic's Corey Apar found the album \\"nothing if not consistent,\\" and while generally regarding the disc with positive sentiments, noted a lack of distinction from the \\"rest of the post-grunge/alt-metal pack\\" aside from \\"a certain charm\\". IGN's Spence D. gave the disc a negative review, citing tedium and lack of vocal distinction, feeling that the group's \\"intersection of hard rock and emo-oriented introspection\\" is \\"not a bad thing, but also not a terribly memorable or earth-shattering one, either.\\" However, the writer praised the musicianship of Fink, Klepaski, and Szeliga, ultimately giving the album a score of 5.7 out of 10. Entertainment Weekly graded the album C+ and noted its angst-ridden themes, saying, \\"as pathological angst goes, it's expertly done, with expansive choruses and epic riffs ‚Äì not that that matters, when, like, we're all going to die cold and alone anyway.\\" =Dear Agony (2009‚Äì2010)= Breaking Benjamin performing in Fort Wayne, Indiana in January 2010. Breaking Benjamin began working on a fourth album, titled Dear Agony, in 2009. It was the first album Burnley wrote while completely sober. In 2007, Burnley experienced fatigue and phosphenes following three consecutive days of no sleep and heavy drinking, after which he decided to remain sober. Burnley acknowledged an improved clarity and coherence within Dear Agony due to his sobriety. The album cover features Burnley's brain scan, representing the recurrent themes on Dear Agony related to the singer's chronic illnesses caused by alcohol consumption. Burnley collaborated with then-Red guitarist Jasen Rauch on various tracks for Dear Agony: The two equally wrote together the songs \\"Without You\\" and \\"Hopeless\\", and Rauch wrote the outro for \\"I Will Not Bow\\", also helping write \\"Lights Out\\". Burnley said of the collaboration, \\"I love writing with him because he does stuff exactly like I would've done,\\" adding, \\"writing-wise, we're like the same person.\\" Dear Agony was released on September 9, 2009, and peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard 200. The disc initially outsold its predecessor in its first week, moving more than 134,000 copies. It ultimately achieved gold certification on February 16, 2010. The album's lead single \\"I Will Not Bow\\" reached No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart, and went platinum on November 24, 2015. The other two singles, \\"Lights Out\\" and \\"Give Me a Sign\\", peaked at No. 9 and No. 6 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart, respectively (the latter of which also receiving a gold certification on November 24, 2015). Breaking Benjamin toured in support of the album in January and February 2010 with Three Days Grace and Flyleaf, then with Red, Chevelle, and Thousand Foot Krutch in March 2010. In April, Breaking Benjamin began touring with Nickelback, Shinedown, and Sick Puppies on their Dark Horse Tour. Prior to the last show of the Dark Horse Tour, Burnley stated he was ill and therefore no longer able to tour in support of the album, placing the band on hiatus. After internet rumors began to circulate that the band had broken up, Burnley released a statement \\"officially letting everyone know that Breaking Benjamin has not broken up.\\" Dear Agony received mixed critical reception. AllMusic's James Monger gave the album a positive review, stating it \\"feels a lot like their first three\\", noting a consistency that \\"feels like a well- oiled machine.\\" The disc received a negative review from Consequence of Sound's Alex Young, who complained of over-production and the disc's sell-out nature at the hands of three-time Breaking Benjamin producer David Bendeth: \\"Dear Agony is the unfortunate side effect of a trend in 'producer' David Bendeth's world, training wild chimpanzees to be more tasteful whilst handling silverware\\", ultimately giving the record a half-star \\"for teaching Breaking Benjamin's peers who not to hire for production credit.\\" About Entertainment gave the record a mixed review, feeling that \\"Though it lacks the breakthrough singles of Phobia, Dear Agony does have its moments,\\" adding, \\"frustratingly, Dear Agony never reaches greatness, settling for an admirable competency that's still the envy of many of their contemporaries.\\" =Hiatus and Shallow Bay (2010‚Äì2013)= In March 2010, Hollywood Records requested that the band produce two new master recordings and a greatest hits album, and sought permission to release a new version of the hit song \\"Blow Me Away\\" featuring Sydnee Duran of Valora. In May 2011, Fink and Klepaski granted the record company's requests after they were offered a $100,000 payment. Burnley, alleging that Fink and Klepaski acted unilaterally on both the song remix and the compilation album, not informing him or the band's management, fired the two via email, demanding at least $250,000 in punitive fees and compensatory damages, as well as the exclusive right to the name Breaking Benjamin. Fink and Klepaski's attorneys stated the two \\"dispute and strictly deny\\" Burnley's allegations, instead asserting that a January 2009 agreement (allowing Burnley to dismiss them for \\"just cause\\") was no longer valid because of the singer's status of indefinite hiatus. The case was ordered by a judge to arbitration. Burnley's attorney, Brian Caplan, told the Associated Press, \\"The relationship between Mr. Burnley and the two other members of the band has ended ... Mr. Burnley intends on moving forward using the name Breaking Benjamin and the band will continue. It just won't continue in its prior configuration. He's not retiring.\\" In August 2011, Hollywood Records scheduled the release of the Shallow Bay: The Best of Breaking Benjamin compilation album, featuring every single from the band's catalog, including the remix of \\"Blow Me Away\\". A two- disc deluxe edition was released alongside it, with the second disc containing altered versions of b-sides and rarities. Burnley publicly opposed the album's release, saying content had been altered without his consent and did not meet his standards. Burnley later elaborated, saying that the rarities were taken off of his laptop without his consent, and were intended for in-studio reference and not public release, but that he was otherwise content with previously-released tracks on Shallow Bay. The album was released on August 16, 2011 and peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard 200, also topping the Hard Rock Albums chart in 2011, 2012, and 2013. The disc received positive critical reception. The Daily Trojan's Krishna Jetti praised it for balance and a progressive retrospective history. AllMusic's Gregory Heaney felt similarly, saying, \\"Shallow Bay is a great jumping-on point for new fans, capturing the band at their height delivering some of their best moments in one convenient package. For older fans, this collection may just serve as a reminder of a crucial turning point in Breaking Benjamin's career.\\" In April 2013, Burnley announced that the dispute involving Fink and Klepaski was resolved and that he would retain the right to continue the band under the name Breaking Benjamin. Three days later, Szeliga announced his departure, citing creative differences. =Return and Dark Before Dawn (2014‚Äì2016)= In August 2014, Breaking Benjamin announced via Facebook that the band reformed as a quintet with, except for Burnley, all new members, including: Dear Agony co-writer Jasen Rauch (guitar, originally from Red); Keith Wallen (guitar and backing vocals, originally from Adelitas Way); Aaron Bruch (bass and backing vocals); and Shaun Foist (drums, originally from Picture Me Broken). Burnley said of the lineup: \\"Everybody that's in the band now is deliberately handpicked,\\" noting that \\"Keith [Wallen] and Aaron [Bruch] are really, really amazing singers. That's kind of what the band always needed.\\" On March 18, 2015, a new single entitled \\"Failure\\" as well as a new album, Dark Before Dawn, were announced for release on March 23 and June 23, respectively. Breaking Benjamin performing at Rock am Ring in Germany 2016. The new lineup debuted with acoustic shows in late 2014, then went on a four-venue winter tour in the north-eastern United States. The band afterward announced 2015 spring, summer, and fall tour dates, supported by bands such as Young Guns and Starset. In July 2015, the band announced their first overseas performance, in which they headlined a four-day cruise venue in February 2016 along with Yngwie Malmsteen, Zakk Wylde, Flyleaf, et al. The band also performed on a joint U.S. tour with Shinedown in October and November along with Sevendust, and proceeded to play further outside of the United States in June 2016 at venues such as the Download Festival in the United Kingdom, Rock am Ring in Germany, and Nova Rock in Austria. Burnley explained that writing for Dark Before Dawn was intermittent and fragmentary, taking place throughout the hiatus, though it was toward the end of the hiatus in 2013 when it became cohesive. After growing frustrated with the lack of answers regarding his health condition, Burnley decided to abandon searching for a diagnosis and focus on the album. Recorded and produced at a personal studio of Burnley's, Dark Before Dawn is the first album with the front man credited as the producer. The singer stated that \\"I would say that I did the same amount of producing on this album as I've done on other albums, just never had my name [on it]\\", adding, \\"You know, I'm not doing anything different here than I have done in the past. Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it?\\" Within an hour of pre-order availability, Dark Before Dawn reached No. 1 on the rock albums chart on iTunes and No. 3 on the overall album chart. It sold 135,000 pure album units and 141,000 equivalent album units in its first week, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, making the album the group's heretofore most successful sales effort. It achieved gold certification on August 18, 2016. The disc's lead single \\"Failure\\" spent nine weeks at No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart as well. Billboard's Jason Lipshutz felt the album's success was \\"eyebrow- raising\\", noting that, in addition to the band's lineup change, \\"135,000 in pure album sales is a hefty number in 2015 ‚Äì it's a bigger number than the respective bows of recent Madonna, ASAP Rocky, and Kelly Clarkson albums\\". Joe DeTomaso, program director of active rock station WAQX-FM, added that, \\"They've always been a top-level band for the format, but not quite on the level of Disturbed or Shinedown or bands like that. They always seem to put out hit records without getting the kind of recognition that they deserved.\\" Forbes' Hugh McIntyre writes that runner-up Tori Kelly's 75,000 copies \\"puts Breaking Benjamin's figures into perspective\\" and that despite \\"a pretty extensive lineup change, it looks like fans were awaiting their return with open arms.\\" The album was met with mostly positive critical reception, many critics praising the album for staying true to the group's sound, though others criticized it for sounding too similar to previous material. Dan Marsicano from About Entertainment stated, \\"Burnley could have made his creation just another dose of the glitzy, overproduced crap that is heard on every rock radio station in the world. Instead, Breaking Benjamin hardly deviate from the hooky jams that were present on Dear Agony.\\" Conversely, AllMusic's James Monger felt that \\"it's hard to conceal the fact that most of these songs are nearly interchangeable with the band's older material.\\" Revolver's Jeremy Borjon felt that \\"the music's true force only becomes apparent through deeper and repeated listenings, as the songs, on the surface, have a tendency to blend into one another.\\" =Ember (2017‚Äì2018)= The group's sixth studio album was first revealed to be completed in August 2017. The band toured with Avenged Sevenfold and Bullet For My Valentine on their North American tour, following with a U.S. mini-tour with 10 Years, and then a tour with Five Finger Death Punch beginning in the second quarter of 2018. In December 2017, Ember and its lead single \\"Red Cold River\\" were announced for release in the second quarter of 2018 and January 5, 2018, respectively. On January 26, \\"Feed the Wolf\\" was released as a pre-order bonus, along with a release date for the album of April 13, 2018. Three subsequent songs‚Äî\\"Blood\\", \\"Psycho\\", and \\"Save Yourself\\"‚Äîwere released ahead of the album as promotional releases. It sold 88,000 units in its first week of sales, debuting at No. 3 on the Billboard 200. \\"Red Cold River\\" peaked at No. 2 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart, and No. 5 on the Hot Rock Songs chart. Writing for the album began in 2016, with recording primarily happening in 2017. While Burnley remained the primary composer for the album, he stated that around half of it was written by the rest of the band. Burnley returned to producing for the album, along with the rest of the band, a first for the group. Rauch commented that the album pushes the boundaries with heavier material than the band's done in the past. He said \\"playing-wise, it's the most difficult album\\", and that they took advantage of the three-guitar player dynamic, but that the album nonetheless does not depart from Breaking Benjamin's established sound. Burnley explained that there was demand for heavier material from fans, and that the group was happy to reflect that. He later explained that he believed fans gravitated to the heavier side of the band, but that \\"we also make sure to explore our melodic and softer side too\\", saying that the album seeks to give both sides to the furthest degree. Burnley stated that he chose Ember as the album title as something that could be the end of something or the start of it, but emphasized an intentional ambiguity to leave it open to interpretation. Official music videos were released for singles \\"Red Cold River\\", \\"Torn in Two\\", and \\"Tourniquet\\" on January 18, April 12, and December 13, respectively, with Burnley explaining that they are part of a three-part continuity. The music video for \\"Torn in Two\\" is a continuation of a narrative started by \\"Red Cold River\\", and features references to all of Breaking Benjamin's past music videos. \\"Tourniquet\\" concludes the trilogy as a sequel to both previous videos. Dancer and actor Derek Hough (who had previously covered \\"Ashes of Eden\\" in a choreographed music video) has an appearance on the album, saying that the opportunity was \\"a dream come true\\". Burnley later explained that he reached out to Hough after seeing his cover of \\"Ashes of Eden\\", and that the song he is featured on is \\"The Dark of You\\". Louder Than Life in 2019. Ember received mostly positive critical reception, and was noted both for its familiarity and its heavier stylistic shift. AllMusic's Neil Yeung gave a generally favorable review but emphasized its familiarity, saying, \\"As far as variety goes, this is a fairly standard collection of tunes from a band that is mainly concerned with giving fans what they want and expect.\\" Conversely, Loudwire's Chad Childers called Ember \\"a heavy record‚Äînot just in terms of sound where you could argue that they've never sounded heavier, but also in terms of lyrical content\\", saying the group is \\"proving that they're better (and yes, heavier) than ever with plenty still left to say.\\" Luke Nuttall of The Soundboard gave the album a mixed review, saying, \\"Even the most dedicated diehard has to admit that this is far from groundbreaking or any sort of departure from their past material, and such an unashamed recycling of work seldom leads to positive results\\", but adding that, \\"Ember manages to elevate above radio-rock‚Äôs most uninspired efforts, but this is purely for those who‚Äôve been there all the way through; for everyone else, it‚Äôs there to embrace or avoid as per want.\\" =Aurora (2018‚Äîpresent)= In an interview in December 2018, Burnley stated there will be an album of acoustic renditions of past songs in 2019. In July 2019, Burnley confirmed during a radio interview that the new acoustic album will feature collaborations from Red, Underoath, Saint Asonia, and Lacey Sturm. The band's 2019 North American headline tour with Chevelle and Three Days Grace went from July 21 to September 25. On October 28, 2019, the band officially announced the album Aurora via their official social media pages, with a release date of January 24, 2020. They also announced their 2020 co-headlining North American tour with Korn. On December 6, 2019, the band released \\"Far Away\\" featuring Scooter Ward of Cold, the first single from Aurora. On January 10, 2020, the band released an acoustic version of \\"Red Cold River\\" featuring Spencer Chamberlain of Underoath. In March 2020, they announced their summer 2020 tour, with Bush, Theory of a Deadman, Saint Asonia, and Cory Marks. On May 19, 2020, the band announced the cancellation of the tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic.https://loudwire.com/breaking-benjamin-cancel-2020-tour- dates/ On July 10, 2020, the band released a cover of the Goo Goo Dolls' \\"Iris\\", with singer Diamante. Characteristics =Musical style= Breaking Benjamin's musical style is primarily classified as hard rock; ; ; ; ; ; ; . and alternative rock,; ; ; ; ; ; ; . more specifically post-grunge; ; ; ; . and alternative metal,; ; ; ; . and has commonly been noted for its consistency. Corey Apar felt that \\"Breaking Benjamin are nothing if not consistent\\", and Alex Young felt that \\"Breaking Benjamin is one of the few modern rock bands on the radio that, if you have heard any song in its catalog prior, could be immediately recognized.\\" Despite a complete lineup change prior to the release of Dark Before Dawn, Dan Marsicano stated, \\"Breaking Benjamin hardly deviate from the hooky jams that were present on Dear Agony. They have had an established sound since their breakout We Are Not Alone ‚Äì hard-edged riffs with emotional upheaval ‚Äì and that isn't tampered with on Dark Before Dawn.\\" Their style is described by Apar as \\"mixing heavy hard rock dynamics with a moody demeanor that never slips into full-on dejection.\\" Spence D. characterizes the band as \\"[persisting] in delivering crunching guitars topped off with somewhat generic, angst-ridden [lyrics] that waffle between being plaintive and aggressive\\" with vocals that \\"[deliver] just the right amount of emotion, fluctuating between contemplative subjectivity and growling anger.\\" Young felt that Breaking Benjamin is \\"indicative of early '00s modern rock, while also now and then being more Filter-esque or technically proficient, primarily on guitar during 2002's Saturate, and from then on with bass and drums.\\" Breaking Benjamin's style was described by The Wall Street Journal in 2020 as \\"a subgenre of rock 'n' roll, often called 'active rock'... the genre includes bands like Disturbed, Five Finger Death Punch and Three Days Grace, hard rockers who growl and yell, but can be as tender and emotive as Coldplay.\\" =Composition= Burnley is the primary songwriter in the band. Music industry attorney and author Martin Frascogna writes that \\"it's unmistakably clear that Burnley started the group, is the creative force behind the group and essentially dictates the group's decisions.\\" Bands such as Nirvana, Live, Bush, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, and The Beatles have been cited as influences.; . Burnley remarked in 2009 that while the other band members did contribute, it was \\"always left up to me to put all the pieces together and make it so that it's even anything at all.\\" However, Burnley expressed how he considered Rauch to be his \\"writing partner\\" during Dear Agony, and that he looked forward to writing with him in the future. After joining the band in 2014 as part of the new lineup, Rauch provided writing contributions on Dark Before Dawn, writing the intro and outro tracks as well as riffs on two other tracks. Burnley revealed in 2015 that the whole band would write songs for Breaking Benjamin in the future, and that \\"It just so happens that when they came on board for this album, I was already 95 percent done\\", adding, \\"I'm really looking forward to writing the next one all together.\\" 2018's Ember represents the band's first effort with full composition credit given to members other than Burnley. Breaking Benjamin's lyrical content evolved as a product of Burnley's sobriety, the front man noting that the lyricism in Dear Agony is more thought out. Rito Asilo of the Inquirer writes that Burnley \\"owes the improved clarity and coherence in Breaking Benjamin's music to sobriety.\\" Burnley has said that before sobriety, anything that made sense thematically was a coincidence, and that he would take shots if he were dissatisfied with a lyric. Breaking Benjamin's lyrics have been noted for their vague, angst-heavy themes,; ; . Burnley saying that \\"I try to keep my writing vague so people can draw their own conclusions.\\" =Live performance= Rhythm guitarist and vocalist Keith Wallen performing in 2016. Breaking Benjamin's live sound has corresponded with lineup arrangements. The band originally lacked backing vocalists and tertiary instrumentation, requiring them to rely on pre-recorded tracks during live performances. However, the band was noted for a change in such respects with the second iteration of the band assembled in 2014.; ; ; ; ; Bruch and Wallen were selected in part for their ability as singers, providing all backing vocals on both new studio recordings and during live shows. Burnley noted that it was important to add two new singers in order to replicate vocal techniques such as three-part harmonies, octave range, and layered vocals. Rauch, acting as a third guitarist, provides the band with \\"more freedom while simultaneously thickening up their live sound\\", as some songs feature three guitar parts, layered guitars, or are meant to feature Burnley only performing vocals, such as \\"I Will Not Bow\\" and \\"Lights Out\\". Foist utilizes Roland V-Kit electronic drums during live performances and triggers certain sounds as heard in studio recordings, such as the piano notes in \\"Breakdown\\". Additionally, Rauch is equipped with a Roland GR-55 guitar synthesizer allowing him to play orchestral strings and choir sound effects, further eliminating any reliance on pre-recorded tracks.

It is often abbreviated to J$, the J serving to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. It is divided into 100 cents, although cent denominations are no longer in use as of 2018.  Exchange rate  History The history of currency in Jamaica should not be considered in isolation of the wider picture in the British West Indies as a whole. See British West Indies dollar. The peculiar feature about Jamaica was the fact that it was the only British West Indies territory to use special issues of the sterling coinage, apart from the four-pence groat coin which was specially issued for all the British West Indies, and later only for British Guiana. The earliest money in Jamaica was Spanish copper coins called maraved√≠es. This relates to the fact that for nearly four hundred years Spanish dollars, known as pieces of eight were in widespread use on the world's trading routes, including the Caribbean Sea region. However, following the revolutionary wars in Latin America, the source of these silver trade coins dried up. The last Spanish dollar was minted at the Potos√≠ mint in 1825. The United Kingdom had adopted a very successful gold standard in 1821, so 1825 was an opportune time to introduce the British sterling coinage into all the British colonies. An imperial order-in-council was passed in that year for the purposes of facilitating this aim by making sterling coinage legal tender in the colonies at the specified rating of $1 = 4s 4d (one Spanish dollar to four shillings and four pence sterling). As the sterling silver coins were attached to a gold standard, this exchange rate did not realistically represent the value of the silver in the Spanish dollars as compared to the value of the gold in the British gold sovereign, and as such, the order-in-council had the reverse effect in many colonies. It had the effect of actually driving sterling coinage out, rather than encouraging its circulation. Remedial legislation had to be introduced in 1838 so as to change over to the more realistic rating of $1 = 4s 2d. However, in Jamaica, British Honduras, Bermuda, and later in the Bahamas also, the official rating was set aside in favour of what was known as the 'Maccaroni' tradition in which a British shilling, referred to as a 'Maccaroni', was treated as one quarter of a dollar. The common link between these four territories was the Bank of Nova Scotia which brought in the 'Maccaroni' tradition, resulting in the successful introduction of both sterling coinage and sterling accounts. In 1834, silver coins of threepence and three halfpence ( pence) were introduced, valued at real and real. The three-halfpence coins came to be called \\"quartiles\\" or \\"quatties\\". These in particular were used in church collections due to a feeling by the black population that copper coins were inappropriate for that purpose. Hence, they came to be called \\"Christian quatties\\". In 1839, an act was passed by Parliament declaring that as of December 31, 1840, only British coinage would be legal tender in Jamaica, demonetizing all of the Spanish coins, with the exception of the gold doubloon which was valued at ¬£3 4s. Coins in use were thus the farthing (d), halfpenny, penny, three halfpence (d), threepence, sixpence, shilling, florin (2s), half crown (2s 6d), and crown (5s). The emancipation of the slaves in 1838 increased the need for coinage in Jamaica, particularly low-denomination coins, but the blacks were still reluctant to use copper. The solution was to use cupronickel, adopted in 1869. Pennies and halfpennies were minted for use in Jamaica, becoming the first truly Jamaican coins. Beginning in 1880, the farthing was also minted in cupronickel. In 1904, the first government-authorized banknotes were produced in the denomination of 10s. Banknotes of ¬£1 and ¬£5 were also being circulated by chartered banks. In 1918, denominations of 2s 6d and 5s were authorized. The 2s 6d note proved to have a short life, being withdrawn in 1922. In 1940, the government bank began producing ¬£1 and ¬£5 notes. In October 1960, the Bank of Jamaica was given the sole right to mint coins and produce banknotes in Jamaica. Their notes were released on May 1, 1961, in the denominations of 5s, 10s, ¬£1, and ¬£5. On January 30, 1968, the Jamaican House of Representatives voted to decimalize the currency by introducing the dollar, worth 10 shillings, to replace the Jamaican pound. Coins and banknotes went into circulation on September 8, 1969. The introduction of a decimal currency provided the opportunity for the introduction of a complete Jamaican coinage as formerly, the coins (with the exception of the penny and halfpenny), were the same as those used in the United Kingdom. The reverse of the decimal coinage was designed by Christopher Ironside. These coins were in circulation from 1969 to about 1990. From its introduction, as a result of elevated levels of inflation during the 1980s and especially the early 1990s, the Jamaican dollar has fallen from a peak of J$0.77 to US$1 in its first few years of circulation to around J$131 to US$1 as of July 2018.http://www.boj.org.jm/uploads/excel/Historic_rates.xls The new Jamaican dollar (and the Cayman Islands dollar) differed from all the other dollars in the British West Indies in that it was essentially a half-pound sterling. All the other dollars either began on the US dollar unit or the Spanish dollar unit. Coins At the time of the currency's introduction, 1969, coins of 1 cent (1.2 pence), 5 cents (6 pence), 10 cents (1 shilling), 20 cents (2 shillings), and 25 cents (2 shillings 6 pence) were produced. With the exception of a smaller bronze 1 cent, the compositions, sizes, and shapes of the coins were identical to those they replaced. The 1-cent coin was changed in 1975 to a twelve-sided shape and aluminium composition. Decagonal 50-cent coins were introduced in 1976 to replace the 50 cent banknote, but production for circulation ceased in 1989, along with that of the 20 cents. In 1990, nickel-brass 1 dollar coins were introduced to replace the banknote of the same denomination. Nickel-plated steel replaced copper-nickel in the 5, 10, and 25 cent coins in 1991 with a smaller size and seven-sided shape for the 25 cent coin. In 1994, a round nickel-plated steel 5 dollar coin replaced its corresponding banknote, a smaller, seven-sided nickel-plated steel 1 dollar coin was introduced, and the 5 cent coin was abandoned. 1995 saw smaller, round copper-plated steel 10 and 25 cent coins. All non-current coins were demonetized in January 1997. A scalloped nickel-plated steel 10 dollar coin replaced the 10 dollar note in 1999 and a bimetallic 20 dollar coin with a nickel-brass ring and copper-nickel center was introduced in place of a 20 dollar banknote in 2000. All nickel-plated or copper-plated steel coins are magnetic. All coins have the Jamaican coat of arms on their reverse.

The $5 note was introduced on 20 October 1970, followed by the $20 in June 1976, when the 50 cent note was replaced by a coin. $100 notes were added on 2 December 1986, followed by $50 notes on 27 July 1988. The $2 note was dropped in 1994, whilst the $1 note was replaced by a coin in 1990. In 1994, coins replaced the $5 notes and $500 notes were introduced. In 1999, $10 coins replaced notes, whilst, in 2000, $20 coins replaced the notes and $1000 notes were introduced.

It bears the portrait of former Prime Minister of Jamaica, The Honourable Hugh Lawson Shearer. On May 18, 2009, a specimen note was presented to the former Prime Minister's widow, Dr. Denise Eldemire-Shearer. Finance Minister Audley Shaw criticized the decision to introduce the banknote, saying that the introduction of such a banknote is a sign that the Jamaican dollar is losing value. On November 15, 2010, the Bank of Jamaica issued a $50 commemorative note to celebrate its founding. The note is similar to its regular issue in design and security features, but the bank's logo printed in blue, with the words \\"50th anniversary\\" and \\"1960‚Äì2010\\" printed above and below the logo. The back of the commemorative note features the Bank of Jamaica headquarters building in Nethersole Place set against a background of morning glory blossoms. Both the commemorative and the regular issue note circulate in parallel.Jamaica 50-dollar commemorative confirmed BanknoteNews.com. Retrieved 2012-06-29. In 2012, the Bank of Jamaica introduced a new family of banknotes commemorating the country's Golden Jubilee. The commemorative banknotes are similar to its regular issue banknotes, but on the obverse it features the \\"Jamaica 50\\" logo superimposed on the watermark on the front of each note. The unique image, which is normally on the reverse side of each note, has been replaced by a photograph of a group of children from Central Branch Primary School, from 1962. It formerly appeared on the $2 note, which was in circulation from 1969 to 1994. Currently, the Jamaican banknotes are printed on a cotton material which has a relatively short life in the country's tropical climate and other circulation conditions, but the new notes will come on enhanced substrates. The $100 note is printed on a material called \\"hybrid\\", a combination of a protected polyester film layered on a cotton fiber core. The $50, $500, and $1000 notes are printed on a varnished cotton substrate, that is, the traditional cotton treated with a varnish after the notes have been printed. Varnishing creates a moisture-proof layer to protect the banknotes against surface soiling and reduces the extent to which they will absorb moisture, contaminant particles and microorganisms. The $5000 note remains on a regular cotton substrate as the main security thread, \\"Optiks\\", is compatible only with the cotton based material. The commemorative notes are released into circulation on July 23, 2012 and the new notes will circulate alongside the regular issue banknotes.Jamaica new commemorative notes confirmed BanknoteNews.com.

Use outside Jamaica The Jamaican dollar was used not only by Jamaica, but also by the Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands, former dependencies of Jamaica, until 1972 and 1973 respectively. In 1972, the Cayman Islands stopped using the Jamaican dollar and adopted its own currency, the Cayman Islands dollar, while in 1973 the Turks and Caicos Islands replaced the Jamaican dollar as legal tender with the United States dollar legal tender. Half Pounds In adopting the Jamaican dollar, Jamaica followed the pattern of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand in that when it adopted the decimal system, it decided to use the half pound unit as opposed to the pound unit of account. The choice of the name dollar was motivated by the fact that the reduced value of the new unit corresponded more closely to the value of the US dollar than it did to pound sterling.

The park is located on a ridge of Hook Mountain above the west bank of the Hudson River. Included within the park is the Rockland Lake. Development of the park as part of the Palisades Interstate Park system began in 1958. Rockland Lake State Park is functionally part of a continuous complex of parks that also includes Hook Mountain State Park, Nyack Beach State Park, and Haverstraw Beach State Park. History Rockland Lake was known as \\"Quashpeake Pond\\" to the region's Native American population, prior to the lake being given its current name, which refers to the county in which it is situated. The adjacent hamlet of Rockland Lake was originally known as \\"Slaughter's Landing\\" before its name was changed to match the lake. =Ice production= Prior to the establishment of the park, Rockland Lake served as an important supplier of ice to New York City after the Knickerbocker Ice Company was established on the lake's northeastern bank in 1831. Rockland Lake eventually became known as the \\"Icehouse of New York City\\", with a reputation for having the cleanest and purest ice in the area. During the 1850s, the Knickerbocker Ice Company operated a dozen steamboats, 75 ice barges, and employed 3,000 people. Ice harvests typically began in January, and blocks of ice were stored in large icehouses before being shipped to customers during warmer weather. The icehouses, insulated with sawdust, could store up to 50,000 tons of ice. The nearby Knickerbocker Fire House was established 1862.Fire Company Serving Rockland Lake Celebrates 150th Anniversary The Knickerbocker Ice Company closed in 1924. In 1926, workers who were demolishing one of the ice houses accidentally set fire to the structure's sawdust insulation. The fire spread extremely quickly and destroyed much of the village of Rockland Lake. The old foundation of the ice company remains today, marked by a historical plaque and bench. =Recreational history= Hook Mountain, as viewed from the Hudson River Rockland Lake has been formally used for recreation since 1873, when a picnic area known as \\"The Grove\\" was established near the north end of the lake. This was followed by the installation of a second recreation area near the south end of the lake known as the \\"Quaspeck Park Beach Club and Casino\\". At the turn of the 20th century, special trains delivered visitors to the lake's recreation areas. The Palisades Interstate Park Commission purchased its first parcel of what was to become Rockland Lake State Park in 1958, which consisted of the lake and of land. By 1964, a total of had been purchased to form the park. During the intervening years, additional land acquisitions increased the park's size to its current total of . Park description Rockland Lake State Park features a swimming pool, in addition to a smaller pool for children. The park also has scattered picnic tables and grills, a car-top boat launch and boat rentals, hiking trails with views of the Hudson Valley, and six tennis courts. Anglers on Rockland Lake may catch bass, perch and norlunge, while walkers, bikers and joggers may use the paved trail that circles the lake. Rockland Lake also has its own fire department, Knickerbocker Engine Company 1, located at the rear of the park. It is the second-oldest fire department in Rockland County and is still in operation today. =Golf courses= Rockland Lake features two 18-hole golf courses, the Championship and Executive courses. The Championship course is a regulation golf course measuring 6,864 yards from the back tees, with a par of 72. It also features a driving range and clubhouse with snack bar. The Executive course is par 3 and measures 2,780 yards.

In 1919 it was transferred to Coastal Area where it remained until it was disbanded on 18 January 1932. The group was re- formed on 1 June 1940 within Fighter Command to enable neighbouring No. 11 Group to function more efficiently. Its area of operation was the south- western region of England. Commanded by Air Vice Marshal Sir Quintin Brand, 10 Group supported 11 Group in the Battle of Britain by rotating squadrons, providing additional fighter support when needed, and supplying additional pilots. The Air Officer Commanding (AOC) of 11 Group, Air Vice Marshal Keith Park, had a far warmer relationship with Brand than with the AOC of 12 Group, Air Vice Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory, who regarded Park with jealousy. As well as providing support for 11 Group, 10 Group also had some squadrons of aircraft that could not be risked in the Battle of Britain (Gloster Gladiator, Boulton Paul Defiant). Middle Wallop operations room in use in 1943 Brown's Quarry, a small quarry north of Tunnel Quarry, was converted into an underground operations centre for HQ No. 10 Group, RAF Box. After the Battle of Britain, 10 Group also provided fighter cover missions for convoys approaching and leaving the British Isles. Pilots rotated into 10 Group from either 12 or 13 Group knew that soon they would go over to 11 Group, so the pilots took advantage of their comparatively safer area of operation to hone their skills.

The park's land occupies the site of the former Camp Bluefields, a rifle range used to train members of the New York National Guard prior to World War I. The park is located south of Nyack. History Prior to becoming Blauvelt State Park, the property was known as Camp Bluefields, a large rifle range used primarily to train members of the New York National Guard. The rifle range occupied of land and was touted in 1910 as being the largest in the country. The range's location was criticized almost immediately, and complaints of stray bullets being encountered in nearby residential areas were registered even before the range's official completion. The rifle range operated from soon after the state's initial purchase of the land in 1909 until its administration was transferred to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission in 1913. In the years that followed, Camp Bluefields was used as a YWCA summer camp for New York City working women, an ROTC training camp, a Columbia University summer camp, and as a destination for participants in the Fresh Air Fund. In 1930, the camp resumed military use by the U.S. Army, who used the property for training programs that year. In 1942, soldiers from Camp Shanks used the property as a training grounds, and it was used as an air raid post during World War II. The adjacent Clausland Mountain County Park is the former home of a Nike missile launch site. During the Cold War the site was part of a ring of Nike surface-to-air missiles surrounding New York City, intended to defend the city from Soviet bombers.

Early life John Gardner was born in Manchester, England and grew up in Ilfracombe, North Devon. His father Alfred Linton Gardner (born 1882, Ilfracombe died 10 April 1918, France) was a local physician and amateur composer who was killed in action in the First World War. His grandfather was John Twiname Gardner, also a G.P. and composer. His mother, Emily Muriel Pullein-Thompson, was the sister of Captain Harold J \\"Cappy\\" Pullein-Thompson, who was the father of the Pullein-Thompson sisters and their brother, the playwright Denis Cannan. Gardner was educated at Eagle House School, Sandhurst, Wellington College and Exeter College, Oxford.'GARDNER, John Linton', in Who's Who 2012 (London: A. & C. Black, 2012) online article (subscription site), by Oxford University Press, January 2012, accessed 20 April 2012 An important figure in his early life was Hubert J. Foss of Oxford University Press, who published the Intermezzo for Organ in 1936 and introduced him to the composer Arthur Benjamin, to whom Gardner dedicated his Rhapsody for Oboe and String Quartet (1935). This work had its first performance at the Wigmore Hall in February 1936. The String Quartet No. 1 (1938) was broadcast from Paris by the Blech Quartet in 1939, and the anthem The Holy Son of God most High (1938) was also published by OUP. At Oxford Gardner was friendly with Theodor Adorno with whom he played piano duets. Career After coming down from Oxford in 1939, Gardner completed two terms as music master at Repton School, where one of his pupils was the composer John Veale, then a sixth former. In 1940 he enlisted and working first as a Bandmaster (Fighter Command) and then as a Navigator with Transport Command. It was during the War that ideas for the Symphony No.1 began to form. Gardner regarded the end of the War as a new start, set aside his juvenile works (of which nearly 100 have survived in manuscript) and began again from Opus 1. He took a job as a repetiteur at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. John Barbirolli discovered the First Symphony (Op. 2) when Gardner was given the opportunity of playing through his Nativity Opera. According to Gardner this work is \\"unperformable\\", which fact was quickly grasped by Barbirolli; however, when Barbirolli asked to see other works, Gardner showed him the Symphony. The first movement needed some re-working because Barbirolli was not convinced it made sense in its original form. The work was scheduled for the 1951 Cheltenham Festival where it caused a minor sensation. Many major commissions followed and Gardner was suddenly able to call himself \\"a composer\\". He resigned the job at the Opera House and there followed a remarkable period of creativity. Cantiones Sacrae, Op. 11, Variations on a Waltz of Carl Nielsen, Op. 13 and the ballet Reflection, Op. 14, were all written in 1951 and 1952 and first performed during 1952. He re-wrote A Scots Overture, previously a military band piece, for the 1954 season of Promenade Concerts in 1954. In May 1957 Sadler's Wells put on the opera The Moon and Sixpence, which they had commissioned, and two other major works were premiered that year, the Piano Concerto No. 1 (Cyril Preedy and Barbirolli at the Cheltenham Festival) and the Seven Songs, Op. 36 in Birmingham, a work which Gardner wrote as \\"light relief\\" while working on the other major works. In 1956 he was invited by Thomas Armstrong to join the staff of the Royal Academy of Music, where he would teach for the best part of thirty years. A few years later he took a part-time job as Director of Music at St Paul's Girls' School, following Gustav Holst and Herbert Howells, and was for a time Director of Music at Morley College. These teaching posts led to the composition of some of his most enduring works, and together with the many holiday courses he worked on as a conductor (Canford, Dartington, ESSYM, Bernard Robinson's Music Camp, etc.) ensured that he was able to bring practical experience and knowledge to bear on his compositions. Gardner composed prolifically throughout his life, and his works are listed on his website (see link below). Among the major works are two more symphonies, two more operas ‚Äì The Visitors (1972) and Tobermory (1976), concertos for Trumpet, Flute, Oboe and Recorder and Bassoon, many cantatas, including The Ballad of the White Horse, Op. 40 (1959),The Ballad of the White Horse (2020 recording, EM Records), reviewed at Musicweb International Five Hymns in Popular Style, Op. 54 (1962), A Burns Sequence, Op. 213 (1993), as well as much choral, chamber, organ, brass and orchestral music. Gardner's best known work is the Christmas carol Tomorrow Shall Be My Dancing Day, which was written for St Paul's, as was another popular carol setting, The Holly and the Ivy. His final work was a Bassoon Concerto, Op. 249, written in 2004 for Graham Salvage, the principal bassoonist of the Hall√© Orchestra, which was premiered at the Budleigh Salterton Festival in July 2007, by Graham Salvage with the Festival Orchestra conducted by Nicholas Marshall. Honours Gardner was made an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Music (Hon. RAM) in 1959; a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1976; and an Honorary Member of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1997, the year of his eightieth birthday. Personal life Gardner married Jane Abercrombie, the daughter of Nigel Abercrombie (Secretary General of the Arts Council 1963‚Äì1968) and the soprano Elisabeth Abercrombie, in 1955. They had three children: Christopher (1956), Lucy (1958) and Emily (1962). After the War he lived in South London ‚Äì in Morden, New Malden and Ewell. He died in Liss Forest, England. Recordings Gardner's music, apart from \\"Tomorrow shall be my dancing day\\", has been largely unrepresented on commercial records, but in recent years a number of new recordings have been issued, including the 3rd Symphony, Oboe Concerto, Flute Concerto and Petite Suite for Recorder and Strings. In September 2007, Naxos issued his Symphony No. 1, Piano Concerto and the overture Midsummer Ale. David Lloyd-Jones conducted the Royal Scottish National Orchestra with Peter Donohoe as the solo pianist.

It is located along the highways of U.S. Route 75, Minnesota State Highway 23 and Minnesota State Highway 30. The catlinite, or \\"pipestone\\", has been traditionally used to make ceremonial pipes, vitally important to traditional Plains Indian religious practices. The quarries are sacred to many of the tribes of North America, including the Dakota, Lakota, and other tribes of Native Americans, and were neutral territory where all Nations could quarry stone for ceremonial pipes. The Sioux tribes may have taken control of the quarries around 1700, but the Minnesota pipestone has been found inside North American burial mounds dating from long before that, and ancient Indian trails leading to the area suggest pipestone may have been quarried there for many centuries. As the United States grew westward in the 19th century, pipes found their way into white society through trade. To protect their source, the Yankton Sioux secured free and unrestricted access via The Treaty With The Yankton Sioux, which was signed on April 19, 1858. The land was acquired by the federal government in 1893. In 1928, the Yankton Sioux, then resettled on a reservation away, sold their claim to the federal government. The National Monument was established by an act of Congress on August 25, 1937, and the establishing legislation restored quarrying rights to the Indians. Today only people of Native American ancestry are allowed to quarry the pipestone. A boundary change occurred on June 18, 1956.The National Parks: Index 2001‚Äì2003. Washington: U.S. Department of the Interior. As a historic area under the National Park Service it was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places under the heading \\"Cannomok'e‚ÄîPipestone National Monument\\". The Red Pipestone Quarries within the monument comprise a Minnesota State Historic Site. During the summer months, there are cultural demonstrations at the monument. The Upper Midwest Indian Cultural Center, located inside the visitor center, sponsors demonstrations of pipemaking by native craftworkers using the stone from the quarries. Local Native Americans carve the stones using techniques passed down from their ancestors. Many of the demonstrators are third or fourth generation pipe makers. Visitors can also walk along a three-quarter mile (1.2 km) self- guided trail to view the pipestone quarries and a waterfall. A trail guide is available at the visitor center. About of the national monument has been restored to native tallgrass prairie. Monument staff burn prairie parcels on a rotating basis to control weeds and stimulate growth of native grasses. A larger area of restored tallgrass prairie and a small Bison herd are maintained by the Minnesota DNR at Blue Mounds State Park, to the south. The visitor center features exhibits about the natural and cultural history of the site, including a petroglyph display.

The sector airfields were: *RAF Acklington *RAF Dyce *RAF Inverness *RAF Turnhouse *RAF Usworth *RAF Wick =Battle Of Britain= As well as guarding the north during the Battle of Britain, 13 Group also provided reserve squadrons and pilots to the more beleaguered 11 Group, and provided quieter bases for squadrons to recuperate from operations. The 13 Group also contributed to pilot education by producing its \\"Forget-Me-Nots for Fighters\\" brochure that included a foreword by Air Vice-Marshal R. E. Saul. During the Battle of Britain, the Germans had faulty intelligence indicating that 13 Group had next to no fighters in operation (they believed that the only reason why 11 Group was still holding out was that 13 Group had been sending them down their available aircraft), so they had thought that any attacks made on Scotland would not face any serious resistance. This proved to be a costly mistake for the Luftwaffe, as their bombers were intercepted by a large number of fighters. The bombers could not be escorted all the way to Scotland from Occupied Europe because of the short range of the Messerschmitt Bf 109, so the attacking bombers proved to be fodder for Saul's Spitfire and Hurricane squadrons. On 15 August 1940 the German air force attempted its one and only daylight flank attack on Northern England. North East England was attacked by 65 Heinkel He 111s escorted by 34 Messerschmitt Bf 110s, and RAF Driffield was attacked by 50 unescorted Junkers Ju 88s. Out of 115 bombers and 35 fighters sent over 16 bombers and 7 fighters were destroyed. After the Battle of Britain, 13 Group squadrons helped RAF Coastal Command in patrolling for U-boats and providing air cover for convoys. New pilots would usually find themselves posted to a 13 Group squadron initially so as to gain experience with lesser risk of getting shot down. Post war After the war, the Group was disbanded on 20 May 1946. However, nine years later it was reformed. It finally disbanded on 31 December 1961 when it was redesignated No. 11 Group.

Care Not Cash was a San Francisco ballot measure (Proposition N) approved by the voters in November 2002. Primarily sponsored by Gavin Newsom, then a San Francisco supervisor, it was designed to cut the money given in the General Assistance programs to homeless people in exchange for shelters and other forms of services. The major intent of this measure was to prevent the cash grants given to be used for purchasing drugs and alcohol, and to strongly encourage homeless people to enter shelters or housing and obtain counseling and other services. Gavin Newsom talks to the media about \\"Care Not Cash\\" in 2003. Care Not Cash altered city welfare assistance to the approximately 3,000 homeless adults who received about $395 a month to $59 a month plus housing and food. According to the measure, if the services weren't available, the city couldn't reduce a homeless person's aid. The idea behind Care Not Cash was to use the city's savings from cutting the welfare checks‚Äîan estimated $13 million a year ‚Äî-- to set baseline funding for creating affordable housing, expanding shelters, and adding mental health and substance abuse treatment. Later, an amendment called \\"Real housing, real care\\", was voted upon by the Board of Supervisors. It was created to ensure that the \\"Care\\" element of \\"Care not Cash\\" was in place; that is, to mandate a certain level of housing and services to be available before the city cut General Assistance payments. Controversy Care Not Cash caused a significant amount of controversy in San Francisco. The name was seen as a euphemism, and critics complained that the quality of care provided was not equivalent to the cash. The major debates, however, were in the many underlying issues that Care not Cash brought up, including: *The \\"right\\" to be homeless. This issue was raised by some like Angela Alioto, who criticized the provision of the Care not Cash law that states if the homeless person refused \\"care,\\" he or she would not be given \\"cash.\\" In other words, it should not be illegal to be poor. Most supporters of the law did not see that as a weakness in the law, but rather as the fundamental point of the legislation, to strongly discourage people from homelessness if shelters and other services were possible. *The quality of the shelter system. Both certain supporters of Care not Cash and certain critics were very negative towards the prevailing homeless shelter system in San Francisco at the time, criticizing it not only for being of low quality and unsafe, but also as a source of cronyism and graft. *Many critics, such as Alioto, point out that the premise of the law does not affect the main class of homeless, the so-called \\"hardcore homeless,\\" who Alioto claims are by and large so mentally unstable as to not even know how to collect General Assistance in the first place. Additionally, Eugene Dong MD, JD, an Associate Professor of Cardiac Surgery Emeritus at Stanford University, conducted an independent investigation of the cost of the program and proclaimed, \\"[the] program just does not add up.\\" Dong said that the city claims to have used $14,000,000 to house just 1,000 people, Online NewsHour, PBS, April 8, 2005 suggesting the city spent $14,000.00 per housed recipient per year, or $1,226.00 per month, rather than the $410.00, which was the maximum monthly benefit. Dong believes that difference, or 70 percent of the county welfare fund, went \\"directly to the hotel owners in the form of cash payments and capital improvements that they would not otherwise have received.\\" Dong also said that the CNC Program did not actually decrease the numbers of homeless, since in the same year, the numbers of homeless in the surrounding communities swelled commensurately.Dong, Eugene. Send2PressNewswire, Friday, May 6, 2005 Progress A study released February 9, 2005, indicated that the number of County Adult Assistance Programs (CAAP) residents who declared themselves to be homeless residents of San Francisco had decreased from 2,497 to 679 since implementation of Care Not Cash in May 2004. As of January 2007, the caseload had decreased further to 333, although Mayor Newsom acknowledged in a radio interview that two or three new homeless persons come to San Francisco for each homeless person that gets off the streets. Update 2016 San Francisco report, following 1,820 homeless adults for eight years from 2007 to 2015, showed that before entering the program living on their own, costs averaged $21,000/person due to urgent emergency care, jail time, and behavioral health services. And after entering supportive housing, costs initially more than doubled for ongoing housing, medical care, and mental health by 2011, but then started decreasing yearly since by 56% in 2015.

According to World Steel Association (Chinese companies data was provided by China Iron and Steel Association), the corporation was ranked the 5th in 2015 the world ranking by production volume (2nd in China for 34.938 million metric tons). A plan to merge with Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation was announced on 21‚Äì22 September 2016, which would make the combined production volume the second highest in the world (34.938 million + 25.776 million), after ArcelorMittal (97.136 million in 2015), surpassing Hesteel Group (47.745 million in 2015). Since Baosteel Group and Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation also announced targets of cutting 3.95 and 4.42 million metric tons production capacity respectively in June and July 2016, and a further cut for Baosteel Group of 2.10 million while a 3.15 million cut was already planned the final ranking may still significantly change. The IPO of the subsidiary of Baosteel Group on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2000 was the largest in China up to that time, raising CNY 7.7 billion despite being limited to domestic investors only.  History  =Baoshan Iron and Steel= Beginning in 1978, the Chinese government began to institute economic reforms. Plans called for a large integrated steel production facility to be located near the port of Shanghai. The Baoshan District, a suburb of Shanghai, was chosen as the site and Japanese assistance was enlisted in constructing one of the most modern steel plants of the time. As the government's flagship steel company, Baoshan Iron and Steel as it was originally called, benefitted from acquiring the engineers and managers, access to technology, and receiving government contracts. Baoshan Iron and Steel also benefitted from the Chinese economic expansion which consumed all the steel available. However, with the continuing liberalization of the Chinese economy, Baoshan found itself in competition with new rivals, both foreign and domestic. The company decided to add an export trade marketing component to remain competitive; it scored notable success in South Korea. Although hurt by the Asian financial crisis, Baoshan pushed through with a merger of other money losing state owned enterprises, though it had managed to remain profitable itself. =Baosteel Group= On November 17, 1998, the former Baoshan Iron and Steel (Group) Corporation absorbed the Shanghai Metallurgical Holding Group Corporation (‰∏äÊµ∑ÂÜ∂ÈáëÊéßËÇ°ÈõÜÂõ¢ÂÖ¨Âè∏) and the \\"Shanghai Meishan Group\\" (‰∏äÊµ∑Ê¢ÖÂ±±ÈõÜÂõ¢ÂÖ¨Âè∏) to form Shanghai Baosteel Group Corporation. The new conglomerate was the largest steel producer in the country with annual steel production of nearly 20 million tons. In 1997, a subsidiary of Shanghai Metallurgical Holding, the former Shanghai No.3 Iron and Steel Plant, Shanghai Pudong Iron and Steel, formed a joint venture with ThyssenKrupp of Germany, as Shanghai Krupp Stainless.Company Profile Shanghai Krupp Stainless It followed the parent company to become a subsidiary of Baosteel Group in 1998. In 2000, a subsidiary Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. was formed to list a portion of the group on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, while Shanghai No.1st, 2, 3 and 5 Iron and Steel Plants of the group were remaining unlisted. In 2004, the listed subsidiary acquired Meishan Iron and Steel from Baosteel Group (via Shanghai Meishan Group). In 2007 Baosteel Group acquired the majority stake of Xinjiang Ba Yi Iron and Steel Group, which was the parent company of Ba Yi Iron and Steel [Company Limited by Shares]. In 2008 Baosteel Group expended in Southern China, which planned to build a new facility in Zhanjiang, Guangdong, which formally started by its subsidiary Baoshan Iron & Steel in 2012, by acquiring 71.8032% stake of Zhanjiang Iron and Steel for CNY4.976 billion from State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Guangzhou City. In 2011, Baosteel Group acquired 51% stake of Guangdong Shaoguan Iron and Steel Group from SASAC of Guangdong Government. =Baowu = On 21‚Äì22 September 2016, a plan to merge Baosteel Group and fellow state-owned steel maker Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation was announced. Baoshan Iron and Steel Company Limited, the listed portion of Baosteel Group would takeover the counterpart Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Limited in an all-share deal, while the rights of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation would be transferred to Baosteel Group for free as a wholly owned subsidiary. Both Baosteel Group and Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation were supervised by SASAC of the Central Government. As of December 2016, the name of the new group is China Baowu Steel Group Corporation. It is now the second largest steel producer in the world, with assets estimated to be worth around 730 billion Yuan, employing 228,000 employees and expected annual sales revenues of 330 billion Yuan ($47.9 billion). In 2019, China Baowu Steel Group acquired 51% stake of Masteel Group from the SASAC of for free. The acquisition also included the indirect controlling stake of the list company Maanshan Iron and Steel Company Limited. See history of China Baowu Steel since 2006.  Controversies  In early 2016, Baosteel Group was accused by US Steel Corp. of stealing commercial secrets. Baosteel rejected these allegations, stating that \\"In particular, the charges claiming that Baosteel stole commercial secrets from U.S. Steel is rootless speculation and subjective assumption, and could even be described as an absurd statement\\". The International Trade Commission (ITC) launched a probe into these allegations in May 2016. Next to Baosteel, Hebei Iron and Steel Group, Wuhan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd., Maanshan Iron and Steel Company Limited, Anshan Iron and Steel Group and Jiangsu Shagang Group are also under investigation.

He is one of a few composers who shows aspects of both medieval and Renaissance style, and was a contemporary of Dufay during Dufay's sojourn in Italy. Very little is known about his life, except for a few years in the 1420s to around 1430. It is presumed that he was from Flanders or adjacent areas. In the early 1420s he was probably in the service of the Malatesta family in either Rimini or Pesaro, since Dufay mentioned him in the text of a rondeau which was written between 1420 and 1424. Lantins was in Venice in 1428 and Rome in 1431, in the latter city as a singer in the papal chapel choir, along with Dufay. He was only in Rome six months; after that he disappears from history. Rome was entering a period of turmoil related to the Conciliar movement after the death, in February 1431, of Pope Martin V; many musicians left at that time or shortly after, and Lantins may have been one of them. It is not known for certain if Arnold de Lantins was a relative of Hugo de Lantins, a composer active at the same time, but since their works often appear together in collections and they seem to have been in the same geographical regions, it is not unlikely. However, a sharp stylistic difference between the works of the two composers shows they can not be the same person. Earlier theories that there was a third \\"de Lantins,\\" a certain Ray de Lantins, known from a single inscription in Munich, Bayerischestaatsbibliothek Mus. 3224, were shown to be wrong in 2012 by Margaret Bent and Robert Klugseder, upon the discovery of a second, fuller inscription to \\"Raynaldus de lantins\\" of a Credo ascribed to Arnold de Lantins in two other sources.David Fallows, review of Margaret Bent and Robert Klugseder, Ein Liber cantus aus dem Veneto (um 1440) (Wiesbaden: Reichert, 2012), in Plainsong and Medieval Music 23.1 (2014) This ascription makes it extremely likely that Ray should be read as a variant of Arnold. Lantin's music was held in high regard, and appears alongside that of Dufay, Gilles Binchois and Johannes Ciconia in contemporary manuscript collections. In particular, one motet ‚Äì Tota pulchra es ‚Äì is found in widely distributed sources; since this was before the advent of printing technology, wide distribution of copies is taken as evidence of a composer's fame and popularity. Arnold wrote a complete mass, found in Bologna Q15 (all the movements are found in OX 213 although the last two movements are separated - only the first three movements are found in Bologna 2216), as well as several parts of a composite mass in Bologna Q15, augmenting movements written by Johannes Ciconia. Several other examples exist of composers adding movements to partial masses written by other composers, for example Zacara da Teramo, particularly in Bologna Q15. Musically Arnold's mass movements are fairly simple, using three voices, head motif technique, and avoiding imitative writing. Some of his other sacred music, such as his Marian motets, contain florid melodic writing and some use of imitation. He also wrote secular music, including ballades and rondeaux, all of which are in French, as well as a few shorter sacred pieces. Some of them refer to specific events or specific people, but none of either have been conclusively identified.

It had been formed and disbanded for various periods during the 20th century before disbanding in 1996 and reforming again in 2018. Its most famous service was in 1940 in the Battle of Britain during the Second World War, when it defended London and the south-east of the United Kingdom from attacks by the German Luftwaffe. It was reformed in late 2018 as a \\"multi-domain operations group\\" to ensure the service thinks and acts in a networked way. History =First World War= No. 11 Group was first formed on 1 April 1918 in No. 2 Area as No. 11 (Equipment) Group, and was transferred to South-Western Area the next month on 8 May. The Group was disbanded on 17 May 1918. =Inter-war years= The next incarnation of the Group occurred in 22 August 1918 when it was formed as part of the North-Western Area. On 6 February 1920, Group Captain Ian Bonham-Carter took command and three months later, in May 1920, 11 Group was reduced in status to No. 11 Wing. The Group was reformed on 1 May 1936 as No. 11 (Fighter) Group by renaming Fighting Area. On 14 July 1936, 11 Group became the first RAF Fighter Command Group responsible for the air- defence of southern England, including London. =Second World War, 1939 to 1945= No.11 Group was organised with the Dowding System of fighter control. Group Headquarters was at Hillingdon House, located at RAF Uxbridge in the London Borough of Hillingdon. The Group operations room was underground in what is now known as the Battle of Britain Bunker. Commands were passed to the sector airfields, each of which was in charge of several airfields and fighter squadrons.

Battle of Britain 1940  The most famous period of the Group was during the Battle of Britain when it bore the brunt of the German aerial assault. Pilots posted to squadrons in 11 Group knew that they would be in constant action, while pilots and squadrons transferred from No.11 Group knew that they were going to somewhere comparatively safer. During the Battle of Britain, the Group was commanded by New Zealander Air Vice Marshal Keith Park. While supported by the commanders (AOCs) of No. 10 Group and No. 13 Group, he received insufficient support from the AOC of 12 Group, Air Vice Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory, who used the Big Wing controversy to criticise Park's tactics. Leigh-Mallory's lack of support compromised Fighter Command at a critical time and the controversy caused problems for Park. When the Battle of Britain was over, Leigh-Mallory, acting with Air Marshal Sholto Douglas, conspired to have Park removed from his position (along with the Commander-in-Chief of Fighter Command, Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding). Leigh-Mallory then took over command of 11 Group. =Post-war= After the war in December 1951, No.11 Group consisted of the Southern and Metropolitan sectors. The Southern Sector included 1 Squadron and No. 29/22 Squadrons at RAF Tangmere and 54 Squadron and 247 Squadron at RAF Odiham. The Metropolitan Sector had 25 Squadron at RAF West Malling, 41/253 Squadron at RAF Biggin Hill, 56/87 Squadron and 63 Squadron at RAF Waterbeach, 64 Squadron and 65 Squadron at RAF Duxford, 72 Squadron at RAF North Weald, 85/145 at RAF West Malling with Gloster Meteor NF.11s, and 257 Squadron and 263 Squadron at RAF Wattisham.

No. 11 Squadron English Electric F6 based at RAF Binbrook, part of No. 11 Group.left In 1960 Fighter Command was re- organised and 11 Group was disbanded on 31 December 1960, to reform one day later when 13 Group was renamed 11 Group. On 1 April 1963, the Group was renamed No. 11 (Northern) Sector. This incarnation lasted until Fighter Command was absorbed into the new Strike Command on 30 April 1968 and became 11 Group. Group Headquarters shifted to RAF Bentley Priory in north-west London and took responsibility for the UK Air Defence Region (UK ADR). The English Electric Lightning entered service in 1960 and the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II in 1969, with 43 Squadron at RAF Leuchars. The group was renamed 11 (Air Defence) Group in January 1986. In the early 1990s, the front- line force consisted of 56 Squadron and 74 Squadrons flying Phantoms from RAF Wattisham, 5 Squadron and 29 Squadron flying the Panavia Tornado F3 from RAF Coningsby, 11 Squadron, 23 Squadron, and 25 Squadron flying the Tornado F3 from RAF Leeming and 43 Squadron and 111 Squadron at RAF Leuchars; 8 Squadron flew E-3D Sentry AEW1 from RAF Waddington, 5 Squadron and 11 Squadron had been the last units flying the English Electric Lightning from RAF Binbrook until 1988; 25 Squadron and 85 Squadron had been operating Bristol Bloodhound surface-to-air missiles and re-equipped with the Tornado and disbanded in 1989 and on 10 July 1991 respectively. The Wattisham Phantom Wing was disbanded relatively quickly following the end of the Cold War; 23 Squadron was disbanded in March 1994. On 1 April 1996, 11 Group amalgamated with 18 Group to form 11/18 Group. Air Vice Marshal Anthony Bagnall, who took over on 15 July 1994, was the Group's last commander. = 2018 reformation = Air Marshal Stuart Atha presenting 11 Group's crest to AVM Ian Duguid in 2018 On 11 July 2018, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier announced at the Air Power Conference that 11 Group would reform as a \\"multi-domain operations group\\", to ensure the RAF thinks and acts in a networked way and combining air, space and cyber-warfare elements to create an integrated force. No increase in the number of senior officers or staff at headquarters was proposed as part of the reformation. The group reformed at a ceremony at RAF High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire on 1 November 2018, when Air Vice-Marshal Ian Duguid took command.

It is called blood pinning in the United States Marine Corps. Although it is rare, some Air Force Academy cadets receive their upper-class Prop and Wings insignia via the blood wings tradition. Upon receiving the Parachutist Badge, an instructor or comrade of the graduate places the pins of the badge pointing into the chest of the graduate. The badge is then slammed against the graduate's chest, resulting in the pins being driven into the flesh. If the graduation is affiliated with a particular unit number (unit 14, for example), then the pin will often be pounded deeper into the muscle the same number of times (14 times in this case). The origins of this tradition are unknown, but most likely date back to World War II paratrooper training. This practice is fairly secretive and sparked controversy recently when knowledge of it reached the public, which is often critical about painful forms of hazing. Blood wings are against Armed Forces Policy and are prohibited. Recipients of blood wings consider it a highly honorable rite of passage.

Early life Curtis was born on February 19, 1868, on a farm near Whitewater, Wisconsin.Laurie Lawlor (1994). Shadow Catcher: The Life and Work of Edward S. Curtis. New York: Walker.His father, the Reverend Asahel \\"Johnson\\" Curtis (1840‚Äì1887), was a minister, farmer, and American Civil War veteran born in Ohio. His mother, Ellen Sheriff (1844‚Äì1912), was born in Pennsylvania. Curtis's siblings were Raphael (1862‚Äìc.1885), also called Ray; Edward, called Eddy; Eva (1870‚Äì?); and Asahel Curtis (1874‚Äì1941). Weakened by his experiences in the Civil War, Johnson Curtis had difficulty in managing his farm, resulting in hardship and poverty for his family. Around 1874, the family moved from Wisconsin to Minnesota to join Johnson Curtis's father, Asahel Curtis, who ran a grocery store and was a postmaster in Le Sueur County. Curtis left school in the sixth grade and soon built his own camera. Career =Early career= Princess Angeline (Duwamish) in an 1896 photogravure by Curtis In 1885, at the age of 17, Curtis became an apprentice photographer in St. Paul, Minnesota. In 1887 the family moved to Seattle, Washington, where he purchased a new camera and became a partner with Rasmus Rothi in an existing photographic studio. Curtis paid $150 for his 50% share in the studio. After about six months, he left Rothi and formed a new partnership with Thomas Guptill. They established a new studio, Curtis and Guptill, Photographers and Photoengravers. In 1895, Curtis met and photographed Princess Angeline (c. 1820‚Äì1896), also known as Kickisomlo, the daughter of Chief Sealth of Seattle. This was his first portrait of a Native American. In 1898, three of Curtis's images were chosen for an exhibition sponsored by the National Photographic Society. Two were images of Princess Angeline, \\"The Mussel Gatherer\\" and \\"The Clam Digger\\". The other was of Puget Sound, entitled \\"Homeward\\", which was awarded the exhibition's grand prize and a gold medal. In that same year, while photographing Mt. Rainier, Curtis came upon a small group of scientists who were lost and in need of direction. One of them was George Bird Grinnell, considered an \\"expert\\" on Native Americans by his peers. Curtis was appointed the official photographer of the Harriman Alaska Expedition of 1899, probably as a result of his friendship with Grinnell. Having very little formal education Curtis learned much during the lectures that were given aboard the ship each evening of the voyage. Grinnell became interested in Curtis's photography and invited him to join an expedition to photograph people of the Blackfoot Confederacy in Montana in 1900. =The North American Indian= The North American Indian, volume 1, 1907 In 1906, J. P. Morgan provided Curtis with $75,000 to produce a series on Native Americans. This work was to be in 20 volumes with 1,500 photographs. Morgan's funds were to be disbursed over five years and were earmarked to support only fieldwork for the books, not for writing, editing, or production of the volumes. Curtis received no salary for the project, which was to last more than 20 years. Under the terms of the arrangement, Morgan was to receive 25 sets and 500 original prints as repayment. Once Curtis had secured funding for the project, he was able to hire several employees to help him. For writing and for recording Native American languages, he hired a former journalist, William E. Myers. For general assistance with logistics and fieldwork, he hired Bill Phillips, a graduate of the University of Washington. Perhaps the most important hire for the success of the project was Frederick Webb Hodge, an anthropologist employed by the Smithsonian Institution, who had researched Native American peoples of the southwestern United States. Hodge was hired to edit the entire series. Eventually 222 complete sets were published. Curtis's goal was not just to photograph but also to document as much of Native American traditional life as possible before that way of life disappeared. He wrote in the introduction to his first volume in 1907, \\"The information that is to be gathered ... respecting the mode of life of one of the great races of mankind, must be collected at once or the opportunity will be lost.\\" Curtis made over 10,000 wax cylinder recordings of Native American language and music. He took over 40,000 photographic images of members of over 80 tribes. He recorded tribal lore and history, and he described traditional foods, housing, garments, recreation, ceremonies, and funeral customs. He wrote biographical sketches of tribal leaders. His material, in most cases, is the only written recorded history, although there is still a rich oral tradition that preserves history. His work was exhibited at the Rencontres d'Arles festival in France in 1973. =In the Land of the Head Hunters= Curtis had been using motion picture cameras in fieldwork for The North American Indian since 1906. He worked extensively with the ethnographer and British Columbia native George Hunt in 1910, which inspired his work with the Kwakiutl, but much of their collaboration remains unpublished. At the end of 1912, Curtis decided to create a feature film depicting Native American life, partly as a way of improving his financial situation and partly because film technology had improved to the point where it was conceivable to create and screen films more than a few minutes long. Curtis chose the Kwakiutl tribe, of the Queen Charlotte Strait region of the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, for his subject. His film, In the Land of the Head Hunters, was the first feature-length film whose cast was composed entirely of Native North Americans. In the Land of the Head-Hunters premiered simultaneously at the Casino Theatre in New York and the Moore Theatre in Seattle on December 7, 1914. The silent film was accompanied by a score composed by John J. Braham, a musical theater composer who had also worked with Gilbert and Sullivan. The film was praised by critics but made only $3,269.18 in its initial run. It was however criticized by ethnographic community due to its lack of authenticity. The Indians were not only dressed up by the movie director himself but the plot was enriched with exaggerated elements falsifying the reality. =Later years= Indian Days of the Long Ago, 1915 The photographer Ella E. McBride assisted Curtis in his studio beginning in 1907 and became a friend of the family. She made an unsuccessful attempt to purchase the studio with Curtis's daughter Beth in 1916, the year of Curtis's divorce, and left to open her own studio. Around 1922, Curtis moved to Los Angeles with Beth and opened a new photo studio. To earn money he worked as an assistant cameraman for Cecil B. DeMille and was an uncredited assistant cameraman in the 1923 filming of The Ten Commandments. On October 16, 1924, Curtis sold the rights to his ethnographic motion picture In the Land of the Head-Hunters to the American Museum of Natural History. He was paid $1,500 for the master print and the original camera negative. It had cost him over $20,000 to create the film. In 1927, after returning from Alaska to Seattle with Beth, Curtis was arrested for failure to pay alimony over the preceding seven years. The total owed was $4,500, but the charges were dropped. For Christmas of 1927, the family was reunited at the home of his daughter Florence in Medford, Oregon. This was the first time since the divorce that Curtis was with all of his children at the same time, and it had been 13 years since he had seen Katherine. In 1928, desperate for cash, Curtis sold the rights to his project to J. P. Morgan Jr. The concluding volume of The North American Indian was published in 1930. In total, about 280 sets were sold of his now completed magnum opus. In 1930, his ex-wife, Clara, was still living in Seattle operating the photo studio with their daughter Katherine. His other daughter, Florence Curtis, was still living in Medford, Oregon, with her husband, Henry Graybill. After Clara died of heart failure in 1932,Certificate of death for Clara J. Curtis, Center for Health Statistics, Department of Health, State of Washington. his daughter Katherine moved to California to be closer to her father and Beth. =Loss of rights to The North American Indian= In 1935, the Morgan estate sold the rights to The North American Indian and remaining unpublished material to the Charles E. Lauriat Company in Boston for $1,000 plus a percentage of any future royalties. This included 19 complete bound sets of The North American Indian, thousands of individual paper prints, the copper printing plates, the unbound printed pages, and the original glass-plate negatives. Lauriat bound the remaining loose printed pages and sold them with the completed sets. The remaining material remained untouched in the Lauriat basement in Boston until they were rediscovered in 1972. Personal life =Marriage and divorce= In 1892, Curtis married Clara J. Phillips (1874‚Äì1932), who was born in Pennsylvania. Her parents were from Canada. Together they had four children: Harold (1893‚Äì1988); Elizabeth M. (Beth) (1896‚Äì1973), who married Manford E. Magnuson (1895‚Äì1993); Florence (1899‚Äì1987), who married Henry Graybill (1893‚Äì?); and Katherine (Billy) (1909‚Äì?). In 1896, the entire family moved to a new house in Seattle. The household then included Curtis's mother, Ellen Sheriff; his sister, Eva Curtis; his brother, Asahel Curtis; Clara's sisters, Susie and Nellie Phillips; and their cousin, William. During the years of work on The North American Indian, Curtis was often absent from home for most of the year, leaving Clara to manage the children and the studio by herself. After several years of estrangement, Clara filed for divorce on October 16, 1916. In 1919 she was granted the divorce and received Curtis's photographic studio and all of his original camera negatives as her part of the settlement. Curtis and his daughter Beth went to the studio and destroyed all of his original glass negatives, rather than have them become the property of his ex- wife. Clara went on to manage the Curtis studio with her sister Nellie (1880‚Äì?), who was married to Martin Lucus (1880‚Äì?). Following the divorce, the two oldest daughters, Beth and Florence, remained in Seattle, living in a boarding house separate from their mother. The youngest daughter, Katherine, lived with Clara in Charleston, Kitsap County, Washington. =Death= On October 19, 1952, at the age of 84, Curtis died of a heart attack in Los Angeles, California, in the home of his daughter Beth. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. A brief obituary appeared in The New York Times on October 20, 1952: Collections of Curtis materials =Northwestern University= The entire 20 volumes of narrative text and photogravure images for each volume are online.http://curtis.library.northwestern.edu/ Each volume is accompanied by a portfolio of large photogravure plates. The online publishing was supported largely by funds from the Institute for Museum and Library Services. =Library of Congress= The Prints and Photographs Division Curtis collection consists of more than 2,400 silver-gelatin, first-generation photographic prints ‚Äì some of which are sepia-toned ‚Äì made from Curtis's original glass negatives. Most are although nearly 100 are and larger; many include the Curtis file or negative number in the lower left-hand corner of the image. The Library of Congress acquired these images as copyright deposits from about 1900 through 1930. The dates on them are dates of registration, not the dates when the photographs were taken. About two-thirds (1,608) of these images were not published in The North American Indian and therefore offer a different glimpse into Curtis's work with indigenous cultures. The original glass plate negatives, which had been stored and nearly forgotten in the basement of the Morgan Library, in New York, were dispersed during World War II. Many others were destroyed and some were sold as junk. =Charles Lauriat archive= Around 1970, Karl Kernberger, of Santa Fe, New Mexico, went to Boston to search for Curtis's original copper plates and photogravures at the Charles E. Lauriat rare bookstore. He discovered almost 285,000 original photogravures as well as all the copper plates. With Jack Loeffler and David Padwa, they jointly purchased all of the surviving Curtis material that was owned by Charles Emelius Lauriat (1874‚Äì1937). The collection was later purchased by another group of investors led by Mark Zaplin, of Santa Fe. The Zaplin Group owned the plates until 1982, when they sold them to a California group led by Kenneth Zerbe, the owner of the plates as of 2005. 1985 Kern donated a portion of the collection to the Museum of the American Indian (National Museum of the American Indian New York). Other glass and nitrate negatives from this set are at the Palace of the Governors Photo Archives (Santa Fe, New Mexico). =Peabody Essex Museum= Charles Goddard Weld purchased 110 prints that Curtis had made for his 1905‚Äì06 exhibit and donated them to the Peabody Essex Museum, where they remain. The 14\\" by 17\\" prints are each unique and remain in pristine condition. Clark Worswick, curator of photography for the museum, describes them as: =Indiana University= Two hundred seventy-six of the wax cylinders made by Curtis between 1907 and 1913 are held by the Archives of Traditional Music at Indiana University.Archives of Traditional Music These include recordings of music of the following Native American groups: Clayoquot, Cowichan, Haida, Hesquiat, and Kwakiutl, in British Columbia; and Arapaho, Cheyenne, Cochiti, Crow, Klikitat, Kutenai, Nez Perc√©, Salish, Shoshoni, Snohomish, Wishram, Yakima, Acoma, Arikara, Hidatsa, Makah, Mandan, Paloos, Piegan, Tewa (San Ildefonso, San Juan, Tesuque, Namb√©), and possibly Dakota, Clallam, Twana, Colville and Nespelim in the western United States. =University of Wyoming= Toppan Rare Books Library at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyoming, holds the entire 20 volume set of narrative texts and photogravure images that make up The North American Indian. Each volume of text is accompanied by a portfolio of large photogravure plates. Legacy =Revival of interest= Though Curtis was largely forgotten at the time of his death, interest in his work revived and continues to this day. Casting him as a precursor in visual anthropology, Harald E.L. Prins reviewed his oeuvre in the journal American Anthropologist and noted: \\"Appealing to his society's infatuation with romantic primitivism, Curtis portrayed American Indians to conform to the cultural archetype of the 'vanishing Indian.' Elaborated since the 1820s, this ideological construct effectively captured the ambivalent racism of Anglo-American society, which repressed Native spirituality and traditional customs while creating cultural space for the invented Indian of romantic imagination. [Since the 1960s,] Curtis's sepia-toned photographs (in which material evidence of Western civilization has often been erased) had special appeal for this 'Red Power' movement and even helped inspire it.\\" Major exhibitions of his photographs were presented at the Morgan Library & Museum (1971), the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1972), and the University of California, Irvine (1976). His work was also featured in several anthologies on Native American photography published in the early 1970s. Original printings of The North American Indian began to fetch high prices at auction. In 1972, a complete set sold for $20,000. Five years later, another set was auctioned for $60,500. The revival of interest in Curtis's work can be seen as part of the increased attention to Native American issues during this period. =Critical reception= A representative evaluation of The North American Indian is that of Mick Gidley, Emeritus Professor of American Literature, at Leeds University, in England, who has written a number of works related to the life of Curtis: \\"The North American Indian‚Äîextensively produced and issued in a severely limited edition‚Äîcould not prove popular. But in recent years anthropologists and others, even when they have censured what they have assumed were Curtis' methodological assumptions or quarrelled with the text's conclusions, have begun to appreciate the value of the project's achievement: exhibitions have been mounted, anthologies of pictures have been published, and The North American Indian has increasingly been cited in the researches of others ... The North American Indian is not monolithic or merely a monument. It is alive, it speaks, if with several voices, and among those perhaps mingled voices are those of otherwise silent or muted Indian individuals.\\" Of the full Curtis opus N. Scott Momaday wrote, \\"Taken as a whole, the work of Edward S. Curtis is a singular achievement. Never before have we seen the Indians of North America so close to the origins of their humanity ... Curtis' photographs comprehend indispensable images of every human being at every time in every place\\" Don Gulbrandsen, the author of Edward Sheriff Curtis: Visions of the First Americans, put it this way in his introductory essay on Curtis's life: \\"The faces stare out at you, images seemingly from an ancient time and from a place far, far away ... Yet as you gaze at the faces the humanity becomes apparent, lives filled with dignity but also sadness and loss, representatives of a world that has all but disappeared from our planet.\\" In Shadow Catcher: The Life and Work of Edward S. Curtis, Laurie Lawlor revealed that \\"many Native Americans Curtis photographed called him Shadow Catcher. But the images he captured were far more powerful than mere shadows. The men, women, and children in The North American Indian seem as alive to us today as they did when Curtis took their pictures in the early part of the twentieth century. Curtis respected the Native Americans he encountered and was willing to learn about their culture, religion and way of life. In return the Native Americans respected and trusted him. When judged by the standards of his time, Curtis was far ahead of his contemporaries in sensitivity, tolerance, and openness to Native American cultures and ways of thinking.\\" alt=portrait of Theodore Roosevelt from 1904, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, 1904, orotone by Curtis Theodore Roosevelt, a contemporary of Curtis's and one of his most fervent supporters, wrote the following comments in the foreword to Volume 1 of The North American Indian: Curtis has been praised as a gifted photographer but also criticized by some contemporary ethnologists for manipulating his images. Although the early twentieth century was a difficult time for most Native communities in America, not all natives were doomed to becoming a \\"vanishing race.\\" At a time when natives' rights were being denied and their treaties were unrecognized by the federal government, many natives were successfully adapting to Western society. By reinforcing the native identity as the noble savage and a tragic vanishing race, some believe Curtis deflected attention from the true plight of American natives. At the time when he was witnessing their squalid conditions on reservations first-hand, they were attempting to find their place in Western culture and adapt to their changing world. In his photogravure In a Piegan Lodge, published in The North American Indian, Curtis retouched the image to remove a clock between the two men seated on the ground. He is also known to have paid natives to pose in staged scenes or dance and partake in simulated ceremonies. His models were paid in silver dollars, beef and autographed photos. For instance, one of his first subjects, Princess Angelina, was paid a dollar a photo. Curtis paid natives to pose at a time when they lived with little dignity and enjoyed few rights and freedoms. It has been suggested that he altered and manipulated his pictures to create an ethnographic, romanticized simulation of native tribes untouched by Western society.

He is a member of the Democratic Party. In 2002, Sanchez ran an unsuccessful campaign as the Democratic nominee for Governor of Texas against Republican incumbent Rick Perry. Sanchez is also known for his successful oil, natural gas, and banking operations, which are based in Laredo, Webb County, Texas. Early life and education Sanchez, a descendant of Tom√°s S√°nchez, was born on February 3, 1943, in Laredo, Texas, and attended to Saint Mary's University in San Antonio, Texas, where he earned a B.A. degree (1965) and J.D., (1969). He was a member of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission from 1985 to 1991. He also served on the University of Texas at Austin Board of Regents, from 1997 to 2003. Oil and gas business Participating in the oil and gas brokerage business that he and his late father, Antonio Rodolfo Sanchez, Sr., founded, Sanchez immediately envisioned expansion of the family business beyond a small operation into the larger scope business of oil and gas exploration, development, and production. Tony's father agreed; and in 1973, the father and son duo, along with their partner, Brian E. O'Brien, drilled a successful exploratory well in Webb County. This initial well started the development of the largest pool of natural gas found in the United States in 30 years. Three decades after drilling its first well and participating in the drilling of over 1,000 wells in Texas and other states, the Sanchez Oil & Gas Corporation remains active in exploration and development, with operations concentrated in Texas. Sanchez serves on the Conoco board of directors and is an active member of a number of organizations: the American Petroleum Institute, the Independent Petroleum Association of America and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission. In 1994, he was appointed to the National Petroleum Council, which advises the United States Secretary of Energy. 2002 Texas gubernatorial campaign In March 2002, Sanchez, then a member of the University of Texas Board of Regents from 1997 to 2003, defeated former state Attorney General Dan Morales for the Democratic nomination for governor. Later, Morales endorsed Sanchez's Republican opponent, Rick Perry. Morales' brother was imprisoned for having attempted to blackmail Sanchez in the primary campaign. Morales himself went to prison for wrongdoing in connection with the state tobacco settlement. During Sanchez's campaign to unseat Perry, the heated topic was homeowners' insurance reform. Questions arose over a multimillion-dollar settlement against Farmers Insurance Group regarding mold coverage and the role played by former state legislator Joe Nixon. In several Texas cities, both Sanchez and the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate, Ron Kirk, the former mayor of Dallas, Texas, shared campaign space. Sanchez energy businesses and family involvement  Sanchez is former chairman and CEO of Sanchez Oil & Gas Corporation a privately held company that he built with his father, Antonio Sanchez, Sr. He is also the chairman of Sanchez Energy Corporation and Sanchez Midstream Partners, related publicly traded corporations. He and his family are also majority owners of International Bancshares Corporation (parent of International Bank of Commerce), a multibillion-dollar bank holding company, and Sanchez has been a major investor in Blockbuster, Viacom, and other high- tech ventures. His wealth has been estimated in excess of $600 million. One of his sons, Tony Sanchez III, is the president and CEO of Sanchez Energy. His other son Patricio is president and COO of Sanchez Midstream Partners. The two sons are co-presidents of Sanchez Oil & Gas.  Later political and philanthropic engagement  He has served as an aide to former Lieutenant Governor Ben Barnes. \\"Over Bush's career, Sanchez, members of his family, and employees of his companies have given him at least $320,150, making them his No. 2 career patron,\\" according to the Center for Public Integrity. After the March 7, 2006, primary, he announced his support for independent gubernatorial candidate Carol Keeton Strayhorn, who fared poorly in Webb County voting, in her general election campaign against Perry. He also donated campaign money to Democrat Michael Skelly in his unsuccessful bid for a congressional seat in the race for Texas's 7th congressional district in 2008 against incumbent Republican John Culberson.

Fictional character biography Introduced in chapter four, Bill is perceived by Alice to be someone who does all of the hard work for The White Rabbit and the denizens of the community. When Alice becomes stuck in one of The White Rabbit's house's rooms from drinking from an unlabeled bottle that made her grow uncontrollably, the rabbit's attempts to get in through the door and window fail. Bill the Lizard is sent to go through the chimney to investigate, since he and another creature have a ladder in their possession. Unwilling to let Bill get through the chimney, Alice uses her now huge foot, which is in the chimney, to kick Bill into the air. He manages to survive the fall thanks to fellow creatures. Reappearing in chapters eleven and twelve, Bill is a juror in the trial of The Knave of Hearts' supposed theft of The Queen of Heart's tarts. When his pencil squeaks too much on his slate, it annoys Alice to the point that she takes the pencil from him. Not knowing where it went, Bill the Lizard starts using his finger to write, even though it left no mark on the slate. In chapter twelve, he becomes disheveled when the \\"mile-high\\" Alice disturbs the jury by messing up the jury box. When Alice puts Bill the Lizard back in his place, he stares blankly up in the sky. Then later, the Queen provides ink for Bill when she spills ink on his face. In other media =Disney= Bill makes a brief appearance in the Disney film based on the book. Here, he is portrayed as a chimney sweep with a Cockney accent who is recruited by the White Rabbit and the Dodo to go down the Rabbit's chimney to pull the \\"monster\\" (Alice, made giant) out of the house. He seems all right with the task at first, but when he sees Alice in the window and realizes that he's been asked to retrieve a \\"monster\\", he tries to run in terror. However, the Dodo catches him and forces him down the chimney, telling him this could be his moment of glory. Unlike the book, he is not kicked out, since Alice's hands and legs are sticking out outside of the house. Instead, he spreads a lot of soot, causing Alice to begin to sneeze. Hearing her inhale frantically, the White Rabbit hides and the Dodo is knocked off the roof from Alice wriggling inside as she tries to suppress the sneeze. Bill, however, cannot escape in time, and Alice's sneeze is so big it blows all the soot out of the house and rockets Bill into the sky. The Rabbit and Dodo watch him disappear and Dodo smiles, \\"Well, there goes Bill.\\" Alice, recovered from her sternutation, peeps out the window and utters: \\"Poor Bill.\\" He is not seen again. He was voiced by Larry Grey. A lizard identical in both appearance and voice is a member of Ratigan's gang in the film The Great Mouse Detective. He was voiced by Wayne Allwine, who was best known as the voice of Mickey Mouse. He was once briefly voiced by Charles Fleischer, who also voiced Roger Rabbit in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. even though his voice actor was never in the end credits. In Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Bill can be spotted in the beginning scene of the film helping someone hold a ladder. =American McGee's Alice= Bill (under the name of Bill McGill) makes a cameo in the video game American McGee's Alice, voiced by Andrew Chaikin. He is much more chameleon-like and appears to be a builder, and wears a toolbelt, cap and waistcoat. He has a very cynical outlook on life and repeatedly asks Alice for brandy, until a gust from the Duchess's house forces Alice inside, causing him to run in fear. He later appears again, and explains that he'll have the leeches in to clear up the remains of the defeated Duchess. =Once Upon a Time in Wonderland= A character very loosely based on Bill by the name Elizabeth appears in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, portrayed by Lauren McKnight. Going by the nickname \\"Lizard\\", Elizabeth is a young woman who is one of Caterpillar's Collectors. Alice meets her upon attempting to locate the Knave of Hearts (who in this series is Will Scarlet) after the two split up. She tells Alice that she and the Knave were great friends in his earlier days, assisting him with many battles in Wonderland. She also reveals of his love for Anastasia, and this being the real reason that he escaped Wonderland....to forget her abandonment of him. Lizard later attempts to help Alice rescue the Knave, though she is knocked out by Jafar. She does regain consciousness where she sees Anastasia looking at the Knave's petrified form. Later after bathing in the river, Elizabeth finds Cyrus' lamp where the Knave of Hearts is now residing. She does make some wishes which improves a nearby town. Elizabeth then admits to the Knave of Hearts that she has feelings for him. After unwittingly making her third wish for the Knave of Hearts to feel something for her, Elizabeth falls dead. The Jabberwocky later finds Elizabeth's dead body and takes her eyes so that Jafar can track down Cyrus' lamp. =Alice's Warped Wonderland= Bill the Lizard appeared in the Sunsoft's 2006 mobile game . Bill takes the form of a slender young man with lizard-like attributes, including a forked tongue, reptilian eyes, and green hair. Bill serves as the \\"Keeper of Truth\\" and is the character who guards Ariko's (the \\"Alice\\" of the game) suppressed tragic memories until she is ready to accept them.

It is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or alternatively TT$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. It is subdivided into 100 cents. Cents are abbreviated with the cent sign ¬¢, or TT¬¢ to distinguish from other currencies that use cents. Its predecessor currencies are the Trinidadian dollar and the Tobagonian dollar.  History  The history of currency in the former British colony of Trinidad and Tobago closely follows that of the British Eastern Caribbean territories in general. The first currency used was the Spanish dollar, also known as \\"pieces of eight\\", which began circulating in the 16th century. Proposals for establishing banks in the West Indies, targeted at landowners, were made in 1661 by the British government, and in 1690 by Sir Thomas Dalby. Despite this, and Queen Anne's proclamation of 1704 that brought the gold standard to the West Indies, silver pieces of eight (Spanish dollars and later Mexican dollars) continued to form a major portion of the circulating currency right into the latter half of the nineteenth century. The abolition of slavery in the West Indies was the catalyst which led to the establishing of the first bank. The Colonial Bank was established on 1 June 1836, and opened its first branch in Trinidad in 1837 under the management of Anthony Cumming. Its initial mandate was to use Spanish and Mexican dollars as its official currency, and it was required to make all payments in those currencies, but incoming payments could be made in any currency, and the bank often found that it was short of dollars. The bank therefore lobbied the government, seeking permission to issue money in other currencies. This resulted in an imperial order-in-council in 1838, in which Trinidad and Tobago formally adopted the sterling currency, although the Spanish, Mexican and Colombian currencies were also declared legal tender. A second bank, the West India Bank, was granted a Royal Charter in 1840, and opened its first branch in 1843. The loss of its monopoly had a profound effect on the Colonial Bank, which was also at a disadvantage due to not being permitted to pay interest on deposits, as the West India Bank did. The two banks pursued opposite strategies, with the Colonial Bank maintaining a conservative stance, including removing currency from circulation, while the West India Bank pursued aggressive expansion. The Sugar Duties Act of 1846, which equalised the duties on sugar imported into the United Kingdom from the British colonies with that of non-British territories, created a financial crisis in Trinidad and Tobago as the price of sugar fell rapidly. The West India Bank, which had taken on too much risk, went bust during the crisis and the Colonial Bank was also put under strain. The international silver crisis of 1873 signalled the end of the silver dollar era in the West Indies and silver dollars were demonetized in Tobago in 1879 and in Trinidad at around the same period. This left a state of affairs, in which the British coinage circulated, being reckoned in the private sector using dollar accounts at an automatic conversion rate of 1 dollar = 4 shillings 2 pence. Local banks also issued their own dollars, however, denominated in dollars. Government offices kept their accounts in British pounds, shillings, and pence until the year 1935 when Trinidad and Tobago went decimal. The Currency Interpretation Ordinance of 1934 replaced the system of pounds, shillings and pence with the dollar, retaining the fixed exchange rate of 1 dollar for every 4 shillings 2 pence. From 1949, with the introduction of the British West Indies dollar, the currency of Trinidad and Tobago became officially tied up with that of the British Eastern Caribbean territories in general. The British sterling coinage was eventually replaced by a new decimal coinage in 1955, with the new cent being equal to one half of the old penny. In 1951, notes of the British Caribbean Territories, Eastern Group, were introduced, replacing Trinidad and Tobago's own notes. In 1955, coins were introduced when the dollar was decimalized. 2006 Series of the Trinidad and Tobago dollar The currency of the union was replaced by the modern Trinidad and Tobago dollar in 1964, two years after the nation's independence in 1962. The Trinidad and Tobago dollar was launched, and had become the sole currency by 1967. In 1964, Trinidad and Tobago introduced its own dollar. Between 1964 and 1968 the Trinidad and Tobago dollar was utilized in Grenada as legal tender until that country rejoined the common currency arrangements of the East Caribbean dollar. The Trinidad and Tobago dollar and the Eastern Caribbean dollar were the last two currencies in the world to retain the old rating of one pound equals four dollars and eighty cents, as per the gold sovereign to the Pieces of eight. Both of these currencies ended this relationship within a few weeks of each other in 1976. After VAT was introduced in 1989, the dollar was switched from a fixed rate to a managed float regime on Easter Weekend, 1993. For a wider outline of the history of currency in the region, see Currencies of the British West Indies.  Coins  In 1966, coins were introduced in denominations of 1¬¢, 5¬¢, 10¬¢, 25¬¢ & 50¬¢. A large sized $1 coin was first released for circulation in 1969 and again in 1979 before being replaced with a smaller sized version in 1995 more regularly minted. The 5¬¢ is struck in bronze, with the other denominations in cupro- nickel. The obverses all feature Trinidad and Tobago's coat of arms, with the reverse designs solely featuring the denomination until 1976, when they were replaced by either a national bird or flower in addition to the denomination after the declaration of a republic. The 50¬¢ & $1 coins are scarcely seen in circulation, but can be purchased from banks if requested. There are also coins minted in $5, $10, $100 and $200 denominations as well. These coins are not in circulation, and can only be obtained from the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, either as part of a special 'eight-coin proof set' collection (in the case of the $5 and $10 coins) or individually (in the case of the $100 and $200 coins.) Notably, the $5 and $10 coins are minted in sterling silver, whereas the $100 and $200 are minted in gold. The price of the gold coins fluctuate depending on the current state of the market for gold. In 2014 the government stopped minting the 1¬¢ coin. On 3 July 2018 cash rounding was implemented as 1¬¢ coins ceased being legal tender for cash payments, but the Central Bank will redeem them indefinitely in multiples of 5¬¢.  Banknotes  In the nineteenth century, the British gold sovereign was valued at four Spanish silver dollars and eighty cents. When the sterling coinage was finally accepted as the main circulating coinage in the British West Indies, the Eastern Caribbean colonies continued nevertheless to use the dollar unit for accounting purposes. The West Indian dollar was therefore equivalent to four shillings and two pence. This Royal Bank of Canada note reflects this state of affairs with its overt mention of the fact that one hundred dollars is equal to twenty pounds, sixteen shillings, and eight pence sterling. This state of affairs was exclusively confined to the Eastern Caribbean region, possibly due to the geographical proximity to British Guiana. British Guiana had a reason to wish to retain the dollar unit owing to its recent changeover from Dutch currency. These factors did not affect Jamaica, Bermuda, or the Bahamas which adopted the sterling currency in both coinage and as the unit of account. In 1898, the Colonial Bank introduced $20 notes. These were followed in 1901 by $5. $100 notes were also issued. The last notes were issued in 1926, after which the Colonial Bank was taken over by Barclays Bank, which issued $5, $20 & $100 notes until 1941. In 1905, notes were introduced by the government in denominations of $1 & $2, followed by $5 in 1935, followed by $10 & $20 in 1942. The Royal Bank of Canada introduced $5, $20 & $100 notes in 1909. From 1920, the notes also bore the denomination in sterling. 100-dollar notes were not issued after 1920, whilst the $5 and $20 were issued until 1938. The Canadian Bank of Commerce introduced $5, $20 & $100 notes in 1921, with the $5 & $20 notes issued until 1939. The Royal Bank of Canada one hundred dollar note, shown here; is a relic of a monetary system, in which the unit of account was related to the circulating coinage on the basis of two historical coins which were no longer in use. Trinidad and Tobago 100 Dollars banknote of 1964 On 14 December 1964, the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago introduced notes for $1, $5, $10 & $20. New denominations in the form of $50 & $100 notes were issued on 6 June 1977, although the $50 note was not continued after a shipment was stolen prior to issue. The $50 note was taken out of its brief circulation. The reverses of the current notes feature the Central Bank Building of Trinidad & Tobago. The obverses have the coat of arms in the center, a national bird and a place in Trinidad, such as a market, petroleum refinery, etc. In 2002, new $1 & $20 notes were introduced. In 2003, new $1, $5, $10 & $100 were also introduced. The notes were only slightly changed; they now have more security features & darker colour. Recently, more security features have been added to the notes by the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago. In 2012 the $50 note was reintroduced to commemorate Trinidad and Tobago's Golden Jubilee of Independence. On the front of the note is a Red- capped cardinal bird and the commemorative text around the center of the coat of arms.Trinidad and Tobago new 50-dollar regular and commemorative notes reported BanknoteNews.com. Retrieved 2012-06-21 Two versions of this denomination were released, one without the commemorative text around the centre of the coat of arms (general circulation) and one with the commemorative text. Trinidad and Tobago revised 50 Dollar bill 2015 On 9 December 2019 polymer $100 notes were distributed to banks. The government announced that the current $100 notes would be demonetized after 31 December 2019.

He was active in Italy, especially Venice, and wrote both sacred and secular music; he may have been a relative of Arnold de Lantins, another composer active at the same time in the same area. Little is known about his life, except that he was probably in Venice during the 1420s, for he wrote ceremonial music for the Doge Francesco Foscari; his music appears in several collections from that city. Evidently he wrote music for the wedding of Cleofe Malatesta and Theodore Palaiologos, Prince of Sparta, in 1421, since precise topical details occur in the text to the music. He almost certainly was known to Dufay, since both composers wrote music for some of the same events, and Dufay mentioned him in the text to one of the compositions he wrote during his stay in Rimini with the Malatesta family (1420‚Äì1424). Hugo's music is more forward looking than that of Arnold, making use of imitation, which was to become the prevailing musical device for the next hundred years and more; indeed, imitation is more prevalent in the music of Lantins than in the music of any other composer of the early 15th century. Most of Hugo's music is for three voices, though occasionally he added a fourth. Several sections of masses have survived, but none complete, as well as five motets, one of which is isorhythmic. In the secular music category he wrote many rondeaux, all in French, as well as some ballate in Italian (almost certainly for the royal wedding of the Malatesta family).

It is said to be an illdefined district, sometimes incorrectly referred to as an economic region,. The district is located within parts of the Barwon South West and the Grampians regions; extending from the south-west corner of the state to Ballarat in the east and as far north as Ararat. The district is bounded by the Wimmera district in the north, by the Goldfields district in the east, by Bass Strait and the Southern Ocean in the south, and by the South Australian border in the west. The district is well known for the production of wool. The most populated city in the Western District is the Ballarat region, with 96,940 inhabitants.ABS ERP 2015 The principal centres of the district are: Warrnambool, Hamilton, Colac, Portland, Casterton, Port Fairy, Camperdown, and Terang. Other cities and towns in or on the edge of the district include: Coleraine, Merino, Heywood, Dunkeld, Penshurst, Macarthur, Koroit, Allansford, Ararat, Willaura, Beaufort, Learmonth, Ballarat, Snake Valley, Skipton, Moyston, Linton, Derrinallum, Lismore, Mortlake, Noorat, Cobden, Timboon, Beeac, Cororooke, Birregurra, Apollo Bay, and Lorne. Geology It consists of a nearly flat volcanic plain created by a number of quite recently active volcanoes, the best known being Mount Eccles, Mount Richmond and Mount Gambier. Whilst some of them (e.g. Mount Richmond) have given rise to cemented pyroclastic rocks that do not produce fertile soils, others have given rise to fertile Andisols that make the district the best grazing land in Australia, as well as highly suitable for the production of vegetable crops. Away from the volcanoes, soils are of moderate to low fertility and many are sandy, supporting heathland flora like the Grampians. Drainage is very poor and most rivers flow only after prolonged periods of steady rain, resulting in remarkably variable flow when the low variability of the climate is taken into account. The major mountain range is the Otway Ranges, which straddle the boundary between the Western District and Port Phillip District. Climate The climate is mild to warm and generally humid to sub-humid. Summer temperatures are warm, with February means ranging from at Portland to in the northern part of the plain. Rainfall in summer is not uncommon but is only rarely heavy; though in March 1946 rains of up to in a week constitute easily the heaviest falls in the district. In winter, temperatures typically range from minima of around to maxima of , and rainfall is very frequent and reliable, averaging from in the driest area around Lake Bolac to at Portland. In the Otway Ranges, summers are mild, averaging around , whilst winters are cold and very wet, with maxima averaging around and rainfall averaging about with extremes in June 1952 as high as at Weeaproinah and a Victorian record at nearby Tanybryn. History The Western District was well-populated by Aboriginal Victorians at the time colonisation began. For example, the ancestors of the Gunditjmara people lived in villages of weather-proof houses with stone walls a metre high, located near eel traps and aquaculture ponds at Lake Condah and elsewhere - on just one hectare of Allambie Farm, archaeologists have discovered the remains of 160 house sites.The Gunditjmara People with Gib Wettenhall, (2010) The People of Budj Bim: Engineers of aquaculture, builders of stone house settlements and warriors defending country, em Press, Heywood, pp.16-27 Henty wrote in his diary on 3 December 1834: > Arrived at 6p.m., made the boat fast in the middle of the river, and started > three days' walk in the bush accompanied by H Camfield, Wm Dutton, five men, > one black woman and 14 dogs, each man with a gun and sufficient quantity of > damper to last for the voyage. In the 5 December entry Henty wrote: > On descending the hill we saw a native. He immediately ran on seeing us. He > was busily employed pulling the gums from the wattle trees. Both the Henty brothers and Captain Griffiths (who settled at Port Fairy in 1836), combined whaling and farming. The district was explored by Thomas Mitchell in 1836 who identified the area's potential for grazing. Charles Tyers was the first to survey the area in 1839. Sheep were first brought to the district in 1836 by Thomas Manifold at Port Henry, near Geelong, and rapidly occupied the whole district. By 1840 squatters occupied almost all the district. The first settlers avoided the Western District (preferring the forest country further west), as its countryside was then exceptionally dry: tussocks were so scanty it was said one could walk to Geelong without stepping on grass. Runoff after rainfall was rapid, and it was claimed that only after cattle had firmed the soil that the grass began to thicken. The regional climate also became much wetter.http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/138676917http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/currie- john-lang-3304 =Aboriginal dispossession= With pastoral land in the colony of Van Diemen's Land fully allocated to colonists, John Batman turned his attention to mainland land speculation at the vast grasslands of Port Phillip Bay, which began in 1835 without the consent of the British Crown. With no legal recognition or protection of the Aboriginal inhabitants, some cases of violence occurred. For example, in August 1836, some Aboriginal people killed the squatter Charles Franks and an unnamed shepherd, at Franks' station on the Werribee River (near Melbourne). In response, Henry Batman (John Batman's brother) led an indiscriminate punitive expedition against a group of 70-80 Aboriginal people (men, women & children) living in 9 large huts on the Werribee River, killing an unrecorded number. In spite of this, in May 1837, Henry Batman \\"...was appointed acting Commissioner of Crown Lands, the official charged with overseeing the squatters.\\" Earlier, on 4 March 1837, Governor Bourke in his visit to Melbourne addressed 120 Aboriginal people, \\"...whom he exhorted...to good conduct and attention to the Missionary.' The Kulin were given blankets and four favoured men, who had been recommended for 'honorary distinctions' by [Police Magistrate Captain William] Lonsdale, were awarded brass plates.\\"Boyce, James (2008). p.148 By 1839, large numbers of homeless Aboriginal people from surrounding pastoral districts, were \\"....surviving whenever and however they could on the geographic, social and economic margins of the town [ie, Melbourne].\\"Boyce, James (2008). p.186 When Chief Protector of Aborigines George Augustus Robinson arrived in the town in the winter of 1839, \\"four to five hundred blacks of the Port Phillip tribes\\" were gathering at a camp site on the south bank of the Yarra River, suffering hunger and disease. By 1840, Robinson still \\"....had no stores allocated to him...\\" by Captain Lonsdale, the Police Magistrate in Melbourne, even though \\"...it was patently obvious that the Aborigines were starving, and many were ill and near death...\\" With land in the hinterland overrun by \\"...vast numbers of sheep and cattle..\\" and \\"...conditions in the countryside becoming intolerable, the blacks swarmed into Melbourne looking for food and blankets.\\" Between 1836 and 1842, Victorian Aboriginal groups were largely dispossessed of hunting grounds larger than the whole of England. =Eumeralla Wars= In the Portland area in the 1840s, the Gunditjmara fought for their hunting grounds in a series of clashes known as the Eumeralla Wars, in which both they and colonists experienced violent deaths. The Gunditjmara resistance became overwhelmed by the colonisers who brought in the Native Police - an organisation consisting of highly skilled Aboriginal men dedicated to keeping the peace in their native land. The historian Jan Critchett has documented this conflict in her 1990 book, A distant field of murder: Western district frontiers, 1834-1848. =Aftermath= The colonization of the Western District had huge impacts beyond the immediate district. By January 1844, there were said to be 675 Aborigines resident in squalid camps in Melbourne. Although the British Colonial Office appointed 5 \\"Aboriginal Protectors\\" for the entire Aboriginal population of Victoria, arriving in Melbourne in 1839, they worked \\"...within a land policy that nullified their work, and there was no political will to change this.\\"Boyce, James (2008). p.177 \\"It was government policy to encourage squatters to take possession of whatever Aboriginal land they chose,....that largely explains why almost all the original inhabitants of Port Phillip's vast grasslands were dead so soon after 1835\\".Boyce, James (2008). p.199 By 1845, fewer than 240 wealthy Europeans held all the pastoral licences then issued in Victoria and became the patriarchs \\"...that were to wield so much political and economic power in Victoria for generations to come.\\"Boyce, James (2008). p.163 With the Aboriginal population dispossessed of hunting grounds and their centuries-old management of fire having been disrupted for almost 15 years, the Colony experienced for the first time its largest ever bushfires, burning about 25% of the land area of Victoria on Black Thursday (1851) on 6 February 1851. =Missions= Missionaries sought to relocate Gunditjmara people of the west to a mission established further east near Purnim in 1861, however, the Gunditjmara from the Portland region refused because of tension with rival Aboriginal clans from the eastern boundary of Gunditjmara country and beyond the Hopkins River. Five years later in 1866, of Crown land at Lake Condah was set aside for use as an Aboriginal mission. This land was gazetted as a reserve in 1869 and an Anglican mission was established. In 1951, the Lake Condah reserve, with the exception of three small areas, was revoked and the land was handed over to the Soldiers Settlement Commission. =Towards recognition of Aboriginal rights= In 1980, the Gunditjmara launched Onus v. Alcoa, taking legal action in the Supreme Court of Victoria to prevent Alcoa of Australia Ltd from damaging or interfering with Gunditjmara cultural sites located on the same place as the proposed aluminium smelter at Portland. The Supreme Court dismissed their subsequent application for leave to appeal to the Federal Court. However, the Gunditjmara took the matter to the High Court of Australia where they were successful. High Court Chief Justice Gibbs judged that: \\"The appellants have an interest in the subject matter of the present action which is greater than that of other members of the public and indeed greater than that of other persons of Aboriginal descent who are not members of the Gournditch-jmara people. The applicants and other members of the Gournditch-jmara [ie, the Gunditjmara] people would be more particularly affected than other members of the Australian community by the destruction of the relics\\".Weir, Jessica (2009) pp.13-18 On 30 March 2007, the Gunditjmara were recognised by the Federal Court of Australia to be the native title-holders of almost of Crown land and waters in the Portland area.. On 27 July 2011, together with the Eastern Maar people, the Gunditjmara people were recognised to be the native title-holders of almost of Crown land in the Yambuk region, including Lady Julia Percy Island, known to them as Deen Maar.. Primary production Wheat was grown in the drier northern part of the district for some time until more easily managed soils in the Wimmera were developed. Dairying was developed as a major industry in the wetter southern parts during this period, as was the cultivation of potatoes and onions on the best soils. In the Otway Ranges, forestry became the major industry, especially after the building of the Great Ocean Road which opened up these very wet areas. Because of the change in focus since the late 1960s to woodchipping, many timber mills are now defunct as jobs have moved to Geelong. Tourism is the dominant industry in towns such as Lorne and Apollo Bay, which fill up during the summer as Melburnians are drawn by the stunning scenery and milder weather. In towns like Heywood and Nelson, pine plantations have been the dominant industry since the 1950s but the industry, even as plantations mature, is under threat due to poor prices.

The Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad was a railroad from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Trenton, New Jersey. Opened in 1832, it became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad system in 1871. The majority of it is now part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. History The P&T; was chartered on February 23, 1832, by the Pennsylvania General Assembly and organized on June 9, 1832. It opened in 1834 from Philadelphia to Trenton. In 1836, the Camden and Amboy Railroad began to operate the P&T;, after obtaining a controlling stock interest. The original terminus was at Kensington station. The PRR, which controlled the Philadelphia & Trenton, had originally intended to directly connect the two lines through the heart of Philadelphia. However, attempts to buy out and demolish buildings in the right-of-way led to riots, and the P&T; was forced to end at Kensington. On March 23, 1839, the railroad was authorized to build a southern extension along Frankford Avenue, Laurel Street and Front Street, and then run west along the Northern Liberties and Penn Township Railroad on Willow Street to its station at the Third Street Hall, at the northwest corner of Third and Willow Streets. This was never built. The part of the planned extension on Front Street would later be used by the North Pennsylvania Railroad. The several-mile distance between Kensington and downtown Philadelphia led many southbound passengers to Philadelphia to use the Camden and Amboy Railroad, which terminated at Camden and required a ferry ride across the Delaware River. To resolve the problem, the Connecting Railway Company was incorporated May 15, 1863. Between 1864 and June 1867, constructed a 6.75-mile (10.86 km) connecting line between Frankford Junction on the P&T; and Mantua Junction (now Zoo Junction) on the PRR main line, passing through what is now North Philadelphia. The P&T; leased the line, allowing its trains to reach 30th Street Station in West Philadelphia. The Pennsylvania Railroad leased the P&T; on June 30, 1871, and began operating it on December 1, 1871. A branch in Philadelphia, known as the Tioga Street Branch, was built in 1878, and later sold to the Kensington and Tacony Railroad (which was consolidated into the Connecting Railway in 1902). Realignments Several realignments have been made. In Bristol, the original alignment lies southeast of the current alignment of the Northeast Corridor. Over the Delaware River, the current alignment is southeast of the original one, which used the Trenton Free Bridge. Finally, the last bit in Trenton originally ran along West Canal Street, Merchant Street, Stockton Street and Hanover Street, ending at the original station at Broad Street and Hanover Street. It was joined to the Camden and Amboy Railroad's Trenton Branch by a bridge across the Delaware and Raritan Canal by 1836; it then used the station on the east side of the canal, just south of State Street, until the C&A; Trenton Branch was realigned around 1865 and the current station was built. The line today North of Frankford Junction in Philadelphia, where the Connecting Railway joined, the line is part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. The northernmost part south of Frankford Junction is still in place for freight, but the rest has been removed.

A total of 175 were built between February 1935 and January 1939. Two main series of locomotives were built, distinguished by engine size and output: the straight-8, 'S' series, and the V12, 'N' series. Both were offered with either one-piece cast underframes from General Steel Castings of Granite City, Illinois, denoted by 'C' after the power identifier, and fabricated, welded underframes built by EMC themselves, denoted by 'W'. This gave four model series: SC, SW, NC and NW. Further developments of the models gave model numbers NC1, NC2, NW1, and NW1A, all of which were practically indistinguishable externally from the others, as well as a pair of unique NW4 models for the Missouri Pacific Railroad and a solitary, twin-engined T transfer locomotive model built for the Illinois Central Railroad.  S series  Lackawanna 426, a preSC The production S series locomotives are identical except for cast or welded underframes, which are identical to those used under the N-series locomotives. The hood on the S series is shorter, and the locomotives have a characteristic, rounded-edged \\"satchel\\" in front of the radiator. The straight-8 Winton 201-A engine moved the exhaust stacks off- center to the engineer's left, while the N series' were central. The Winton- engined switchers can be distinguished from later EMD 567-engined units by small louvres at the top front sides of their hoods, as well as top-of-hood ventilation through several lifting vents rather than the large top grille of those later units. The series was much more successful than the during this early period; 114 were sold. = Pre-SC = Two pre-production units were built in February 1935; they differed from full production units by having a hood that did not taper in toward the cab, and six rather than three small louvres on each top front hood side. They were delivered to the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad as 425 and 426. Both were re-engined with EMD 567 engines in 1962. One, 426, was purchased by the Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad and is on display at Steamtown National Historic Site in Lackawanna colors. = SC = 43 cast-frame SC units were built between May 1936 and January 1939.

PB&NE; 206 was reengined with a 567CR block (R for counter-clockwise revolution) in 1955. The locomotive operated on both the Maryland & Pennsylvania Railroad (as #23) and Stewartstown Railroad (as #11). Since 2014, it has operated under its original #206 on the Allentown & Auburn Railroad in Kutztown, PA. While it now has an EMD 567C block, it retains its EMC electrical system and early lifting hood vents. Missouri Pacific #5 survives and operates as Thermal Belt Railway #1, repowered with a Cummins diesel.  N series  These locomotives were all nearly identical, except for cast versus welded underframes. The V12 Winton 201-A-engined NC and NW series locomotives can be distinguished from the less powerful SC and SW because, although the underframes are identical, the hood on the N series is longer, leaving only a small amount of room before the front walkway. Many, but not all, N series locomotives have a short electrical box with sharp- angled corners in that location; this is easily distinguished by the lower, longer, rounded-cornered \\"satchel\\" of the SC and SW series. The other distinguishing feature from the S series is the central location of the twin exhaust stacks; the S series have them offset towards the engineer's left, because of the inline diesel engine. = Pre-NC = One experimental locomotive was built in March 1935 as a demonstrator, numbered EMC 518. It was assembled by Bethlehem Steel of Wilmington, Delaware. After demonstration purposes, it was sold to the Philadelphia, Bethlehem and New England Railroad in October as #203, later renumbered to 55; it was later sold to the Parrish Line Railway as their #10. = NC = Five NC locomotives were built. Some had General Electric electrical equipment, while others had Westinghouse, since EMC's own designs were not yet ready. This model did not have multiple unit equipment. They were: # EMC S/N 647:1 (built January 1938): Great Northern Railway #5101 (later #5300) rebuilt to an SW1200 in 1955. # EMC S/N 648:1 (built July 1937): Philadelphia, Bethlehem and New England Railroad #208. # EMC S/N 649:1 (built July 1937): Philadelphia, Bethlehem and New England Railroad #209. # EMC S/N 650 (built May 1937): Youngstown and Northern Railroad #201, to Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway #402 in April 1946, to Philadelphia, Bethlehem and New England #55 # EMC S/N 651 (built May 1937): Youngstown and Northern Railroad #202, to Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railroad #408 in April 1946, to Marinette, Tomahawk & Western Railroad #408, then finally to the Sabine River and Northern Railroad as #408 before being preserved in the National Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri. = NC1 = Five NC1 locomotives were built during March 1937, all with Westinghouse electrics. The only difference between models NC and NC1 was the fitting of multiple unit connections to the NC1, to enable multiple working. All were delivered to the Birmingham Southern Railroad, as EMC S/N 642-646, BSR #71-75. = NC2 = Two NC2 locomotives were built in July 1937 for the Missouri Pacific Railroad. They were functionally identical to the NC1; Pinkepank states EMC as recording, enigmatically, \\"Wiring\\" as the difference. They were EMC S/N 714 and 715, MP #4100 and 4101. = NW = Eight NW locomotives were constructed between September 1937 and December 1938. They were identical to the NC except for the EMC-built welded underframes. The first three were built as EMC S/N 725-727 for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway as their #2350-2352, later renumbered #2400-2402 and rebuilt into SW1200s in 1959. Two were constructed as S/N 728 and 729 for the Philadelphia, Bethlehem and New England Railroad as their #210 and 211, later renumbered as #53 and 54. Another two were built as S/N 730 and 731 for the Kansas City Terminal Railroad as their #60 and 61. The final NW, S/N #732 was built for the Northern Pacific Railway as their #100. NP 100 was rebuilt to an SW900m in Jan 1957. It was in service on the Burlington Northern with same number and sold in 1983. = NW1 = Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway locomotive D-538 at the National Railroad Museum. The NW1 was the only 201-A-engined N series locomotive model to be ordered in any significant number; 27 were built between November 1937 and January 1939. It had a lengthened hood and no electrical box in front of it as in the other N series models. Electrical equipment was General Electric. Owning railroads were: # Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway: 2 locomotives, #400-401 # Lehigh Valley Railroad: 11 locomotives, #120-130 # Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad: 2 locomotives, #9200-9201 # Great Northern Railway: 1 locomotive, #5102 (rebuilt to an SW8 #101) # Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad: 8 locomotives, #700-707 # Chicago and North Western Railway: 1 locomotive, #901 # Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway: 2 locomotives, D538 (now preserved at the National Railroad Museum, Green Bay, Wisconsin) and D738 = NW1A = The NW1A, of which only 3 were built, was equipped with EMC-built traction motors, although the generator was still a General Electric unit. All were built for the Soo Line: EMC S/N 841-843, SOO #2100-2102. = NW4 = The NW4, of which two examples were built for the Missouri Pacific Railroad, used the hood and cab configuration of the regular N-series, but with an additional straight section between cab and hood, mounted on a lengthened frame with large air tanks on the front platform, in front of the radiator. The additional hood section contained a steam generator; The water tanks were mounted beneath the frame; the air tanks were therefore displaced to the front. The locomotives ran on AAR type B trucks re-used from EMC boxcab demonstrators #511 and 512. The two NW4s were EMC S/N 823 and 824, and were MP #4102 and 4103. They were scrapped in 1961.  T  The solitary EMC transfer locomotive classified T was built in May 1936 for the Illinois Central Railroad as their 9201, but soon renumbered as 9202. The bodywork was built by St. Louis Car Company and the electrical equipment was by General Electric. The main frame rested on two subframe bolsters which were articulated together; the four two-axle trucks were mounted to the bolsters, giving it a B-B+B-B wheel arrangement. The locomotive was a center-cab design, with twin hoods extending in both directions, each containing a V12 Winton 201-A diesel engine of , giving . The locomotive's main underframe sagged over time, and was returned to EMD for straightening and gusseting for extra strength. The locomotive was scrapped in 1950.

After an unhappy and unsettled childhood, Hickok found success as a reporter for the Minneapolis Tribune and the Associated Press (AP), becoming America‚Äôs best-known female reporter by 1932. After covering Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äôs first presidential campaign, Hickok struck up a close relationship with the soon-to-be First Lady, and travelled with her extensively. The nature of their friendship has been widely debated, especially after 3000 of their mutual letters were discovered, apparently confirming physical intimacy, and Hickok was known to be a lesbian. It was the closeness of the friendship that compromised Hickok‚Äôs objectivity, and caused her to resign from the AP and work as chief investigator for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). She later promoted the 1939 New York World's Fair, and then served as executive secretary of the Women's Division of the Democratic National Committee, living mostly at the White House. Hickok was the author of several books.  Early life and career  Lorena Alice Hickok was born on March 7, 1893 in East Troy, Wisconsin, the daughter of Addison J. Hickok (1860‚Äì1932), a dairy farmer who specialized in making butter, and Anna Hickok (nee Anna Adelia Wiate, d. 1906). She had two sisters, Ruby Adelsa (later Ruby Claff, 1896‚Äì1971) and Myrtle.All Wisconsin, Birth Index, 1820‚Äì1907, Ancestry.com Her childhood was hard; her father was an alcoholic and the family didn't enjoy the luxury of having a husband and father who was consistently employed. When she was 10 years old, the family moved to Bowdle, South Dakota and Anna died of a stroke there in 1906, when Hickok was 13 years old. In 1908, two years after his wife's passing, Addison married Emma Flashman, a divorcee who'd worked as a housekeeper for the family after Anna's passing.South Dakota Department of Health; Pierre, South Dakota; South Dakota Marriage Records, 1905‚Äì2016 Lorena's relationship with Addison was not a good one, him having been abusive and neglectful towards her, and so he did not come to her defense when Emma forced her out of the family home. Without support from her father, the 14 year old supported herself by working as a housekeeper for an Irish family, in a boarding house infested with mice, a rooming house for railroad workers on the edge of town, and in a farm kitchen. During her time at the rooming house, Hickok was forced to barricade her door with a chair so that male visitors to the house wouldn't be able to enter her room while she slept. She saw her father one more time in her life, when she was 15 years old, while on a train. Addison had no polite words for his eldest daughter but the experience was a liberating one for the girl, who left the train with the realization that she was now an adult and her father could no longer strike her. Hickok made her way to Gettysburg, South Dakota, where she met and worked for a kind, elderly lady named Mrs. Dodd, who helped her to learn how to be an adult, teaching the teenager basic skills such as washing her hair. Under Dodd's influence, Hickok decided to return to Bowdle to go to school. In exchange for room and board, she started working for a wealthy family, the Bicketts. The living situation was not a good one for Hickok, as the wife demanded she devote all her free time to keeping house, which came at the expense of schoolwork. She left the Bicketts to live with the O'Malleys, who owned a saloon, and were viewed with disdain for such. Unlike the Bickett family, Hickok found friendship with the couple, particularly the wife, who was somewhat of an outcast in Bowdle, not only for her family's source of income but for her wearing makeup and wigs and drinking alcohol. Hickok was ultimately able to find some stability within her family in 1909, when she left South Dakota to meet Ella Ellis, a cousin whom she called Aunt Ella, in Chicago Illinois. Mrs. O'Malley paid for her train fare and dressed her for the occasion. From there on, Hickock went on to graduate from high school in Battle Creek, Michigan and enroll at Lawrence College in Appleton, Wisconsin, but dropped out. Unable to fit in at college, Hickok found work covering train arrivals and departures and write personal interest stories at The Battle Creek Evening News for $7 a week. In an attempt to follow in the footsteps of her role model, novelist and former reporter Edna Ferber, she joined the Milwaukee Sentinel as its society editor, but moved on to the city beat where she developed a talent as an interviewer. She interviewed celebrities, including actress Lillian Russell, pianist Ignacy Paderewski, and opera singers Nellie Melba and Geraldine Farrar, gaining a wide audience. She also became close friends with diva Ernestine Schumann-Heink. Hickok moved to Minneapolis to work for the Minneapolis Tribune. She enrolled at the University of Minnesota, leaving upon being forced to live in a women's dormitory. She stayed with the Tribune where she was given opportunities unusual for a female reporter. She had a byline and was the paper's chief reporter, covering politics, sports, and preparing editorials. During her tenure with the paper, she also covered the football team, becoming one of the first female reporters to be assigned a sports beat. In 1923, she won an award from the Associated Press for writing the best feature story of the month, a piece on President Warren G. Harding's funeral train. During her years in Minneapolis, Hickok lived with a society reporter named Ella Morse, with whom she had an eight-year relationship. In 1926, Hickok was diagnosed with diabetes, and Morse persuaded her take a year's leave from the newspaper so the pair could travel to San Francisco and Hickok could write a novel. At the beginning of the leave, however, Morse unexpectedly eloped with an ex- boyfriend, leaving Hickok devastated. Unable to face a return to Minneapolis, Hickok moved to New York, landing a job with the New York Daily Mirror. After working for The Mirror for about a year, Hickok obtained a job with the Associated Press in 1928, where she became one of the wire service's top correspondents. Unusually for the time, she was assigned hard-news stories, which female journalists rarely covered, instead assigned soft-news stories, which were felt to be more feminine. Her November 1928 story on the sinking of the SS Vestris was published in The New York Times under her own byline, the first woman's byline to appear in the paper. She also reported on the Lindbergh kidnapping and other national events. By 1932, she had become the nation's best-known female reporter. Hickok called herself by this time \\"the top gal reporter in the country\\". Eleanor Roosevelt in 1933  Early relationship with Eleanor Roosevelt Hickok first met Roosevelt in 1928 when assigned to interview her by the AP. In 1932, Hickok convinced her editors to allow her to cover Eleanor Roosevelt during her husband's presidential campaign and for the four-month period between his election and inauguration. When the mother of Franklin's secretary, Missy LeHand, died, Eleanor invited Hickok to accompany her to Potsdam, New York for the funeral. The women spent the long train ride talking, beginning a long friendship. During the 1932 election, Hickok always submitted her stories about Eleanor Roosevelt to the subject first for her approval or to Louis Howe, the campaign adviser to Franklin Roosevelt, becoming by the end of the election an unofficial press attache for Eleanor. By Franklin's inauguration on March 4, 1933, Hickok had become Eleanor's closest friend. The two made trips together to Albany and Washington, D.C., and spent nearly every day in each other's company. Hickok joined the Roosevelts every Sunday night for dinner, while on other nights Eleanor joined Hickok at the theater or opera, or at dinners alone at Hickok's apartment. For the inauguration, Eleanor wore a sapphire ring Hickok had given her. That same day, Hickok interviewed Roosevelt in a White House bathroom, her first official interview as First Lady. By this time, Hickok was deeply in love with Roosevelt and finding it increasingly difficult to provide objective reporting. In addition, Hickok's job kept her largely in New York, while Eleanor was in Washington. Both women were troubled by the separation, professing their love by telephone and letter; Roosevelt put a picture of Hickok up in her study, which she told Hickok she kissed every night and every morning. During this period, Roosevelt wrote daily ten- to fifteen-page letters to \\"Hick\\", who was planning to write a biography of the First Lady. The nature of Hickok and Roosevelt's relationship has been a subject of dispute among historians. Roosevelt was close friends with several lesbian couples, such as Nancy Cook and Marion Dickerman, and Esther Lape and Elizabeth Fisher Read, suggesting that she understood lesbianism; Marie Souvestre, Roosevelt's childhood teacher and a great influence on her later thinking, was also a lesbian. Hickok biographer Doris Faber published some of Roosevelt and Hickok's correspondence in 1980, but concluded that the lovestruck phrasing was simply an \\"unusually belated schoolgirl crush\\" and warned historians not to be misled. Researcher Leila J. Rupp criticized Faber's argument, calling her book \\"a case study in homophobia\\" and arguing that Faber unwittingly presented \\"page after page of evidence that delineates the growth and development of a love affair between the two women\\". In 1992, Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook argued that the relationship was in fact romantic, generating national attention. Biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin summarized the letters between Hickok and Roosevelt thus: > Hick longed to kiss the soft spot at the corner of Eleanor's mouth; Eleanor > yearned to hold Hick close; Hick despaired at being away from Eleanor; > Eleanor wished she could lie down beside Hick and take her in her arms. Day > after day, month after month, the tone in the letters on both sides remains > fervent and loving. Goodwin concluded, however, that \\"whether Hick and Eleanor went beyond kisses and hugs\\" cannot be known for certain, and that the important issue is the impact the close relationship had on both women's lives. A 2011 essay by Russell Baker reviewing two new Roosevelt biographies in the New York Times Review of Books stated, \\"That the Hickok relationship was indeed erotic now seems beyond dispute considering what is known about the letters they exchanged.\\" From 1933 to 1936, Hickok was the lead investigator for Federal Emergency Relief Administration head Harry Hopkins (pictured).  In the Roosevelt administration  Early in the Roosevelt administration, Hickok is credited with pushing Eleanor to write her own newspaper column, \\"My Day\\", and to hold weekly press conferences specifically for female journalists. Hickok found it difficult to objectively cover the Roosevelts herself, however, and once suppressed a story at Eleanor's request. The declining quality of her reporting soon caused her to receive a pay cut. Despite her worries about leaving the career on which she had built her identity, Hickok quit the AP at Eleanor's urging in mid-1933. Eleanor then helped Hickok obtain the position as a Chief Investigator for Harry Hopkins' Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), where she conducted fact-finding missions. In June 1933, she resigned from the Associated Press and then spent the next month on vacation with Eleanor Roosevelt in New England and in the Atlantic provinces of Canada. In July 1933, Hopkins told Hickok: \\"What I want to you is to go around the country and look this thing over. I don't want statistics from you. I don't want the social worker angle. I just want your own reaction, as an ordinary citizen\\". Hickok traveled in a car that Eleanor had brought her which she named Bluette, heading first for the coal-mining districts of western Pennsylvania to enter the region of Appalachia. From West Virginia, she reported about the lives of the coal miners: \\"Some of them have been starving for eight years. I was told there are children in West Virginia who never tasted milk! I visited one group of 45 blacklisted miners and their families who had been living in tents two years...Most of the women you see in the camps are going without shoes or stockings...It's fairly common to see children entirely naked\\". She reported that the most common causes of death in West Virginia were tuberculosis, asthma, typhoid, diphtheria, pellagra, and malnutrition. Many people in West Virginia where she reported \\"had been living for days on green corn and string beans-and precious little of that. At the Continental Hotel in Pineville, I was told that five babies up one of those creeks had died of starvation in the last ten days...Dysentery is so common that nobody says much about it.\\" About the people of Appalachia, Hickok wrote that they were patriotic, religious and of \\"pure Anglo-Saxon stock\\", and she found them \\"curiously appealing\\". At the same time she criticized them for their apathy observing that they were willing to accept their fate as what God had intended for them. In the summer of 1933, she reported that 62% of people in the eastern counties of Kentucky were living on federal relief while another 150, 000 people depended upon relief payments from the state government to feed their families. On 12 August 1933, the Commonwealth of Kentucky stopped relief payments because of a lack of funds, leading people going to the relief offices to find them closed and then wandering away silently. Hickok wrote: \\"I cannot for the life of me understand why they don't go down and raid the Blue Grass country\\". From Iowa, she wrote to Hopkins in October 1933 that the Depression \\"is 10 or 12 years old out here\\" and Sioux City was a \\"hotbed of the Reds\\". The same month she wrote from Minnesota that the farmers were growing unhappy with President Roosevelt as one farm leader told her: \\"We were promised a New Deal...Instead, we have the same old stacked deck\\". In a letter to Eleanor from North Dakota she stated: \\"These plains are beautiful. But, oh, the terrible, crushing drabness of life here. And the suffering, for both people and animals...Most of the farm buildings haven't been painted in God only knows how long...If I had to live here, I think I'd just quietly call it a day and commit suicide....The people up here are in a daze. A sort of nameless dread hangs over the place\\". In Morton County, North Dakota, Hickok left a church and found several farmers huddled around her car, trying to stay warm from the car's engine's heat on a cold winter day. One farm wife Hickok met had 10 children and was pregnant with her 11th child, saying she wished she had some contraceptives as she and her husband could not afford such a large family. Hickok wrote: \\"The plight of the livestock is pitiable...Half-starved horses have dropped in the harness right on the road job...They've even harvested Russian thistle to feed to their horses and cattle. Russian thistle, for your information, is a thistle plant with shallow roots that dries up in the fall and is blown across the plains like rolls of barbed wire. The effect on the digestive apparatus of an animal...would be, I should imagine, much the same as though it had eaten barbed wire\\". She called South Dakota \\"the Siberia of the United States. A more hopeless place I never saw. Half the people-particularly the farmers-are scared to death...The rest of the people are apathetic\\". In South Dakota, she found several farm wives serving Russian thistle soup to their children. Out on the South Dakota plains, she visited \\"...what had once been a house. No repairs have made in years. The kitchen floor was all patched up with pieces of tin...Great patches of plaster had fallen from the walls. Newspapers had been stuffed in the cracks about the windows. And in that house two small boys...were running about without a stitch on save some ragged overalls. No shoes or stockings. Their feet were purple with cold\\". She reported some of the normally conservative farmers of South Dakota were blaming capitalism for their plight and were turning towards Communism as Communist meetings on the Great Plains were well attended. Hickok also noted the Farm Holiday Association that called for the end of banks foreclosing on farms was growing popular on the Great Plains. When one bank foreclosed on a South Dakota farm and asked the county sheriff to evict the farmer and his family, she saw the \\"Family Holiday crowd\\" disarm the sheriff's deputies at gunpoint and \\"ended up tearing off the sheriff's clothes and beating him quite badly\\". But at the same time, she noted that for all the fury and violence of the Farm Holiday movement that the prevailing mood was still apathy, writing: \\"I was told in Bismarck that in the country I visited this afternoon I would find a good deal of unrest-'farm holiday' spirit. I can't say that I did. They seemed almost too patient for me\\". In December 1933, Eleanor wrote her: \\"Mr. Hopkins said today that your reports would be the best history of the Depression in future years\\". In December 1933, Hickok went on a two-month tour of the American South, where she was horrified by the poverty, malnutrition, and lack of education that she encountered. Hickok found life the South even worse than on the Great Plains, which she previously found to be very \\"depressing\\". In January 1934, she reported that she had seen in rural Georgia \\"half-starved Whites and Blacks struggle in competition for less to eat than my dog gets at home, for the privilege of living in huts that are infinitely less comfortable than his kennel...If there is a school system in the state, it simply isn't functioning. It can't. The children just can't go to school, hundreds of them because they haven't the clothes. The illiterate parents of hundreds of others don't send them. As a result you've got the picture of hundreds of boys and girls in their teens down here in some of these rural areas who can't read or write. I'm not exaggerating...Why, some of them can barely talk!\\". In Savannah, a relief director told her: \\"Any Nigger who gets over $8 a week is a spoiled Nigger, that's all...The Negroes regard the President as the Messiah, and think that they'll all be getting $12 a week for the rest of their lives\\". In Florida, she wrote that she found seasonal farm workers on the citrus farms living in \\"peonage\\" while the hotels on the coasts were \\"comfortably filled\\". The citrus farmers of Florida had she wrote \\"got the world licked...for being mean-spirited, selfish and irresponsible\\". In February 1934, she reported from North Carolina about sharecropping: \\"The truth is that the rural South never has progressed beyond slave labor...When their slaves were taken away, the proceeded to establish a system of peonage that was as close to slavery as it possibly could be and included Whites as well as Blacks.\\" From the textile mill towns of the Carolinas, Hickok wrote about the \\"blocks and blocks of shabby, tumbledown little houses\\" inhibited by the \\"lintheads\\" as the textile workers called themselves who were not normally paid cash, but rather company scrip which could only be used to purchase food at company stores . She urged Eleanor to visit a tent city of homeless ex-miners in Morgantown, West Virginia, an experience that led Eleanor to found the federal housing project of Arthurdale, West Virginia. In March 1934, Hickok accompanied Eleanor on a fact-finding trip to the US territory of Puerto Rico, reporting afterward to Hopkins that the island's poverty was too severe for FERA to usefully intervene. One of her most important conclusions was the Great Depression did not just plunge a prosperous nation into poverty, but rather that there was an \\"old poverty\\". Hickok reported that even before 1929 there were about 40 million Americans which included virtually the entire non-white population, almost the entire rural population and most of the old who were already living in poverty, and all the Depression had done was merely make things worse for people who were already struggling. Hopkins praised her for discovering \\"a volume of chronic poverty, unsuspected except by a few students and by those who always experienced it\\". In the town of Calais, Maine she found that most of the unemployed were Catholic French-Canadians while the relief workers were WASPs. Owning to religious and ethnic prejudices, Hickok reported \\"the people on relief in that town are subjected to a treatment that is almost medieval in its stinginess and stupidity\\". From Tennessee, she reported that she found relief workers \\"whose approach to the relief problem is so typical of the old line social worker, supported by private philanthropy and looking down his- only usually it was HER-nose at God's patient poor, that it made me gag a little\\". In Texas, she visited an \\"intake\\" facility (where people applying for relief were assessed) and wrote: \\"Mr. Hopkins, did you ever spend a couple of hours sitting in an intake? Intake is about the nearest thing to Hell that I know anything about. The smell alone-I'd recognize it anywhere. And take that on top of the psychological effect of having to be there at all. God!\\" Hickok reported many of the people applying for relief were full of guilt and shame. The ethos of the \\"American Dream\\" had been so deeply engraved into the minds of so many Americans that those who found themselves without a job tended to blame themselves, feeling that their unemployment was due to some personal flaw that had condemned them to be failures in a society where in theory anyone would be successful with the right attitude. Such feelings were especially common with those who had formerly had white collar jobs as Hickok found them \\"dumb with misery\\" as they faced unemployment. In New Orleans, a newspaper editor told Hickok \\"The whole white collar class are taking an awful beating. They're whipped, that's all. And it's bad\\". One unemployed engineer told her \\"I had to murder my pride\\" before applying for relief. In Alabama, a lumberman told her \\"It took me a month [to apply for relief]. I used to go down there every day or so and walk past the place again and again. I just couldn't make myself go in\\". One 28 year old laid off teacher in Texas, fired as she was the most junior teacher, dejectedly told her: \\"If I can't make a living, I'm just no good, I guess\\". The mayor of Toledo, Ohio told Hickok: \\"I have seen thousands of these defeated, discouraged, hopeless men and women, cringing and fawning as they come to ask for public aid. It is a spectacle of national degeneration\\". During her time with FERA, Hickok developed a dislike of reporters. In one report to Hopkins in 1934, she wrote, \\"Believe me, the next state administrator who lets out any publicity on me is going to get his head cracked\\". In February 1934, Time called her \\"a rotund lady with a husky voice, a peremptory manner, baggy clothes\\", a description that wounded Hickok. In a letter to Hopkins' secretary, she asked, \\"Why the Hell CAN'T they leave me alone?\\"Roosevelt, Eleanor, Lorena A. Hickok, and Rodger Streitmatter. Empty Without You: The Intimate Letters of Eleanor Roosevelt and Lorena Hickok. New York: Free Press, 1998. pp. 89‚Äì90. Following the incident, Hickok and Roosevelt redoubled their efforts to keep their relationship out of the spotlight; on one occasion, Roosevelt wrote to her, \\"we must must be careful this summer & keep it out of the papers when we are off together. In April 1934, a Texas businessman told her that the solution to America's problems was fascism as he maintained democracy was doomed. Hickok told Hopkins that \\"honestly, after nearly a year of travelling about this country, I'm almost forced to agree with him. If I were 20 years younger and weighed 75 pounds less, I think I'd start out to be Joan of Arc of the Fascist movement in the United States...I've been out on this trip now for a little more than two weeks. In all that time I've hardly met a single person who seemed confident and cheerful. Relief loads are mounting. They can't see any improvement...Nobody seems to think any more that the thing [the New Deal] is going to WORK\\". From the Imperial Valley in California, she reported that the wealthy landowners were \\"simply hysterical\\" about the prospect of the Communists organizing the masses of the unemployed to lead a revolution. She wrote to Hopkins \\"it looks as through we're in this relief business for a long, long time...The majority of those over 45 probably will NEVER get their jobs back\\". As Roosevelt became more active as first lady, however, she had less time for Hickok. Hickok grew angry and jealous at perceived slights, and demanded more time alone, which Roosevelt was unable to give; at other times, she attempted unsuccessfully to separate herself from Roosevelt. Though the pair remained friends throughout their lives, they continued to grow apart in the years that followed. In 1937, Roosevelt wrote to Hickok that \\"I never meant to hurt you in any way, but that is no excuse having done it . . . I am pulling back from all my contacts now . . . Such cruelty & stupidity is unpardonable when you reach my age.\\" After an incident with her diabetes while traveling, Hickok resigned her FERA post for health reasons in late 1936. From 1936 to 1939, Hickok worked in public relations for the 1939 New York World's Fair.  World's Fair  On the advice of Roosevelt's secretary, Malvina Thompson, Hickok then sought work in New York with public relations man and politician Grover Whalen. Shortly after Franklin Roosevelt's 1936 re-election, Hickok was hired by Whalen to do publicity for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Opportunities for female employees of the Fair were limited, and she found the work unrewarding compared to her reporting days. Hickok primarily worked on promoting the fair to young people, including arranging class trips. Because Hickok rented both a country home and an apartment, she often faced financial problems despite her good salary during these years, and Roosevelt occasionally sent her small gifts of money.  Democratic National Committee With help from Roosevelt, Hickok became the executive secretary of the Women's Division of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in February 1940, doing groundwork for the 1940 election. Taking to the road again, she wrote Roosevelt, \\"This job is such fun, dear ... It's the nearest thing to newspaper work I've found since I left the A.P.\\" From early January 1941 until shortly after FDR's fourth inauguration in 1945, she lived at the White House. During her time there, Hickok's nominal address was at the Mayflower Hotel in DC, where she met most people. Also during this time, she formed an intense friendship with Marion Janet Harron, a United States Tax Court judge who was ten years younger than sheJohn B. Roberts, \\"Rating the First Ladies: The Women Who Influenced the Presidency\\", Citadel Press, 2004, p. 247 and almost the only person to visit her at the White House.Faber 1980, ch. 18. Hickock's grave in Rhinebeck Cemetery When Hickok's diabetes worsened in 1945, she was forced to leave her position with the DNC. Two years later, Roosevelt found her a position with the New York State Democratic Committee. When Hickok's health continued to decline, she moved to Hyde Park to be closer to Roosevelt. She lived in a cottage on the Roosevelt estate, where she died in 1968. She is buried at Rhinebeck Cemetery in Rhinebeck, New York.Wilson, Scott. Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 21279). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.  Personal life  Hickok's interest in women began when she was young and over the course of her life, she had several long term relationships with women. Some of her lovers ultimately married men or were married to men at the time they were with Hickok. Her most notable relationship was with Eleanor Roosevelt. After Roosevelt's husband won the presidency, Hickok lived in the White House. It is believed she had an affair with Mrs. Roosevelt. The relationship ended when Roosevelt traveled to Geneva to work on drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and took interest in her male doctor, Swiss physician David Gurewitsch. Hickok suffered from diabetes, which eventually led to her death. She used the condition to avoid social situations, claiming it made it difficult for her to dine with others, but Hickok had always enjoyed her own company or that of her dogs, Prinz and Mr. Choate. Hickok relied on her sister, Ruby Claff, a nurse, to help her during her ill health, as she had not only diabetes but blindness and arthritis in her later years. Hickok died at the age of 75. She was cremated and, for two decades, her ashes sat in an urn in a funeral home before being buried in an unmarked grave. A marker was finally placed on the site on May 10, 2000, describing her as \\"Hick\\" and an \\"A.P. (Associated Press) reporter, an author, an activist, and friend of E.R. (Eleanor Roosevelt).\\" Legacy Late in life, Hickok wrote several books. She co-authored Ladies of Courage with Eleanor Roosevelt in 1954. This was followed by The Story of Franklin D. Roosevelt (1956), The Story of Helen Keller (1958), The Story of Eleanor Roosevelt (1959), and several more. Hickok willed her personal papers to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park, part of the US National Archives. Her donation was contained in eighteen filing boxes that, according to the provisions of her will, were to be sealed until ten years after her death. In early May 1978, Doris Faber, as part of research for a projected short biography of Eleanor Roosevelt, became perhaps the first person outside the National Archives to open these boxes, and was astounded to discover that they contained 2,336 letters from Roosevelt to Hickok, and 1,024 letters from Hickok to Roosevelt. Most of them dated to the 1930s, but the correspondence continued up to Roosevelt's 1962 death. Hickok's papers remain at the FDR Library and Museum, where they are available to the public. Based on these letters, Terry Baum and Pat Bond wrote the play, Hick: A Love Story, the Romance of Lorena Hickok and Eleanor Roosevelt.http://press- push.com/hick/bio.html In 2018, the novelist Amy Bloom published White Houses: A Novel about the relationship between Eleanor Roosevelt and Hickok. In an interview, Bloom stated what she wanted to examine: \\"...could it be like to be madly in love with someone who is married to your political hero? Lorena was, like Eleanor, not just a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat; she was a big FDR fan, which means her hero and friend was also her rival.\\" Though the book was a novel, Bloom argued that many aspects of it such as Franklin Roosevelt approving of Eleanor's relationship with Hickok were based on fact as she argued: \\"There's no way that she was employed without Franklin's OK. And he obviously knew that she was in the White House in a bedroom adjoining his wife. I think to myself, You know, if my spouse had a lover in my house, even if it was a big house, I'm pretty sure I would notice. I'd assume the same was true for Franklin...And it was clear to me from Franklin's correspondence with other friends of Eleanor's, who were lesbian couples, that he was...I mean, he had, for a man of his background and personality, a sort of genial condescension, but also a lot of warmth and affection. I didn't think he would be threatened by Lorena.\\" However, Bloom admitted that other aspects of her novel such Hickok working in a circus were entirely of her own invention.\\"  References  Notes Bibliography  * Further reading * Beasley, Maurine. \\"Lorena A.

Life and work Read, along with his contemporaries William Billings, Oliver Holden, Supply Belcher, and Justin Morgan, was one of the primary members of a group of American composers called the Yankee tunesmiths or the First New England School. While the classical music era was in its heyday in Europe, American composers of \\"serious\\" music were setting hymn tunes in three- and four-part a cappella style, with simple folklike melodies and little regard for functional harmony. Many of these works were fuguing tunes, which begin with all voices singing together (with a melody usually based on a Protestant hymn), come to a stop, and continue with each voice entering one at a time. Nearly all were hymn tunes, developed for the use of the newly-forming singing societies. Once a private in the Massachusetts militia, later a comb-maker and owner of a general store in New Haven, Connecticut, Read was only the third American composer to put out a collection of his own music (after William Billings and Simeon Jocyln). This work, The American Singing Book (1785), went through five editions in the years immediately following: unusually successful for its day, making him by number of printings the most popular composer in the nation. To that must be added the number of published compilations of tunes that used his works (not always with his permission); \\"Sherburne\\", a 1785 tune originally from the American Singing Book, a setting of the Nahum Tate carol \\"While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks,\\" appeared over seventy times in print before 1810. Read made his living by operating a general store in New Haven, but supplemented his income by compiling and publishing tunebooks himself (which often contained his original works as well), including The Columbian Harmonist (three volumes: 1793, 1794, 1795, revised 1805, 1807, 1810) and The New Haven Collection of Sacred Music (1818). An Introduction to Psalmody (1790) was not a tunebook - in fact, it contained no music whatsoever, but was rather a pamphlet to instruct aspiring composers. Together with engraver Amos Doolittle, Read published The American Musical Magazine in twelve issues from 1786 through 1787. Read was influenced by the practices in European music in his later years, and later repudiated the compositions in the style that he exemplified and helped define. Three of the six works of his in the 1818 New Haven Collection were \\"corrected\\" to more closely conform to European standards before reprinting in that volume; his later manuscripts are works imitating the styles of European devotional music. Several of Read's tunes, such as \\"Greenwich\\", \\"Windham\\", and \\"Sherburne\\", are still sung in American churches; in addition to those tunes, \\"Judgment\\", \\"Lisbon\\", \\"Russia\\", \\"Stafford\\", \\"Windham\\", and \\"Winter\\" appear in The Core Repertory of Early American Psalmody, a scholarly anthology of the 101 most often reprinted sacred tunes in pre-1810 America, as compiled by Richard Crawford. His work is also popular among Sacred Harp singers; eleven of his tunes appear in The Sacred Harp, 1991 Edition. During the 19th and 20th centuries, Read was one of the favorite composers performed by the Stoughton Musical Society. There are fourteen of his tunes in The Stoughton Musical Society's Centennial Collection of Sacred Music, reprinted in 1980, with a new Introduction by Roger L. Hall. Read's surviving writings and portrait may be found today at the New Haven Museum and Historical Society in New Haven, Connecticut.

Early life and family Holt was born in Weston, Lewis County, West Virginia, on June 19, 1905.Rush D. Holt Sr. at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress. His parents were Chilela (n√©e Dew) and Dr. Matthew Samuel Holt,http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/holt.htm a small-town physician and horse trader. Matthew Holt was an atheist, who shifted his political support from the Republican Party to William Jennings Bryan in the 1890s, and then to Socialist candidate Eugene Debs; Matthew Holt attended the Socialist Party's 1917 convention, where he participated in condemning American involvement in World War I.Coffey, William E. \\"Isolationism and Pacifism: Senator Rush D. Holt and American Foreign Policy\\". West Virginia History, Volume 51 (1992), pp. 1-14. Rush Holt attended the public schools and West Virginia University at Morgantown; he graduated from Salem College in 1924. He became a high school teacher and athletic coach, then an instructor at Salem College. Political career Holt was elected as a Democrat to the West Virginia House of Delegates, serving from 1931 to 1935. In this office, he was described as \\"a champion of the common man and a critic of privately owned utility corporations.\\" In November 1934, at 29, he was elected to the United States Senate, but because a Senator is constitutionally required to be at least 30 years old, he could not take his seat until after his 30th birthday in June 1935. Holt was the youngest person ever popularly elected to the U.S. Senate. Holt was elected with the support of the United Mine Workers and the endorsement of Democratic West Virginia Senator Matthew M. Neely. Holt proclaimed himself an unequivocal supporter of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but according to William E. Coffey, \\"most knowledgeable observers ... viewed Holt as politically left of the president.\\" However, by 1936, Holt emerged as a vocal conservative critic of the New Deal, attacking, for example, the Works Progress Administration as corrupt and inefficient. One scoring method found Holt to be the third most conservative Democratic Senator to serve between 1937 and 2002. The two Democratic Senators who were rated as more conservative were Harry F. Byrd Sr. and Strom Thurmond. It would be more accurate to describe Holt as a traditional populist liberal, who objected to departures from traditional liberalism by F.D.R. Throughout his Senate career, Holt was a staunch isolationist. He was impressed by the findings of the Nye Committee (1934-1936) and by H. C. Engelbrecht's and F. C. Hanighen's book, Merchants of Death (1934). Holt began making a number of public appearances in support of antiwar causes, including several radio addresses for the National Council for Prevention of War. He supported the Neutrality Acts of 1935, 1936, and 1937, and also every amendment aimed at making those acts more stringent. During the Spanish Civil War, Holt declared himself in favor of \\"strict, mandatory neutrality.\\" He opposed increases in military spending, threatening to filibuster the 1938 Naval Expansion Bill. Holt did not favor American participation in international organizations, voting against World Court membership, and not supporting membership in the League of Nations. He opposed reciprocal trade agreements and \\"faithfully represented\\" West Virginia's pro-tariff glass industry. During the Winter War, despite being sympathetic to Finland, Holt voted against a loan to that country. Holt opposed the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 (also known as the Burke-Wadsworth Act), which instigated peace-time conscription, actively participating in the long (six weeks) and often vitriolic debate on the act; the act eventually passed, 58-31, Holt voting against. These activities did not make Holt popular with his constituents; in his 1940 bid for renomination, Holt came in third. After his Senate term expired, on January 3, 1941, Holt continued living in Washington, D.C., supporting himself as a lecturer and author. He was an active antiwar lecturer, most often supported by the sponsorship of the America First Committee. He attended dozens of antiwar rallies across the United States, usually as the featured speaker. This speaking tour ended after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the America First Committee was dissolved. Holt's foreign policy views remained the same, writing in 1942: \\"Our fight is not over. We must stand guard to see that the internationalists ... are not allowed to determine the future of our great country. They would commit us to everlasting wars everywhere.\\" Holt received a high level of media attention during his Senate years and was the subject of hundreds of political cartoons from across America.https://holt.lib.wvu.edu/ Holt unsuccessfully sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1944 and the Democratic nomination for United States Senator in 1948. He switched to the Republican Party in 1949, and was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for election to the Eighty-second Congress in 1950. In 1952, Holt again ran for governor, and earned 48% of the vote. In 1954, he was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates. Holt's political career ended where it started, and he died of cancer while in office on February 8, 1955 at age 49. He was interred in Macpelah Cemetery in Weston, West Virginia. Family Holt's widow, Helen F. Holt (1913‚Äì2015), filled Holt's unexpired term in the West Virginia House of Delegates (1955-1957). She was then appointed Secretary of State, serving from 1957 to 1959, becoming the first woman to hold high office in West Virginia.\\"Mrs. Holt Takes Secretary Post\\", Charleston Gazette, December 5, 1957.

In June, they reached an agreement with the Hunts Point Terminal Produce Cooperative to extend its lease for another three years, while the Cooperative and NYCEDC work together to develop a long-term plan for a larger, modernized facility in the Bronx. To this end, the City and State have each agreed to contribute capital resources and to work with the Cooperative to secure additional third-party sources of funding.http://www.nycedc.com/sites/default/files/filemanager/Resources/Brochures/NYCEDCAnnualReviewFY2011_Brochure.pdf Transportation The market can be accessed from other boroughs via the Bruckner Expressway (Interstate 278) and Sheridan Boulevard (New York State Route 895). It is serviced by rail via CSX Transportation's Oak Point Yard and gets around 2700 cars per year. In 2012 the market received a $10 million federal grant to improve rail operations. Currently, rail cars and trucks share unloading docks, causing conflicts. The rail improvements are part of a $332.5 million major renovation to the market that is under negotiation.Hunts Point Market to Use $10M Grant For Rail Improvements , June 25, 2012, Fred Dreier, DNAinfo.comFreight Rail Modernization: Improving The Freight Rail & Transfer Facility At The Hunts Point Terminal Produce Market In The South Bronx, NY, TIGER grant application, 2009 In 2015, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that New York would spend $150 million over 12 years to modernize the market.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/nyc-to- invest-150-million-to-revamp-hunts-point-market-in-bronx References External links *Hunts Point Produce Market * Hunts Point Cooperative Market Food markets in the United States Rail freight transportation in New York City Buildings and structures in the Bronx Commercial buildings completed in 1962 Hunts Point, Bronx 1962 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Hunts Point Cooperative Market"},{"id":"1370229","text":"Electrorheological (ER) fluids are suspensions of extremely fine non- conducting but electrically active particles (up to 50 micrometres diameter) in an electrically insulating fluid. The apparent viscosity of these fluids changes reversibly by an order of up to 100,000 in response to an electric field. For example, a typical ER fluid can go from the consistency of a liquid to that of a gel, and back, with response times on the order of milliseconds. The effect is sometimes called the Winslow effect after its discoverer, the American inventor Willis Winslow, who obtained a US patent on the effect in 1947: Winslow, W. M.: 'Method and means for translating electrical impulses into mechanical force', 25 March 1947 and wrote an article published in 1949.  The ER effect  The change in apparent viscosity is dependent on the applied electric field, i.e. the potential divided by the distance between the plates. The change is not a simple change in viscosity, hence these fluids are now known as ER fluids, rather than by the older term Electro Viscous fluids. The effect is better described as an electric field dependent shear yield stress. When activated an ER fluid behaves as a Bingham plastic (a type of viscoelastic material), with a yield point which is determined by the electric field strength. After the yield point is reached, the fluid shears as a fluid, i.e. the incremental shear stress is proportional to the rate of shear (in a Newtonian fluid there is no yield point and stress is directly proportional to shear). Hence the resistance to motion of the fluid can be controlled by adjusting the applied electric field.  Composition and theory  ER fluids are a type of smart fluid. A simple ER fluid can be made by mixing cornflour in a light vegetable oil or (better) silicone oil. There are two main theories to explain the effect: the interfacial tension or 'water bridge' theory, and the electrostatic theory. The water bridge theory assumes a three phase system, the particles contain the third phase which is another liquid (e.g. water) immiscible with the main phase liquid (e.g. oil). With no applied electric field the third phase is strongly attracted to and held within the particles. This means the ER fluid is a suspension of particles, which behaves as a liquid. When an electric field is applied the third phase is driven to one side of the particles by electro osmosis and binds adjacent particles together to form chains. This chain structure means the ER fluid has become a solid. The electrostatic theory assumes just a two phase system, with dielectric particles forming chains aligned with an electric field in an analogous way to how magnetorheological fluid (MR) fluids work. An ER fluid has been constructed with the solid phase made from a conductor coated in an insulator. This ER fluid clearly cannot work by the water bridge model. However, although demonstrating that some ER fluids work by the electrostatic effect, it does not prove that all ER fluids do so. The advantage of having an ER fluid which operates on the electrostatic effect is the elimination of leakage current, i.e. potentially there is no direct current. Of course, since ER devices behave electrically as capacitors, and the main advantage of the ER effect is the speed of response, an alternating current is to be expected. The particles are electrically active. They can be ferroelectric or, as mentioned above, made from a conducting material coated with an insulator, or electro- osmotically active particles. In the case of ferroelectric or conducting material, the particles would have a high dielectric constant. There may be some confusion here as to the dielectric constant of a conductor, but \\"if a material with a high dielectric constant is placed in an electric field, the magnitude of that field will be measurably reduced within the volume of the dielectric\\" (see main page: Dielectric constant), and since the electric field is zero in an ideal conductor, then in this context the dielectric constant of a conductor is infinite. Another factor that influences the ER effect is the geometry of the electrodes. The introduction of parallel grooved electrodes showed slight increase in the ER effect but perpendicular grooved electrodes doubled the ER effect. A much larger increase in ER effect can be obtained by coating the electrodes with electrically polarisable materials. This turns the usual disadvantage of dielectrophoresis into a useful effect. It also has the effect of reducing leakage currents in the ER fluid. The giant electrorheological (GER) fluid was discovered in 2003, and is able to sustain higher yield strengths than many other ER fluids. The GER fluid consists of Urea coated nanoparticles of Barium Titanium Oxalate suspended in silicone oil. The high yield strength is due to the high dielectric constant of the particles, the small size of the particles and the Urea coating. Another advantage of the GER is that the relationship between the electrical field strength and the yield strength is linear after the electric field reaches 1 kV/mm. The GER is a high yield strength, but low electrical field strength and low current density fluid compared to many other ER fluids. The procedure for preparation of the suspension is given in. The major concern is the use of oxalic acid for the preparation of the particles as it is a strong organic acid.  Applications  The normal application of ER fluids is in fast acting hydraulic valves and clutches, with the separation between plates being in the order of 1 mm and the applied potential being in the order of 1 kV. In simple terms, when the electric field is applied, an ER hydraulic valve is shut or the plates of an ER clutch are locked together, when the electric field is removed the ER hydraulic valve is open or the clutch plates are disengaged. Other common applications are in ER brakes (think of a brake as a clutch with one side fixed) and shock absorbers (which can be thought of as closed hydraulic systems where the shock is used to try to pump fluid through a valve). There are many novel uses for these fluids. Potential uses are in accurate abrasive polishing and as haptic controllers and tactile displays. ER fluid has also been proposed to have potential applications in flexible electronics, with the fluid incorporated in elements such as rollable screens and keypads, in which the viscosity-changing qualities of the fluid allowing the rollable elements to become rigid for use, and flexible to roll and retract for storing when not in use. Motorola filed a patent application for mobile device applications in 2006.  Problems and advantages  A major problem is that ER fluids are suspensions, hence in time they tend to settle out, so advanced ER fluids tackle this problem by means such as matching the densities of the solid and liquid components, or by using nanoparticles, which brings ER fluids into line with the development of magnetorheological fluids. Another problem is that the breakdown voltage of air is ~ 3 kV/mm, which is near the electric field needed for ER devices to operate. An advantage is that an ER device can control considerably more mechanical power than the electrical power used to control the effect, i.e. it can act as a power amplifier. But the main advantage is the speed of response, there are few other effects able to control such large amounts of mechanical or hydraulic power so rapidly. Unfortunately, the increase in apparent viscosity experienced by most Electrorheological fluids used in shear or flow modes is relatively limited. The ER fluid changes from a Newtonian liquid to a partially crystalline \\"semi-hard slush\\". However, an almost complete liquid to solid phase change can be obtained when the electrorheological fluid additionally experiences compressive stress. This effect has been used to provide electrorheological Braille displays and very effective clutches.

Jungle boots have vent holes in the instep and sometimes a canvas upper to aid in ventilation and drainage of moisture. Development and use The use of \\"jungle\\" or \\"hot weather\\" boots predates World War II, when small units of U.S. soldiers in Panama were issued rubber-soled, canvas-upper boots for testing.Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj.) Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, (1996), pp. 172‚Äì183 Developed in conjunction with the U.S. Rubber Company, a pair of jungle boots weighed approximately three pounds. Adopted in 1942, the design of the jungle boot was based on the idea that no boot could possibly keep out water and still provide sufficient ventilation to the feet in a jungle or swamp environment. Instead, the jungle boot was designed to permit water and perspiration to drain, drying the feet while preventing the entry of insects, mud, or sand. In 1942, fused layers of original-specification Saran or PVDC were used to make woven mesh ventilating insoles for newly developed jungle boots made of rubber and canvas.Risch, Erna, The Quartermaster Corps, Washington, DC: Office of the Chief of Military History, Dept. of the Army (1953), pp. 108‚Äì109Report on Orinoco-Casiquiare-Negro Waterway: Venezuela- Colombia-Brazil, Volume 4, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Office of Inter-American Affairs (July 1943) The Saran ventilating insoles trapped air which was circulated throughout the interior of the boot during the act of walking; moist interior air was exchanged for outside air via the boot's water drain eyelets. In cold weather, the trapped air in Saran insoles kept feet from freezing by insulating them from the frozen ground; when walking, the insoles circulated moist air that would otherwise condense and freeze, causing trench foot or frostbite. The new M-1942 canvas-and-rubber jungle boots with Saran mesh insoles were tested by experimental Army units in jungle exercises in Panama, Venezuela, and other countries, where they were found to increase the flow of dry outside air to the insole and base of the foot, reducing blisters and tropical ulcers. The Saran ventilating mesh insole was also used in the M-1945 tropical combat boot. =World War II= Field reports from the Panama Experimental Platoon on the new lightweight boots were positive, and M-1942 jungle boots were later issued to a number of U.S. Army and Marine forces for use in tropical or jungle environments, including U.S. Army forces in New Guinea and the Philippines, and in Burma with Merrill's Marauders,George, John B.

Col), Shots Fired In Anger, NRA Press, pp. 490‚Äì491 the 1st Air Commando Group and the Mars Task Force (5332nd Brigade, Provisional).Mars Task Force: A Short History http://www.cbi- theater.com/mars/marstaskforce.html As jungle boots wore out more quickly than the standard Army Type II field shoes, they were often carried by infantrymen attached to the field pack as a secondary pair of footwear, to be used when encountering heavy, soft mud. In 1944, the Panama sole was first developed by U.S. Army Sergeant Raymond Dobie, which used a series of angled rubber lugs in the soles to push soft mud from the soles, clearing them and providing much better grip in greasy clay or mud. However, the Panama sole was developed too late to see service in World War II, and both M-1942 (Jungle) and M-1945 (Combat Boot, Tropical) boots used Vibram soles.Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine (1996), pp. 178‚Äì179Rottman, Gordon L., Green Beret in Vietnam: 1957‚Äì73, Osprey Publishing, (2002), p. 58 With the end of the war, all official interest in jungle equipment came to a halt; an improved jungle boot with the new Panama sole was not produced until 1965. British Imperial forces designed their own jungle boot based on the American one, but much higher. Special Operations Executive Force 136 personnel were issued with these boots during operations in Burma 1944‚Äì45. Otherwise, they were not issued until after the war where they were used in the Malayan Emergency.p.47 Brayley, Martin & Chappell, Mike The British Army, 1939‚Äì45: The Far East Osprey Publishing =First Indochina War= The French issued rubber/canvas jungle boots manufactured by Palladium during the first indochina war. They came in different variants and were also worn during the Algerian war. =Vietnam War= In the early years of the Vietnam War, some U.S. Army units were equipped with the M-1945 Tropical Combat Boot. In 1965, a boot incorporating most of the improvements developed since the end of World War II for tropical climates was adopted by the U.S. military as the M-1966 jungle boot, developed by the Natick Laboratories and the shoe industry.Hearings on military posture and H.R. 13456, p. 8177. In the improved boot, the upper was made of cotton canvas duck, with leather for the toe and heel, and nylon reinforcements for the neck of the boot. The new jungle boot originally used a Vibram-type lugged composition rubber sole strongly vulcanized to the leather toe and heel.Wood, Clyde E., Mud: A Military History, Washington, D.C.: Potomac Books, Inc., (2006) p. 106 Water drains (screened eyelets) were added to the canvas top near the sole to quickly drain water from the inside of the boot. Removable ventilating insoles made of fused layers of Saran plastic screen, first invented in 1942, were issued with the jungle boot. In May 1966, after numerous widely reported incidents of foot injuries to U.S. forces caused by punji stake traps, issue jungle boots were fitted with a stainless steel plate inside the boot's sole to protect the wearer from punji stake traps.Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine (1996), p. 179Interview with General Colin L. Powell, : A young Colin Powell, later to become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces, was injured by one of these traps, but would not have been protected by the steel plate; his foot fell into the trap at an angle, and the punji stake missed his boot sole entirely, penetrating his instep. Later jungle boots were given nylon canvas tops in place of cotton duck. The boot was also fitted with other improvements, including the Panama mud-clearing outsole and nylon webbing reinforcement on the uppers. However, Vibram-soled jungle boots continued to be issued to troops into 1969. The US military jungle boot's popularity extended beyond the US Armed Forces with Australian Army and New Zealand Army soldiers going to great lengths to get a pair of jungle boots from American troops to use alongside their standard-issue black leather General Purpose Boots (GP Boots). When the 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) was deployed to South Vietnam and served alongside the US Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade in 1965, many Australian troops were willing to trade their Australian Army-issue \\"slouch hats\\" for a pair of jungle boots from the Americans since the boots Australian troops were issued were World War II vintage tropical studded ankle boots and the boots were not suited to the conditions of Vietnam. Australian and New Zealand Special Air Service troops also made extensive use of American jungle boots during the course of the Vietnam War and they were very popular with SAS troopers. Up until the replacement of the GP Boots for the Terra Boots in 2000, Australian military personnel were allowed to wear the US military jungle boots with their combat uniforms and the boots remained popular with Australian soldiers during the post-Vietnam period. =Post-Vietnam jungle boot designs= The Vietnam-era jungle boots were quite successful. They have gone through only minor design changes since they were introduced in the 1962 and used in large numbers by troops in Vietnam. Jungle boots were the standard combat footwear for mild weather for decades following Vietnam. The last nomenclature for jungle boots was boot, Hot Weather, Type I, Black, Hot-Wet and allowed for both OG107 green and black for the nylon sections of the upper. In addition, the Type II boot was defined, identical except with desert tan color for the leather and the nylon, eliminate the steel plate (conducted heat to the foot in hot sand) and vent eyelets (let sand into the boot). The US military jungle boot helped influence the design of the famed desert combat boot, which many American soldiers wore during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in 2001 and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. Despite the introduction of the desert boot at the time of Operation Desert Storm, many American military personnel were still issued jungle boots because there were not enough desert boots to issue to all personnel in the Middle East at the time, which led to many American soldiers and Marines to go into battle with jungle boots and black leather combat boots. During Operation Enduring Freedom, US Army and Marine personnel were seen wearing black jungle boots and black leather speedlace combat boots alongside the newer desert boots while on combat operations in Afghanistan during the early 2000s. During the 1980s, some of the improvements incorporated over the years in U.S. jungle boot design were modified or discarded, primarily for reasons of cost and convenience to the contractor.Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj.), pp. 183, 365‚Äì368 This included changes in rubber sole composition (to avoid marking linoleum floors at stateside army bases), and use of waterproof Poron linings instead of Saran ventilating insoles. Since the boot retained its water drain eyelets, water still entered the boot, where it soaked the open-cell Poron insoles which remained in constant contact with the bottom of the foot.Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj.), pp. 365‚Äì368 In contrast, the British Army continues to use Saran insoles in its combat boots, primarily because of its insulating properties.Westwood, E., Smith, N., and Dyson, R., Comparison of the Influence of Three Types of Military Boot Insoles Upon the Force and Loading Rates Experienced In Drop Jump Landings, Biomechanics Symposia 2001, University of San Francisco (2001), p. 30 Increasing use of the jungle boot as a general- purpose combat boot brought more changes; the issue boot's Panama sole reverted to a Vibram sole in the 1980s. However, the Vibram sole, while better suited to use on rocks, sand, or other hard terrain, lacked the mud-clearing qualities of the Panama sole, and was inferior to the latter for use in jungle or swampy environments.Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj.), pp. 366‚Äì368 Other changes were made to lower acquisition costs. By the late 1980s, incidents of heel blowouts and loss of water drains (screened eyelets) from poor materials and lack of quality control were being reported.Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), pp. 366‚Äì368 Today, Altama Footwear and Wellco Footwear are two American combat boot companies who still manufacture the US military jungle boot. Altama began manufacturing boots for the military towards the end of the Vietnam War, in 1969, and is still supplying the military with footwear to date. Wellco gained the first government contract for boots in 1965. These companies manufacture jungle boots with waterproof insoles and Vibram or Panama outsoles with green cotton/nylon uppers and conventional eyelets. Both companies also make an updated version with a black Cordura upper and a Speedlace-and-eyelet lacing system. The company Atalaia manufactures jungle boots for the Brazilian Army.http://www.coturnoatalaia.com.br/exercito.html McRae boots of North Carolina produces the original green cotton boot and the black nylon boot in the US. As of 2005, the United States Marine Corps has retired the black jungle boots from front-line military service and replaced them with two versions of a new tan rough-out leather combat boot. One version, called the Temperate or Infantry Combat Boot, has a waterproof Gore-Tex lining inside. The Temperate boot is an effort to keep moisture out of the boot; once the interior is soaked with water, it tends to remain there. The lining also tends to limit air exchange, limiting its use to environments with temperatures of 98 ¬∞F or less. Another, called the Jungle or Hot Weather Boot, has no lining but retains the vent holes on the instep of the boot. The US Army and US Air Force have also removed the black jungle boot from frontline service for suede leather desert-style boots when the US Army adopted the Army Combat Uniform and the US Air Force adopted the Airman Battle Uniform. A number of nations outside the United States are still using and issuing the American-made jungle boot to their soldiers. One example can be seen in Afghanistan with soldiers of the Afghan National Army being seen wearing black jungle boots with American-made combat uniforms.

Color code: dark blue = Hg, yellow = S. Methylmercury is formed from inorganic mercury by the action of microbes that live in aquatic systems including lakes, rivers, wetlands, sediments, soils and the open ocean. This methylmercury production has been primarily attributed to anaerobic bacteria in the sediment. Significant concentrations of methylmercury in ocean water columns are strongly associated with nutrients and organic matter remineralization, which indicate that remineralization may contribute to methylmercury production. Direct measurements of methylmercury production using stable mercury isotopes have also been observed in toxic waters, but the microbes involved are still unknown. Flooding of soils associated with reservoir creation (e.g. for hydroelectric power generation) has been linked to increased methylmercury concentrations in reservoir water and fish. There are various sources of inorganic mercury that may indirectly contribute to the production of methylmercury from microbes in the environment. Natural sources of mercury released to the atmosphere include volcanoes, forest fires, volatilization from the ocean and weathering of mercury-bearing rocks.Tewalt, S. J.; Bragg, L. J.; Finkelman, R. B., 2005, Mercury in U.S. coal -- Abundance, distribution, and modes of occurrence, U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet 095-01. Access-date=January 12, 2006. Anthropogenic sources of mercury include the burning of wastes containing inorganic mercury and from the burning of fossil fuels, particularly coal. Although inorganic mercury is only a trace constituent of such fuels, their large scale combustion in utility and commercial/industrial boilers in the United States alone results in release of some 80.2 tons (73 tonnes) of elemental mercury to the atmosphere each year, out of total anthropogenic mercury emissions in the United States of 158 tons (144 tonnes)/year.U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1997, \\"Mercury study report to congress, Volume II: An inventory of anthropogenic mercury emissions in the United States\\" , table ES-3, sum of Utility boilers and Commercial/industrial boilers. Report: EPA-452/R-97-004. In the past, methylmercury was produced directly and indirectly as part of several industrial processes such as the manufacture of acetaldehyde. However, currently there are few direct anthropogenic sources of methylmercury pollution in the United States. Whole-lake ecosystem experiments at IISD-ELA in Ontario, Canada showed that mercury falling directly on a lake had the fastest impacts on aquatic ecosystems as opposed to mercury falling on the surrounding land. This inorganic mercury is converted to methylmercury by bacteria. Different stable isotopes of mercury were added to lakes, wetlands, and uplands, simulating rain, and then mercury concentrations in fish were analyzed to find their source. The mercury applied to lakes was found in young-of-the-year yellow perch within two months, whereas the mercury applied to wetlands and uplands had a slower but longer influx. Acute methylmercury poisoning can occur either directly from the release of methylmercury into the environment or indirectly from the release of inorganic mercury that is subsequently methylated in the environment. For example, methylmercury poisoning occurred at Grassy Narrows in Ontario, Canada (see Ontario Minamata disease) as a result of mercury released from the mercury-cell Chloralkali process, which uses liquid mercury as an electrode in a process that entails electrolytic decomposition of brine, followed by mercury methylation in the aquatic environment. An acute methylmercury poisoning tragedy occurred also in Minamata, Japan following release of methylmercury into Minamata Bay and its tributaries (see Minamata disease). In the Ontario case, inorganic mercury discharged into the environment was methylated in the environment; whereas in Minamata, Japan, there was direct industrial discharge of methylmercury. =Dietary sources= Because methylmercury is formed in aquatic systems and because it is not readily eliminated from organisms it is biomagnified in aquatic food chains from bacteria, to plankton, through macroinvertebrates, to herbivorous fish and to piscivorous (fish-eating) fish.reviewed in Wiener, J.G., Krabbenhoft, D.P., Heinz, G.H., and Scheuhammer, A.M., 2003, \\"Ecotoxicology of mercury,\\" Chapter 16 in Hoffman, D.J., B.A. Rattner, G.A. Burton, Jr., and J. Cairns, Jr., eds., Handbook of Ecotoxicology, 2nd edition.: Boca Raton, Florida, CRC Press, p. 409-463. At each step in the food chain, the concentration of methylmercury in the organism increases. The concentration of methylmercury in the top level aquatic predators can reach a level a million times higher than the level in the water. This is because methylmercury has a half-life of about 72 days in aquatic organisms resulting in its bioaccumulation within these food chains. Organisms, including humans, fish-eating birds, and fish-eating mammals such as otters and cetaceans (i.e. whales and dolphins) that consume fish from the top of the aquatic food chain receive the methylmercury that has accumulated through this process, plus the toxins in their habitat. Fish and other aquatic species are the main source of human methylmercury exposure. The concentration of mercury in any given fish depends on the species of fish, the age and size of the fish and the type of water body in which it is found. In general, fish-eating fish such as shark, swordfish, marlin, larger species of tuna, walleye, largemouth bass, and northern pike, have higher levels of methylmercury than herbivorous fish or smaller fish such as tilapia and herring.Mercury Levels in Commercial Fish and Shellfish Accessed March 25, 2009.What You Need to Know about Mercury in Fish and Shellfish Accessed March 25, 2009. Within a given species of fish, older and larger fish have higher levels of methylmercury than smaller fish. Fish that develop in water bodies that are more acidic also tend to have higher levels of methylmercury. Biological impact =Human health effects= Ingested methylmercury is readily and completely absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. It is mostly found complexed with free cysteine and with proteins and peptides containing that amino acid. The methylmercuric- cysteinyl complex is recognized as and/or by amino acids transporting proteins in the body as methionine, another essential amino acid. Because of this mimicry, it is transported freely throughout the body including across the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and across the placenta, where it is absorbed by the developing fetus. Also for this reason as well as its strong binding to proteins, methylmercury is not readily eliminated. Methylmercury has a half- life in human blood of about 50 days. Several studies indicate that methylmercury is linked to subtle developmental deficits in children exposed in utero such as loss of IQ points, and decreased performance in tests of language skills, memory function and attention deficits. Methylmercury exposure in adults has also been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease including heart attack.Guallar E, Sanz-Gallardo I, van't Veer P, et al., 2002, Mercury, Fish Oils, and the Risk of Myocardial Infarction , New England Journal of Medicine, vol. 347, p. 1747-1754.Choi, A.L., Weihe, P., Budtz-J√∏rgensen, E., J√∏rgensen, P.J., Salonen, J.T., Tuomainen, T.-P., Murata, K., Nielsen, H.P., Petersen, M.S., Askham, J., and Grandjean, P., 2009, Methylmercury Exposure and Adverse Cardiovascular Effects in Faroese Whaling Men: Environmental Health Perspectives, v. 117, no. 3, p. 367-372. Some evidence also suggests that methylmercury can cause autoimmune effects in sensitive individuals. Despite some concerns about the relationship between methylmercury exposure and autism, there are few data that support such a link.https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient- table-2.pdf Although there is no doubt that methylmercury is toxic in several respects, including through exposure of the developing fetus, there is still some controversy as to the levels of methylmercury in the diet that can result in adverse effects. Recent evidence suggests that the developmental and cardiovascular toxicity of methylmercury may be mitigated by co-exposures to omega-3 fatty acids and perhaps selenium, both found in fish and elsewhere. Review. Erratum in: Review. There have been several episodes in which large numbers of people were severely poisoned by food contaminated with high levels of methylmercury, notably the dumping of industrial waste that resulted in the pollution and subsequent mass poisoning in Minamata and Niigata, Japan and the situation in Iraq in the 1960s and 1970s in which wheat treated with methylmercury as a preservative and intended as seed grain was fed to animals and directly consumed by people (see Basra poison grain disaster). These episodes resulted in neurological symptoms including paresthesias, loss of physical coordination, difficulty in speech, narrowing of the visual field, hearing impairment, blindness, and death. Children who had been exposed in- utero through their mothers' ingestion were also affected with a range of symptoms including motor difficulties, sensory problems and intellectual disability. At present, exposures of this magnitude are rarely seen and are confined to isolated incidents. Accordingly, concern over methylmercury pollution is currently focused on more subtle effects that may be linked to levels of exposure presently seen in populations with high to moderate levels of dietary fish consumption. These effects are not necessarily identifiable on an individual level or may not be uniquely recognizable as due to methylmercury. However, such effects may be detected by comparing populations with different levels of exposure. There are isolated reports of various clinical health effects in individuals who consume large amounts of fish;For example: however, the specific health effects and exposure patterns have not been verified with larger, controlled studies. Many governmental agencies, the most notable ones being the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada, and the European Union Health and Consumer Protection Directorate-General, as well as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), have issued guidance for fish consumers that is designed to limit methylmercury exposure from fish consumption. At present, most of this guidance is based on protection of the developing fetus; future guidance, however, may also address cardiovascular risk. In general, fish consumption advice attempts to convey the message that fish is a good source of nutrition and has significant health benefits, but that consumers, in particular pregnant women, women of child-bearing age, nursing mothers, and young children, should avoid fish with high levels of methylmercury, limit their intake of fish with moderate levels of methylmercury, and consume fish with low levels of methylmercury no more than twice a week.Information on characteristic levels of methylmercury by species can be found at A wallet- card guide for consumers can be found at http://www.nrdc.org/health/effects/mercury/protect.asp =Effects on fish and wildlife= Jordanella after one month in normal water for the first batch, and in water containing 0.6PPB and 1.26PPB and 2.5PPB (parts per billion) of methylmercury for the three bottles at right. In recent years, there has been increasing recognition that methylmercury affects fish and wildlife health, both in acutely polluted ecosystems and ecosystems with modest methylmercury levels. Two reviews document numerous studies of diminished reproductive success of fish, fish-eating birds, and mammals due to methylmercury contamination in aquatic ecosystems. =In public policy= Reported methylmercury levels in fish, along with fish consumption advisories, have the potential to disrupt people's eating habits, fishing traditions, and the livelihoods of the people involved in the capture, distribution, and preparation of fish as a foodstuff for humans. Furthermore, proposed limits on mercury emissions have the potential to add costly pollution controls on coal- fired utility boilers. Nevertheless, substantial benefits can be achieved globally by introducing mercury emission reduction measures because they reduce human and wildlife exposure to methyl mercury.Jozef M.

The natural sources category includes re-emission of mercury previously deposited from anthropogenic sources. According to one study, based on modeled concentrations, pre-Anthropocene tissue-bound levels in fish may not have differed markedly from current levels. However, based on a comprehensive set of global measurements, the ocean contains about 60,000 to 80,000 tons of mercury from pollution, and mercury levels in the upper ocean have tripled since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Higher mercury levels in shallower ocean waters could increase the amount of the toxicant accumulating in food fish, exposing people to a greater risk of mercury poisoning.Carl H. Lamborg, Chad R.

Released on March 2, 1935, the short is notable for featuring the first appearance of several Warner Bros. cartoon characters, most notably future cartoon star Porky Pig. Beans the Cat, a minor Looney Tunes star in 1935-1936, also made his first appearance in this cartoon. I Haven't Got a Hat was one of the earliest Technicolor Merrie Melodies, and (because of Walt Disney's exclusive deal with Technicolor at the time) was produced using Technicolor's two-strip process (red and green) instead of its more expensive three-strip process. Plot  The short opens with introductions of Miss Cud (a cow who is the school teacher), Beans (who is caught defiantly eating from a jar of jam), Porky, Oliver Owl (who are both shown at once), and Ham and Ex (twin puppies). Little Kitty is absent from this sequence. A poster is shown explaining that the school children are sponsoring a musical and recital for the benefit of teachers and parents. The school talent show first features Porky Pig reciting the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem Paul Revere's Ride, but with his excessive stutter (causing him to recite his part with incredible strain and sweat on some moments). A small gag involves Porky pointing to offstage students to provide sound effects for his next poem The Charge of the Light Brigade (the underside of a turtle's shell for a drum, and falling light bulbs for gunfire). However, he points to the wrong student, but the intended student takes his cue, and Porky points to the correct one. The class children whistle and cat-call which makes several stray dogs burst into the schoolhouse and chase poor Porky out. Little Kitty attempts to recite \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\". She is so nervous that she forgets a couple of lines (even confusing snow for corn flakes) and then proceeds with the rhyme but gradually speeds up her voice to a high pitch. Throughout her performance she is fidgeting and crossing her legs in a way to suggest she urgently needs the toilet. She reaches the end of the rhyme as she makes a hasty exit, to a building that may be the school outhouse. Ham and Ex sing the song \\"I Haven't Got a Hat\\", written by Buddy Bernier and Bob Emmerich. During this performance, Oliver Owl haughtily refuses to share a bag of candy with Beans, who is angered by Oliver's snobbery. When Oliver goes up for his piano recital, Beans decides it is time for payback and sneaks a stray cat and dog into the piano. Their commotion creates a virtuoso performance of Franz von Supp√©'s Poet and Peasant overture to riotous applause. When the animals jump out of the piano (with the cat chasing the dog rather than vice versa) the ruse is revealed to the audience's disapproval and Oliver, humbled and vengeful, covers Beans in green ink from his pen, causing Beans to fall off his ladder and launch a pail of red paint onto Oliver. Caught in the same predicament, they shake hands as the cartoon ends. This end scene emphasizes the fact that this was a two-strip Technicolor cartoon, with only red and green hues. At the time (as stated before), the three-strip process (with blue hues added) was exclusive to Disney for use in cartoons. This contract ran out in the fall of 1935, and WB released their first three-strip Technicolor cartoon, Flowers for Madame, in November of that year. Production notes Inspired by the Hal Roach Our Gang live-action shorts, the short introduces several new characters as grade school students in the hope that some would catch on. At the time, the only star for the more character-driven Looney Tunes series was Buddy, a meager replacement for the feistier Bosko, who left Schlesinger's studio with his creators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising. The entry introduces the following characters: *Beans the Cat, a mischievous young cat voiced by Billy Bletcher *Little Kitty, a nervous girl cat, voiced by Bernice Hansen in falsetto. *Porky Pig, a stuttering pig voiced by Joe Dougherty *Oliver Owl, a haughty owl who taunts Beans. *Ham and Ex, (Hansen and Bletcher) twin singing puppies Though the gags are fairly indicative of early 1930s cartoons, I Haven't Got a Hat is significant for launching the career of Porky Pig, who went on to become a Warner Bros. regular for the next 30 years. Oliver Owl effectively disappeared after this short; Beans and Kitty (now a couple) and Ham and Ex would continue to make occasional appearances through 1936.

It is the second title in The Sims console series and the first The Sims title not released on Windows PC. It featured the same 3D environment and engine the past game did, however adds several features from The Sims expansion packs: The Sims: Hot Date, The Sims: Superstar, and The Sims: Livin' Large. As the title suggests, the sims can get out of the house to visit other locations such as Shiny Things Lab or Casa Caliente. There are two modes. Bust Out Mode, which has mission-based gameplay and Freeplay Mode, which is open-ended gameplay very much like the original The Sims PC game. The PlayStation 2 version once featured the option to play online. However, it was shut down on August 1, 2008 (the same day The Sims Online shut down). Gameplay In the console version, Malcolm Landgraab is going around his neighborhood, stealing items in return for unpaid rent. The player's objective is to complete each career track, unlock and buy back everyone's many possessions, and become rich enough to evict Malcolm from his mansion and move their own Sim in. The Game Boy Advance and N-Gage version puts the player's Sim in a place called \\"SimValley\\" for summer holiday. Like the console version, GBA/N-Gage version gameplay is objective-based ‚Äì every time the player completes a series of tasks, the game is allowed to progress. In this game, there are no furnishing objects to unlock. Instead, the player must complete all tasks to unlock new houses. Deviating from the \\"point-and-click\\" selection process heretofore used in every Sims title, this version allows the user to control their Sim directly, using the GBA's directional pad. In both versions, there are various locations that Sims may visit throughout the course of the game. As Sims advance through the game, new areas become accessible. In the GBA version, new mini-games may be unlocked in certain areas. In the N-Gage version, new mini- games (jobs for the Sims) are unlocked progressively when certain tasks are done. Also, Sims can collect three cartridges from various locations and play classic games such as Snakes on the Sims' mobile phones that would not be available again until The Sims 3. Release The Japanese version of the game was shortened to simply The Sims („Ç∂„Éª„Ç∑„É†„Ç∫) as the PC and Console versions of The Sims was called SimPeople. Online play Exclusive to the PlayStation 2 version was a free online play called \\"Online Weekend\\" which was very similar to The Sims Online. This mode allowed players to participate in both freeplay and storymode with each other and chat using the USB keyboard on the PlayStation 2. The server for the game shut down on August 1, 2008, the same day The Sims Online was shut down, rendering the game impossible to play online. Reception The Sims Bustin' Out received positive reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation 2 version 83.44% and 81/100, the GameCube version 80.76% and 81/100, the Xbox version 79.42% and 81/100, the N-Gage version 78.59% and the Game Boy Advance version 77.87%. The PlayStation 2 version of Bustin' Out received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

This practice may occur either when the Eucharist is exposed, or when it is not publicly viewable because it is reserved in a place such as a church tabernacle. Adoration is a sign of devotion to and worship of Jesus Christ, who is believed by Catholics to be present Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity, under the appearance of the consecrated host, that is, sacramental bread. From a theological perspective, the adoration is a form of latria, based on the tenet of the real presence of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament.Schad√©, Johannes P., \\"Eucharistic adoration\\", Encyclopedia of World Religions, 2006, Christian meditation performed in the presence of the Eucharist outside Mass is called Eucharistic meditation. It has been practiced by such as Peter Julian Eymard, Jean Vianney and Th√©r√®se of Lisieux. Authors such as the Blessed Concepcion Cabrera de Armida and Blessed Maria Candida of the Eucharist have produced large volumes of text based on their Eucharistic meditations. When the exposure and adoration of the Eucharist is constant (twenty-four hours a day), it is called perpetual adoration. In a monastery or convent, it is done by the resident monks or nuns and, in a parish, by volunteer parishioners since the 20th century. In a prayer opening the Perpetual chapel in St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica, Pope John Paul II prayed for a perpetual adoration chapel in every parish in the world. Pope Benedict XVI instituted perpetual adoration for the laity in each of the five sectors of the diocese of Rome. Practice and context Ciborium St.Franziskus Kirche Eucharistic adoration may be done both when the Eucharist is exposed for viewing and when it is not. It may take place in the context of the liturgical rite of Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament or an informal \\"visit\\" to pray before the tabernacle. Writer Valerie Schmalz notes that \\"During the first part of the twentieth century, it was common for Catholics, young and old, on their way home from work or school, en route to the grocery store or a sports practice, to \\"stop in for a visit\\" to the Blessed Sacrament in their local church. Most times the Eucharist was not exposed, but a red candle ‚Äì then, as now ‚Äì showed the Presence in the tabernacle.\\"Schmalz, Valerie. \\"Eucharistic Adoration: Reviving An Ancient Tradition\\", Ignatius Insight, 3 October 2005 Since the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic church has made Eucharistic exposition and benediction a liturgical service in its own right and exercised more direction over its practice; it draws its primary meaning from the Eucharistic celebration itself.Gr√ºn, Anselm and Cumming, John. The seven sacraments, 2003, pp. 82‚Äì83 \\"By worshiping the Eucharistic Jesus, we become what God wants us to be! Like a magnet, The Lord draws us to Himself and gently transforms us.\\" At the beginning of the exposition of the Blessed Sacrament, a priest or deacon removes the sacred host from the tabernacle and places it in the monstrance on the altar for adoration by the faithful. A monstrance is the vessel used to display the consecrated Eucharistic Host, during Eucharistic adoration or benediction. The adoration may also take place when the Eucharist is not exposed but left in a ciborium, which is likewise placed on an altar or in an enclosed tabernacle so that the faithful may pray in its presence without the need for volunteers to be in constant attendance (as is required when the Blessed Sacrament is exposed).Arinze, Francis. The Holy Eucharist, 2001, p. 110 The \\"Instruction on Eucharistic Worship\\", issued by the Sacred Congregation of Rites on the Feast of Corpus Christi, 25 May 1967, reads in pertinent part, \\"The exposition of the Blessed Sacrament, for which either a monstrance or a ciborium may be used, stimulates the faithful to an awareness of the marvelous presence of Christ and is an invitation to spiritual communion with Him. It is therefore an excellent encouragement to offer Him that worship in spirit and truth which is His due.\\" Speaking to a gathering in Phoenix Park, during a three-day visit to Ireland, from 29 September ‚Äì 1 October 1979, Pope John Paul II said, > The visit to the Blessed Sacrament is a great treasure of the Catholic > faith. It nourishes social love and gives us opportunities for adoration and > thanksgiving, for reparation and supplication. Benediction of the Blessed > Sacrament, Exposition and Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, Holy Hours, > and Eucharistic processions are likewise precious element of your heritage-- > in full accord with the teaching of the Second Vatican Council.\\"\\"Pope John > Paul II Recalls and Encourages National Eucharistic Devotion\\" As to the manner in which Eucharistic adoration is conducted, the \\"Instructions\\" state: \\"Even brief exposition of the Blessed Sacrament, ...should be so arranged that before the blessing with the Blessed Sacrament reasonable time is provided for readings of the Word of God, hymns, prayers, and silent prayer, as circumstances permit.\\" While psalms, readings and music are part of the liturgical service, in common practice silent contemplation and reflection tend to predominate. Eucharistic adoration in Saint Therese Little Flower Catholic Church in Reno, Nevada, USA Where Eucharistic adoration is done by an individual for an uninterrupted hour, this is known as a Holy Hour. The inspiration for the Holy Hour is when in the Garden of Gethsemane the night before his crucifixion, Jesus asks Peter: \\"So, could you not keep watch with me for one hour?\\". Some Christian denominations that do not subscribe to transubstantiation consider Eucharistic adoration unfounded and even bordering on idolatry.'Eucharistic Adoration';Heads of Agreement on the Lord's Supper by John Calvin' ; But according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, exposition \\"serves to deepen our hunger for Communion with Christ and the rest of the Church.\\" History =Early history= While the keeping of the Blessed Sacrament outside Mass seems to have been part of the Christian practice from the beginning to administer to the sick and dying (both Justin Martyr and Tertullian refer to it), the practice of adoration began somewhat later.Driscoll, Jeremy. Theology at the eucharistic table, 2003, pp. 237‚Äì244 One of the first possible references to reserving the Blessed Sacrament for adoration is found in a life of St. Basil (died AD 379). Basil is said to have divided the Eucharistic bread into three parts when he celebrated the Divine Liturgy in the monastery. One part he consumed, the second part he gave to the monks, and the third he placed in a golden dove- shaped container suspended over the altar. This separate portion was probably to reserve the sacrament for distribution to the sick who were unable to attend the liturgy. In Eastern Christianity, the adoration which developed in the West has never been part of the Eastern liturgy which St. Basil celebrated, but a liturgy for adoration does exist among the Eastern Catholic Churches involving psalms and placing a covered diskos with the sacred species on the altar. This is befitting the Eastern custom of veiling from human eyes those things deemed sacred.'Byzantine Daily Worship'; Archbishop Joseph Raya, Baron Jose de Vinck =Middle Ages= The theological basis for the adoration was prepared in the 11th century by Pope Gregory VII, who was instrumental in affirming the tenet that Christ is present in the Blessed Host. In 1079, Gregory required of Berengar of Tours a confession of belief: > I believe in my heart and openly profess that the bread and wine that are > placed on the altar are, through the mystery of the sacred prayer and the > words of the Redeemer, substantially changed into the true and proper and > lifegiving flesh and blood of Jesus Christ our Lord, and that after the > consecration they are the true body of Christ This profession of faith began a \\"Eucharistic Renaissance\\" in the churches of Europe. The Franciscan archives credit Saint Francis of Assisi (who died in 1226) for starting Eucharistic Adoration in Italy. It then spread from Umbria to other parts of Italy.Robson, Michael. St Francis of Assisi: The Legend and the Life, 2002, pp. 83‚Äì84 In 1264 Pope Urban IV instituted the feast of Corpus Christi (\\"the Body of Christ\\") with the publication of the papal bull Transiturus. He asked the Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas to write the texts for the Mass and Office of the feast.Torrell, Jean-Pierre. Saint Thomas, Catholic University of America Press, 1996, pp. 129-136 This included such famous hymn as Panis angelicus, and Verbum Supernum Prodiens the last two strophes of which form the Benediction hymn O Salutaris Hostia. The last two verses of Pange Lingua are sung as the hymn Tantum Ergo, also used at Benediction. As of the fourteenth century in the Western Church, devotions began to focus on the Eucharistic gifts as the objective presence of the risen Christ and the Host began to be elevated during the liturgy for the purpose of adoration, as well as to be seen by the congregation since the priest stood facing the same direction in front of the altar. =16th‚Äì18th centuries= In the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation was challenging various issues with respect to the Eucharist and in response the Council of Trent greatly emphasized the presence of Christ in the Eucharist, the theological basis for Eucharistic adoration. The Trent declaration was the most significant theological component of Eucharistic doctrine since the apostolic age. The statement included the following: The other sacraments do not have the power of sanctifying until someone makes use of them, but in the Eucharist the very Author of sanctity is present before the Sacrament is used. For before the apostles received the Eucharist from the hands of our Lord, He told them that it was His Body that He was giving them. The Council then declared Eucharistic adoration as a form of latria: Following the Council of Trent, figures such as Saints Charles Borromeo and Alain de Solminihac promoted Eucharistic devotion and adoration.Bunson, Matthew. John Paul II's book of saints, 1999, p. 88 As part of the simplification of Church interiors, and to emphasize the importance of the Blessed Sacrament, Charles Borromeo initiated the practice of placing the tabernacle at a higher, central location behind the main altar. As Eucharistic adoration and Benediction became more widespread during the 17th century, the altar came to be seen as the \\"home of the Blessed Sacrament\\" where it would be adored.Schloeder, Steven J., Architecture in communion, 1998, p. 98 A common early practice of adoration known as Quarantore (literary forty hours) started in the 16th century. It is an exercise of devotion in which continuous prayer is made for forty hours before the exposed Blessed Sacrament. This practice started in Milan in the 1530s and 1540s by Capuchins such as Giuseppe da Fermo who promoted long periods of adoration. From Northern Italy it was carried to elsewhere in Europe by the Capuchins and Jesuits.Johnson, Timothy J., Franciscans at prayer, 2007, pp. 444‚Äì445Black, Christopher F., Italian Confraternities in the Sixteenth Century, 2003, p. 99 The practice of the perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament started in Naples in 1590 within the Order of the Clerics Regular Minor, founded by St. Francis Caracciolo, Fr. Augustine Adorno and Fr. Fabrizio Caracciolo. This practice was modified to continuous adoration during the day due to the few number of religious in the Order's Constitutions of 1597 with approval by Pope Clement VIII Capetola, C.R.M., Nicholas. \\"St. Francis Caracciolo: Founder of the Clerics Regular Minor (Adorno Fathers)\\" pp. 68-69 At a later date, the Order would revert to its earlier rule of perpetual adoration, but only within houses of no less than twenty religious. The houses with less religious were offered perpetual adoration as an option if it would not interfere with the execution of the house's ministries. In the 18th century, large numbers of people were drawn to quiet adoration of the Eucharist and priests such as Alphonsus Liguori encouraged the practice. He wrote a book on Visits to the Blessed Sacrament and he explained that a visit to the Blessed Sacrament is the \\"practice of loving Jesus Christ\\", since friends who love each other visit regularly. Benedict Joseph Labre, a homeless beggar and Franciscan tertiary, was a familiar figure in the city of Rome and known as the \\"saint of the Forty Hours\\" (or Quarant' Ore) for his dedication to Eucharistic adoration. =19th and 20th centuries= The Venerable Leo Dupont St. Peter Julian Eymard The French Revolution hindered the practice of Eucharistic adoration, however, the beginning of the 19th century witnessed a strong emphasis on Eucharistic piety, devotions and adorations. By 1829, the efforts of the Confraternity of Penitents-Gris brought Eucharistic adoration back in France. Twenty years later, the Venerable Leo Dupont initiated the nightly adoration of the Blessed Sacrament in Tours in 1849, from where it spread within France.Scalan, Dorothy. The Holy Man of Tours. (1990) Saint Anthony Mary Claret, the confessor to Isabella II of Spain and the founder of the Claretians, was also a fervent promoter of Eucharistic devotion and adoration and introduced the practice to Cuba, where he was sent as Archbishop. The adoration of the Eucharist within France grew in this period, and there were interactions between Catholic figures who were enthusiastic about spreading the practice, e.g., Leo Dupont, Saint Jean Vianney and Saint Peter Julian Eymard who in 1858 formed the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament.Cruz, Joan Carroll, Saintly Men of Modern Times. (2003) Also in 1858, Eymard, known as the Apostle of the Eucharist, and sister Marguerite Guillot formed the Servants of the Blessed Sacrament which now maintains houses on several continents where continuous Eucharistic adoration takes place. Letellier, Arthur. \\"Congregation of the Servants of the Most Blessed Sacrament.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 24 November 2017 Saint Peter Julian Eymard By Decree of the Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Worship, dated 9 December 1995, Saint Peter Julian Eymard, Priest, was added to the General Roman Calendar with the rank of optional memoria: Font and fullness of all evangelization and striking expression of the infinite love of our divine Redeemer for mankind, the Holy Eucharist clearly marked the life and pastoral activity of Peter Julian Eymard. He truly deserves to be called an outstanding apostle of the Eucharist. In fact, his mission in the Church consisted in promoting the centrality of the Eucharistic Mystery in the whole life of the Christian community. The first informally organized Eucharistic Congress took place in 1874, through the efforts of Marie-Marthe Tamisier of Tours, France. In 1881, Pope Leo XIII approved the first formal Eucharistic Congress, which was organized by Louis-Gaston de S√©gur in Lille, France, and was attended by few adherents.Meehan, Thomas. \\"Eucharistic Congresses.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 24 November 2017 The 1905 congress took place in Rome, and Pope Pius X presided over it.Bunson, Matthew. OSV's encyclopedia of Catholic history, 2004, p. 334 The practice of prolonged Eucharistic adoration also spread to the United States in the 19th century and Saint John Neumann the Archbishop of Philadelphia started Forty Hours adoration there, where it continues to date.Trigilio, John and Brighenti, Kenneth. The Catholicism Answer Book: The 300 Most Frequently Asked Questions, 2007, p. 153 Christian traditions =Anglicans= Early Anglicanism officially rejected Eucharistic adoration. Article XXVIII ‚Äì Of the Lord's Supper in Anglicanism's 39 Articles rejects transubstantiation, declaring that \\"Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions.\\"The Thirty-Nine Articles The Article also states that \\"The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by Christ's ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshiped.\\" Furthermore, the Black Rubric (in both its 1552 and 1662 versions) explains that \\"the Sacramental Bread and Wine remain still in their very natural substances, and therefore may not be adored; for that were Idolatry, to be abhorred of all faithful Christians\\". However, since the mid-19th century, the Oxford Movement has broadened Anglican opinions on the matter. An early 20th century bishop, the Right Reverend Edgar Gibson, Bishop of Gloucester, wrote of Article 28 that \\"The statement in the Article is worded with the utmost care, and with studied moderation. It cannot be said that any one of the practices is condemned or prohibited by it. It only amounts to this: that none of them can claim to be part of the original Divine institution.\\" Today, opinions on the nature of the Eucharist and thus on the propriety of adoration and exposition of the Blessed Sacrament vary in the Anglican tradition (see Anglican Eucharistic theology), but many Anglo-Catholics practice Eucharistic adoration. Others celebrate Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, which is not unlike Eucharistic adoration. =Lutherans= High Lutheran church in Kansas City, Missouri Lutheran Eucharistic adoration is most commonly limited in duration to the Eucharistic service because Lutheran tradition typically does not include public reservation of the Sacrament. If the holy elements are not consumed at the altar or after the service, then they can be set aside and placed in an aumbry, which is normally located in the sacristy. Primarily, the extra hosts are reserved for another Eucharist or for taking to the sick and those too feeble to attend a church service. However, in North America and Europe, some Lutherans may choose to reserve the Eucharist in a tabernacle near the altar. The Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church and some parishes in the Lutheran Evangelical Catholic tradition strongly encourage Eucharistic adoration. Historically in Lutheranism there have been two parties regarding Eucharistic adoration: Gnesio-Lutherans, who followed Martin Luther's view in favor of adoration, and Philippists who followed Philipp Melanchthon's view against it. Although Luther did not entirely approve of the Feast of Corpus Christi,Corpus Christi article in Christian Cyclopedia he wrote a treatise The Adoration of the Sacrament (1523) where he defended adoration but desired that the issue not be forced. In his reform of the Roman Mass Luther placed the Sanctus after the Institution Narrative to serve as a solemn act of worship of the Real Presence just brought about by the latter. This order is still maintained in some lutheran liturgies, such as that of the noticeably high church Church of SwedenKyrkohandbok f√∂r Svenska kyrkan, 2017, pp:132. After the death of Martin Luther, further controversies developed including Crypto- Calvinism and the second Sacramentarian controversy, started by Gnesio- Lutheran Joachim Westphal. The Philippist understanding of the Real Presence without overt adoration through time became dominant in Lutheranism, although it is not in accordance with Luther's teaching. The German theologian Andreas Musculus can be regarded as one of the warmest defenders of Eucharistic adoration in early Lutheranism. =Roman Catholics= Eucharistic adoration in the Chapel of the Apparitions of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of F√°tima in Portugal. Royal Basilica of Mafra, Portugal, on Maundy Thursday ‚Äì Royal and Venerable Confraternity of the Most Blessed Sacrament of Mafra. Catholic doctrine holds that at the moment of consecration the elements of bread and wine are changed (substantially) into the Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Christ while the appearances (the \\"species\\") of the elements remain. In the doctrine of Real Presence, at the point of consecration, the act that takes place is a double miracle: 1) that Christ is present in a physical form and 2) that the bread and wine have truly, substantially become Jesus' Body and Blood. Because Roman Catholics believe that Christ is truly present (Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity) in the Eucharist, the reserved sacrament serves as a focal point of adoration. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that: \\"The Eucharistic presence of Christ begins at the moment of the consecration and endures as long as the Eucharistic species subsist.\\"Arinze, Francis. Celebrating the Holy Eucharist, 2006, p. 103 St. Faustina Kowalska stated that she was called to religious life while attending the Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament at age seven.Guiley, Rosemary. The encyclopedia of saints, 2001, p. 106 Notable examples of conversion are Saints Elizabeth Ann Seton and John Henry Newman, both having converted from Anglicanism, and the Venerable Hermann Cohen (Carmelite), O.C.D., from Judaism, following Eucharistic adoration. Cohen went on to help establish the widespread practice of nocturnal adoration. The practice of a \\"daily Holy Hour\\" of adoration has been encouraged in the Catholic tradition. Mother Teresa of Calcutta had a Holy Hour each day and all members of her Missionaries of Charity followed her example.McHugh, Joan Carter. My Daily Eucharist II, 1997, p. 14 Since the Middle Ages the practice of Eucharistic adoration outside Mass has been encouraged by the popes.Ball, Ann. 2003, Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices p. 11 In the midst of the Second Vatican Council, on 3 September 1965, a few days before opening the fourth session, Pope Paul VI issued the Encyclical Mysterium fidei whereby he urged daily Mass and communion and said, \\"And they should not forget about paying a visit during the day to the Most Blessed Sacrament in the very special place of honor where it is reserved in churches in keeping with the liturgical laws, since this is a proof of gratitude and a pledge of love and a display of the adoration that is owed to Christ the Lord who is present there.\\" St. Pius X used to say: \\"The daily adoration or visit to the Blessed Sacrament is the practice which is the fountainhead of all devotional works,\\" In Dominicae Cenae Pope John Paul II stated: \\"The Church and the world have a great need of Eucharistic worship. Jesus waits for us in this sacrament of love. Let us be generous with our time in going to meet Him in adoration and in contemplation that is full of faith.\\"Vatican website: Dominicae Cenae And he added in Ecclesia de Eucharistia: \\"The worship of the Eucharist outside of the Mass is of inestimable value for the life of the Church.... It is the responsibility of Pastors to encourage, also by their personal witness, the practice of Eucharistic adoration, and exposition of the Blessed Sacrament.\\" From his early years, the Eucharist had a central place in the theology of Joseph Ratzinger and in his role as Pope Benedict XVI. In his book God Is Near Us: The Eucharist, the Heart of Life he strongly encouraged Eucharistic adoration.Murphy, Joseph. Christ, Our Joy: The Theological Vision of Pope Benedict XVI, 2008, p. 180Ratzinger, Joseph. God Is Near Us: The Eucharist, the Heart of Life, 2003, pp. 88‚Äì91 Catholic prayers to the Blessed Sacrament One of the better known prayers of reparation to the Blessed Sacrament is attributed to the Angel of Portugal, said to have appeared at Fatima: :O most Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, I adore You profoundly. I offer You the Most Precious Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ, present in all the tabernacles of the world, in reparation for the outrages, sacrileges and indifferences by which He is offended. By the infinite merits of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I beg the conversion of sinners. Short Visit to the Blessed Sacrament By Saint John Henry Newman: :I place myself in the presence of Him, in whose Incarnate Presence I am before I place myself there. :I adore You, O my Savior, present here as God and Man, in Soul and Body, in true Flesh and Blood. :I acknowledge and confess that I kneel before the Sacred Humanity, which was conceived in Mary's womb, and lay in Mary's bosom; which grew up to man's estate, and by the Sea of Galilee called the Twelve, wrought miracles, and spoke words of wisdom and peace; which in due season hung on the cross, lay in the tomb, rose from the dead, and now reigns in heaven. :I praise and bless, and give myself wholly to Him, Who is the true Bread of my soul, and my everlasting joy. Eucharistic celebrations of any nature are sometimes initiated with the first four or at least the first stanza of the hymn Pange lingua, and often concluded with the Tantum ergo (being the other two stanzas of the same hymn), or at the least the versicle and oration attached to the Tantum ergo (see the article). These hymns and orations are from the Daily Office for Corpus Christi, composed by St. Thomas Aquinas. Eucharistic meditation Apart from promoting the Eucharist, Saint Peter Julian Eymard also made meditations before the Blessed host and his writings were later published as a book: The Real Presence.Eymard, Peter Julian. The Real Presence: eucharistic meditations, Sentinel Press, 1938 ASIN B00087ST7Q His contemporary Saint Jean Vianney also performed Eucharistic meditations which were later published.Vianney, Jean Baptiste Marie. The eucharistic meditations of the Cur√© d'Ars, Carmelite Publications (1961) ASIN B0007IVDMYVianney, Jean Baptiste Marie, Convert, H. and Benvenuta, Mary. Eucharistic Meditations: Extracts from the Writings and Instructions of Saint John Vianney, 1998, Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux was devoted to Eucharistic meditation and on 26 February 1895 shortly before she died wrote from memory her poetic masterpiece \\"To Live by Love\\" which she had composed during Eucharistic meditation. During her life, the poem was sent to various religious communities and was included in a notebook of her poems.Descouvemont, Pierre and Loose, Helmuth Nils. Therese and Lisieux, 1996, p. 245Collected poems of St Th√©r√®se of Lisieux by Th√©r√®se (de Lisieux), Alan Bancroft 2001 p. 75 Significant portions of the writings of the Venerable Concepcion Cabrera de Armida were reported as having been based on her meditations during adoration of the Blessed Sacrament.Armida, Concepci√≥n Cabrera de. I Am: Eucharistic Meditations on the Gospel In her book Eucharist: true jewel of eucharistic spirituality Maria Candida of the Eucharist (who was beatified by Pope John Paul II) wrote about her own personal experiences and reflections on Eucharistic meditation.Bunson, Matthew. Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Almanac, 2008, page 255 Perpetual adoration Perpetual adoration at the National Expiatory Temple of San Felipe de Jesus, Mexico City Perpetual adoration is the practice of the continuous exposition and adoration of the Eucharist, twenty-four hours a day. Similar to the \\"Perpetual Rosary\\" in which the Rosary is recited uninterrupted by a changing group of people, this practice gained popularity among Roman Catholics in 19th-century France and has since spread to lay Catholics in parishes across the world.A textbook was produced by a lay Catholic, Susan Taylor, with help from monks and clergy as a \\"how to set up Perpetual Adoration\\". During perpetual adoration, a specific person performs adoration for a period of one hour or more, so there is always at least one person who performs adoration during each day and night. However, during Mass the Blessed Sacrament should be reposed and is then exposed again after Mass. The only other time perpetual adoration is not performed is during the three days of Easter Triduum. =Early traditions= Perpetual adoration of God by psalm and prayer has been a tradition among Christians since ancient times, e.g., in Eastern Christianity since the year 400 when the Acoemetae monks kept up a divine service day and night; and in Western Christianity the monks at the monastery of Agaunum performed perpetual prayers since its formation in 522 by King Sigismund.Addis, William E. and Arnold, Thomas. A Catholic Dictionary, 2004, p. 656 Perpetual adoration at the Cathedral of Chihuahua, Mexico The first recorded instance of perpetual adoration formally began in Avignon, France, on 11 September 1226. To celebrate and give thanks for the victory over the Albigensians in the Siege of Avignon, King Louis VIII asked that the sacrament be placed on display at the Chapel of the Holy Cross. The overwhelming number of adorers brought the local bishop, Pierre de Corbie, to suggest that the exposition be continued indefinitely. With the permission of Pope Honorius III, the idea was ratified and the adoration continued there practically uninterrupted until the chaos of the French Revolution halted it from 1792. On 25 March 1654 Mother Mechtilde of the Blessed Sacrament formed a Benedictine society formed for that purpose. Mother Mechtilde pioneered perpetual adoration of the Eucharist on request of P√®re Picotte.Goyau, Georges. \\"Saint-Di√©.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 25 November 2017McMahon, Joseph. \\"Perpetual Adoration.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 25 November 2017 P√®re Picotte was the confessor of Anne of Austria who asked him for a vow for the deliverance of France from war and the order was formed in response to that vow. A small house was bought on Rue Feron in Paris and a Benedictine convent, founded for this purpose, began perpetual adoration there on 25 March 1654, one or more nuns kneeling in front of the altar in adoration each hour of the day and night. The simple Benedictine rules with which the nuns started were amended and formal approval for perpetual adoration was provided by the Camera Apostolica in Rome in 1705. Various Roman Catholic societies and orders were formed for the specific purpose of perpetual adoration prior to the 19th century, e.g., the Perpetual Adorers of the Blessed Sacrament (1659 in Marseille), Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary and of the Perpetual Adoration (formed in 1768 in Paris), and the Religious of the Perpetual Adoration (1789, Switzerland). By the beginning of the 19th century, in France as well as elsewhere in Europe, strong currents in favor of Eucharistic piety, devotions and adoration began to appear. Preachers such as Prosper Gu√©ranger, Peter Julian Eymard and Jean Vianney were very effective in renewing such devotions. The 19th century thus witnessed a rapid growth in perpetual adoration societies, and some existing orders (e.g., the Dominicans and the Poor Clares) e.g.: Sisters of the Perpetual Adoration (1845 in Brittany), Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration (also in 1854), Religious of Perpetual Adoration (Brussels, 1857), Servants of the Most Blessed Sacrament (1858, Paris), Sisters of St. Francis of Perpetual Adoration (1863, Olpe, Germany), Holy Spirit Adoration Sisters (the Netherlands, 1896). A number of perpetual adoration orders were also formed in the United States, e.g., Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration (1849 Wisconsin) and Benedictine Sisters of Perpetual Adoration (1874, Clyde, Missouri). The Poor Clares of the Monastery of Saint Mary of the Angels of Perpetual Adoration, in Drumshanbo, Ireland, first established perpetual adoration on 25 March 1870, and have continued the practice uninterrupted to this day. The Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration have been praying nonstop longer than anyone in the United States; the practice began on 1 August 1878, at 11 a.m. and continues to this date. =20th and 21st centuries= In the 20th century, the practice of perpetual adoration spread from monasteries and convents to Catholic parishes at large, and is now also performed by lay Catholics. The perpetual adoration chapel in Saint Peter's Basilica was inaugurated by Pope John Paul II in 1981 and a number of the major basilicas in Rome have also started perpetual adoration in the 20th century. Early in the 20th century, questions arose as to the suitability of perpetual adoration by lay Catholics. However, after various discussions, on 2 June 1991 (feast of Corpus Christi), the Pontifical Council for the Laity issued specific guidelines that permit perpetual adoration in parishes. In order to establish a \\"perpetual adoration chapel\\" in a parish, the local priest must obtain permission from his bishop by submitting a request along with the required information for the local \\"perpetual adoration association\\", its officers, etc. At the beginning of the 21st century, there were over 2,500 perpetual adoration chapels in Catholic parishes around the world. The United States (with about 70 million Catholics) had about 1,100 chapels, the Philippines (with about 80 million Catholics) 500, the Republic of Ireland (with about 4 million Catholics) about 150, South Korea (with about 4 million Catholics) had about 70. , the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis was estimated to have the most chapels of perpetual adoration of any archdiocese in the United States. , the world's largest monstrance is in Chicago, in a perpetual adoration chapel dedicated to the Divine Mercy, and is adjacent to Church of St. Stanislaus Kostka, one of the city's Polish churches.

Krasnodar Krai is often referred to as \\"Kuban\\", both officially and unofficially, although the term is not exclusive to the krai and accommodates the republics of Adygea, Karachay- Cherkessia, and parts of Stavropol Krai. Cossack settlement The settlement of Kuban and of the adjacent Black Sea region occurred gradually for over a century, and was heavily influenced by the outcomes of the conflicts between Russia and Ottoman Empire.Azarenkova et al., pp. 8ff. In the mid-18th century, the area was predominantly settled by the mountainous Adyghe tribes. After the Russo-Turkish War of 1768‚Äì1774, the population of the area started to show more pro-Russian tendencies. In order to stop Turkish ambitions to use Kuban region to facilitate the return of the Crimea, Russia started to establish a network of fortifications along the Kuban River in the 1770s. After the Russian annexation of the Crimea, right-bank Kuban, and Taman in 1783, the Kuban River became the border of the Russian Empire. New fortresses were built on the Kuban in the 1780s‚Äì1790s. Until the 1790s, these fortresses and the abandoned Cossack settlements on the Laba River and in Taman remained the only indication of Russian presence in the area. More intensive settlement started in 1792‚Äì1794, when Black Sea Cossack Host and Don Cossacks were re-settled to this area by the Russian government in order to strengthen the southern borders. In the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries, the right bank of the Kuban River was settled. At the same time, first settlements appear on the coast of the Black Sea and on the plain between the Kuban and Bolshaya Laba Rivers. During the second half of the 19th century, the settlement rate intensified, and the territory was administratively organized into Kuban Oblast and Black Sea Okrug (which later became Black Sea Governorate). The location of the territory along the border had a significant effect on its administrative division, which incorporated the elements of civil and military governments.

It brings up the benefits, risks, and consequences. Plot summary Victor Frank, and his wife Marsha, are unable to have a second child due to Marsha's infertility. They turn to surrogacy as an alternate method of conception. Victor, an obstetrician-gynaecologist and owner of the biochemical company Chimera Inc., injects the egg implanted in his wife with an agent called Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) into chromosome six, which causes the baby to grow more neurons than usual, as a result making them super intelligent. Their son, VJ (Victor Junior), is born a genius. He is able to talk in six months and read in thirteen. Victor wonders if his experiment was a mistake. Several years later, VJ's brother, David, and nanny, Janice, both die of an unexplainable rare form of liver cancer. At about three, VJ experiences a drop in intelligence, leading Victor to think his experiment is a failure. VJ is not a genius anymore. VJ lives a secluded life from that point, leading his psychiatrist mother to worry, to the annoyance of Victor who believes VJ is fine. When VJ turns eleven, a disastrous chain of events begins. Victor had injected two other eggs with NGF, which were given to two families who work at Chimera through the fertility clinic there. They both inexplicably die at age three because of brain edema. Victor later finds out they had been given the antibiotic Cephaloclor, which causes the nerve cell growth process to begin again. This causes their brains to grow too large for their skulls, killing them. Their parents, however, were told their children had deadly allergies to this antibiotic. Victor launches an investigation into the children's deaths, and finds no explanation for how they got the antibiotic. He also insists on VJ getting a full neurological work-up, making Marsha suspicious. Victor eventually reveals his experiment to Marsha, horrifying her. She then gives VJ a full psychological work-up as well. Nothing seems out of the ordinary in the results, but Marsha realizes the results don't seem to reflect VJ's real personality. This leads her to believe that he analyzed the tests and beat them. Victor, meanwhile, is having the DNA of the tumors that killed his older son and nanny analyzed. When the DNA in the tumors is sequenced, there is an identical strand of alien DNA in both of them. Victor then goes looking for VJ, who spends a lot of time at the lab, and sees him head under an old clock tower on the Chimera campus. Victor follows him, and is knocked out by a guard. When he wakes up he is in a laboratory built by VJ, where he has solved many of the biochemical problems Victor had been trying to solve. Victor is amazed by his son's genius, and rushes to show Marsha. Marsha reacts differently and is worried about VJ, especially about the part of the lab he didn't show them. Victor and Marsha come back the next day and insist on VJ showing them the rest of the lab. In one room, VJ is growing fetuses, the five eggs from Marsha that had not been implanted, in artificial wombs. VJ tells them that there is no fifth fetus because of a failed implantation attempt in the artificial womb, and also reveals that he has altered the babies to make them mentally retarded, so they won't be more intelligent than him. After this, he reveals that he killed the other two children who had been injected with NGF for the same reason, so he would be the only super genius. Not only did he kill the two children, he also used a method he had created for injecting cancer into someone to kill David, Janice, and a teacher who was prying into his life. VJ then leads his horrified parents into another room, where he has tanks full of E. coli genetically altered to produce cocaine, which he sold to Colombian drug dealers to finance his lab. VJ then insists that his parents announce their intent to him. Marsha convinces VJ to leave her and Victor to talk alone, and they decide that they must kill their son. NGF may have made VJ a genius, but at the cost of his conscience. Victor lies to VJ, and VJ agrees to release him on two conditions. One, that Marsha stay in the lab as a hostage, and two, that Victor must have a guard with him at all times. Victor takes the guard back to his house and drugs him. He then rushes to his lab, where he synthesizes nitroglycerin. He makes a bomb with the nitroglycerin, and plants it in a tunnel by VJ's lab. He convinces VJ to release Marsha so she can do her work, and stalls VJ until the bomb goes off, causing the gates redirecting a river under the clock tower to break. VJ rushes for the exit, but Victor stops him discovering that, ironically, despite the fact VJ's mind is beyond his years, he still has the strength of a ten-year-old. Victor holds him down until the lab floods, killing them both. One year later, a mother brings in her teenage daughter and her daughter's child to her office. Marsha surmises from the fact that the 18-month child is reading a medical journal, something VJ did, and his ice blue eyes, a trait VJ had, that this child is the \\"failed\\" zygote. She decides she will have to go through another VJ-like experience, \\"with Joe's help and end forever the nightmare her husband had begun\\". 1989 American novels Novels by Robin Cook Novels about genetic engineering ","title":"Mutation (novel)"},{"id":"1370276","title":"Rumina Sato"},{"id":"1370282","text":"A Cossack host (, kozatske viysko; , kazachye voysko), sometimes translated as Cossack army, was an administrative subdivision of Cossacks in the Russian Empire.  Imperial Russia  The Cossack host consisted of a certain territory with Cossack settlements that had to provide military regiments for service in the Imperial Russian Army and for border patrol. Usually the hosts were named after the regions of their dislocation. The stanitsa, or village, formed the primary unit of this organization. In the Russian Empire, the Cossacks constituted eleven separate hosts, settled along the frontiers: the Don, Kuban, Terek, Astrakhan, Ural, Orenburg, Siberian, Semiryeche, Transbaikal, Amur, and Ussuri. There was also a small number of the Cossacks in Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk, who would form the Yenisey Cossack Host and Irkutsk Cossack Regiment of the Ministry of the Interior in 1917. Cossack hosts on Russian soil were disbanded in 1920, at the end of the Russian Civil War.

The museum contains information panels that cover each inductee's career and accomplishments through text, photographs, and various artifacts. In the center of the exhibit area, a replica of a 1930s theater marquee reminds visitors of the role of country music in film. A juke box nearby allows visitors to select the country songs that they wish to hear played while touring the museum. The marquee serves as the entrance to the Tex Ritter Museum. A native of Panola County, Ritter was one of the first singers inducted into the hall of fame when it was established in 1998. It also has an exhibit on Ritter's son, John Ritter. Mickey Gilley, a native of Ferriday, Louisiana, and Moe Bandy, originally from Meridian, Mississippi, though not born in Texas, have subsequently had a long association with the state, Gilley with Houston and Bandy with San Antonio. On August 12, 2017, Kenny Rogers, a Houston native who became one of the most successful performers in country music history in a career spanning nearly 60 years, was inducted into The Texas Country Music Hall of Fame.

The population was 2,614 at the 2010 census. It lies along U.S. Route 1, west of Aiken in Horse Creek Valley, which originates in the nearby town of Vaucluse. Graniteville is part of the Augusta, Georgia metropolitan area, also known as the C.S.R.A. or Central Savannah River Area. History Old Graniteville Mill headquarters Graniteville dates back to 1845 when William Gregg built the South's first large-scale cotton mill in what became known as Graniteville. His paternalistic mill town included 90 homes, several boarding houses, six stores, two churches, and a school for the mill workers and their families. The community got its name because most of those original buildings were constructed of blue granite. Gregg required the children of mill workers to attend the public school he instituted, and violators were fined. As such, Graniteville holds the distinction of having the first compulsory education system in the Southern United States. The Graniteville Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Site of derailment at Graniteville, South Carolina Monument to the crash's victims On January 6, 2005, a Norfolk Southern Railway freight train struck a parked train on the spur leading to Avondale's Stevens Steam Plant. One of two train cars that were carrying liquid chlorine ruptured, releasing a poisonous chlorine cloud. Nine people were killed, more than 550 injured, and more than 5,400 were displaced from their homes for more than a week. The town built a memorial in a small park at the intersection of Canal Street and Aiken Road, and on May 20, 2006, the memorial was dedicated to the people who died in the crash. In 2008, there were talks about incorporating the villages of Graniteville, Vaucluse, and Warrenville; as a result, the towns approved a referendum to vote on whether or not to incorporate. If approved, the municipality would have had an area of around . The referendum was defeated by a two-to-one margin in August 2008. Economy Until 1996, Graniteville was the home office and central location of a collection of textile plants in South Carolina and Georgia known as The Graniteville Company. In 1996, the company was bought out by Avondale Mills, a company which was one of the largest denim manufacturers in the United States. Avondale closed or sold off all of its plants in the area in 2006, unable to recover financially from the train accident in 2005. Graniteville is also home to a Bridgestone/Firestone Tire and Rubber Company plant. A continuing legacy of The Graniteville Company is the Gregg-Graniteville Foundation, which was established by the company in 1941 in honor of Mr. Gregg. To continue his concern for people, the Foundation awards annual college scholarships and other charitable contributions. Gregg Park Civic Center, a recreational complex, has services offered to community residents at a nominal charge. The Foundation funds the complex which includes a walking track, softball and baseball fields, tennis courts, swimming area, picnic area. The gym includes a basketball court, weight room, exercise room, racquetball courts, locker rooms and showers. Demographics As of 2010, the total population of the CDP was 2,614. 0.65% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.04% were Asian, 28.62% were African American, 0.08% were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 65.26% were white, 2.83% were some other race, and 2.52% were of two or more races. People of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race) were 5.93% of the population. Males were 47.59% of the population, and females were 52.41%. The age distribution of the population was 9.45% under 5 years of age, 18.06% 5 to 17 years, 57.46% 18 to 64 years, and 15.03% age 65 and over.

When a teach was absent, students had the option to attend the Sub Program or go to study hall. Run by a staff advisor and a team of student volunteers, the programming was often quite notable.

Rogue Traders, Rogue Princes, Rogue Bishops and the German Financial Meltdown of 1621‚Äì23\\", Mike Dash, Smithsonian, March 29, 2012 Starting around 1621, city-states in the Holy Roman Empire began to heavily debase currency in order to raise revenue for the Thirty Years' War,\\"The German economic crisis of 1618 to 1623\\", Bundesbank as effective taxation did not exist. More and more mints were established until the debased metal coins were so worthless that children allegedly played with them in the street, which became the basis for Leo Tolstoy's short story \\"Ivan the Fool\\". The name refers to the use of tipping scales to identify not-yet-debased coins, which were then taken out of circulation, melted, mixed with baser metals such as lead, copper or tin, and re-issued. Often the states did not debase their own currency, but instead manufactured low-value imitations of coins from other territories and then spent them in yet other territories as far as possible from their own lands, hoping that the resulting damage would then occur to the economy of those other regions rather than their own. This worked for a while; but after a time, the general public caught on to the manipulation, resulting in pamphlets denouncing the practice, local riots and the refusal of soldiers and mercenaries to fight unless paid in real, non-debased money. Also the states began to get back their own debased coins in taxes and customs fees. Due to these problems the practice largely stopped around 1623; however, the damage done was so large that it created financial disarray in almost all the city- states in the area. The same thing re-occurred on a smaller scale near the end of the century and again during the middle of the 18th century; however, the debasement spread from Germany to Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, and Poland. Meaning of Kipper und Wipper Based on a 17th-century slang, Kipper und Wipper summarizes the financial crisis. Kipper means \\"the clipping of coins\\" and Wipper means \\"seesaw\\". During the financial crisis of Kipper und Wipper, people clipped or shaved the sides of coins. They were able to shave off the sides of coins that contained precious metals because the sides of the coins were not milled. Milled coins are coins with grooves on the sides that prevent clipping. Wipper correlates to the financial crisis because it means to wag or seesaw. While merchants or money exchangers weighted money, they would continuously keep the scale in motion so that they could switch the good money with bad, debased coins. Frequently, coins would be melted and mixed with less rare and less precious metals such as copper. Origin of debased coins In Europe, there were many sources of debased money. Though there is not one specific place where the debasement of coins can be traced back to, there were early traces in Italy and Switzerland. It was said that debased coins were put into circulation and were created as early as 1580. Debasement During Kipper und Wipper, there were two forms of debasement. To finance the Thirty Years' War, which was occurring simultaneously, coins were either shaved down or melted. By clipping or shaving coins, the amount of silver or precious metal in the coin decreased. Additionally, by melting coins, mixing them with lesser metals, making new coins, and circulating them, the nominal value, face value, greater deferred from the melt value or value of the metal in the coin. =Cause= A major decision made between cities that resulted in the creation of more mints and eventually more debased coin was when six cities decided to allow the establishment of more mints, a place to manufacture coins and money. By doing so, mints were able to mint more debased coins. =Effect= Many states in Europe tried to finance their war efforts through debased coins. Charles P. Kindleberger wrote, \\"Bad money was taken by debasing states to their neighbors and exchanged for good.\\" Referring to good money, he said that states would mint debased coins, exchange it in neighboring state, and bring good coins back. This brought in coins what had a higher content of silver. However, the neighboring states also debased their coins to prevent a loss of money. This resulted in hyperinflation. Hyperinflation is the rapid rise in prices in a short period of time. This eventually became a crisis throughout many states in Europe for debased coins quickly spread from state to state. =Attempt at prevention= During the period of crisis, many methods of preventing the debasement of coins and preventing Gresham's Law were thought of. Gresham's Law states that coins with a lower melt value or intrinsic value circulate faster and better than coins that have a higher melt value. In European states, the import of bad coins and the export of good coins were enforced by punishments such as banishment, burning, or the confiscation of goods. These penalties were difficult to enforce and debased coins and good coins flowed in and out of states.

It was maintained by Trend Micro under the new name of Trend Micro Anti-Spyware, which came into effect from version 3.0. Previous versions did not have the Trend Micro branding. Trend Micro Anti-Spyware was later discontinued on November 30, 2007, and replaced with Trend Micro AntiVirus plus AntiSpyware 2008. The program is shareware, and was available to download as a 30-day trial. Previously, SpySubtract was often pre-installed on new desktop and notebook computers. References Spyware removal ","title":"SpySubtract"},{"id":"1370321","text":"Microsoft Defender (known as Windows Defender before Windows 10 May 2020 Update or Windows Defender Antivirus in Windows 10 Creators Update and later) is an anti-malware component of Microsoft Windows. It was first released as a downloadable free anti-spyware program for Windows XP, and was later shipped with Windows Vista and Windows 7. It has evolved into a full antivirus program, replacing Microsoft Security Essentials as part of Windows 8 and later versions.  Basic features  Before Windows 8, Windows Defender only protected users against spyware. It includes a number of real-time security agents that monitor several common areas of Windows for changes which might have been caused by spyware. It also has the ability to remove installed ActiveX software. Windows Defender featured an integrated support for Microsoft SpyNet that allows users to report to Microsoft what they consider to be spyware, and what applications and device drivers they allow to be installed on their systems. Protection against viruses was subsequently added in Windows 8; which resembles Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE). It also uses the same anti-malware engine and virus definitions from MSE. In Windows 10, Windows Defender settings are controlled in the Windows Defender Security Center. In the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, a new logo is introduced and a pop-up notification will appear to announce the results of a scan, even if no viruses are found.  History  = Beta = alt= Windows Defender was initially based on GIANT AntiSpyware, formerly developed by GIANT Company Software, Inc. The company's acquisition was announced by Microsoft on December 16, 2004. While the original GIANT AntiSpyware officially supported older Windows versions, support for the Windows 9x line of operating systems was later dropped by Microsoft. The first beta release of Microsoft AntiSpyware from January 6, 2005 was a repackaged version of GIANT AntiSpyware There were more builds released in 2005, with the last Beta 1 refresh released on November 21, 2005. At the 2005 RSA Security conference, Bill Gates, the Chief Software Architect and co-founder of Microsoft, announced that Windows Defender (formerly Microsoft AntiSpyware prior to November 4, 2005) would be made available free-of-charge to users with validly licensed Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 operating systems to secure their systems against the increasing malware threat. Windows Defender (Beta 2) was released on February 13, 2006. It featured the program's new name and a redesigned user interface. The core engine was rewritten in C++, unlike the original GIANT- developed AntiSpyware, which was written in Visual Basic. This improved the application's performance. Also, since beta 2, the program works as a Windows service, unlike earlier releases, which enables the application to protect the system even when a user is not logged on. Beta 2 also requires Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) validation. However, Windows Defender (Beta 2) did not contain some of the tools found in Microsoft AntiSpyware (Beta 1). Microsoft removed the System Inoculation, Secure Shredder and System Explorer tools found in MSAS (Beta 1) as well as the Tracks Eraser tool, which allowed users to easily delete many different types of temporary files related to Internet Explorer 6, including HTTP cookies, web cache, and Windows Media Player playback history. German and Japanese versions of Windows Defender (Beta 2) were later released by Microsoft. = General availability = On October 24, 2006, Microsoft released Windows Defender. It supports Windows XP and Windows Server 2003; however, unlike the betas, it does not run on Windows 2000. = Conversion to antivirus = Windows Defender was released with Windows Vista and Windows 7, serving as their built-in anti-spyware component. In Windows Vista and Windows 7, Windows Defender was superseded by Microsoft Security Essentials, an antivirus product from Microsoft which provided protection against a wider range of malware. Upon installation, Microsoft Security Essentials disabled and replaced Windows Defender. In Windows 8, Microsoft upgraded Windows Defender into an antivirus program very similar to Microsoft Security Essentials for Windows 7Windows 8 Consumer Preview: Set Up Windows 8 with the Web Installer and using the same virus definition updates. MSE itself does not run on Windows versions beyond 7. In Windows 8 and Windows 10, Windows Defender is on by default. It switches itself off upon installation of a third-party anti-virus package. Starting with Windows 10, Microsoft began to transfer the control of Windows Defender out of its native client. Initially, its \\"Settings\\" dialog box was replaced by a dedicated page in the Settings app. In Windows 10 Creators Update, Windows Defender is renamed Windows Defender Antivirus to distinguish it from Windows Defender Security Center. The latter has become the default avenue to interface with Windows Defender. While there was no shortcut on the Start menu for Windows Defender's native client, it could still run. It was later removed in the Windows 10 April 2018 Update and transferred to Windows Defender Security Center.  Advanced features  alt= = Real-time protection = In the Windows Defender options, the user can configure real-time protection options. Windows 10's Anniversary Update introduced Limited Periodic Scanning, which optionally allows Windows Defender to scan a system periodically if another antivirus app is installed. It also introduced Block at First Sight, which uses machine learning to predict whether a file is malicious. = Browser integration = Integration with Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge enables files to be scanned as they are downloaded to detect malicious software inadvertently downloaded. As of April 2018, Windows Defender is also available for Google Chrome via an extension and works in conjunction with Google Safe Browsing. = Application Guard = A feature released in early 2018, Windows Defender Application Guard is a feature exclusive to Microsoft Edge that allows you to sandbox your current browsing session from your system. This prevents a malicious website or malware from affecting your system and your browser. Application Guard is a feature only available on Windows 10 Pro & Windows 10 Enterprise.  Windows Vista-specific functionality  Windows Defender had additional functionality in Windows Vista which was removed in subsequent versions of Windows: = Security agents = Security agents which monitor the computer for malicious activities: * Auto Start ‚Äì Monitors lists of programs that are allowed to automatically run when the user starts the computer * System Configuration (settings) ‚Äì Monitors security-related settings in Windows * Internet Explorer Add-ons ‚Äì Monitors programs that automatically run when the user starts Internet Explorer * Internet Explorer Configurations (settings) ‚Äì Monitors browser security settings * Internet Explorer Downloads ‚Äì Monitors files and programs that are designed to work with Internet Explorer * Services and Drivers ‚Äì Monitors services and drivers as they interact with Windows and programs * Application Execution ‚Äì Monitors when programs start and any operations they perform while running * Application Registration ‚Äì Monitors tools and files in the operating system where programs can register to run at any time * Windows Add-ons ‚Äì Monitors add-on programs for Windows = Software Explorer = The Advanced Tools section allows users to discover potential vulnerabilities with a series of Software Explorers. They provide views of startup programs, currently running software, network connected applications, and Winsock providers (Winsock LSPs). In each Explorer, every element is rated as either \\"Known\\", \\"Unknown\\" or \\"Potentially Unwanted\\". The first and last categories carry a link to learn more about the particular item, and the second category invites users to submit the program to Microsoft SpyNet for analysis by community members. The Software Explorer feature has been removed from Windows Defender in Windows 7. = Notification of startup programs that run as an administrator = Windows Defender in Windows Vista automatically blocks all startup items that require administrator privileges to run (this is considered suspicious behavior for a startup item). This automatic blocking is related to the User Account Control functionality in Windows Vista, and requires users to manually run each of these startup items each time they log in if they desire the item to run at startup. = User interface = In Windows Vista, it is possible to close the window and have the program run in the system tray while a scan is running. However, in Windows 7, this functionality was removed and the window must remain open while a scan is running.  Windows Defender Offline  Windows Defender Offline (formerly known as Standalone System Sweeper) is a stand-alone anti-malware program that runs from bootable removable media (e.g. CD or USB flash drive) designed to scan infected systems while the Windows operating system is offline. Since Windows 10 Anniversary Update in 2016, the option to boot into Windows Defender Offline can be initiated from within Windows itself, negating the need for the separate boot disk.  Mitigated security vulnerability  On May 5, 2017, Tavis Ormandy, a vulnerability researcher from Google, discovered a security vulnerability in the JavaScript analysis module (NScript) of Microsoft Antimalware Engine (MsMpEngine) that impacted Windows Defender, Microsoft Security Essentials and System Center Endpoint Protection. By May 8, 2017, Microsoft had released a patch to all affected systems. Ars Technica commended Microsoft for its unprecedented patching speed and said that the disaster had been averted. Reviews During a December 2017 test of various anti-malware software carried out by AV-TEST on Windows 10, Windows Defender earned 6 out of 6 points in detection rate of various malware samples, earning its \\"AV-TEST Certified\\" seal. During a February 2018 \\"Real-World Protection Test\\" performed by AV-Comparatives, Windows Defender achieved a 100% detection rate of malicious URL samples, along with 3 false positive results. An AV-TEST test of Windows Defender in October 2019 demonstrated it provides excellent protection both against viruses and 0-day / malware attacks.

He later co-created, and was executive editor and host of Religion & Ethics Newsweekly, which aired on PBS from 1997 until 2017.  Early career  Abernethy received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. His broadcasting career began in 1951, at WBUD radio (now WFJS) in Morrisville, Pennsylvania. =NBC= After graduating from Princeton in 1952, Abernethy went to work at NBC News. He was assigned to the network's Washington, D.C. bureau in 1953 and spent two years there before being transferred to London. He returned to Washington in 1958 to report and anchor network news updates. From 1961 until 1963 Abernethy hosted a weekly television news magazine for NBC, Update, which targeted teenagers and young adults. He also anchored the network's coverage of the Northeast blackout of 1965 from its Washington news bureau. In August 1966 NBC transferred Abernethy again, this time to Los Angeles, and assigned him to anchor evening newscasts at its owned-and- operated television station KNBC. Abernethy anchored at KNBC until 1970, but remained on the newscasts as an interviewer, special correspondent, and commentator. He also served as moderator of a local public affairs program on the station, KNBC News Conference. After 11 years at KNBC, Abernethy left Los Angeles in 1977 and returned to NBC's Washington bureau to report for the Today Show, where he appeared alongside former KNBC colleague Tom Brokaw. Abernethy took a leave from NBC in 1984 to study briefly at Yale Divinity School in New Haven, Connecticut. He returned to the network a year later to Washington, and in 1989 accepted what would be his final NBC assignment, chief correspondent of the Moscow bureau. =Public Television= Abernethy completed his Moscow assignment in 1994 and subsequently retired from NBC. He spent the next three years developing Religion & Ethics NewsWeekly for PBS. Using his personal background as part of a family of Northern Baptist ministers, his education at Yale Divinity and having covered religion stories for NBC, Abernethy crafted the program to fill a void in objective reporting of faith-based issues in American television. Religion & Ethics NewsWeekly premiered in September 1997, produced by WNET in New York City and underwritten primarily by a $5 million grant from the Lilly Endowment. An executive there said it was one of the largest amounts our religion program has ever made to a single project. The program ended in February 2017 after a nearly 20-year run.  Personal life  Abernethy is married to Marie Cheremeteff Grove. They have two daughters, one stepdaughter, and three stepsons. They currently live in Washington, D.C., and Jaffrey, New Hampshire, and are ordained members of the United Church of Christ.

Their alternative name, Yaik Cossacks, comes from the old name of the river. They were also known by the names: *Russian: –£—Ä–∞ÃÅ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–µ –∫–∞–∑–∞ÃÅ–∫–∏ (—É—Ä–∞ÃÅ–ª—å—Ü—ã) (Uralskiye kazaki (uraltsyo)); –£—Ä–∞ÃÅ–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–µ –∫–∞–∑–∞ÃÅ—á—å–µ –≤–æÃÅ–π—Å–∫–æ (Uralskiye kazachye voisko), –Ø–∏ÃÅ—Ü–∫–æ–µ –∫–∞–∑–∞ÃÅ—á—å–µ –≤–æÃÅ–π—Å–∫–æ (Yaitskoye kazachye voisko) *Ukrainian: –£—Ä–∞ÃÅ–ª—å—Å–∫—ñ –∫–æ–∑–∞–∫–∏ÃÅ (Uralski kozaky); –£—Ä–∞ÃÅ–ª—å—Å—å–∫–µ –∫–æ–∑–∞ÃÅ—Ü—å–∫–µ –≤—ñÃÅ–π—Å—å–∫–æ (Uralske kozatske viysko), –Ø—óÃÅ—Ü—å–∫–µ –∫–æ–∑–∞ÃÅ—Ü—å–∫–µ –≤—ñÃÅ–π—Å—å–∫–æ (Yaitske kozatske viysko) *Bashkir: –£—Ä–∞–ª –∫–∞–∑–∞–∫—Ç–∞—Ä—ã (—É—Ä–∞–ª–µ—Ü) (Ural kazktaryo (uralets)); –£—Ä–∞–ª –∫–∞–∑–∞–∫ “ì”ô—Å–∫”ô—Ä–µ (Ural kazak ƒü…ôsk…ôrye), –Ø–π—ã“° –∫–∞–∑–∞–∫ “ì”ô—Å–∫”ô—Ä–µ (Yiyok kazak ƒü…ôsk…ôrye)  History  Orenburg cossacks (1912), descendants of Yaik Cossacks from Sakmara settlement, founded by Yaik Cossacks before the foundation of Orenburg. The Yaik (Ural) Cossacks although speaking Russian and identifying themselves as being of primarily Russian ancestry also incorporated many Tatars into their ranks. According to Peter Rychckov some these Tatars called themselves Bulgarians of Khazar origin, and the first Yaik Cossacks, including these Tatars and Russians, existed by the end of 14th century.The origin of Yaik Cossacks http://www.yaik.ru/rus/forces/history/index.php?SECTION_ID=263&ELEMENT;_ID=2542 These Tatars might be both Chuvash people and Mishari (Meschera in Russian, Mi≈ü√§r in Tatar language), the latter had not only Muslims and Jews, but Christians among them to facilitate their merge with Russians Meschera were important on Don as well. Later, as Pushkin wrote, a lot of Nogai joined Yaik Cossacks. Twenty years after the conquest of the Volga from Kazan to Astrakhan, in 1577 Alton S, Donnelly, 'The Russian Conquest of Bashkiria',1968, for this paragraph. Moscow sent troops to disperse pirates and raiders along the Volga (one of their number was Ermak). Some of these fled southeast to the Ural River and joined Yaik Cossacks. In 1580 they captured Saraichik together. By 1591 they were fighting for Moscow and sometime in the next century they were officially recognized. In 1717 they lost 1,500 men on the Alexander Bekovich-Cherkassky expedition to Khiva. A census in 1723 showed 3,196 men fit for military service. Yaik Cossacks were the driving force in the rebellion led by Yemelyan Pugachev in 1773-1774. Their main livelihood was fishery and the taxation on it was a major source of friction between the Cossacks and the state. A revolt broke out in 1772, marked by the murder of General von Traubenberg. Traubenberg headed a commission which was to investigate and settle Cossack complaints and grievances, but his behaviour only antagonized them further. In reprisal, many were arrested, executed and outlawed. Pugachev appeared shortly after and managed to rally them to his cause. The Yaik Cossacks were renamed as part of the Ural Host after the rebellion. The Ural regiments later took part in Suvorov's Italian and Swiss expedition, the Great Patriotic War of 1812, the Russo-Turkish War, the November Uprising of 1830 and in the Crimean War. They also played a significant role in the Turkestan campaigns of the 1870s. In the Ural-Guryev operation of 1919‚Äì1920, the Red Turkestan Front defeated the Ural Army, which was formed from Ural Cossacks and others troops which rebelled against the Bolsheviks. During the winter 1920, Ural Cossacks and their families, totaling about 15,000 people, headed south along the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea towards Fort Alexandrovsk. Only a few hundred of them reached Persia in June 1920. Distinctions The distinguishing colour of the Ural Host was crimson/red; worn on the cap bands, epaulettes and wide trouser stripes of a dark blue uniform of the loose-fitting cut common to the Steppe Cossacks. Individual regiments were distinguished by yellow numbers on the epaulettes. High fleece hats were worn on occasion with crimson cloth tops. No spurs were worn by the Ural and other cossack hosts. After 1907 a khaki-grey jacket was adopted for field uniform, worn with blue-grey breeches.\\"Tablitsi Form' Obmundirovaniya Russkoi Armi\\", Colonel V.K.

He was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1879 to 1900, taking his seat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.Paul A. Townend, \\"'No Imperial Privilege': Justin McCarthy, Home Rule, and Empire.\\" √âire-Ireland 42.1 (2007): 201-228. Early life McCarthy was born in Cork City, Cork, and was educated there. He began his career as a journalist, aged 18, in Cork. From 1853 to 1859 he was in Liverpool, on the staff of the Northern Daily Times. In March 1855, he married Charlotte Ailman. In 1860 he moved to London, as parliamentary reporter to the Morning Star, of which he became editor in 1864. He gave up his post in 1868, and, after a lecturing tour in the United States, joined the staff of the Daily News as leader-writer in 1870. In this capacity he became one of the most useful and respected upholders of the liberal politics of the time. He lectured again in America in 1870‚Äì71, and again in 1886‚Äì87. Political career Spy in Vanity Fair, 1885 McCarthy was first elected to Parliament at a by-election on 4 April 1879, when he was returned unopposed as a Home Rule League MP for County Longford. He was re-elected unopposed as a Parnellite Home Ruler in 1880,Walker, op. cit., p. 125. and when the two-seat Longford constituency was split into two divisions under the Redistribution of Seats Act, he was elected as an Irish Parliamentary Party member for the new single-seat Northern division of Longford. His sole opponent, a Conservative, won only 6% of the votes.Walker, op. cit., p. 134. At the 1886 general election, he was returned unopposed in North Longford,Walker, op. cit., p. 140. but had also stood in Londonderry City, where he was declared to have lost to the Unionist candidate by the narrow margin of 1778 votes to 1781.Walker, op. cit., p. 139. However, the result was later overturned on petition, and McCarthy opted to sit for Londonderry City. During the divorce controversy surrounding Charles Stewart Parnell in November 1890, the British Prime Minister Gladstone expressed a warning, given to Justin McCarthy as intermediary, that if Parnell retained leadership of the Irish Parliamentary Party it would mean the loss of the next election, the end of their alliance and Home Rule. When the annual party leadership election meeting was called later that month, this threat was somehow not conveyed to the members, who re-elected Parnell leader of the Party. After a further historical meeting of the Irish Party MPs early December, Parnell refused to retire, and the Party divided. McCarthy became chairman of the Anti-Parnellite group, or the Irish National Federation and held that post until January 1896; but his nationalism was of a temperate and orderly kind, and though his personal distinction singled him out for the chairmanship during the party dissensions of this period, he was in no active sense the political leader. At the 1892 general election, McCarthy again stood both in North Longford and in Londonderry City. In each seat there was a two-way contest between the Anti- Parnellite McCarthy and a Unionist candidate, but the narrow Unionist victory in Londonderry City (by 1986 votes to 1960) was not overturned, and McCarthy sat for North Longford, where he had won over 93% of the votes.Walker, op. cit., p. 147. He was returned unopposed for North Longford in 1895, and stood down from Parliament at the 1900 general election. Writing It has been claimed that McCarthy's true vocation was literature.* His earliest publications were novels, some of which, such as A Fair Saxon (1873), Dear Lady Disdain (1875), Miss Misanthrope (1878), Donna Quixote (1879), attained considerable popularity. His most important work is his History of Our Own Times (vols. i.iv., 1879‚Äì1880; vol. v., 1897), which treats of the period between Queen Victoria's accession and her Diamond Jubilee.; ; ; He published England under Gladstone, 1880-1885 in 1885.See online copy He began a History of the Four Georges (1884‚Äì1901); the latter half was written by his son, Justin Huntly McCarthy. He also collaborated on three novels with Rosa Campbell Praed: The Right Honourable (1886), The Rebel Rose (issued anonymously in 1888 but appeared in their joint names in two later editions under the title, The Rival Princess), and The Ladies' Gallery (1888). They also collaborated on The Grey River, a book on the Thames, which was illustrated with etchings by Mortimer Menpes. He wrote The Story of Gladstone (1904), a somewhat uncritical biography of William Ewart Gladstone. Family life McCarthy married in 1855, they had a son Justin Huntly McCarthy born in 1859 who also became a Member of Parliament, and they had a daughter Charlotte born in 1872. McCarthy died in Folkestone, Kent, England on 24 April 1912, aged 81.

It is owned by Cumulus Media, which also owns KQRS-FM and the three station trimulcast known as \\"Love 105\\". Its transmitter is located in Shoreview, Minnesota. Its studios are in Northeast Minneapolis in the Como district. History Through much of its early history, the station was known as WAYL, airing a beautiful music format. When the format fell out of favor nationwide during the 1980s, the frequency enjoyed success with several rock music formats. =1960-1988: WAYL= WAYL signed on the air in October 1960 and originally broadcast on 96.1 FM. They soon began broadcasting in stereo. A few years later, WAYL moved its beautiful music format to 93.7 FM. Entertainment Communications (later Entercom) acquired the station in 1969. In 1976, Entercom added an AM sister station with the purchase of WYOO (980 AM). =1988-1993: WAYL-FM becomes KLXK, then 93X= In July 1988, due to the aging demographics of the beautiful music format (and despite high ratings), WAYL became classic hits KLXK, with the beautiful music format moving to 980 AM.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1988/RR-1988-07-29.pdf KLXK was clearly influenced by another young station, WKLH in Milwaukee, which had recently adopted a similar format. KLXK enjoyed modest success, but rival KQRS-FM had retooled their format to include a large amount of classic rock product, and also had the top-rated morning show in the market. KLXK eventually decided to attack KQRS from another front. On January 28, 1992, 93.7 flipped to hard rock with the call sign KRXX (\\"93X\\").http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1992/RR-1992-01-31.pdf Their co-owned AM station had earlier flipped to a similar hard rock format as KMZZ, initially airing the syndicated Z-Rock network for a time before briefly switching to a locally based automated heavy metal format (\\"Mega Rock 980\\") and finally simulcasting 93X by 1993. =1994-1997: \\"The Edge\\": KQRS buys KRXX= Former 93.7 The Edge logo Cap Cities/ABC, the owner of rival KQRS-FM, took control of 93X pending purchase (but not KMZZ, which was sold separately later) from Entercom on February 4, 1994. The selling price was $20 million, then a record for highest amount ever paid for a radio station in the market. The following day, 93X began stunting with a loop \\"It's the End of the World as We Know It\\" by R.E.M. throughout the weekend. Confused listeners flocked in droves to the KRXX studios in Eagan that Saturday to see what was going on. Some listeners thought the DJ's were being held hostage and reportedly, more than 50 calls regarding KRXX were logged to 911. Finally, on Sunday, February 6, at 8 p.m., 93.7 began simulcasting KQRS' weekly alternative rock show, \\"Over the Edge\\", leading the way for \\"93.7 The Edge\\", which billed itself as \\"Minnesota's New Music Alternative\\". In a massively popular stunt to secure 93X listeners, the first song played after the switch was \\"It's the End of the World as We Know It\\" by R.E.M..http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-02-11.pdf The new KEGE-FM call letters were soon registered for the new station. The move to create The Edge was due to the growing popularity of modern rock format nationwide, and to thwart Cargill Communications pending plans to roll out the format on the new Rev 105. The Edge came on the air almost two years after KJJO switched to country music, and it did what KJ104 couldn't - it became a massive ratings success. At one point, KEGE had the highest overall Arbitron market ratings of any modern rock station in the country. A station-sponsored annual concert known as the EdgeFest (later 93XFest) debuted soon after, and took place annually in Somerset, Wisconsin. It was so popular that even rival Rev 105 gave away tickets for it (though not mentioning the \\"Edgefest\\" name). When KEGE went back to being 93X and the \\"Edge\\" name was retired in the Twin Cities, the festival briefly continued as \\"Edgefest\\" and was later renamed 93XFest. The annual festival in Somerset continued until 2004, when \\"93X Riverfest\\" replaced it. =1997-Present: The return of 93X= Following the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that relaxed ownership restrictions, ABC purchased KEGE's rival, \\"Rev 105\\" in March 1997 and immediately began broadcasting hard rock on that station as \\"X105\\". Later that year, on September 18, at 2 p.m., the two stations did a format swap of sorts, with 93.7 returning to active rock and the 93X moniker with new call letters KXXR, while The Edge's format moved over to the 105 frequencies and rebranded as \\"Zone 105\\" (though it would be tweaked to AAA) on September 24 after six days of simulcasting 93X on all four frequencies. On the final day of broadcasting, The Edge played \\"It's the End of the World as We Know It\\" by R.E.M. on a continuous loop. ABC sold its non-Radio Disney and ESPN Radio stations, including KXXR, to Citadel Broadcasting in 2007. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. KXXR HD2 In 2007 the station added an HD signal for its main programming. It also offered an HD2 channel featuring a CHR/Top 40 format branded as \\"The Machine\\" which aired for several years until the station ceased HD operations at December 31, 2014 at midnight.

It was released 2004-12-06. Jason is now supporting the game through his website titaniumspork.org. where he is working on a 2nd edition revision and a 1st edition PDF can be downloaded for free. The game is set in a sci-fi universe where the theory of multiple universes was proven to be true. Proving it set off wars across the √Ütherverse by opening up new avenues of conquest. √Ütherverse distinguishes itself from other wargames in that the system does not merely provide pre-set army lists, but also includes rules that allow players to create their own armies from scratch. Because of this flexibility of the rule system √Ütherverse has no official models, instead encouraging the players to use models from other systems or ones that they have custom-built. The game has been nominated for a 2004 Origins Award in the \\"Best Miniature Wargame or Expansion\\" category (awarded at the 2005 Origins gaming convention). The Game Itself The game is based around the idea that, human nature being what it is, the ability for alternate worlds to contact each other would inevitably lead to conflict. As an example, what would be the reaction of a world where pagan Rome was still the global superpower be to a world which was ruled by the Catholic Church? With √Ütherverse you can play out such battles. The system is based around constructing your own army, one custom tailored to suit the players tastes, in terms of play style, miniatures used, and background data. Almost any force can be represented. This design process breaks down to representing your army into six distinct stats, and a number of 'attributes' representing special skills or talents. Based on these chosen abilities, your army can be equipped with various armor and weapons, along with vehicles for support. They then go and fight with someone else's army. A typical (3,000 point) army will consist of about 30 troops, with possible aerial, artillery, orbital, or vehicle support. However, armies can range in size from 3 to 300 models, so the scale of a game is often quite dependent on the army design choices of the players involved. Ten sided dice are used as a randomizing element. Upheaval A smaller-scale version of √Ütherverse, entitled √Ütherverse: Upheaval, was created and put onto the Internet as a pay-per-download PDF file. Gameplay in Upheaval was similar to that of its predecessor, although it included a higher level of detail, which in turn led to a lower model count. A normal Upheaval army might only consist of two or three units rather than the seven to ten that were common in \\"standard\\" √Ütherverse play.

She began performing shortly after she graduated; she also recorded for several local record labels. Her first album, \\"All at once...\\" (Kanaka KM-1002), was produced by island record industry veteran George J.D. Chun. At that time she was billed as Carol Kai. Career In the late 1970s, when she was already well known as a Hawaii showroom headliner, her manager, Yemun Chung, paired her with a young island show band he was also managing, The Fabulous Krush (later known simply as \\"The Krush\\"). Kai was not a member of the group; they performed as her backing band as well as doing their own shows. In the late 1990s, following the national success of shows featuring two or more \\"divas\\", she joined three other local singers with showroom experience ‚Äî Loyal Garner, Melveen Leed, and Nohelani \\"Baby Diva\\" Cypriano ‚Äî to form a new show group named The Local Divas. The group made several recordings but broke up after Garner's death several years later. Kai was also the co-host, with Kimo Kahoano, of a televised karaoke contest, Hawaii Stars, that was the most popular locally produced show of its kind in Hawaii. Philanthropy Kai was the organizer and namesake of the first bed race in Hawaii, the Carole Kai Bed Race (later the Honolulu International Bed Race). It became an annual event benefiting the Variety Schools, a local school for children with special needs. Later, in 1985, after ending her affiliation with the bed race, she partnered with local cardiologist Jack Scaff to organize a road race between Aloha Tower in downtown Honolulu and Aloha Stadium.

By contrast, a ranged weapon is any other weapon capable of engaging targets at a distance beyond immediate physical contact. Etymology The term melee originates in the 1640s from the French word ', which refers to disorganized hand-to-hand combat, a close- quarters battle, a brawl, or a confused fight; especially involving many combatants.Oxford English Dictionary. 2015. m√™l√©e. \\"A battle or engagement at close quarters, a skirmish; a confused struggle or scuffle, esp. one involving many people. Also hist.: a tournament involving two groups of combatants.\\" The 1812 tabletop war game, Kriegsspiel referred to the hand-combat stage of the game as a melee. Later war games would follow this pattern. From there, gamers would eventually begin to call the weapons used in that stage melee weapons.  Categories  Melee weapons can be broadly divided into three categories : * Pointed weapons, which cover spears, pikes and almost all pole weapons. They typically have a sharp point designed to inflict penetrating trauma, even against heavily armoured opponents, and the length of such weapons gives a range advantage. Certain variants may also hook at enemies to disrupt and disarm them, or pull them from atop horses. * Edged weapons, which cover swords, axes, fighting knives and daggers. These weapons are designed to cause cutting, dismemberment and exsanguination injuries, and are most effective against minimally armoured opponents. These are used to cut, hack, slash, thrust or stab. * Blunt weapons, which cover clubs, maces, war hammers, staves, and flails. These weapons are designed to cause blunt trauma, even through armour that would protect against penetration by pointed or edged weapons. Many weapons fit into multiple categories, or fit in between them; many polearms such as halberds, lucerne hammers and add edged and blunt methods of attack to a spear base, and various hooked weapons such as billhooks, , falxes and evade easy classification; while flexible weapons such as whips don't fall into any of these categories.

Description It is 10.2 cm long and weighs 7.2g. The longish black bill is slightly decurved. The tail in both sexes has dark central feathers, the outer tail being wine-red tipped with black. The male has glossy bright green upperparts. His throat and chest are matt black, bordered with blue-green. The flanks are bright green, and the black of the chest tapers onto the belly. The female black-throated mango has bronze-green upperparts and white underparts with a black central stripe. Immature birds show some grey or buff feather tips on the head and wings, and have brown around the eyes. The call of the black-throated mango is a high-pitched tsiuck, and the song is a buzzing hsl-hsl-hsl-hsl-hsl-hsl-hsl. This species is very similar to the closely related green-breasted mango. Although the male black-throated mango has more extensive black on the underparts, this and other plumage differences are not always easy to confirm in the field because the birds appear all-black. The females of the two species can be almost inseparable, although the black-throated lacks the more extensively coppery upperpart of its relative. Distribution and ecology It breeds from Panama south to northeastern Bolivia, southern Brazil and northern Argentina. It is also common on both Trinidad and Tobago. It is a local or seasonal migrant, with some birds moving up to 1000 miles, although its movements are not well understood. This small bird inhabits open country, gardens and cultivation. Though it will adapt to human activity, it seems less of a generalist than for example the gilded sapphire (Hylocharis chrysura) or the sapphire-spangled emerald (Amazilia lactea).Baza Mendon√ßa & dos Anjos (2005) The food of this species is nectar, often taken from the flowers of large trees. This hummingbird is also notably insectivorous, often hovering in open areas to catch flying insects. It appears to be somewhat picky regarding favorite foodplants and often does not visit ornamental plants popular with many other hummingbirds, such as Erythrina speciosa or Stifftia chrysantha; certain ornamental Bignoniaceae like the fountain tree (Spathodea campanulata) seem more to this bird's liking. While feeding, it has been observed to dominate over a glittering-bellied emerald (Chlorostilbon lucidus) and to be displaced by a gilded hummingbird, both considerably smaller species. The black-throated mango's breeding season lasts almost year-round in most of its range. It builds a tiny cup nest on a high, thin, and usually bare branch.E.g. of Macrolobium sp. (Greeney & Merino M. 2006) For this it uses fluff like seed down, cladding the outside with lichen. Nests are maybe 35‚Äì40 mm wide and 25‚Äì30 mm tall on the outside and some 25 mm wide and 10‚Äì15 mm deep inside. The two all-white eggs measure c.15 by 9.5 mm. They are incubated by the female for 16 or 17 days, and fledging takes another 24.Greeney & Merino M. (2006) At a black-throated mango nest in Cuyabeno Faunistic Reserve, Ecuador, it was noted that the tree was beset with Pseudomyrmex stinging ants. This was also noted at a green-breasted mango nest on San Andr√©s Island (Caribbean). It is likely that the ants would deter predators, but it is not known whether the birds deliberately select such trees for nesting.

He must have died between 1537 (when he is still mentioned on record) and 1542 (when his widow is mentioned). He probably started working in Krak√≥w (from the connections of this city with L≈ëcse at that time and from similarity of styles he could be a student of Veit Stoss), Sabinov (), Bansk√° Bystrica () until he settled in L≈ëcse around 1500 and married a daughter of an influential citizen. In 1506 he established a carving workshop. A list of some of his works includes an altar of St. Barbara in Bansk√° Bystrica from 1509, an altar of St. George in Spi≈°sk√° Sobota (; today a part of Poprad) from 1516, and his most famous work, completed in 1517, an altar in the Basilica of St. James in L≈ëcse. This late Gothic altar is the highest in Europe, with 18.62 meters of height. It is carved in wood and decorated with gold. The Madonna from this altar was also depicted in the former issue of 100 SKK banknotes (before Slovakia's adoption of the Euro on 1 January 2009). In 1527 he became a member of the L≈ëcse town council, but he became famous only after his death. Even art historians started to mention his name only in the 1870s in discussions about the creator of the altar in L≈ëcse.  References  * Hleb, E.: Levo in history, history in Levoƒçi.

Spanning approximately along a south‚Äìnorth axis, it is a continuation of Route 146 in Rhode Island, which splits from I-95 in Providence. The southern terminus within Massachusetts exists in Millville, where the expressway enters the state from North Smithfield, Rhode Island. Among several local roads, Route 146 intersects with the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90) in Millbury and I-290 in Worcester before arriving at its northern terminus at the intersection of several surface streets in downtown Worcester. Most of the route is a freeway, except for a short section near the boundary between Millbury and Sutton where there is driveway access and at-grade crossings. History During the late 1940s, the then-Massachusetts Department of Public Works (MassDPW, now MassDOT) planned an extension of Route 146 from Rhode Island north toward Worcester. MA 146 was built between 1949 and 1952 as a four-lane divided roadway from US 20 in Millbury to Boston Road in Sutton, and from Sutton south to the Massachusetts-Rhode Island border, Route 146 was built as a three-lane undivided roadway, providing one lane in each direction and a shared lane in the center. In 1981, the MassDPW began work on rebuilding Route 146. During the next three years, the state rebuilt the section from just south of Boston Road in Sutton to the Massachusetts-Rhode Island border, replacing the three- lane undivided section with a four-lane freeway and eliminating all at-grade intersections and curb cuts. The project upgrading the section linking Exit 10A on the Massachusetts Turnpike north into downtown Worcester at Brosnihan Square to Interstate Highway standards was completed in November 2007 according to the State Highway Administration. The improvements to the road created an economic boon to the Blackstone Valley through which it passes. The improved transportation corridor has attracted several large employers since the road was upgraded. As of 2015, there still remains a non-freeway section of 146 in the Sutton-Millbury area, though the road was widened and a major intersection was improved to fix traffic flow problems. Future Exits traditionally were not numbered, but sequential numbers were assigned by MassHighway during the last sign replacement project. All interchanges were to be renumbered to milepost-based numbers under a project scheduled to start in 2016. However, this project was indefinitely postponed until November 18, 2019, the MassDOT confirmed that beginning in late summer 2020 the exit renumbering project will begin. Exit list Suffixed routes =Route 146A= Route 146A in Massachusetts, United States, is a north to south route which connects Route 122 in Uxbridge, and Rhode Island Route 146A in North Smithfield. There are two connector entrances to Route 146, along Route 146A. These are Exit 1, which connects Route 146 directly to Route 146A, and Exit 2, the Chockalog Road exit in Uxbridge. This highway was renamed by the Massachusetts General Court in 2004 as the Lydia Taft Highway, after America's first woman voter, Lydia Chapin Taft, a colonial woman from Uxbridge. Lydia Chapin Taft's historic vote and her role in the history of Women's suffrage is recognized by the Massachusetts legislature since 2004, which named Route 146A from Uxbridge to the Rhode Island border in her honor. Route 146A is completely within the town limits of Uxbridge. In colonial times, this route had the name of \\"the Great Road\\", and later \\"the Quaker Highway\\", after Quakers from Smithfield, Rhode Island, settled here. There are a number of historic sites along this road including the Friends Meetinghouse, which is on the National Historic Register. The Moses Farnum House, and the Ironstone Mill Housing and Cellar Hole are two other sites along this road. Route 98 also connects with Route 146A, near its midpoint, and has significant historic sites of the original Quaker village known as Quaker City, and Aldrich Village, which are also on the National Historic Register. Just beyond the northern terminus of Route 146A and continuing north on Route 122 is a famous historical house known as Elmshade, a home and gathering place of the influential Taft family in America. Part of what is now Route 146A was the original Route 146 before a new limited access highway was constructed from the Rhode Island line to Worcester, between 1981 and 1984. This project involved moving a former almshouse cemetery and led to archeological findings on mortuary practices following that excavation. The Second Great Awakening changed local mortuary practices for the poor. Major intersections References External links *Mass.

Welkom is also known as Circle City, City Within A Garden, Mvela and Matjhabeng. The city's Sotho name, Matjhabeng means 'where nations meet', derived from the migrant labour system, where people of various countries such as Lesotho, Malawi and Mozambique etc. met to work in the mines of the gold fields. A settlement was laid out on a farm named \\"Welkom\\" (which is the Afrikaans and Dutch word for \\"welcome\\") after gold was discovered in the region, and it was officially proclaimed a town in 1948. The town became a municipality in 1961. It now falls in the Matjhabeng Municipality, part of the Lejweleputswa District. Welkom was officially declared a city on 14 February 1968. History Much of the history of Welkom is centred around the discovery of gold in the northwestern Free State. It was proclaimed a town in 1948, nine years after a major gold discovery was made in Odendaalsrus, just north of Welkom. =Early mining activity= Prospecting pit of Arthur Megson circa 1904 The first prospecting in the area was done by the Englishmen Mr Donaldson and Mr Hinds on a portion of the farm Zoeten-Inval in 1896. The men discovered a small outcrop which seemed to be a conglomerate pebble reef, but they failed to raise interest among mining companies who at that stage did not believe that there was gold to be discovered south of the Vaal River. They returned to England to test the samples they had extracted, but died before reaching their destination when their ship sank in the Bay of Biscay. Prospector Arthur Megson heard of their venture and decided to investigate near the town of Odendaalsrus in 1904. He gathered samples of exposed strata near an outcrop, which by then was part of Hendrik Petrus Klopper's farm Aandenk. He too did not succeed in obtaining any interest from companies until October 1932, when he presented his findings to Allan Roberts and Mannie Jacobs. The area needed to be tested by drilling, and the first borehole was started on 5 May 1933. Jacobs managed to interest two men, Fritz Marx and Peter Woolf, in the venture and the Wit Extensions Company was formed later that year. Although the borehole, which by then penetrated more than 1200 metres, yielded 120-inch pennyweights of gold (roughly 480 centimetre grams per ton), it was not enough to garner financial assistance and the operation had to close due to depleted finances. (For gold ores to be payable in South Africa, the grade must typically exceed 960 cengrams ‚Äì the equivalent of 8 grams per ton over a 120 cm stope width, which after dilution will yield 4g/t in the mill). However, the discovery of gold-bearing reef in the Klerksdorp area in 1933 by the Anglo American Corporation encouraged geologists and others with vision to see the northwestern Free State as a potential gold field. Prospecting intensified and the first high values of gold were discovered in 1939. By 1940, sufficient work had been done to prove the existence of gold in the area and thirteen mining areas were later demarcated around what would become the town of Welkom. =Development of the settlement= Welkom Central Business District 1950 Welkom officially came into being on 15 April 1947, six years after the first mining lease in the area was awarded to the St Helena Gold Mining Company, and was proclaimed a town on 23 July 1948. On 14 February 1968, after 21 years of existence, Welkom received city status, and celebrated this event with the opening of the Civic Centre by Mrs Martie du Plessis. The construction of this building commenced in 1964. =Apartheid era= During Apartheid in the years of segregation, the townships of Thabong and Bronville were established for black and Coloured people, respectively. On 8 December 1976, Welkom experienced an earthquake measuring 5.2 on the Richter magnitude scale. The most significant damage caused was the total collapse of a six-storey block of flats about 75 minutes after the event. Widespread damage to many other buildings was experienced throughout the city. Despite extensive damage to surface and underground mining structures, only four deaths occurred.South African History Online During the decline of the Apartheid era, race relations were particularly problematic as many White South Africans felt threatened by the eventuality of a regime change. This was the main cause of the events that transpired on 13 May 1989, when the mayor, a Mr Gus Gouws, was tarred and feathered after officiating at a multiracial wheelchair marathon event. The National Party mayor ran foul of his White constituency when he proposed the opening of a taxi rank in the business district of Welkom. Aggrieved residents of the city then sought to humiliate him to dissuade him from authorising the erection of the facility, by assaulting him and a security guard, while he was officiating at the event. Four men were arrested and charged with the assault.Mayor of Welkom, in the Free State, is tarred and feathered  South African History Online =Recent history= On 20 March 1990, Welkom was struck by a multi- vortex tornado which scoured through the suburbs. This tornado was part of a 240 km long storm front and had a width of up to 1.7 km. This weather event proved to be the most devastating recorded (financially/insurance) in South Africa to date, destroying 4000 homes.Vista NewsGoliger A.M. Retief J.V.

The mining company Pamodzi Gold applied for bankruptcy in 2009 even though it was sitting atop one of the richest and consistently-producing gold veins in the world. The gold mine, President Steyn, was previously owned by the Thistle Mining Co., up until February 2008, and reported a total sale of 487,069 troy ounces of gold from 2004 to 2006. On 29 October 2007, Thistle Gold Mining entered into a 'Sale of Shares and Claims Agreement' under the South African government's black economic empowerment laws, under which Thistle's direct and indirect interests were sold to Pamodzi Gold for $14-million. In 2010, Harmony Gold subsequently acquired President Steyn from the now liquidated Pamodzi Gold and resumed operations. Geography =Topography= Koppie Alleen Koppie Alleen is the only hill near Welkom and therefore is aptly named for its odditity. The terrain elevation above sea level is 1435 metres. The largest water catchment is the Sand River to the south-east of Welkom in Virginia's direction. Large saline pans such as Flamingo Pan and Theronia Pan are situated to the south-west of Welkom. Flamingo Pan is coded as an Important Bird Area (IBA)CWAC  Registered CWAC sites listing =Communities= * Rheederpark * West bedelia * Welkom ext * Jim Fouche Park * Alma * Flamingo Park * Seemeeu Park * Dagbreek * Reitzpark * Stateway * Doorn * Welkom Central * Jan Cilliers Park * Naudeville * St Helena * Bedelia * Lake View South * Lake View North * Orangia * Welkom North * Riebeeckstad * Sandania * Bronville * Thabong =Streetscape= Welkom is well known for its efficient road traffic design mainly through the use of traffic circles, which has been the basis of worldwide studies. This is encouraged by flow design, the minimum of stop streets and the total absence of traffic lights and parking meters in the Central Business District. There are currently 33 large traffic circles. =Monuments and public art= Welkom has several monuments including: * Aandenk Monument ‚Äì This borehole memorial is shaped in the form of a key and symbolises the unlocking of the Free State goldfields.(next to Allanridge) * Afrikaans Language Monument * Joanne Pim Monument * WWII Monument * Voortrekker Memorial * Dog Monument * Old Indaba Bluegum Tree * MOTH Memorial * Gold Museum ‚Äì A complete history of gold and its mining and production was on display. St Helena Gold Mine is not a working mine any more. Until a few years ago It was still possible to visit the mine and its wine cellar at 857m below surface but it does not exist any more. * Museum of Welkom ‚Äì The public library houses a display of the discovery of gold in Welkom, the town's history and bird and animal life indigenous to this region. * Local Apartheid Memorial ‚Äì commemorating local citizen's contribution to the Struggle in the Apartheid years. =Climate= Welkom normally receives about 401 mm to 550 mm of rain per year, dependent on wet or dry cycles, with most rainfall occurring mainly during mid-summer. It receives the lowest rainfall (0 mm) in July and the highest (70 mm) in January. The monthly distribution of average daily maximum temperatures ranges from 17 ¬∞C in June to 29 ¬∞C in January. The region is the coldest during July when the mercury drops to 0 ¬∞C on average during the night. =Flora and fauna= Flamingos over Lakeview Welkom is situated on two vegetation units, the Western Free State Clay Grassland and Vaal-Vet Sandy Grassland, these are differentiated by soil types, rainfall and frost.Low, A.B. & Rebelo, A.G. (eds.) 1996. Vegetation of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland . Pretoria: DEAT. This publication is available online at http://www.ngo.grida.no/soesa/nsoer/Data/vegrsa/vegstart.htm The dominant grass species are Hyparrhenia hirta, Themeda triandra, Sporobolus pyramidalis, Eragrostis sp, Aristida sp, and other grasses and herbs. Trees and shrubs are infrequent due to heavy frost in the winter months. The grasslands surrounding Welkom also include small mammal communities of yellow mongoose, ground squirrel, Cape porcupine, African mole-rat, pouched mouse, large-eared mouse, four-stripe grass mouse, and multimammate mouse. The De Rust Private Nature ReserveDe Rust Private Nature Reserve Homepage is situated about 25 km from Welkom on the Kroonstad road and is registered with the Free State Department of Nature Conservation. =Local geology: gold-bearing reefs= Welkom is located on the south-western corner of the Witwatersrand Basin. This basin situated on the Kaapvaal Craton,James, D.E. Niu, F. Rokosky, J. Crustal structure of the Kaapvaal craton and its significance for early crustal evolutiona, Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, Carnegie Institution of Washington, 5241 Department of Earth Science, Rice University, Houston, TX 77251, USA is filled by a 6-kilometre thick succession of sedimentary rocks, which extends laterally for hundreds of kilometres.Phillips G.N.

The geology of the Welkom Goldfields with special reference to the A, B and Beatrix reefs, Rhodes University, 1993 cut by the north‚Äìsouth striking De Bron Fault. This major structure has a vertical displacement of about 1500m as well as a lateral shift of 4 km. A number of other major faults lie parallel to the De Bron Fault. Dips occur mostly towards the east, averaging 30 degrees but this becomes steeper approaching the De Bron Fault. To the east of the fault, a dip occurs towards the west at 20 degrees, although structurally complex dips of up to 40 degrees have also been measured. Between these two blocks, lies the uplifted horst block of the West Rand Group of sediments with no reef preserved.Mineral resources and mineral reserves 2013  Free State operations The western margin area is bound by synclines and reverse thrusts faults and is structurally complex. Towards the south and east, reefs sub-crop against overlying strata, eventually cutting out against the Karoo to the east of the area. Most of the ore resource tends to be concentrated in reef bands located on one or two distinct unconformities. Mining has taken place as mostly deep-level underground, exploiting the narrow, generally shallow dipping tabular reefs. Harmony Gold Mine shaft on R30 Basal Reef The Basal Reef, is the most common reef horizon. It varies from a single pebble lag to channels of more than 2m thick. It is commonly overlain by shale, which thickens northwards. Leader Reef The second major reef is the Leader Reef, located 15-20m above the Basal Reef. This is mostly mined at shafts to the south. Further north, it becomes poorly developed with erratic grades. The reef consists of multiple conglomerate units, separated by thin quartzitic zones, often totalling up to 4 metres thick. A selected mining cut on the most economic horizon is often undertaken. The B Reef is a highly channelised ore-body located 140m stratigraphically above the Basal Reef. Within the channels, grades are excellent, but this falls away to nothing, outside of the channels. The A Reef is also a highly channelised reef, located some 40m above the B Reef. It consists of multiple conglomerate bands of up to 4m thick and a selected mining cut is usually required to optimise the ore-body. Fossils of Matjhabeng A 2007 palaeontological study done in greater Matjhabeng began a programme of excavation of an early Pliocene locality. With an estimated age of 4.0‚Äì3.5 Ma, the locality also represents the only well- documented, river-deposited Pliocene locality in the central interior of southern Africa. After three years of excavation, a diverse fauna that includes fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals was recovered. Mammals ranged in size from rodents to mammoths, including an array of proboscideans, perissodactyls and artiodactyls, alongside rare carnivores. In total, 29 taxa, including the oldest Ancylotherium and Megalotragus fossils in southern Africa were recovered. Some of the taxa from Matjhabeng are shared with Langebaanweg, and others with Makapansgat, confirming the intermediate status of this locality. Isotopic analysis revealed the earliest indication of extensive grasslands in South Africa, though these grasslands were part of an environmental mosaic that included significant woodland, and probable wetland, components.D.J.; Brophy, J.K.; Lewis, P.J.; Kennedy, A.M.; Stidham, T.A.; Carlson, K.B.; Hancox, P. John, 2010: Preliminary investigation of Matjhabeng, a Pliocene fossil locality in the Free State of South Africa. Palaeontologia Africana 45 Demographics According to the 2011 census, Welkom proper had a population of 64,130 people in an area of , a population density of . 60.7% of the inhabitants described themselves as \\"Black African\\", 26.9% as \\"White\\", 11.1% as \\"Coloured\\" and 0.9% as \\"Indian or Asian\\". Economy =Mining= Gold and uranium Harmony Phakisa shaft Welkom's economy centres on the mining of gold and uranium and is the hub of the Free State Goldfields. Welkom has contributed 21% to the free world's gold sales. The city and immediate surroundings are dominated by the headgears and reduction plants of several gold and uranium mining companies, including St Helena, Unisel, Welkom, Western Holdings, Free State Geduld, President Brand, President Steyn, Erfdeel Dankbaarheid, Phakisa,Harmony  Home and Tshepong. =Recent discoveries= In Sept 2016 Harmony Gold and its partner White Rivers Exploration declared a as to then unknown gold ore body near the current Target shaft. This resource is estimated to have a mine life of about 30 years. http://www.miningreview.com/news/white-rivers-exploration-defines- massive-gold-resource-harmony Coal Welkom also has significant coal reserves. The Theunissen coal field is located in the districts of Theunissen and Bultfontein, only some 12 km to the south of Welkom. The section of the reserve able to be mined covers an area of more than 23,500 hectares.McCarthy, T. S. Pretorius, J. P. Coal mining on the Highveld and its implications for future water quality in the Vaal River system, School of Geosciences, University of the Witwatersrand Diamonds Located about 7.5 km from Welkom, a kimberlite pipe, was discovered in 1890 and mined from a single shaft until the start of the Boer War in 1899. Mining continued after the war until a major aquifer, which was encountered at a depth of 259m, forced the mine to close. It was eventually re-opened by Samada Diamonds Pty Ltd and closed again in the early 1990s. Petra Diamonds operated the Star mine, a fissure 40 km south of Welkom. The Star mine was renowned for its consistent production of high value diamonds. In 2013, Petra commenced a disposal process of its Fissure Mines portfolio. This process did not result in any acceptable offers for the mines and Star was subsequently placed into care and maintenance. Other minerals Other minerals found in the Welkom vicinity include calcite, iridium, isoferroplatinum, muscovite, pyrophylite, rutile and uranite. =Industry= Due to the declining gold price in the nineties, the manufacturing industry was promoted as a further means to support the local economy. Heavy machinery support for mining can be found in the Voorspoed area. Various other maintenance industries and services are well founded in Welkom which include engineering, and mechanical repairs.Maize production near the R34 leading into WelkomWelkom produces goods such as steel, lumber, dairy products, and beef.http://matjhabengpublicity.co.za/ The city also hosts several major industries such as Coca-Cola and South African Breweries. =Agriculture= The high water table in the north-western part of the district makes it very suitable for maize production and should remain an important maize producing area. The district is mostly covered by non-arable, moderate potential grazing land as well as marginal potential arable land.http://www.ard.fs.gov.za/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LEJWELEPUTSWA- PROFILE.pdf The Welkom region forms part of the Maize Triangle, which stretches over three of South Africa's provinces.

Biography Lengyel was born Lebovics Menyh√©rt in Balmaz√∫jv√°ros, Hungary. He started his career as a journalist.Lengyel, Menyh√©rt: √âletem k√∂nyve (Book of My Life) (Published by J√≥zsef Vink√≥). Gondolat, Budapest, 1987 He worked first in Kassa (Ko≈°ice), then later in Budapest. His first play, A nagy fejedelem (The Great Prince) was performed by the Thalia Company in 1907. The Hungarian National Theatre performed his next drama A h√°l√°s ut√≥kor (The Grateful Posterity) in 1908 for which he received the Vojnits Award from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, given every year for the best play. Taifun (Typhoon), one of his plays, written in 1909, became a worldwide success and is still performed today. It was adapted to the screen in the United States in 1914. His articles were often published in Nyugat (West), the most important Hungarian literary journal in the first half of the 20th century. During World War I, he was sent to Switzerland by the Hungarian daily newspaper Az Est (The Evening) as a reporter. His pacifist articles and other publications written in 1918 were also published in German and French papers and were collected in a book called Egyszer≈± gondolatok (Simple Thoughts). His story \\"The Miraculous Mandarin\\" (in Hungarian: A csod√°latos mandarin), a ‚Äúpantomime grotesque‚Äù came out in 1916. It is the story which inspired B√©la Bart√≥k, the famous Hungarian composer, to create in 1924 the ballet The Miraculous Mandarin. After World War I, Lengyel went to the United States for a longer stay and published his experiences in 1922 in a book Amerikai napl√≥ (American Journal). In the 1920s, he was active in the film industry. For some time, he was story editor at May-Film in Berlin. In 1929/30, he was co-director of a Budapest theatre. In 1931, he was sent by the Hungarian newspaper Pesti Napl√≥ (Pest Journal) to London as its reporter. The story of his Utopian novel A boldog v√°ros (The Happy City) came out in 1931; it was set in an American city that lay in the depths of a chasm created by the great Californian earthquake. He moved to Hollywood, California in 1937 and became a screenwriter. Several of his stories were the basis of screenplays for films by Ernst Lubitsch which became worldwide successes, such as Ninotchka (1939), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Writing, Original Story; To Be or Not to Be (1942), and the 1937 film Angel, starring Marlene Dietrich. Lengyel returned to Europe in 1960 and settled down in Italy. In 1963, he received the Great Award of Rome for his literary works. After the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Lengyel often visited his home country and returned to live in Budapest in 1974. He died there shortly afterwards at the age of 94. The city library of Balmaz√∫jv√°ros, his native town, was named after him in 2004.

The same story introduced Barker's occult detective hero Harry D'Amour, who later appeared in several prose stories and comic books. Lord of Illusions is D'Amour's first onscreen appearance, with the character portrayed by actor Scott Bakula. Other actors appearing in the film include Kevin J. O'Connor, Famke Janssen and Daniel von Bargen. The story features D'Amour, who has had several experiences with the supernatural, embarking on an investigation involving a stage illusionist named Swann and a cult led by a sorcerer named Nix. Although Clive Barker decided to keep a few story elements and the same principal characters from \\"The Last Illusion,\\" he otherwise presented a new story for the movie and created a new villain, surprising several readers familiar with the original work. The film met with mixed reception and no further live-action movies featuring Harry D'Amour were made afterward. Plot In the Mojave Desert in 1982, a man named Wililam Nix, also calling himself \\"The Puritan,\\" has gathered a cult of disciples in an old, isolated house. Nix wields real magic and plans to sacrifice the girl, telling his followers he will save the world and grant them wisdom. A group of former cult members, including Philip Swann and Caspar Quaid, arrive to stop him. After a confrontation between the group and the loyal cultists, Nix's assistant, Butterfield, escapes. Swann is attacked magically by Nix but the kidnapped girl shoots Nix through the heart with Swann's gun. Swann fastens an ironwork mask over Nix's head in order to \\"bind\\" him and his power. Nix appears to die and Swann declares they will bury him so deep that no one will ever find him. Thirteen years later, Harry D'Amour is a private detective in New York City with an interest in the occult who has had several experiences with supernatural forces. A recent experience in Brooklyn involving an exorcism, a case which got media attention, has shaken D'Amour and he decides to accept a new case of insurance fraud in Los Angeles, hoping the experience will be akin to a paid vacation. During his investigation, D'Amour happens upon Quaid, now working as a fortune teller, being viciously attacked by Butterfield and Ray Miller, man possessing great strength. Butterfield and his ally escape. As he dies from multiple stab wounds, Quaid reads D'Amour's palm, seeing that it is his destiny is to \\"walk the line between Heaven and Hell.\\" He warns him that the Puritan is coming, then dies. Swann, now a famous stage illusionist, lives in a Beverly Hills mansion with his wife, Dorothea. After learning Nix's followers have murdered Quaid, Dorothea suggests they hire D'Amour to investigate the murder, having read in the newspaper that the private detective was the one who found Quaid. She tells D'Amour that she fears for her husband, whom she did not marry for love but cares for regardless. He agrees and she invites him to Swann's next magic show. Swann performs a new death-defying illusion which goes wrong, and he is killed on stage, stabbed by multiple swords. Investigating backstage, D'Amour is attacked by Butterfield and Miller. Defending himself, he inadvertently kills Miller, but Butterfield escapes again. D'Amour goes to the Magic Castle, where he hears Nix described as a legend who may have taught his secrets to Swann. After getting into the Repository, a special room in the Magic Castle supposedly containing every magic secret known to man, D'Amour discovers that Swann's \\"illusions\\" involved real magic he learned from Nix. Later, Dorothea reveals to Harry she was the girl that Nix kidnapped years ago and married Swann because of a sense of obligation. Dorothea and D'Amour make love; afterwards, D'Amour is attacked by a man engulfed in fire. Suspecting a ruse, D'Amour opens Swann's coffin and finds that the body is fake. Valentin, Swann's assistant, explains that he helped Swann fake his death so Butterfield and Nix's other disciples wouldn't harm him or Dorothea. D'Amour agrees to allow the ruse to continue. At the funeral, D'Amour follows a suspicious looking man who turns out to be Swann. In jealousy, the magician attacks D'Amour but the detective convinces him to focus on putting an end to Nix's cult instead of hiding from them. Swann admits he decided to masquerade as an illusionist so he would become wealthy rather than hunted as a sorcerer. Butterfield tortures Valentin for the location of Nix's body, then kidnaps Dorothea, using her as a hostage. After finding Nix's corpse, Butterfield stabs Valentin and takes the corpse back to the cult's old house in the desert. There, his cultists have returned to witness Nix's resurrection and follow him once again. Butterfield removes the iron mask and Nix, now decayed and monstrous in appearance, regains consciousness and promises to share his knowledge and power. Swann and D'Amour, acting on information given by the dying Valentin, arrive. Nix opens a deep chasm in the ground. He then turns the earth into quick sand that swallows the cultists, ignoring their pleas for help and declaring only Swann is worthy of receiving his knowledge. D'Amour finds Nix and Dorothea. Nix drops her into the chasm, leaving D'Amour to rescue her as Swann enters the room. Nix admits he should have been honest with Swann regarding his true intention \\"to murder the world.\\" He asks Swann to join him again, reminding the man he no longer has friends or a lover, and embraces him. D'Amour and Dorothea flee but are attacked by Butterfield, whom D'Amour kills. Swann agrees to remain with Nix, but then admits he still cares for Dorthea. In jealousy, Nix attacks with magic, apparently killing Swann. Dorothea finds D'Amour's gun and shoots Nix in his mystical third eye. The man survives and retaliates, saying she should not have taken Swann away from him because he and Nix were meant to be together after humanity was destroyed. Dorothea asks what Nix is, and the Puritan remorsefully says he is a man who had wanted to be a god and changed his mind. Swann reveals he still lives and uses his last life energy and magic to help D'Amour deliver a final blow to Nix. Nix falls into seemingly bottomless chasm. Dorothea holds Swann in her arms as he succumbs to his injuries. D'Amour sees Nix, hideously injured but alive, summoning a whirlwind that seals the chasm. Soon after, Dorothea and D'Amour escape the house and walk off into the desert together. Cast * Scott Bakula as Harry D'Amour * Kevin J.

He is then asked to guard the body of dead illusionist Swann by the man's wife Dorothea, leading him into a confrontation with more demons, including the story's antagonist Butterfield. The story was a mix of detective noir and horror and Barker wrote another D'Amour short story called \\"Lost Souls\\" soon afterward in a 1987 anthology called Cutting Edge. Harry then appears briefly in Barker's 1989 novel The Great and Secret Show, the first book of the \\"Book of the Art\\" trilogy. He returned as a major character in the 1994 novel Everville,https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/clive- barker/everville/ the second installment of the \\"Book of the Art\\" trilogy, a year before Lord of Illusions hit theaters, introducing D'Amour to a wider audience. Clive Barker had directed and written two previous film adaptations of his own work, Hellraiser (1987) and Nightbreed (1990), and had served as screenwriter and executive producer on Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1988). Lord of Illusions was the third film he wrote and directed. According to an interview with Fangoria in 1992, Barker started the first draft of the screenplay in 1991, at which time the movie shared its title with the original short story \\"The Last Illusion.\\" In an interview with Bloody Best of Fangoria in 1993, Barker said, \\"I've always loved illusionists. There's always a dark side, and illusionists present them to you. It's very much life-and-death illusion - you sawed the woman in half, but she's still alive. They're presented as breezy , funny, entertaining pieces - but, subtextually, they're stories of death and resurrection. I love stories that deal with those things, and The Last Illusion is a movie about just that. It's also about magic... and it's about monsters.\\" Regarding how to translate D'Amour's character and the original short story, Barker said in an interview with Fangoria (#138, 1994), \\"The Last Illusion was almost a Philip Marlowe type of thing, but this movie isn't a homage to '40's noir. This isn't going to be about Venetian blinds and ashtrays with a cigarette left burning with lipstick on it. We're really just focusing on this everyman who is drawn into the heart of darkness over and over again because of some karmic thing which he has no power over.\\" In the liner notes for the director's cut of Lord of Illusions, Barker said, \\"I've travelled a long way with Harry D'Amour. He first appeared in a story I wrote almost a decade ago now, 'The Last Illusion.' Since then, I've recounted his life and troubled times in two novels and some short fiction. I've not made the road very easy for him. His destiny, it seems, is to be in constant struggle with what might be loosely called 'the forces of darkness', though he claims he'd be quite content investigating insurance fraud. His reluctance is, I trust, part of his charm. He's not a Van Helsing, defiantly facing off against some implacable evil with faith and holy water. His antecedents are the troubled, weary and often lovelorn heroes of film noir - private detectives with an eye for a beautiful widow and an aversion to razors. It therefore seems perfectly appropriate that Harry finds his way onto the cinema screen, where his world can intersect with that of the grand guignol horror movies I've had the pleasure to create hitherto.\\" Clive Barker claimed he picked Famke Jannsen based purely on her photograph and that he considered Scott Bakula to be the perfect casting for D'Amour in both appearance and manner. On the documentary \\"The Making of Lord of Illusions\\" included on the director cut's laser disc release, Barker said, \\"He's the Harry I've had in my head for 8 years - no word of a lie. When he stepped on set in costume for the first time, which happened to be into his apartment, the set for his apartment, I thought, 'This is wonderful - this is the man I've been writing about for 8 years,' and that's a real thrill to see an actor so beautifully embody somebody that you've been writing about for such a long time - it's a real thrill. I have to say, they used to say that thing on posters: 'So and so is so and so.' Well, Scott Bakula is Harry D'Amour, and it really sends a shiver down an author's back.\\" In the same documentary, Bakula said, \\"It helped tremendously to have the writer saying, 'You're the guy, you're perfect for Harry.' Still I had to come up with my own interpretation of Harry - who he was - and bring this 40s film noir detective into the 90s and make him seem fresh and new and relevant to these situations that only Clive could put him in.\\" In the original short, Butterfield is a demon in human disguise and the main antagonist. In the film adaptation, Butterfield was made into a human acolyte of the new villain Nix, a cult leader who becomes a vessel for demonic power. In an interview with Cinescape in 1995, Barker explained, \\"Nix is a villain I think we can relate to; he's not unlike Charlie Manson. Halfway through shooting this picture, somebody came in with a newspaper with a headline about these mass deaths in a cult in Switzerland. I don't think we even yet know quite what happened there. The craziness of Waco, the craziness of Jonestown, the Manson stuff - Nix is the embodiment of the charismatic leader who says, 'Follow me to death,' which is something that's part of our culture. So I thought, supposing we had a villain like that, but instead of this guy just being somebody who can weave words and make promises, he genuinely has a greater power? That, to me, is scary and interesting.\\" Regarding Nix's personality, Barker told SFX (#16, 1996), \\"One of the things I wanted to do with Nix was to make him very uncharismatic. There is nothing appealing about this man and towards the end of the movie, when the temptation would be to go into apocalyptic mode, the movie pulls in exactly the opposite direction. Nix becomes this frail, rather pathetic creature. In one of the final scenes, Dorothea asks the metaphysical question, 'What are you?' And Nix says, 'I'm a man who wanted to be a god and changed his mind.' And I like that. I like the fact that he is just a man. He wanted to be something more but he gave up on this useless endeavor. He's murdered all his acolytes, his devotees, and now he's alone in the dark. I actively went after that, even though it was flying in the face of what the audience expects.\\"  Production  Regarding the filmmaking process, Clive Barker spoke of difficulty regarding the budget and time restraints, as well as dealing with requests and concerns from MGM/UA. In the documentary feature \\"The Making of Lord of Illusions\\", included with the special director's cut laserdisc release in 1996, he said, \\"I wanted to make a movie which was part detective picture, part horror movie. I wanted the horror to be as intense as I could possibly make it - as far as the MPAA would allow me to go. I wanted the detective elements to have reference to the kind of noir movies that I like. One of the things you have in your head when you're writing a script, or I have in my head when I'm writing a script, is some very specific pictures, and only a handful of them, which are by no means enough to spread throughout a movie. I had four or five images in my head which were starting places for scenes: the look of the magic show - Swann's spectacular - which we've staged at the Plantages; the look of Nix's lair; the cultists' house; the look of the Bel- Air mansion where Swann and his wife, Dorothea, reside and actually Harry's apartment - that was a late addition, but that would be another one where I had a clear idea... For all of us it was a question of making the picture in the most rational way possible. That required storyboarding the entire picture - which I'd never done before. The only things I'd storyboarded [in previous films] were special effects sequences... The thing we were going to try and do was pull off a movie that looked like $20 million for half that - and that required organisation down to the last degree, and that also required me to know every morning exactly what we needed. There wasn't going to be time for me to play the indulgent director, there wasn't the money for that. So that meant planning the whole thing from the boards and keeping to the boards more or less, which is pretty much what we did. You write the script and you put it in the hands of your art director and dressers and so on and you talk and you work through possibilities.\\" In the 1996 documentary, Jannsen commented on the challenge of acting against computer animated effects and other things that would only be added in post-production. \\"So that was certainly challenging - seeing an empty wall and imaging something to come out of that, or looking in the sky and supposedly something is unfolding in front of my eyes that I don't know exactly what to imagine... he tried to explain these things to me during shooting. And I kept insisting, 'I want to know more, be more specific, you know, what does it feel like? What does it look like? Whatever you can give me because I'm not in your head, I can't imagine these things.' And, of course, funny enough, by the time I saw all this on film, it was so different than what I'd been imagining at the time. Because I am not in his head and I don't have his imagination. I wish I did, because he has the best imagination of anybody.\\" In 1995, Barker told Cinescape, \\"The biggest logistical challenge was the magic-show accident in which Swann dies. We had this huge stage set with dancers and 10 swords hanging above him-and he's going to get skewered by eight of them. He's going around and the swords are going around, and the dancers are dancing and there's a thousand people in the audience. We shot it at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood, which was very cool because it's a place with a real history; it's where I first saw Copperfield, in fact. And there we were, staging this magic act which goes horribly, disastrously and bloodily wrong!\\" In an interview with LA Weekly (August 31-September 6, 2001), Barker said, \\"In Lord of Illusions, I got to do all kinds of shit that I wanted to do. The bondage stuff in there, the girl and the ape, all kinds of shit. It's very funny because Frank Mancuso was head of MGM/UA at that time, and he didn't like the movie at all. There was one shot of a dead child on the floor, and he said, 'This shot will never appear in an MGM/UA movie.' As it turns out, it did, because I took it out and then, when he wasn't looking, I put it back in. I knew he'd never bother to see the film again.\\" Regarding the first audience test screening, Barker told Fangoria (#146, 1995), \\"By and large, they didn't like the explicitness of the sex. It surprised the Hell out me. I don't know why, from the bottom of my heart, I don't know. I think horror fans are used to sex scenes being a prelude to death. They're used to sex scenes being about murder and this one wasn't. If one of the characters got out of bed and got a spear through the chest, they might have been perfectly content. They felt people talked too much. I think audiences are used to horror movies being 90 minutes and then get the hell out of there and our theatrical version is 104 minutes, so it's still 14 minutes longer than a Nightmare On Elm Street picture. I happen to like movies that spend some time on character... if you take a few dialogue scenes out and pare them down, the acts of violence get closer together and the feel of the movie is more intense. Now suddenly you have this picture that is really going for the jugular and doesn't give you a moment to breathe since, of course, I took out what few moments there were where the audience was allowed to breathe... At the second screening, the numbers doubled. They said it was the scariest movie they'd ever seen. The sex was pulled back, the violence was not. I did not realise how much people would be freaked out by the cultist stuff and the notion of cults. The whole sort of Manson/Koresh thing that goes on in the movie really got under people's skins with an intensity I didn't anticipate and it freaked the hell out of them.\\" Although he regarded the film's production as difficult and was not satisfied with the theatrical cut, Barker later said he appreciated what he was able to accomplish and learn during the filming process and how to use imagery and symbolism in the storytelling. In 1995, he told The Dark Side (#45), \\"Lord Of Illusions uniquely parallels something that's going on in my own art all the time... There's a little exchange in Lord Of Illusions in which Valentin is making the distinction between magic and illusions. He and Harry are driving and Valentin says, 'Illusions are trickery,' and produces a flower out of his hand. Then he scrunches the flower up and shows his bare hand, saying 'Magicians do it for real.' There's a beat and then Harry leans across and says, 'Where did the flower go?' And in that line (which, by the way, was an ad-lib by Mr. Bakula) is the voice of the audience - 'Where did the flower go? I know it's a trick, I know it's not real magic, but where did the flower go?' - I wanted to lay into the texture of Swann's illusions, images which somehow or other recurred elsewhere in the narrative. So we have sand, obviously, because of all that desert stuff. We have a sarcophagus, which speaks for itself. We have skeletons, we have fire, we have the demon statue... In other words, there on the stage are images which in some way or other refer to other elements of the movie. I don't necessarily expect the audience to pick up on that, but it was a way for us to make some choices out of the millions of directions which we could probably have gone.\\"  Unrated Director's Cut  On seeing Barker's cut of the film, MGM decided that it was too long and there was too much time spent on dialogue scenes that occur in-between scenes involving death or horror elements. MGM insisted on removing roughly twelve and a half minutes from the film and Barker conceded as long as a director's cut could be released later. This director's cut was initially released on laserdisc, then on DVD and streaming services and was designated unrated, whereas the theatrical release had been rated R by the MPAA. It is also known as the Collector's Edition. In 1996, Barker told Home Cinema Choice, \\"It's not twelve and a half minutes of blood and gore [that was removed], it's actually the thematic guts of the movie. What MGM/UA did, and I'll think they're wrong till the end of my days, was say that this isn't enough of a horror movie, we want to make it more intense. It was a bad commercial decision in my view. They wanted to take out some of the detective elements. I said no. Part of the point of the movie is that is a genre-breaking movie. It moves from film noir to horror and back and forth and that's what makes the movie work. But MGM/UA was adamant. They said, 'We're gonna take this stuff out, either you do it or we do it.' So I said I would take it out, so long as they promised me that a director's cut would come out on video and laser disc... Putting together a special edition laser disc like Lord of Illusions is very time consuming and it does change the way you look at the entire film making process, the outtakes and deletions. When Hellraiser was shot, the biggest task was simply to finish the project. Nine years on, we only now realise how valuable all the outtakes and the supplementary stuff is. Finding out that someone was on set one day with a video camera is incredibly exciting. All those throwaway things become like gold dust. Ironically, Lord of Illusions probably looks better on laser disc than it did theatrically. There are lots of tricks you can do during the film to video transfer.\\" The unrated director's cut includes more visible bloodshed on the helmet screws when Swann binds Nix, and likewise a scene with Butterfield's face burning lasts longer and involves more bloodshed. A kiss D'Amour and Dorothea Swann share is longer in the unrated cut and leads into a sex scene that is largely missing from the R-rated version. Extra scenes are included involving a conversation that occurs when Valentin visits D'Amour at his apartment and they take a car ride together, a dream Harry has involving supernatural creatures, a scene of Harry chatting with Walter Wider at the Magic Castle and learning about Vinovich, a scene where D'Amour speaks to Valentin on the phone before then calling Billy to meet him at the Magic Castle, multiple brief scenes of Nix's followers killing their family and leaving to reunite in their old compound, a dream Dorothea has of Nix's followers just before she wakes and discovers her dead housekeeper and a bleeding Valentin before Butterfield then appears, and a discussion between Swann and D'Amour regarding Nix's power and goal as they ride in a car together.  Critical reception  The film received mixed reviews, with a current approval rating of 60% at Rotten Tomatoes from 25 critics.https://rottentomatoes.com/m/lord_of_illusions Allmovie was critical of the film, writing that it \\"starts off strong with an intriguing premise, but then goes quickly nowhere\\". Roger Ebert gave the movie three out of four stars and complimented its visual effects as well as Bakula's performance.https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lord-of-illusions-1995 Joe Leydon of Variety called it \\"much more conventional effort than Barker‚Äôs earlier outings,\\" while also finding it \\"more sophisticated and satisfying than anything the genre has offered since Wes Craven's New Nightmare.\\" The review found Jannsen's performance \\"believable\\" and praised Bakula, saying, \\"Bakula proves to be an inspired choice to play D‚ÄôAmour. His virile good looks, low-key humor and matter-of-fact authority make him an engaging Everyman, the perfect traveling companion for a journey through Barker‚Äôs nightmare world.\\" Regarding Kevin J. O'Connor, Variety said, \\"O'Connor lacks the requisite brio to be completely convincing as Swann. He seems distracted and unfocused, and fails to convey the dark humor in the central irony that informs the character.\\" Leydon also mentioned, \\"There are a few indications of last-minute editing, suggesting that things may have gotten more exuberantly out of hand in an earlier version.\\" In 2015, Patrick Bromley of DailyDead.com reviewed the film, saying, \\"Though not a mystery in the traditional sense ‚Äî after all, Barker basically shows us exactly what happened in the film's opening minutes ‚Äî there is a sense of discovery as D'Amour tries to piece together what the hell is going on. The story is not afraid to take a few twists and turns, either, though not the kind that redirects the entire narrative or forces the viewer to reevaluate that which came before.\\" He added, \\"One of the great disappointments with the box office failure of Lord of Illusions is that horror fans were denied any further adventures of Harry D'Amour, a terrific noir detective played with uncharacteristic cynicism by Scott Bakula in one of his best performances. Bakula is a guy typically called upon to be sincere and decent; he's still those things in Lord of Illusions, but adds a world-weariness that suits the character well... It's too bad someone didn't snatch both the character and Bakula for an anthology TV series in the '90s, as both D'Amour and the world Barker creates are perfectly suited for serialized storytelling.\\" Reflecting on the film in the 1996 documentary \\"The Making of Lord of Illusions\\", Clive Barker said, \\"I can look through the movie and... every two or three minutes I'm saying, 'Geez, why did I do that? Why did I do this?' Well, the answer is, you know, I got 50 things right and 30 things wrong and that's a pretty good batting average for me! You make your work and you move on - and you do that whatever medium you work in.\\"  In popular culture  * Front Line Assembly uses samples from the movie on their album [FLA]vour of the Weak on the tracks \\"Autoerotic\\", \\"Colombian Necktie\\" and \\"Life=Leben\\" as well as on the single \\"Colombian Necktie\\" on Colombian Necktie (GOArge Mix). * Front Line Assembly side-project, Noise Unit, uses samples from the movie on their album Drill on a number of tracks: \\"The Drain\\", \\"Dominator\\", \\"Miracle\\", \\"Eye Burner\\". * Underground hip-hop artists Jedi Mind Tricks sample the movie on the track \\"The Immaculate Conception\\". * Heavy metal group Nevermore uses samples from the movie on their album Dreaming Neon Black, specifically on the intro track \\"Ophidian\\". * Goregrind group Last Days of Humanity uses a sample from the movie to begin their album The Sound Of Rancid Juices Sloshing Around Your Coffin, on the intro track \\"Born to Murder the World\\" (a quote from Nix in the film).

Hondros was a finalist twice for a Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography. Biography Chris Hondros was born in New York City to immigrant Greek and German parents who were child refugees after World War II. He spent most of his childhood in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where he graduated from Terry Sanford High School in 1988. Hondros studied English literature at North Carolina State University where he also worked for the Technician, the campus newspaper. In 1991, Hondros submitted his portfolio and was invited to attend the Eddie Adams Workshop. After graduating from State in 1993, Hondros moved to Athens, Ohio, and earned a master's degree at Ohio University School of Visual Communications. He began his career at the Troy Daily News in Ohio as an intern and later chief photographer before returning to Fayetteville in 1996 to begin a career with The Fayetteville Observer and to be close to his father who died of cancer in 2000. Hondros left his job at The Fayetteville Observer in 1998 to return to New York and concentrate on international reporting. From his base in New York, Hondros worked in most of the world's major conflict zones since the late 1990s, including Kosovo, Angola, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Kashmir, the West Bank, Iraq, and Liberia. Hondros was awarded the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Photojournalism Grant in 1999. In 2001, Hondros was selected for the Pew Fellowship for International Reporting through Johns Hopkins University. Following the September 11 attacks, Hondros took photographs at ground zero. Hondros went to cover the Liberian Civil War in 2003. It was here that Hondros photographed Joseph Duo in an image that graced the front cover of publications worldwide. Hondros also followed Sen. John Kerry's presidential campaign in 2004. When Hondros returned to cover the Liberian election in 2005, he was able to meet Joseph Duo again to discuss the progress that had been made in Liberia since his last visit.http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0511/dis_hondros.html His work included disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The United States presidential election in 2008 found Hondros photographing Governor and Vice-Presidential candidate Sarah Palin. His work appeared as the covers of magazines such as Newsweek and the Economist, and on the front pages of The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times. Photographer Tyler Hicks described Hondros as a \\"sensitive photographer,\\" adding that \\"He never was in it for himself or for the vanity of what the job brings with it. He really believes in his work.\\" His photography was featured in the documentary film, Liberia: A Fragile Peace (2006). Iraq photos Hondros's images from Iraq, especially a January 2005 picture series detailing the shooting of an Iraqi family by U.S. troops, were published extensively and garnered worldwide acclaim and criticism. On January 18, 2005, an Iraqi family was traveling in a car in Tal Afar. Thinking it was a suicide bomber, U.S. troops opened fire, killing both parents and paralyzing one of their five children sitting in the back seat. As a result of the worldwide interest in his case generated by Hondros's pictures, the boy, Rakan Hassan, was later flown to the United States for treatment in a Boston hospital, but was murdered in a bombing by insurgents shortly after his return.\\"The end of Rakan's war, Boston Globe. Hondros won dozens of international awards for the images. One of his pictures of this tragedy is likely to become \\"one of the few photos from the Iraq war that could stand out in history\\" according to Liam Kennedy, from University College Dublin. In an interview, Hondros stated: Libya and death It was reported on April 20, 2011, that Hondros had been fatally wounded in a mortar attack by government forces in Misrata while covering the 2011 Libyan civil war. Photojournalist Tim Hetherington was also killed in the attack, which wounded two other photographers. Photojournalists Guy Martin said that the group was traveling with rebel fighters. According to The New York Times, Hondros died from his injuries as a result of severe brain trauma. Chris Hondros Fund The Chris Hondros Fund is a nonprofit organization established in 2011 in the memory of Hondros and his life's work. The fund's mission is to provide non-profit institutions with grants to advocate for photojournalists. One fellowship for attendance to the Eddie Adams Workshop will be offered annually along with one other fellowship awarded by application. The first fellowship was awarded in 2012 by Getty Images and the Chris Hondros Fund. Hondros film In 2013 the author Greg Campbell launched a Kickstarter campaign to produce a documentary named Hondros: A Life in Frames. The project was launched with an initial goal of $30,000.00 and became fully funded within three days with a total of $89,639 raised. Campbell and Hondros met and became best friends in high school. After Hondros' death, Campbell was contacted by Liberian Joseph Duo, who was the subject of one of Hondros' most famous photographs. Campbell learned that Hondros had returned to Liberia to help Duo earn his high school, college, and eventually law school education. The film is executive produced by Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Lee Curtis. Curtis also assisted Campbell in finding the first significant funding for the project from the Annenberg Foundation. The film, re-titled as Hondros, had its world premiere in April 2017 at the Tribeca Film Festival, where it won the Audience Choice Award for documentaries. It was released in theaters on March 2, 2018.

Career Brown was one of the primary singers and songwriters for the alternative rock band Bourbon Tabernacle Choir in the 1980s and 1990s. When that band broke up, he continued performing as a duo with his Bourbon bandmate Kate Fenner. Brown has accompanied dozens of notable musicians on stage, including a six-month stint as a member of Barenaked Ladies in 1998 filling in for Kevin Hearn while Hearn battled leukemia. Brown released a solo album, Burden of Belief, in 2003. He performs this material both solo and with Tony Scherr, Anton Fier, and Teddy Kumpel as Chris Brown and the Citizens' Band. The group's album Oblivion was released in 2007. Also in 2007, musical contributions from Brown were included on Salamandre, the soundtrack for architectural designer Eric Clough's Mystery on Fifth Avenue apartment renovation project. Along with Fenner, he composed original music: four melodies of inspiration through four centuries of music, including renaissance, classical, Victorian, a Vetentian waltz, jazz, ragtime, blues, folk, and funk. He is also a social justice activist and the founder of the Pros and Cons Program bringing recording arts to prisons and creating musical works for charities. The Pros and Cons Program has become internationally recognized as groundbreaking in fields of restorative justice and inmate mentorship, with the support of The David Rockefeller Fund. Brown recorded an album with the prisoners called Postcards from the County which Exclaim! described as \\"inescapably honest and sincere\\". Brown has recently launched Wolfe Island Records as a home for the prison music and the many artists he produces and collaborates with, including Fenner, Suzanne Jarvie, David Corley, One River, The Mermaids, Hadley McCall Thackston and the Stephen Stanley Band. In 2017 he released a new solo album Pacem. PopMatters premiered his first single, \\"Keeper of the Flame\\", and Huffington Post raved that \\"Pacem is one of those albums that works on the listener from the inside out.\\" Brown currently lives in Wolfe Island where he tours solo and performs with local musicians in a band called Open Hearts Society.

The label operated from 1983 until 2000, and during those seventeen years, only released ska and ska-influenced music. Originally named Moon Records, as a tribute to Sun Records, the label changed its name to Moon Ska Records because another label owned the copyright to the Moon Records name. The label was started by Robert \\"Bucket\\" Hingley, founding member of The Toasters as a means to distribute albums by The Toasters. The label became an American source for many British ska import albums. History The label rose to prominence in the early 1990s by releasing albums by many of the ska genre's biggest acts, such as The Toasters, The Slackers, Hepcat, The Scofflaws, Mephiskapheles, The Pietasters and the debut album of Dance Hall Crashers ‚Äî as well as many up and coming bands such as Spring Heeled Jack and Mustard Plug. The label also promoted non-Moon Ska bands, such as The Allstonians, Gals Panic, Less Than Jake, through various compilation albums. Some of these compilations featured the earliest recordings by No Doubt. In 1997, the label branched out to form Ska Satellite Records, in order to produce albums from smaller acts at a lower budget. Moon Ska also produced patches and T-shirts that were sold at ska concerts around the world. In the mid-1990s, the label operated its own store in East Village, Manhattan. The original storefront was located at 150 East 2nd Street in the Alphabet City section of the East Village. When space became an issue, the business moved to a larger location at 84 East 10th Street. The storefront was a way for fans to purchase albums directly from the source and at cheaper prices than those of chain stores. It also became a place of social interaction for both ska band members and fans from around the world. Amidst the end of the ska boom of the mid-1990s, sales began to drop and many records were returned to the small label. Several distribution companies were filing bankruptcy while owing Moon Ska thousands of dollars in unpaid invoices, for albums that were already sent to stores. Those same record stores refused to keep the album prices in the suggested $10 range, and instead marked them up to between $17 and $19. All of these factors led to the end of the Moon Ska store, and eventually, the label itself. The label is survived by Moon Ska World (formerly Moon Ska Europe), which is a licensed affiliate and is not owned by Hingley. The label, based in the United Kingdom, has released albums from acts such as Rhoda Dakar, Symarip, The Big, The Upsessions, Skaville UK and Go Jimmy Go. Unlike its American sister label, Moon Ska World has released albums from outside of the ska genre. With the name change, the label shifted its focus to ska and old reggae. Moon Ska World has remained dormant since album and single releases by the Dub City Rockers in 2011. In 2003, three years after the demise of Moon Ska Records, Hingley started his second ska label, named Megalith Records. The label has released material by The Toasters, New York Ska Jazz Ensemble, Victor Rice, Eastern Standard Time, Mr. T Bone, Bomb Town, Bigger Thomas & The Hub City Stompers.

Early life Bourgeois was born in Lutcher, Louisiana. He grew up in a Catholic working-class family, and attended the University of Southwestern Louisiana and graduated with a bachelor of science degree in geology. After graduation, Bourgeois entered the United States Navy and served as an officer for four years. He spent two years at sea, one year at a station in Europe, and two tours of duty during one year in Vietnam, during the first of which he was injured and received the Purple Heart. After military service, he entered the Maryknoll Society in 1966; then entered the seminary of the Catholic missionary society of Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers, Glen Ellyn, (Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America), and was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1972. Career 1972‚Äì1975 Fr. Bourgeois began the work of his priesthood in La Paz, Bolivia aiding the poor. In 1975 he was accused of, and was arrested for, attempting to overthrow Bolivian dictator Hugo Banzer, a 1958 graduate of the School of the Americas (SOA) at Fort Benning, in Columbus, Georgia. Bourgeois was eventually deported from Bolivia and returned to the United States. 1980 Fr. Bourgeois moved to a Catholic Worker house in Chicago where he continued his work with the poor. He became an outspoken critic of US foreign policy in Latin America after four American churchwomen were (three of them nuns, and two of them personal friends of Bourgeois) were brutally raped and murdered by a death squad consisting of soldiers from the Salvadoran National Guard, some of whom had been trained at the SOA/WHINSEC. 1989 Fr. Bourgeois's criticism of US foreign policy in Latin America intensified on November 16, 1989 when six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper, and the housekeeper's daughter were massacred on the campus of Universidad Centroamericana \\"Jos√© Sime√≥n Ca√±as\\" (UCA) in San Salvador, El Salvador. Armed men in uniform burst into their shared residence and indiscriminately gunned- down everyone within. The massacre was performed by the Atlacatl Battalion, an elite unit of the Salvadoran Army, and a rapid-response, counter-insurgency battalion created in 1980 at SOA/WHINSEC. 1990 Fr. Bourgeois founded the School of the Americas Watch (SOA Watch), a not-for-profit organization that seeks to close the SOA (since 2000 known as WHINSEC) and to change U.S. foreign policy in Latin America by educating the public, lobbying Congress and participating in creative, nonviolent resistance such as demonstrations and nonviolent protest. The SOA/WHINSEC has long maintained that it does not teach tactics that can be used on civilians but, rather, simply sharpens the military skills of soldiers from participating countries. Its website says it \\"provides professional education and training for civilian, military and law enforcement students.\\" SOA Watch claims its work caused the Pentagon to respond to the growing anti-SOA movement with a PR campaign to give the SOA a new image. \\"In an attempt to disassociate the school with its horrific past,\\" the SOA Watch website claims, \\"the SOA was renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC) in January of 2001.\\" 1998 Fr. Bourgeois testified before a Spanish judge seeking the extradition of Chile's ex-dictator General Augusto Pinochet. 2008 In August 2008, in keeping with his belief that women should be ordained to the Roman Catholic priesthood, Fr. Bourgeois was a celebrant in, and delivered the homily at the ordination ceremony of Janice Sevre-Duszynska, a member of Womenpriests, at a Unitarian Universalist church in Lexington, Kentucky.Coday, Dennis. \\"Sixth Catholic woman priest ordained this year\\", \\"National Catholic Reporter\\", 2008-08-09. Retrieved on 2008-08-11. 2011 Bourgeois was briefly detained by police at the Vatican on October 17, when he tried to deliver a petition to the Holy See with a number of women priests, who were dressed in their liturgical garments. 2012 Bourgeois was part of a panel discussion at the New York premiere of the documentary Pink Smoke Over the Vatican. The film features activists for women's ordination in the Catholic Church, and included clips of an interview with him. Controversy =Federal prison= Bourgeois has spent over four years in federal prisons for nonviolent protests, including entering Fort Benning. He and more than 240 peace activists have been tried and jailed for peacefully demonstrating at the gates of the SOA/WHINSEC. =Excommunication= The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a decree in May 2008 formally declaring that a woman who attempts to be ordained a Catholic priest, and the persons attempting to ordain her, are automatically excommunicated. Three months later Fr. Bourgeois was a celebrant in, and delivered the homily during the ordination of Janice Sevre-Duszynska under the auspices of the group Roman Catholic Womenpriests, which rejects the Church's teaching on the all-male priesthood. The ceremony was not recognized by the Vatican; and its May 2008 declaration meant that Bourgeois was excommunicated latae sententiae.Cooper, Linda and James Hodge, \\" Bourgeois Has Long Drawn Inspiration from Women,\\" National Catholic Reporter, December 3, 2008. Bourgeois received a letter from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith which explained what the letter called his \\"errors\\" along with \\"a genuine concern for his salvation.\\" It gave him 30 days from October 21, 2008 to recant his \\"belief and public statements that support the ordination of women in our Church, or (he) will be excommunicated.\\" Bourgeois refused; and so was excommunicated latae sententiae on November 24, 2008.Priest confirms excommunication; will keep urging women's ordination For the next nearly four years Bourgeois continued to both act and be recognized as a priest, while he and Dominican Fr. Tom Doyle, a canon lawyer acting on Bourgeois' behalf, asked for discussions and negotiatations on the matter with the Maryknoll Society and, through it, the Holy See. At no time, during any of it, did Bourgeois recant his position on women's ordination to the priesthood. On May 22, 1994, Pope John Paul II released an apostolic letter, addressed to the Bishops of the Catholic Church, entitled \\"On Reserving Priestly Ordination to Men Alone (Ordinatio Sacerdotalis),\\" which closes as follows: \\"Arguments against this clear and authoritative teaching,\\" wrote Keith Fournier on Catholic Online, \\"sometimes come from people who do not understand that the priesthood is not a job and have succumbed to the 'rights' mentality of the current age. Other times they come from people who have no understanding of the sacramental nature of the Church. Both groups may include among them Catholics who, as in too many other areas of doctrine, have not been properly catechized.\\" Holding that the Roman Catholic church has no authority to ordain women, Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed the church's ban on women priests at the Vatican's 2012 Holy Thursday chrism Mass. =Maryknoll expulsion= On March 18, 2011, Fr. Bourgeois was given a letter from Fr. Edward M. Dougherty, Maryknoll's Superior General, and Edward J. McGovern, its Secretary General, warning Bourgeois that he had 15 days to recant his support for women's ordination or he would face expulsion from the society.McElwee, Joshua. \\"Maryknoll gives Bourgeois notice of removal from order\\", \\"National Catholic Reporter\\", 2011-03-29. Retrieved on 2011-03-30. Bourgeois responded in a letter dated April 8, 2011, stating that he could not recant without betraying his conscience. On July 22, 2011, 157 Catholic priests signed a letter, addressed to Dougherty, in support of Bourgeois's priesthood and work, and his right to conscience. While the letter did not specifically address the issue of women's ordination, it did indicate the signees' support of the right of priests to speak from conscience without being in danger of sanction. Following his refusal to recant, the society issued Bourgeois a second canonical warning; the final notice of pending removal from the Maryknoll Society, on July 27, 2011. In his August 8, 2011 letter of response, Bourgeois wrote, in part: On August 16, 2011, Bourgeois's canon lawyer Fr. Thomas Doyle wrote a letter to the Maryknoll Society asking that \\"reputable theologians\\" be brought in to examine the case \\"in order to look much more deeply\\" into two central issues: the church's claim that the teaching on women's ordination is infallible, and the right of a Catholic \\"to act and think according to the dictates of his conscience\\" even if the conclusions put one in conflict with the church's highest authorities. In February 2012, Maryknoll's U.S. regional superior, Fr. Mike Duggan, told both Bourgeois and Doyle, over the phone, that the order's general council, which consists of its superior general and three assistant generals, would be voting, in March 2012, on whether to dismiss Bourgeois from the Maryknoll Society. In March 2012, the four-person general council met to vote, but because canon law mandates that at least five people must vote on issues of dismissal from religious orders, Duggan had told Doyle that an unnamed fifth person from the order had been brought in to join the general council in the vote. The Maryknoll Society's official statement about the vote was that it was a split decision, with no clear outcome. However, both Bourgeois and Doyle said, after the vote, that Duggan told them that only two of the five general council members voted for Bourgeois's dismissal, while three abstained. The general council then sent a letter to the Vatican containing the results of the vote. On June 6, 2012 Bourgeois and Doyle met with Dougherty and a mediator at the society's headquarters in New York. Bourgeois and Doyle said no mention was made of the dismissal vote; and Bourgeois added that the two-hour meeting focused on the issue of conscience and \\"the importance of people of faith and members of Maryknoll to be able to speak openly and freely without fear ... of being dismissed or excommunicated.\\" Doyle said the outcome of the meeting was \\"far different than we expected and far more positive.\\"Gibson, David. \\"Maryknoll priest Roy Bourgeois expelled over support for women's ordination\\", Religion News Service, November 20, 2012 =Laicization= On Monday, November 19, 2012, the Maryknoll Society's Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers issued an official statement indicating that the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith had ruled, on October 4, 2012, that Bourgeois had been canonically dismissed from both the Maryknolls, and the Roman Catholic priesthood, thereby laicizing him. The full statement from the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers: Dominican Fr. Thomas Doyle, Bourgeois's canon lawyer, said he was surprised, especially after he and Bourgeois met with Maryknoll's superior general, Fr. Edward Dougherty, in June, and the issue of dismissal had not been discussed. \\"The idea then was that things would continue and they would not dismiss Roy and they would continue to dialogue,\\" Doyle said. \\"And then this just happened, unilaterally. We had no idea.\\" In response, Bourgeois issued the following official statement: Support In its November 20, 2012 statement, Erin Saiz Hanna, Executive Director of the Women's Ordination Conference wrote of Bourgeois: \\"While he is devastated to lose his community, and saddened by the harshness of this final step, he remains steadfast in his faith and conscience. He has asked for solitude and prayers during this time of transition.\\" In its December 3, 2012 editorial column, the National Catholic Reporter stated that \\"the call to priesthood is a gift from God,\\" and came out unequivocally in support of Roy Bourgeois and his campaign in support of women's ordination to the Catholic priesthood.

Background In July 2003, before the band had prepared songs for Fight the Tide, lead vocalist Matt Hammitt said of the album: \\"[On Say it Loud] we wrote about every day life or about God but didn't open ourselves up completely and weren't vulnerable to listeners. I hope on the next album we really open up and pour it out.\\" In February 2004, Sanctus Real returned to the studio to record their second album, and nearly all of the tracks were written in the previous month. They only had four weeks to track and record the album in studio, and according to band members, recording sessions were very intensive and tiring. Hammitt said, \\"If we weren't in the studio laying down tracks, we were at home working on lyrics, melodies, and rewrites. It really felt like a 24 hour-a-day job for about four weeks.\\" He estimated that two months would have been an ideal amount of time to record the album, but that the experience \\"was cool and it stretched us\\". Due to the constant guitar playing, especially during the second half of their recording time, guitarist Chris Rohman tried putting nail polish on his fingertips because they felt so raw. Tedd T served as producer for Fight the Tide; it was recorded and mixed at Antenna Studios in Brentwood, Tennessee.Lyric liner for Fight the Tide, 2004. Lyrical themes There are several themes on Fight the Tide, although its lyrics are mainly centered around various aspects of the Christian faith. Lead vocalist Matt Hammitt noted how some of the tracks were based on the Biblical epistle of James, such as \\"Deeds\\", which discusses the idea that faith and works are not separable, and \\"The Fight Song\\", which references James' concept about the influence of \\"the tongue\\". Interpersonal relationships are another common topic. Hammitt and bassist Steve Goodrum wrote \\"The Fight Song\\" together, which was about a conflict between Goodrum and a friend: \\"I was kind of hurt, but I'm still close to that person ... The song is about fighting over small, unimportant things‚Äîthe things that divide churches, marriages, and close relationships.\\" \\"Alone\\" is a love song while \\"Change Me\\" is written as a prayer asking for better patience and kindness with others; the latter was written after Hammitt once \\"lost patience\\" with his wife: \\"I felt like less of a person at that point. That hurt me as well as it hurt her, because I said some stupid things when I was angry.\\" Promotion and release In September 2004, Sanctus Real embarked on their first headlining tour, the Fight the Tide Tour. The tour covered over 25 cities and featured guest bands Hawk Nelson, Seven Places and Ever Stays Red. The album's lead single, \\"Everything About You\\" was released to radios around the same time of the album's release. The song eventually reached #1 on R&R; magazine's Christian rock chart in September, and held the position for six consecutive weeks. Accolades On 2005, the album won a Dove Award for Modern Rock Album of the Year at the 36th GMA Dove Awards.

History The band began as a side project for Wright when he was a member of Weeping Tile. When that band amicably parted ways following their 1998 recording This Great Black Night, the Wrongs became Wright's primary band. The band membership has shifted a number of times since its inception. Original members Wright, Cam Giroux (drums), Sean Kelly (bass), Brian Flynn (fiddle), Dan Curtis (electric guitar) and Olesh Maximew (pedal steel guitar) toured Canada and established themselves on the burgeoning alt-country scene. Consistent contributors and guests include Sarah Harmer, Jason Mercer, and Chris Brown.Luther Wright and the Wrongs biography at MapleMusic Recordings Pedal steel player Burke Carroll joined the band in 2001 and was followed by Columbus, Ohio-based fiddler Megan Palmer.

Both of these albums are original roots/country efforts with the songs written primarily by Wright. Guitarist Dan Curtis added two songs to Roger's Waltz, one a snappy duet entitled \\"Celia\\" with Sarah Harmer. The band's best-known album, Rebuild the Wall, was released in 2001 on Back Porch Records. It is a track-by-track reimagining of Pink Floyd's progressive rock classic The Wall as a bluegrass country album. The band signed with Universal Records Canada and Back Porch Records in the U.S. and embarked on a North American tour to perform their version of The Wall, intermixed with their own compositions. Their fourth album, Guitar Pickin' Martyrs, was also released on Back Porch and Universal Canada in 2003. In 2006 the band released Instrumentality on Snakeye Muzak.

Located in the town of Foster in the northwest of the state, the site is used as an observatory. It is also a popular destination for highpointers, and prior to 2005 was known for being difficult to access due to a local landowner who prohibited entry. Location The hill is located on Route 101 in Foster, a half mile from the Connecticut line. To ascend the summit, for which there is a sign, there is a long trail that has a mere elevation gain. The hill is high and is located west of Providence, Rhode Island, and east of Willimantic, Connecticut. History The Jerimoth Hill sign along Route 101 at the entrance to the path to the actual highpoint The hill was named after Jerimoth Brown, an early settler. The high point was donated to Brown University by Walter Raymond Turner, a Brown alumnus of the class of 1911. In 1938 he purchased the saltbox house to the west and the surrounding . Turner provided a right of way, straight north from the high point to Route 101, though eventually, it became overgrown. Brown University has used Jerimoth Hill as an astronomy observatory location for decades, because the university has easy access to this land-locked parcel where they have a view of the skies without light pollution from Providence. The high ground has been cleared of pine trees over an area of about . The high point is a rocky outcrop in the woods on the northwest edge of the clearing. A summit register is located in a mailbox for visitors to sign. As the highest point in Rhode Island, Jerimoth Hill is a destination for highpointers‚Äîhikers who try to reach the highest peak in various areas. For many years, hikers could not access the hill, because the only path to the summit crossed the driveway of a private property owner, Henry Richardson (aka \\"the madman of Jerimoth Hill\\"), who prohibited entry. Richardson posted \\"no trespassing\\" signs and installed a security system that alerted him whenever people entered his property. Richardson's belligerence toward hikers made him something of a legend in the community. Eventually, Richardson's son worked out a plan to allow access to the path four times a year. After Richardson's death, his property was purchased in 2005 by the Mosby family, who permitted daily access and eventually ceded the land to the state. In 2014, Brown sold the summit itself to the state, though the university reserves the right to build an observatory there in the future.

According to Clive Barker, D'Amour's destiny of repeatedly being pitted against evil forces is \\"karmic payback\\" for his own past sins. After his initial encounters with the supernatural, Harry has his body tattooed with markers that confer protection against evil.Barker, Clive. The Scarlet Gospels. New York: St. Martin's Press, 2015. He also carries a .38 revolver. Literature In the short story \\"The Last Illusion\\" in Books of Blood Volume 6, Harry D'Amour is introduced as a divorced private investigator living in New York City; he claims to already have roughly twenty years of experience in investigation. Harry D'Amour was a typical private investigator until a recent job in Brooklyn when a man named Lomax hiring him to spy on his adulterous wife Mimi. During this case, several deaths occurred and Harry later found Mimi Lomax at her house on Wyckoff Street with a lover who revealed his true form to be a demon. Harry then battled the demon alongside Mimi and a priest named Father Hesse. Though he survived, Mimi was lost to the \\"Gulfs\\" (a term some of Clive Barker's demons use to refer to Hell). As \\"The Last Illusion\\" begins, Harry considers how his view of the world has been shaken by his experience at the Lomax House and his new knowledge of the existence and power of magical and demonic forces. Harry also has a fear of stairs for some time following this case. The case in Brooklyn was covered in the news, which leads a woman named Dorothea Swann to track down and hire Harry in the beginning of \\"The Last Illusion.\\" Her husband is the famous illusionist Swann who recently died backstage, apparently killed by one of his own tricks going off and releasing several swords that fatally speared him. Dorothea reveals her husband wished to be cremated immediately before enemies could take action, so she hires D'Amour to guard the body while she makes arrangements. D'Amour learns demons want to claim the illusionist's body and soul because years ago he made a deal with them so he could possess actual magic, which he pretended were stage illusions. Swann's attorney Butterfield convinces Dorothea to release D'Amour from employment and obligation. After speaking with Swann's aid Valentin, Harry decides to continue protecting Swann's body and soul. After some battles, D'Amour succeeds in cremating the magician's body before the demons can take it, cheating them of his soul. Butterfield, revealed to be a demon, declares that Hell won't forget or forgive Harry's actions and from now on they are enemies. D'Amour answers, \\"I hope so.\\" Following this, D'Amour feels more confident in himself and is prepared to face the supernatural again when he must. D'Amour later appears in a short story called \\"Lost Souls\\" in a 1987 anthology called Cutting Edge that featured short stories from various authors. Harry then appears briefly in Barker's 1989 novel The Great and Secret Show, the first book of the \\"Book of the Art\\" trilogy. He returns as a major character in the 1994 novel Everville,https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/clive- barker/everville/ the second installment of the \\"Book of the Art\\" trilogy. D'Amour appears alongside the Hell Priest (known to fans of the Hellraiser movie franchise as Pinhead) in Barker's 2015 novel The Scarlet Gospels, which acts as a sequel to Barker's 1986 novella The Hellbound Heart. The Hell Priest belongs to a group of demonic sadists called Cenobites, also called \\"the Surgeons,\\" who do not distinguish between pleasure and pain. The 2016 novel Sherlock Holmes and the Servants of Hell, written by Paul Kane, features Sherlock Holmes encountering the Cenobites and a man named Henri D'Amour, implied to be an ancestor of Harry who lived in the 19th century.  Character conception and development  In an interview with Fangoria, Clive Barker described Harry D'Amour as \\"this everyman who is drawn into the heart of darkness over and over again because of some karmic thing which he has no power over.\\"Fangoria #138, 1994. In an interview with the Wired podcast The Geek's Guide to the Galaxy episode 151 (May 23, 2015), Barker said, \\"Harry is a film noir character in a way. He‚Äôs a Philip Marlowe via Clive Barker. He's a down-at-the-heel, pissed-off, rather exhausted PI who's based in New York.\\"The Geek's Guide to the Galaxy # 151: \\"It's Finally Time to Say Goodbye to Hellraiser's Pinhead\\" (May 23, 2015). In the liner notes included with the director's cut of Lord of Illusions, Barker said, \\"I've travelled a long way with Harry D'Amour. He first appeared in a story I wrote almost a decade ago now, 'The Last Illusion.' Since then, I've recounted his life and troubled times in two novels and some short fiction. I've not made the road very easy for him. His destiny, it seems, is to be in constant struggle with what might be loosely called 'the forces of darkness', though he claims he'd be quite content investigating insurance fraud. His reluctance is, I trust, part of his charm. He's not a Van Helsing, defiantly facing off against some implacable evil with faith and holy water. His antecedents are the troubled, weary and often lovelorn heroes of film noir - private detectives with an eye for a beautiful widow and an aversion to razors.\\"Lord of Illusions - Collector's Edition, released December 2014. In an interview with Bloody Best of Fangoria in 1993, Clive Barker spoke of his story \\"The Last Illusion\\" and its movie adaptation Lord of Illusions and said, \\"I've always loved illusionists. There's always a dark side, and illusionists present them to you. It's very much life-and-death illusion - you sawed the woman in half, but she's still alive. They're presented as breezy, funny, entertaining pieces - but, subtextually, they're stories of death and resurrection.Bloody Best of Fangoria Special, 1993. While filming the adaptation Lord of Illusions, Barker considered actor Scott Bakula the perfect casting choice for Harry D'Amour. On the documentary \\"The Making of Lord of Illusions\\" included with the director cut's of the movie, Barker said, \\"He's the Harry I've had in my head for 8 years - no word of a lie. When he stepped on set in costume for the first time, which happened to be into his apartment, the set for his apartment, I thought, 'This is wonderful - this is the man I've been writing about for 8 years,' and that's a real thrill to see an actor so beautifully embody somebody that you've been writing about for such a long time - it's a real thrill. I have to say, they used to say that thing on posters: 'So and so is so and so.' Well, Scott Bakula is Harry D'Amour, and it really sends a shiver down an author's back.\\"Documentary - \\"The Making of Lord of Illusions\\", included with Lord of Illusions: Collector's Edition from Shout! Factory. Comics Harry D'Amour plays a major role in the BOOM! Studios comic book series Hellraiser that began in 2011. These comic books follow the canon of the first few Hellraiser movie rather than the prose stories of Clive Barker. In the comics, Pinhead escapes Hell and opposes the demon deity Leviathan (described in the Hellraiser films as the creator and ruler of the Cenobites). D'Amour and Kirsty Cotton (a recurring enemy of the Cenobites in the movies) are later trapped by Leviathan himself. Harry then becomes a demonic Cenobite, taking Pinhead's place as the leader of Hell's armies. His flayed chest reveals his still-beating heart. In spite of his new powers, Harry still carries a gun as he battles incursion attempts from other realms. Films D'Amour was portrayed by actor Scott Bakula in the 1995 film Lord of Illusions, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113690/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1 directed and written by Clive Barker and loosely based on his short story \\"The Last Illusion.\\" In the film, Harry is a divorced private investigator who has already had several encounters with the supernatural and has tattooed a protective mark on his back. After a case in Brooklyn involving a child's exorcism makes the news, he leaves New York City and goes to Los Angeles where Dorothea Swann hires him. She fears her husband Philip has become disturbed by a tarot reading and wants to know the truth behind his fear. D'Amour attends Philip Swann's next performance and witnesses his death on stage. Investigating further, he becomes romantically involved with Dorothea and learns that Swann and other allies were once part of a cult led by the demonically empowered man called Nix. Swann and his former allies turned against Nix, but now years later they are being killed by Nix's loyal follower, a man named Butterfield.

Its site is on the northern quay of the Royal Victoria Dock in London Docklands, between Canary Wharf and London City Airport.  History  Aerial view of ExCeL in 2008, before its extension The centre was designed by Moxley Architects and built by Sir Robert McAlpine. It opened in November 2000. In May 2008 it was acquired by Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company. Phase II of development, which included building London's first International Convention Centre (ICC) and creating an \\"eastern arrival experience\\", was completed on 1 May 2010. In 2015 ExCeL announced the opening of CentrEd at ExCeL, a dedicated training and meeting space located close to the western entrance of the venue overlooking Royal Victoria Dock, adding to ExCeL's wide range of flexible spaces. The Royal Victoria Dock closed to commercial traffic in 1981, but it is still accessible to shipping. The Centre's waterfront location allows visiting vessels to moor alongside the Centre. For example, the 2005 London Boat Show was visited by HMS Sutherland. The exhibition building itself consists of two column-free, rectangular, subdivisible halls of approximately 479,493 square feet (approximately 44,546 m¬≤) each, on either side of a central boulevard containing catering facilities and information points. There are also three sets of function rooms, one overlooking the water, another above the western end of the central boulevard, and the third on the north side of the building. These are used for smaller meetings, seminars, presentations and corporate hospitality. There are six hotels, more than 30 bars and restaurants, and 3,700 parking spaces on the campus.

It was announced on 24 March 2020 that the centre was to be temporarily converted into the 4,000-bed NHS Nightingale Hospital as part of the response to the 2020 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Military engineers and contractors supported the erection of the facility, and army medics assisted the NHS nurses, doctors and other staff. The Nightingale was opened on 3 April 2020 by Charles, Prince of Wales via videolink.  Transport  ExCeL London is served by two Docklands Light Railway (DLR) stations, which span the full 600-metre length of the venue. The western entrance is directly linked to Custom House for ExCeL station, which serves the Platinum Suite and the event halls and is located next to the iconic glass pyramid.

It is the administrative capital of the Batticaloa District. The city is the seat of the Eastern University of Sri Lanka and is a major commercial city. It is on the east coast, south of Trincomalee, and is situated on an island. Pasikudah is popular tourist destinations situated 35 km northwest with beaches and flat year-round warm- water shallow-lagoons.  Etymology  Batticaloa is a Portuguese derivation. The original name of the region being the Tamil \\"Matakkalappu\\" (translation: Muddy Swamp).Dennis McGilvray, Crucibles of Conflict (Duke University Press, 2008) According to Mattakallappu Manmiyam (‡ÆÆ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ ‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Øç‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Øç) the word Mattakkallpu consists Tamil words \\"Mattu\\" (‡ÆÆ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡ØÅ) Matta-derived from \\"Mattam\\" (‡ÆÆ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡ÆÆ‡Øç) means 'flat' and geographical name KaLappu. Mukkuwa named this place as KaLappu-Mattam or boundary of lagoon later it became Matta-Kallappu or Flat Lagoon.Mattakallappu Manmiyam (‡ÆÆ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ ‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Øç‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Øç - ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡Æµ‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Æ≤‡Øç) Page 7 Also, Batticaloa has a nickname, \\"Land of the singing fish\\" () due to musical sounds that related to fish or aquatic creature in the Batticaloa Lagoon near the Kallady Bridge. BBC Radio 4 was able to record the mysterious sound in Batticaloa Lagoon. The sound was broadcast by Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation in 1960s with the help of Rev. Fr. Lang, a Catholic priest.  Geography  Batticaloa is in the eastern coast of Sri Lanka on a flat coastal plain boarded by the Indian Ocean in the east occupies a central part of the eastern Sri Lanka. Its average elevation is around 5 meters. Batticaloa district has three lagoons such as Batticaloa Lagoon, Valaichchenai Lagoon, and Vakari (Panichchankerni) Lagoon. Among these lagoon, Batticaloa Lagoon is the largest lagoon and has 56 km long 162 square km area, extending from Pankudaweli in North and Kalmunai in South. There are several islands within the Batticaloa Lagoon such as Puliayantheevu, Buffaloa Island and Bone Island. Many bridges are built across the lagoon connecting the landmasses and the islands. The Puliayantheevu is the metropolitan place of the city. The biggest bridge of all is Lady Manning bridge located at Kallady, which is the main access path to the city from the southern places of the district. This bridge is also famous for Singing fishes which were considered as musical sounds heard in the Kallady lagoon on a full moon day. A priest named Father Lang recorded this musical charm and broadcast it in the 1960s over the (Sri Lanka Broadcasting Cooperation) Batticaloa beaches are sandy and located along 4 km shoreline in the city and further extend through the neighboring places. They include Kallady beach, Pasikudah, and Kalkudah. Pasikudah is a bay protected from the ocean, with a flat and sandy bed extending 150 to 200 meters from the shore. = Climate = Batticaloa has a tropical wet and dry climate under the K√∂ppen climate classification, also generically referred to as 'dry-monsoonal climate'. Batticaloa's climate is temperate throughout the year. From March to May, the warmest time of the year, the maximum temperature averages around 32 degrees Celsius (88 degrees Fahrenheit). During the monsoon season from November to February heavy rains are recorded, with average temperature of 25 ¬∞C. Average annual rainfall in Batticaloa is .  History  = Early history = Mattakallappu Manmiyam Palm-leaf manuscripts at the Batticaloa Museum. Mattakallappu Manmiyam refers (‡ÆÆ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ ‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Øç‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Øç) Mukkuva or Mutkuhar are known as the first people migrated to this land and constructed seven villages in various areas. They immigrated their people from India and established the kingdom of Mukkuva. The name of the villages and towns in Batticaloa still holds the historical evidence of the ancient batticaloan people. When Mutkuhar intruded through the salty water and reached the destination of their voyage at the forests situated around the lagoon. When they finished. The name given by the Mukkuva was \\"Kallpu-Mattam\\" which literally means \\"boundary of lagoon\\". Later it was called \\"Matta-Kallappu\\" which indicates the destination of Mukkuva's voyage and the water is flat. = Mukkuva wars = Mukkuva is a coastal community from Ancient Tamil country. They are of mixed origin and migrated at various periods in history. Mukkuvas waged war around Puttalam and settled in the western coast as well. Sinhala Kings of Suryawamsa kept Mukkuvas as their mercenary force. They waged wars on other countries like Burma. Gajabahu, Parakramabahu, Vijayabahu were some of these Suryawamsa kings who employed the Chera soldiers for their protection and defence of Sri Lanka. Gajabahu I was a friend of Cheran Chenkuttuvan and was mentioned in the great Jain epic of Silappadikaram and in addition to that he was also mentioned in Mahawamsa. When Anuradhapura was destroyed, the capital moved from Anuradhapura to Polonnaruwa. When Pollonaruwa was destroyed the capital moved to Kotte and then to Kandy. Anuradhapura was destroyed by Rajaraja Cholan and he who established Polonnaruwa. Even though Pollonaruwa had a few Hindu temples it was a great Buddhist city full of beautiful Buddhist architecture matching Angkor Wat. = Kalinga Magha = As a catalyst for change, Kalinga Magha is arguably one of the most significant rulers in Sri Lankan history. His invasion marks the final ‚Äì cataclysmic ‚Äì destruction of the kingdom of Rajarata, which had for so long been the heart of native power on the island. The great cities of the ancient kings were now lost and disappeared into the jungle, and were not rediscovered until the 19th century. Native power was henceforth centred on a kaleidoscopically shifting collection of kingdoms in south and central Sri Lanka. The north, in the meanwhile, eventually evolved into the Jaffna Kingdom, which was subjected colonial rule by the Portuguese in 1619. Kalinga Magha's geopolitical impact is reflected in the changing language of the Culavamsa as well. The traditional divisions of Sri Lanka, into Rajarata, Dhakkinadesa, and Ruhuna, first undergo a change of names (Rajarata becomes Pathithadesa, Dhakkinadesa becomes Mayarata), and then slip into obsolescence altogether. Their successor kingdoms tended to be geographically smaller and centred on a strong citadel-capital, such as Yapahuwa or Gampola; they also tended to be much short lived, like Sitawaka. = Jaffna principality = With the decline of the Rohana sub-kingdom and the defeat of Polonnaruwa, coming with the rise of Chola power, i.e., from about the 13th century CE, these regions became wild. The many irrigation works (tanks etc., which exist even today) became home to malaria (see History of Sri Lanka). In the meantime, the eastern coastal region remained less affected by Malaria and began to be occupied. Thus seafaring people who had begun to settle down along the coast since the Anuradhapura times, c. 6th Century CE began to flourish. The forests continued to be dominated by the Veddha population which claimed kingship (\\"cross-cousins\\") with the Sinhala kings of Kandy. Parakramabahu's coronation took place in 1236. He turned his attention to the recovery of Polonnaruwa from the Tamils, and achieved this purpose by 1244. In this connection two kings are mentioned, Kalinga Magha and Jaya Bahu, who had been in power forty years, apparently reckoned from the time of the military rule after Sahasa Malla. As the Tamil war' and the \`Malala war' as specifically mentioned by contemporary chronicles the two kings may have held different parts of the country. In the king's eleventh year (1244/5) Lanka was invaded by Chandrabhanu, a Javanese (Javaka) from Tambralinga, with a host armed with blow-pipes and poisoned arrows: he may have been a sea-robber, and though now repulsed descended on the Island later on. The rest of the reign according to the contemporary records was spent in pious works; the king also held a convocation for the purpose of reforming the priesthood, whose discipline had been relaxed during the Tamil occupation. The chronicles make no mention of a great Pandyan invasion which seems to have taken place between 1254 and 1256, in which one of the kings of Lanka was slain and the other rendered tributary. From this it is clear that Parakramabahu never had recovered the north of the Island, which certainly had been held by his great namesake. = European colony = Portugal The growth and impact of the kingdom of Sitawaka, 1521‚Äì1594 Louren√ßo de Almeida, the Portuguese Admiral for India invaded Ceylon and made it a Portuguese colony. Batticaloa was fortified in the 1620s, which was held until 1638, when the Dutch successfully invaded it. = Batticaloa principality = Vimaladharmasurya I receiving Joris van Spilbergen, 1603 Lanka was a confederacy of various rulers for a long time and different princes ruled the different provinces and helped each other and plotted against each other. As the Portuguese colonisers were dividing and ruling Kotte, Kandy Kingdom and Jaffna Kingdom had to create a confederacy to fight against Portugal. As a joint strategy they approached the Netherlands to have a global free trade and to get rid of the Portuguese. From Cape Comorin the Dutch Admiral Joris van Spilbergen steered his course to Point de Galle; but, without landing there or at any of the other places which were strongly fortified by the Portuguese, he sailed round the south coast of the Island and made for Batticaloa, where he anchored on 31 May 1602. Batticaloa fort, c. 1665 He learnt that the town of Batticaloa, where the chief of the province resided, was about inland; so he sent him a messenger proposing to enter into trade with him. In the meantime he learnt from some Tamils who came on board that there was plenty of pepper and cinnamon to be had, but that it was to be obtained from the chief of the place. These Tamils brought with them a Portuguese interpreter; for Portuguese was the only European language then heard or spoken in Ceylon, and the natives of the island had no idea that there were other white people who spoke a different language. The Admiral was taken from Batticaloa to Kandy and was given a liberation hero's welcome as King Rajasinghe seized the opportunity to get rid of the Portuguese, the oppressors who were slowly encroaching the island systematically and promoting subversion against Rajasinghe. The Batticaloa fort was built by the Portuguese in 1628 and was the first to be captured by the Dutch (18 May 1638). It is one of the most picturesque of the small Dutch fort of Sri Lanka, it's situated in an island, still in good condition. = World War II = In 1942, during World War II, the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes and escorting destroyer HMAS Vampire were stationed at Trincomalee. Both these ships came under Japanese aerial attack off Batticaloa and were sunk. Some of the remnants of HMS Hermes still remain at around off Baticaloa. = 2004 tsunami = The town was also one of the worst hit during the tsunami of December 26, 2004. The water rose up to within 90 minutes of the beginning of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. = 2019 Easter Bombings = On 21 April 2019 the Zion Church was targeted by militant Islamic suicide bombers. At least 28 people were reported dead.https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/21/world/asia/sri-lanka- bombing-maps.htmlhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/22/sri-lanka- bombings-a-timeline-and-visual-guidehttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world- asia-48034689  Modern Batticaloa Town  Puliyanthivu in 3D map Batticaloa Clock Tower The city has four main divisions. *Puliyanthivu: Seat of many government department and offices, schools, banks religious places, General Hospital, Weber Stadium and Shops.

Demography  Batticaloa is on the East coast of Sri Lanka, 314 km from Colombo. The population of 95,489 consists mainly of Sri Lankan Tamils others include Moors, Sinhalese, Burghers and the indigenous Veddas population. The District of Batticaloa itself consists of several administrative divisions, which are: Manmunai North, Manmunai West, Manmunai South & Eruvil Pattu, Manmunai Pattu, Koralai Pattu North, Porativu Pattu, Kattankudy, Eravur Pattu, Eravur Town, Koralai Pattu and Koralai Pattu West.

Religion-based statistics in the year 2012 are: Hindus 64.6%, Muslims 25.5%, Christians 8.8%, with a small numbers of Buddhists (1.1%) and others. These figures became even more polarized towards Hindus during the LTTE occupation which came to an end in 2007 (see Eelam War IV). According to the 2012 census, the total population was 525,142. Of which 381,285 were Sri Lankan Tamils, 133,844 Moors, 6,127 were Sinhalese, 2,794 Burgher, 1,015 Indian Tamils, 58 Veddah, 16 Malay, and 3 Sri Lanka Chetty.  Educational institutions  Wesleyan Mission-Chapel and School-Rooms, Battticaloa, Ceylon (1850) The first educational institution established in Batticaloa was Methodist Central College, founded in 1814 by the Weslyan Methodist William Ault. Other noteworthy institutions are: Sivananda Vidyalayam, Hindu College, St. Michael's College, Batticaloa, St. Cecilia's Girls' College and Vincent Girls' High School,. The Eastern University, Sri Lanka (EUSL), located in Vantharumoolai 16 km north of Batticaloa, was founded in 1980. Its development has been interrupted by the civil war. It is the cultural and economic focal point of the district of Batticaloa and extends its influence towards Trincomalee as well. Batticaloa Regional centre of Open University of Sri Lanka is another education resource of Batticaloa.  Cultural institutions  Batticaloa has historically been a centre of Portuguese Burgher culture, supported in the modern era by the Catholic Burgher Union. In the 1980s, despite Burger emigration to Australia, the Union still numbered some 2,000 speakers of Sri Lankan Portuguese, making them the largest community still speaking the dialect.  Religious institutions  Hinduism is the major religion of Batticaloa. Eastern Province is a place of Amman temples. This shows the worship of female deity Kannaki of Silappatikaram. The cult has come with the King Gajabahu I who brought the settler Tamils from the Chera Kingdom of his friend Cheran Senguttuvan. Silppatikaram copy was initially discovered in Trincomalee by Tamil scholars. Tamil Nadu was not having a copy of this great Tamil literature. The northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka have several temples in honour of Kannaki Amman. Gajabahu I brought Amman worship to Sri Lanka in the Third Century AD after her death. Shri Mamangeshwarar Kovil is one of the main holy places for Hindus in the country is located in a place called Amirthakally which is 6 Kilometers away from Batticaloa town. Hindus believe that by bathing in the water of sacred water of Mamangeshwarar tank, the departed souls of their family will be receiving better attainments in their cycle of its transmigration. Sri Kandaswamy/KannakaiAmman Kovil are important from a devotional point of view. The Mandur (‡ÆÆ‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡ØÇ‡Æ∞‡Øç) temple is in the southern end, while the Mamangeshwarar temple is in the western-most edge at Muhaththuvaram (‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡ØÅ‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡ÆÆ‡Øç). The Colany Mosque, and the Koddamunai Dharga and Madrasa are two noteworthy Muslim institutions. There are a large number of mosques in the region. Christianity is present and Catholic churches are found every where as the coastal community has some Catholics. During the colonial influences, Catholic was introduced to Batticaloan, and the first Catholic church in Batticaloa was established in 1624. The Catholic Church has a diocese headquartered in the city. Methodists, Anglicans, and other Protestants and their schools are also present in Batticaloa. Within Batticaloa Municipal Council area, Christian presence is strong (23%) compare to other area. The latter is a historic harbour and ancient Buddhist shrine, mentioned in the \\"Dhathu Vamsa\\". While the Dagaba and shrine in the Dutch Fort is the oldest (1st century CE), Mangalaramaya is a well-known modern Buddhist temple in Batticaloa.  Economic activities  Rice and coconuts are the two staples of the district, and steamers trading round the island call regularly at the port. The lagoon is famous for its \\"singing fish,\\" supposed to be shell-fish which give forth musical notes. The district has a remnant of Veddahs or wild men of the wood. Prior to the Sri Lankan civil war, there were large-scale shrimp farms as well as fish and rice processing activities. Batticaloa shows a huge potential for tourism related industries. = Transport = Batticaloa bus stand, night view from north Batticaloa is the terminus of a Broad gauge branch railway of the Sri Lanka Government Railway network.

The Laestadian church arrived in North America with Nordic (especially Finnish and Sami) immigrants in the latter half of the 19th century, many of whom came to work in the copper mines of the Keweenaw Peninsula. Some of these new immigrants found themselves in conflict with older, established immigrants from the same countries, being generally poorer and less established, and hewing to the new, fundamentalist teachings of Lars Levi Laestadius, a Swedish-Sami preacher and botanist born in Arjeplog, Sweden. Laestadian congregations separate from the extant Scandinavian Lutheran churches were formed in Cokato, Minnesota, in 1872 and in Calumet, Michigan, in 1873.  Groups in the Americas in 2013  There are a total of 171,000 Laestadians in the world, with 26,000 of these being based in the Americas.Talonen 2001. s. 25Talonen 2012.

In particular, First Apostolic adherents would recoil at being labelled \\"Laestadian\\" because for them, \\"Laestadians\\" are the opposing side of the 1973 schism. In the interest of editorial clarity, this article uses an internally consistent naming scheme which differs from the names congregations apply to themselves. The term \\"Laestadian\\" is used as an umbrella to refer to all churches with a clear succession of belief from the teachings of Lars Levi Laestadius. The respective branches of Laestadian churches recognize their roots with the teachings of Lars Levi Laestadius to varying degrees. The Old Apostolic Lutheran Church, for example, will read a postilla (sermon) of Laestadius along with a text from the Bible with every church service. In contrast, the Pollari congregations do not recognize Laestadius in any of their liturgy and he is not given any special emphasis in their teachings. The term \\"Apostolic\\" does not refer to the doctrine of apostolic succession; rather, it denotes an effort to live as near as possible in the Laestadian view to the Apostle's doctrines and practices. Congregations and concentrations As of 2017, significant concentrations of Laestadian adherents and churches which can trace their roots to Laestadianism exist in the following locales: =USA= * The Mat-Su Valley, Alaska * Phoenix, Arizona * Prescott, Arizona * Hemet, California * Martinez, California * Glenwood Springs, Colorado * Bethel, Connecticut * Lake Worth, Florida * Waukegan and Zion, Illinois * Elkton, Maryland * Centerville, Massachusetts * Fitchburg, Massachusetts * Calumet, Hancock, Houghton, and nearby towns in Michigan (the \\"Copper Country\\") * Brighton, Michigan * Howell, Michigan * Ironwood, Michigan * Iron River, Michigan * Eben Junction, Michigan * Negaunee and Ishpeming, Michigan * Minneapolis, Minnesota (northwestern suburbs) * Brainerd, Minnesota * Cokato, Minnesota * Dayton, Minnesota (northwest Minneapolis exurb) * Deer River, Minnesota * Duluth and Cloquet, Minnesota * Eagle Lake Township, Minnesota * Elk River, Minnesota * Esko, Minnesota * Floodwood, Minnesota * Menahga, Minnesota and surrounding area * New York Mills, Minnesota * Rockford, Minnesota * Virginia, Minnesota * Kalispell, Montana * New Ipswich, New Hampshire * New York City (though small but has a community) * High Point, North Carolina * Dickinson, North Dakota * Portland, Oregon * Greer, South Carolina * Hamlin County, South Dakota * Utah County, Utah (primarily south of Provo, Utah) * Greenbrier, Tennessee * Battle Ground, Washington * Davenport, Washington * Longview, Washington * Seattle, Washington (northwestern suburbs) * Colville, Washington * Spokane, Washington * Marengo, Wisconsin * Kenosha, Wisconsin * Oulu, Wisconsin * Wilmington, North Carolina =Canada= * Lethbridge, Alberta * Vanderhoof, British Columbia * Vancouver, British Columbia * Winnipeg, Manitoba * Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario * Toronto, Ontario * Outlook, Saskatchewan * Dunblane, Saskatchewan * Saskatoon, Saskatchewan * Regina, Saskatchewan Beliefs and characteristics American Laestadians practice varied degrees of fundamentalist Christian belief. Most Laestadians avoid alcohol; varying numbers of adherents avoid a number of \\"worldly\\" practices, including dancing, card-playing, cinema, television, popular music, and the performing arts (listed in approximate order of avoidance). However, caffeine is widely consumed and tobacco is generally tolerated, but preached against when under 18 as most jurisdictions have laws against minors purchasing tobacco products. Family size tends to be large compared to the American average; most families in non-urban congregations have between 4 and 10 children, while most churches have a few families with 12 or 15 children. Birth control is generally not practiced; it is preached as sin unless after consideration and counsel with medical doctors it is determined to be necessary for the health of the mother. Birth control is not tolerated because it prevents a child from being born and each child is a gift from God. Laestadian asceticism is distinguished from other American fundamentalist Christians in that none of the above-mentioned pastimes is officially proscribed; rather, Laestadians counsel each other and employ a reinforcing system of social feedback to encourage abstention. Active congregations provide social outlets in keeping with the beliefs of the church; nearly every weekend evening will find Laestadian teenagers congregating at one or another's home (get-togethers), preferably with adults present. Laestadian churches, in keeping with the Holy Bible, teach that every human is a sinner and that every sin can be forgiven; forgiveness stems from the hearts of Laestadians, not from ceremony or hierarchy. Some Laestadians practice lay confession, whereby a member confesses to another member; in the Heidemanian tradition, some vestige of this practice remains in the liturgy but confession is not widely practiced. Some Laestadian congregations consider themselves the one, true Christian church, and preach that all other Christian churches (including other branches of the Laestadian tradition) are not true Christians. Ceremony and service in the Heidemanian tradition American Laestadian churches provide services in Finnish to varying degrees; , every service in some congregations is bilingual, while in others only special occasions merit translation, and in yet others all preaching is done in English. In any case, a Laestadian may request to receive Communion in Finnish; another lay member of the congregation can deliver Communion if the pastor is not fluent. Communion is the only regularly practiced ceremony (performed once or twice a month, or every week, depending on the congregation), and consists of unleavened wafers and wine (sometimes grape juice), delivered assembly-line fashion at a communion rail at the conclusion of Sunday services. Teenagers undergo Confirmation around age 13 to 15, after which they are eligible for communion. Other significant life ceremonies are baptism (performed during the first months of life, and rarely for adult converts) and marriage. The Old Apostolic Lutheran congregations hold annual Elders' Meetings, often combined with St. John's summer services, several days to one week long, with guest preachers delivering evening sermons each weekday and two or more church services on the bracketing Sundays. Elders (senior preachers) from Lapland are invited to teach. Many church members follow the elders as they travel across America visiting different congregations. Other Apostolic Lutheran bodies hold similar \\"big services,\\" in which members of multiple congregations gather in one location to hear speakers from the United States and from Scandinavia (if they have a cooperating European counterpart).

Some terms are pejorative. In English, medical slang has entered popular culture via television hospital and forensic science dramas such as ER, House M.D., NCIS, Scrubs, and Grey's Anatomy. Examples of pejorative language include bagged and tagged for a corpse, a reference to the intake process at a mortuary; donorcycle for motorcycle or PFO for pissed [drunk] and fell over. Less offensive are the terms blue pipes for veins; cabbage for a heart bypass (coronary artery bypass graft or CABG), and champagne tap for a flawless lumbar puncture, that is, one where erythrocyte count is zero. Limitations on use In many countries, facetious or insulting acronyms are now considered unethical and unacceptable, and patients can access their medical records. Medical facilities risk being sued by patients offended by the descriptions. Another reason for the decline is that facetious acronyms could be confused with genuine medical terms and the wrong treatment administered. In one of his annual reports (related by the BBC), medical slang collector Dr. Adam Fox cited an example where a practitioner had entered ‚ÄúTTFO‚Äù, meaning ‚Äútold to fuck off‚Äù, on a patient‚Äôs chart. When questioned about the chart entry, the practitioner said that the initials stood for ‚Äúto take fluids orally.‚Äù As a result, medical slang tends to be restricted to oral use and to informal notes or E-mails which do not form part of a patient‚Äôs formal records. It may also be used among medical staff outside of the hospital. It is not found on patients‚Äô charts and, due to growing awareness of medical slang, often not used in front of patients themselves. Non-English Although online medical slang dictionaries are primarily from English-speaking countries, non-English medical slang has been collected by Fox from elsewhere. Brazilian medical slang includes PIMBA (\\"P√© Inchado Mulambo B√™bado Atropelado\\" meaning \\"swollen- footed, drunk, run-over beggar\\"), Poliesculhambado (multi-messed-up patient) and Trambicl√≠nica (a \\"fraudulent clinic\\" staffed cheaply by medical students). Annual round-up There is an annual round-up of the usage of medical slang by British physician Dr. Adam Fox of St Mary's Hospital, London. Fox has spent five years charting more than 200 examples, regional and national terms and the general decline of medical slang. He believes that doctors have become more respectful of patients, which has contributed to the decline. While its use may be declining in the medical profession, several dictionaries of the slang have been compiled on the internet.

It is one of the landmarks of Tehran, marking the west entrance to the city, and is part of the Azadi Cultural Complex, which also includes an underground museum. The tower is about tall and is completely clad in cut marble.Hureau, Jean. Iran Today, 2nd. Ed, editions j.a. It was commissioned by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, to mark the 2,500th year of the foundation of the Imperial State of Iran and completed in 1971. After winning a competition, architect Hossein Amanat was tasked to design the tower. His ideas were based upon classical and post-classical Iranian architecture, popular influences on art in the 1960s following the White Revolution. Iran's increasing wealth sparked modernization programs and sent the art industry into a renaissance-like period. History =Name= The first name associated with this monument was DarvƒÅze-ye Kuro≈° (\\"Gate of Cyrus\\"), and at the time of the Centenary Celebrations, Asadollah Alam, who chaired the Council of Celebrations, referred to the monument as DarvƒÅze-ye ≈†ƒÅhan≈°ƒÅhi (\\"Imperial Gate\\"). The monument's ultimate official name was decided before the announcement of the competition for the monument's design in September 1966. Bahram Farahvashi, a scholar and professor of ancient Iranian languages who worked with the Council of Celebrations, came up with the officially designated name of the structure, ≈†ahyƒÅd ƒÄryƒÅmehr. Built in 1971 in commemoration of the 2,500th year of the foundation of the Imperial State of Iran, this \\"gateway into Tehran\\" was named the ≈†ahyƒÅd (\\"Shah's Memorial\\") in honor of the Shah (Mohammad Reza Pahlavi), but was later renamed ƒÄzƒÅdi (\\"Freedom\\") following the 1979 Revolution. =Construction= Plans of the Shahyad Tower. During the 1960s, Iran became a major oil-exporting country, and using the newly-found wealth, the Shah launched programs to modernize and industrialize the country. This followed a cultural growth that architect Hossein Amanat describes as \\"a mini renaissance\\". In 1966, Amanat won a competition to design the building. Due to governmental concerns, Amanat was required to sign underneath contracts \\"on condition of the approval of the Council of Celebrations\\", which would serve as the client. Amanat planned to contract the British company of Arup to assist in the structural design of the tower, as he was impressed by their contributions towards the design and construction of the Sydney Opera House. He initially faced opposition from the head of the council, as well as several conservative and nationalistic Iranian engineers, as he was turning to a foreign engineer for assistance. Despite that, the Shah supported Amanat, sending a letter to the council which would leave the decision to the architect. Shahbanu Farah Pahlavi was also supportive of Amanat's decisions. Amanat told the BBC World News in an interview that \\"overall, the building starts from the base and moves up towards the sky.\\" He states that he was inspired to design the tower in this way because he felt that Iran \\"should be moving towards a higher level.\\" According to him, the main vault is a Sassanian arch representing the classical era, while the broken arch above it is a popular medieval form of arch representing the post-classical era. The \\"network of ribs\\", which connects the arches together, would represent the connection between classical and post-classical Iran. Built with white marble from Isfahan Province, the monument includes 8,000 blocks of stone. The stones were all located and supplied by Ghanbar Rahimi, who was well known for his extensive knowledge of quarries, often known as the SoltƒÅn-e Sang-e IrƒÅn (\\"Iran's Sultan of Stone\\"). Computers were used to \\"define its complex woven surfaces,\\" which, at the time, was a new technological technique. The main contractor for the construction of the tower was the MAP Company, supervised by Ghaffar Davarpanah Varnosfaderani, a renowned Iranian stonemason. The project was mainly funded by a group of five hundred Iranian industrialists. According to a report by MEED, the construction cost about six million dollars. On October 16, 1971, the inauguration of the tower took place. However, it was not until January 14, 1972 that the tower was open to the public. The iconic Martyrs' Memorial in Algiers, which was built in 1982, shows a strong influence by this monument. Museum The Azadi Museum is located at the basement level. Inside are austere black walls of dignified proportions. A concrete mesh forms the ceiling. Heavy doors open onto a crypt with subdued lighting from showcases, each containing an object. The museum houses a number of gold and enamel pieces, painted pottery, marble and paintings. Approximately fifty pieces have been selected, each representing a particular period in Iran's history. Among the earliest items on display are square flagstones, gold sheeting, and terracotta tablets from Susa covered with cuneiform characters. Before the 1979 Revolution, the main display was occupied by a copy of the Cyrus Cylinder, the original being kept at the British Museum. A translation of the cylinder's cuneiform inscription is inscribed in golden letters on the wall of one of the galleries leading to the museum's audio-visual center. A similar plaque facing the cylinder listed the Twelve Points of the White Revolution. Next, to the Cyrus Cylinder, there was a gold plaque commemorating the original presentation of the museum to Mohammad Reza Pahlavi by the Mayor of Tehran. Potteries, ceramics, varnished porcelains (such as a seventh-century blue and gold dish from Gorgan), an illuminated Quran, and miniatures highlighted milestones in the country's history up to the 19th century, which were represented by two painted panels from Empress and the structure was to represent Farah Pahlavi as in is stated in some ancient texts. Events Azadi Tower during the 1979 Iranian Revolution =Audiovisual theater (1971)= The original show, devised in 1971, was replaced in 1975 by a new one which invited visitors to discover Iran's geographic and natural diversity along with its fundamental historical elements. It exhibited a number of national achievements, technical undertakings, calligraphed poems, and miniature paintings. The project, devised by a Czechoslovak company, required 12,000 metres of film, 20,000 color slides, 20 movie projectors, and 120 slide projectors. The audiovisual programs were directed by professor Jaroslav Friƒç (1928‚Äì2000). Five computers operated the entire system. =Gate of Words light show (2015)= German artist Philipp Geist organized a projection mapping installation named Gate of Words at the Azadi Tower, on the occasion of the German Unity Day.The Guardian: German artist lights up Tehran's freedom arch ‚Äì in pictures. 7 October 2015.

The glowing words were in English, German and Persian, moving in sync with live music on the walls of the tower.Philipp Geist was invited by the German Embassy to propose such a project at the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the German Reunification.

For much of the stunt, he sat in a glass booth in Times Square. After a few days he began to hallucinate, and for the last 66 hours the observing scientists and doctors gave him drugs to help him stay awake. He was broadcasting for WMGM in New York City at the time. Tripp suffered psychologically. After the stunt, he began to think he was an imposter of himself and kept that thought for some time. His career soon suffered a massive downturn when he was involved in the payola scandal of 1960. Like several other disc jockeys (including Alan Freed) he had been playing particular records in return for gifts from record companies. Indicted only weeks after his stunt, it emerged that he had accepted $36,050 in bribes. Despite his claim that he \\"never took a dime from anyone\\", he was found guilty on a charge of commercial bribery, receiving a $500 fine and a six-month suspended sentence. Even his wakeathon record did not endure for long. Other DJs had quickly attempted to beat it (such publicity stunts being common in radio broadcasting at the time) and Dave Hunter, in Jacksonville, Florida, soon claimed success (225 hours). Six years after Tripp's record, it was smashed by high school student Randy Gardner, who lasted 11 days. After leaving WMGM, Tripp was unable to re-establish himself in the world of radio, drifting from KYA in San Francisco to KGFJ in Los Angeles and finally WOHO in Toledo, Ohio, before quitting the medium in 1967. Returning to L.A., he had more success working in physical fitness sales and marketing. He diversified into freelance motivational speaking, writing and stockbrokering before settling into a Palm Springs, California retirement. Overall he had spent twenty years in broadcasting: he began with WEXL in Royal Oak, Michigan, in 1947 then on to Kansas City, Missouri in 1953 where he worked for KUDL (where he adopted the nickname \\"The Bald Kid In The Third Row\\", apparently a description made by a parent upon spotting him among many rows of new-borns in a hospital shortly after his birth) and then WHB (restyling himself as \\"The Curly-headed Kid In The Third Row\\"; he was not, in reality, bald) where he pioneered the Top-40 format. It was in 1955 that he landed his ill-fated job with WMGM in New York City, presenting \\"Your Hits of the Week\\". Tripp died at the age of 73 following a stroke, leaving two sons and two daughters. His four marriages all ended in divorce. T.C. Boyle's short story \\"The Kind Assassin\\", in Tooth and Claw (2005), is inspired by Tripp's \\"Wake-A-Thon\\".

It contains two mountain ranges running down its centre: the Caha Mountains and the Slieve Miskish Mountains. The northern part of the peninsula from Kenmare to near Ardgroom is in County Kerry, while the rest forms the barony of Bear in County Cork. The main features of Beara's landscape were formed during the quaternary period which ended 12,000 years ago. There is evidence of human activity on the peninsula dating from at least 3000 BC. Later it was invaded by Vikings, and in the 17th century became a defensive front for the English army against French invasion. Its population peaked at 39,000 before the Great Famine; today there are less than 6000 living in the area. The peninsula contains a long and varied scenic coast, two mountain ranges and a number of passes, and forms part of the Wild Atlantic Way. History Map of ancient sites on the Beara Peninsula The peninsula was glaciated during the quaternary period; evidence from this era survives in the form of striae around Hungry hill, and erratics on the western road into Glengarriff. The first signs of human activity date to c 3000 BC, and consist of traces of Early Bronze Age settlements. The landscape is rich in megalithic monuments and other prehistoric archeological sites, including over 70 standing stones, 22 stone rows, 38 dolmens, as well as wedge tombs, stone circles. Later the area became a Viking settlement, as evident in place names such as Longhart. Levels of Early Medieval activity can be deduced from the presence of many ringforts, cashels, cairns and fulacht fiadh. In the modern period, Beara was the traditional seat of power of the O'Sullivan Beare and one of the last points of native Irish resistance after the 1601 Battle of Kinsale. Allihies, on the tip of Beara, later became major copper mines and featured in the Daphne du Maurier novel 'Hungry Hill' - later made into a film. Around 1796, the French navy threatened Bantry Bay, and English forces responded by erecting defences on Bere Island, including martello and watch towers. A plaque placed by the Beara Historical Society offers the following to explain the origin of the name: :In the early centuries AD, Conn C√©ad Cathach (Con of the hundred battles) fought a fierce battle against Owen M√≥r, King of Ireland at Cloch Barraige. Owen was badly injured in the battle. Those of his followers who survived took him to Inis Greaghraighe (now known as Bere Island) as a safe place for him to recover. There, the fairy Eadaoin took him to her grian√°n (bower) where she nursed him back to full health. Nowadays, this place is known as Greenane. :Owen and his followers then sailed southwards until they reached Spain. There he met and married Beara, daughter of the King of Castille. :Later Owen, Beara and a large army sailed from Spain and landed in Greenane. Owen took his wife to the highest hill on the island and looking across the harbour he named the island and the whole peninsula 'Beara' in honour of his wife. Rossmacowen, Kilmacowen and Buaile Owen most likely are named after Owen M√≥r and his son. According to local tradition Owen‚Äôs wife, Princess Beara, died and was buried in Ballard Commons in the remote and peaceful valley between Maulin and Knocknagree Mountains. The scholar Nollaig √ì Mura√≠le doubted this story, and instead suggested a connection to the Kerry dialect word b√©arach, b√©ar[r]a which refers to \\"rocks on the seashore against which the sea breaks with great force\\". Tourism Stookeennaloakareha Tourist sites on the peninsula include the ruins of Dunboy Castle and Puxley Mansion, the Copper Mines Museum in Allihies, Garnish Island by Glengarriff (maintained by the OPW) and Derreen Garden (privately owned but open to the public). The \\"Ring of Beara\\" follows the roads for about circumnavigating the peninsula. It starts in Kenmare, crossing the Healy Pass through Adrigole, passing Castletownbere, Allihies, and turn offs to Dursey Island, Eyeries and Ardgroom, ending in Glengarriff. The area has had a long connection with the sea; Castletownbere is one of Ireland's largest fishing ports and the largest white fishing port. It has diving, sailing and boating facilities. The Beara Way is a long distance walking route around the peninsula with several historical and archaeological sites en route. The main towns on the route are Castletownbere, Kenmare and Glengarriff. There are a number of villages in between including Allihies, Ardgroom, Adrigole, and Eyeries. Bere Island and Dursey Island can be reached by a short trip by ferry or cable car respectively. The Beara Way is part of the Beara-Breifne Way based on the march of O'Sullivan Beare in 1603. The tallest Ogham stone in Europe, the Ballycrovane Ogham Stone, is close to Eyeries.

Brantford Expositor, 7 April 1999. He began performing on the Queen Street West club scene in the 1980s, both as a solo artist under the name Scott B. and with the band Scott B. Sympathy.\\"'Folk music' is cooking ... with new ingredients\\". Toronto Star, 20 March 1987. The name \\"Scott B. Sympathy\\" was originally intended as the name of the band, with his own stage name simply being \\"Scott B.\\" However, this was so frequently misunderstood by fans and music journalists that when crediting the band's 1996 album Long Way Down to \\"The Sympathy\\" still failed to resolve the confusion, Bradshaw eventually relented and adopted \\"Scott B. Sympathy\\" as his own stage name. Career The band began as a regular act at Elvis Mondays, a regular alternative rock club night in Toronto organized by William New;\\"Like namesake, Elvis Monday refuses to die\\". Toronto Star, 10 May 1999. Bradshaw also played as a supporting musician in New's own band Groovy Religion.\\"What's in a name? Everything but Elvis\\". Toronto Star, 8 September 1994.

Toronto Star, 26 September 1996. By this time the band had a more stable lineup, including guitarist Gary Robertson, bassist Ron Bock and drummer Dave O'Sullivan. The same lineup remained in place for the band's 1996 album Long Way Down, which was credited to The Sympathy. The band's final album, Unfinished Sympathy, was again titled with a pun, referencing Schubert's famous \\"Unfinished Symphony\\". (The album title bears no relation to Massive Attack's 1991 single \\"Unfinished Sympathy\\", which Bradshaw was unaware of at the time of the album's release.) The album included contributions from Ashley MacIsaac, Bazil Donovan, Tyler Yarema, Michelle Josef, Oh Susanna and Cindy Church.\\"Unfinished Sympathy\\". Toronto Star, 13 February 1999.

More a tendency than a movement, poetic realism is not strongly unified like Soviet montage or French Impressionism but were individuals who created this lyrical style. Its leading filmmakers were Pierre Chenal, Jean Vigo, Julien Duvivier, Marcel Carn√©, and, perhaps the movement's most significant director, Jean Renoir. Renoir made a wide variety of films some influenced by the leftist Popular Front group and even a lyrical short feature film.Thompson, Kristin, Bordwell,David. (2010) Film History: An Introduction, Third Edition, New York, NY: The McGraw-Hill Companies. p. 265-268 Frequent stars of these films were Jean Gabin, Michel Simon, Simone Signoret, and Mich√®le Morgan. Poetic realism films are \\"recreated realism\\", stylised and studio-bound, rather than approaching the \\"socio-realism of the documentary\\".Susan Hayward Cinema studies: the key concepts, Routledge, 2006, p.151 They usually have a fatalistic view of life with their characters living on the margins of society, either as unemployed members of the working class or as criminals. After a life of disappointment, the characters get a last chance at love but are ultimately disappointed again and the films frequently end with disillusionment or death. The overall tone often resembles nostalgia and bitterness. They are \\"poetic\\" because of a heightened aestheticism that sometimes draws attention to the representational aspects of the films. Though these films were weak in the production sector, French cinema did create a high proportion of such influential films largely due to the talented people in the industry in the 1930s who were working on them. The most popular set designer was Lazare Meerson. Composers who worked on these films included Georges Auric, Arthur Honegger, Joseph Kosma, and Maurice Jaubert. Screenwriters who contributed to many of the films included Charles Spaak and Jacques Pr√©vert.Thompson, Kristin, Bordwell, David. (2010) Film History: An Introduction, Third Edition, New York, NY: The McGraw-Hill Companies. p. 265-268 The movement had a significant impact on later film movements, in particular Italian neorealism (many of the neorealists, most notably Luchino Visconti, worked with poetic realist directors before starting their own careers as film critics and directors) and the French New Wave. Notable examples Forerunners of the poetic realist movement include: * La Petite Lise (1930) by Jean Gr√©millon * Pension Mimosas (1934) by Jacques Feyder * Le Grand Jeu (1934) by Jacques Feyder Poetic realist works from leading filmmakers of the mid-to-late 1930s include: * L'Atalante (1934) by Jean Vigo * La Bandera (1935) by Julien Duvivier * La Belle √âquipe (1936) by Julien Duvivier * Les Bas-fonds/The Lower Depths (1936) by Jean Renoir * P√©p√© le Moko (1937) by Julien Duvivier * La Grande Illusion (1937) by Jean Renoir * La B√™te humaine (1938) by Jean Renoir * Le Quai des brumes (1938) by Marcel Carn√© * H√¥tel du Nord (1938) by Marcel Carn√© * La R√®gle du jeu (1939) by Jean Renoir * Le Jour se l√®ve (1939) by Marcel Carn√©  Further reading  * COMOLLI Jean- Louis, ¬´ R√âALISME PO√âTIQUE, cin√©ma fran√ßais ¬ª, dans Encyclop√¶dia Universalis , consult√© le 28 juillet 2019.

Procurator-General of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic from 1944 to 1953, Rudenko became Procurator-General of the entire Soviet Union after 1953. He is well known internationally for acting as chief prosecutor for the USSR at the 1946 trial of the major Nazi war criminals in Nuremberg. He was also chief prosecutor at the \\"Trial of the Sixteen\\" (Polish Underground leaders) held in Moscow the year before. At the time he served at Nuremberg, Rudenko held the rank of Lieutenant-General within the USSR Procuracy. In 1961 Rudenko was elected to the CPSU Central Committee. In 1972 he was awarded the Soviet honorary title of Hero of Socialist Labor. Ukraine to 1953 Rudenko was one of the chief commandants of NKVD special camp Nr. 7, a former Nazi concentration camp, until its closure in 1950. Of the 60,000 prisoners incarcerated there under his supervision, at least 12,000 died due to malnutrition and disease. In October 1951, as Procurator-General of the Ukrainian SSR, he personally led prosecution in the trial of OUN member Mykhailo Stakhur who in October 1949 killed the writer Yaroslav Halan.

As Procurator General of the Soviet Union, Rudenko played a major role in devising measures to deal with the growing dissident movement within the USSR. In 1967, he and then KGB chairman Vladimir Semichastny submitted proposals as to how to deal with those defending the writers Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky during and after their trial, without provoking a strong reaction abroad or within the country. This included mention of the \\"mental illness\\" suffered by several prominent dissidents.Joint KGB-Procurator-General's Memorandum to Central Committee, 27 January 1967 (Pb 32/5), Bukovsky Archive online. One measure, proposed jointly with Yury Andropov in late 1972, was to reduce the number of arrests and convictions by reinforcing the issue of \\"prophylactic\\" warnings to individuals, cautioning them that their activities could lead to prosecution under Articles 70 and 1901 of the RSFSR Criminal Code.Joint KGB-Procurator- General's Memorandum to Central Committee, 16 November 1972 (Pb 67/XVI), Bukovsky Archive online.

Hyperkinesia is a state of excessive restlessness which is featured in a large variety of disorders that affect the ability to control motor movement, such as Huntington's disease. It is the opposite of hypokinesia, which refers to decreased bodily movement, as commonly manifested in Parkinson's disease. Many hyperkinetic movements are the result of improper regulation of the basal ganglia‚Äìthalamocortical circuitry. Overactivity of a direct pathway combined with decreased activity of an indirect pathway results in activation of thalamic neurons and excitation of cortical neurons, resulting in increased motor output. Often, hyperkinesia is paired with hypotonia, a decrease in muscle tone. Many hyperkinetic disorders are psychological in nature and are typically prominent in childhood. Depending on the specific type of hyperkinetic movement, there are different treatment options available to minimize the symptoms, including different medical and surgical therapies. The word hyperkinesis comes from the Greek hyper, meaning \\"increased,\\" and kinein, meaning \\"to move.\\" Classification Hyperglycemia-induced involuntary movements (hemichorea and bilateral dystonia) in a 62-year-old Japanese woman with type 1 diabetes. Basic hyperkinetic movements can be defined as any unwanted, excess movement. Such abnormal movements can be distinguished from each other on the basis of whether or not, or to what degree they are, rhythmic, discrete, repeated, and random. In evaluating the individual with a suspected form of hyperkinesia, the physician will record a thorough medical history including a clear description of the movements in question, medications prescribed in the past and present, family history of similar diseases, medical history including past infections, and any past exposure to toxic chemicals. Hyperkinesia is a defining feature of many childhood movement disorders, yet distinctly differs from both hypertonia and negative signs, which are also typically involved in such disorders. Several prominent forms of hyperkinetic movements include: =Ataxia= The term ataxia refers to a group of progressive neurological diseases that alter coordination and balance. Ataxias are often characterized by poor coordination of hand and eye movements, speech problems, and a wide-set, unsteady gait. Possible causes of ataxias may include stroke, tumor, infection, trauma, or degenerative changes in the cerebellum. These types of hyperkinetic movements can be further classified into two groups. The first group, hereditary ataxias, affect the cerebellum and spinal cord and are passed from one generation to the next through a defective gene. A common hereditary ataxia is Friedreich's ataxia. in contrast, sporadic ataxias occur spontaneously in individuals with no known family history of such movement disorders. =Athetosis= Athetosis is defined as a slow, continuous, involuntary writhing movement that prevents the individual from maintaining a stable posture. These are smooth, nonrhythmic movements that appear random and are not composed of any recognizable sub- movements. They mainly involve the distal extremities, but can also involve the face, neck, and trunk. Athetosis can occur in the resting state, as well as in conjunction with chorea and dystonia. When combined with chorea, as in cerebral palsy, the term \\"choreoathetosis\\" is frequently used. =Chorea= Chorea is a continuous, random-appearing sequence of one or more discrete involuntary movements or movement fragments. Although chorea consists of discrete movements, many are often strung together in time, thus making it difficult to identify each movement's start and end point. These movements can involve the face, trunk, neck, tongue, and extremities. Unlike dystonic movements, chorea-associated movements are often more rapid, random and unpredictable. Movements are repeated, but not rhythmic in nature. Children with chorea appear fidgety and will often try to disguise the random movements by voluntarily turning the involuntary, abnormal movement into a seemingly more normal, purposeful motion. Chorea may result specifically from disorders of the basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum. It has also been associated with encephalitis, hyperthyroidism, anticholinergic toxicity, and other genetic and metabolic disorders. Chorea is also the prominent movement featured in Huntington's disease. =Dystonia= Dystonia is a movement disorder in which involuntarily sustained or intermittent muscle contractions cause twisting or repetitive movements, abnormal postures, or both. Such abnormal postures include foot inversion, wrist ulnar deviation, or lordotic trunk twisting. They can be localized to specific parts of the body or be generalized to many different muscle groups. These postures are often sustained for long periods of time and can be combined in time. Dystonic movements can augment hyperkinetic movements, especially when linked to voluntary movements. Blepharospasm is a type of dystonia characterized by involuntary contraction of the muscles controlling the eyelids. Symptoms can range from a simple increased frequency of blinking to constant, painful eye closure leading to functional blindness. Oromandibular dystonia is a type of dystonia marked by forceful contractions of the lower face, which causes the mouth to open or close. Chewing motions and unusual tongue movements may also occur with this type of dystonia. Laryngeal dystonia or spasmodic dysphonia results from abnormal contraction of muscles in the voice box, resulting in altered voice production. Patients may have a strained-strangled quality to their voice or, in some cases, a whispering or breathy quality. Cervical dystonia (CD) or spasmodic torticollis is characterized by muscle spasms of the head and neck, which may be painful and cause the neck to twist into unusual positions or postures. Writer's cramp and musician's cramp is a task- specific dystonia, meaning that it only occurs when performing certain tasks. Writer's cramp is a contraction of hand and/or arm muscles that happens only when a patient is writing. It does not occur in other situations, such as when a patient is typing or eating. Musician's cramp occurs only when a musician plays an instrument, and the type of cramp experienced is specific to the instrument. For example, pianists may experience cramping of their hands when playing, while brass players may have cramping or contractions of their mouth muscles. =Hemiballismus= Typically caused by damage to the subthalamic nucleus or nuclei, hemiballismus movements are nonrhythmic, rapid, nonsuppressible, and violent. They usually occur in an isolated body part, such as the proximal arm. =Hemifacial spasm= Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is characterized by involuntary contraction of facial muscles, typically occurring only on one side of the face. Like blepharospasm, the frequency of contractions in hemifacial spasm may range from intermittent to frequent and constant. The unilateral blepharospasm of HFS may interfere with routine tasks such as driving. In addition to medication, patients may respond well to treatment with Botox. HFS may be due to vascular compression of the nerves going to the muscles of the face. For these patients, surgical decompression may be a viable option for the improvement of symptoms. =Myoclonus= Myoclonus is defined as a sequence of repeated, often nonrhythmic, brief, shock-like jerks due to sudden involuntary contraction or relaxation of one or more muscles. These movements may be asynchronous, in which several muscles contract variably in time, synchronous, in which muscles contract simultaneously, or spreading, in which several muscles contract sequentially. It is characterized by a sudden, unidirectional movement due to muscle contraction, followed by a relaxation period in which the muscle is no longer contracted. However, when this relaxation phase is decreased, as when muscle contractions become faster, a myoclonic tremor results. Myoclonus can often be associated with seizures, delirium, dementia, and other signs of neurological disease and gray matter damage. =Stereotypies= Stereotypies are repetitive, rhythmic, simple movements that can be voluntarily suppressed. Like tremors, they are typically back and forth movements, and most commonly occur bilaterally. They often involve fingers, wrists, or proximal portions of the upper extremities. Although, like tics, they can stem from stress and excitement, there is no underlying urge to move associated with stereotypies and these movements can be stopped with distraction. When aware of the movements, the child can also suppress them voluntarily. Stereotypies are often associated with developmental syndromes, including the autism spectrum disorders. Stereotypies are quite common in preschool-aged children and for this reason are not necessarily indicative of neurological pathology on their own. =Tardive dyskinesia / tardive dystonia= Tardive dyskinesia or tardive dystonia, both referred to as \\"TD\\", refers to a wide variety of involuntary stereotypical movements caused by the prolonged use of dopamine receptor- blocking agents. The most common types of these agents are antipsychotics and anti-nausea agents. The classic form of TD refers to stereotypic movements of the mouth, which resemble chewing. However, TD can also appear as other involuntary movements such as chorea, dystonia, or tics. =Tics= A tic can be defined as a repeated, individually recognizable, intermittent movement or movement fragments that are almost always briefly suppressible and are usually associated with awareness of an urge to perform the movement. These abnormal movements occur with intervening periods of normal movement. These movements are predictable, often triggered by stress, excitement, suggestion, or brief voluntary suppressibility. Many children say that the onset of tics can stem from the strong urge to move. Tics can be either muscular (alter normal motor function) or vocal (alter normal speech) in nature and most commonly involve the face, mouth, eyes, head, neck or shoulder muscles. Tics can also be classified as simple motor tics (a single brief stereotyped movement or movement fragment), complex motor tics (a more complex or sequential movement involving multiple muscle groups), or phonic tics (including simple, brief phonations or vocalizations). When both motor and vocal tics are present and persist for more than one year, a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome (TS) is likely. TS is an inherited neurobehavioral disorder characterized by both motor and vocal tics. Many individuals with TS may also develop obsessions, compulsions, inattention and hyperactivity. TS usually begins in childhood. Up to 5% of the population suffers from tics, but at least 20% of boys will have developed tics at some point in their lifetimes. =Tremor= A tremor can be defined as a rhythmic, back and forth or oscillating involuntary movement about a joint axis. Tremors are symmetric about a midpoint within the movement, and both portions of the movement occur at the same speed. Unlike the other hyperkinetic movements, tremors lack both the jerking associated movements and posturing. Essential tremor (ET), also known as benign essential tremor, or familial tremor, is the most common movement disorder. It is estimated that 5 percent of people worldwide suffer from this condition, affecting those of all ages but typically staying within families. ET typically affects the hands and arms but can also affect the head, voice, chin, trunk and legs. Both sides of the body tend to be equally affected. The tremor is called an action tremor, becoming noticeable in the arms when they are being used. Patients often report that alcohol helps lessen the symptoms. Primary medical treatments for ET are usually beta-blockers. For patients who fail to respond sufficiently to medication, deep brain stimulation and thalamotomy can be highly effective. A ‚Äúflapping tremor,‚Äù or asterixis, is characterized by irregular flapping-hand movement, which appears most often with outstretched arms and wrist extension. Individuals with this condition resemble birds flapping their wings. =Volitional hyperkinesia= Volitional hyperkinesia refers to any type of involuntary movement described above that interrupts an intended voluntary muscular movement. These movements tend to be jolts that present suddenly during an otherwise smoothly coordinated action of skeletal muscle. Pathophysiology The basal ganglia are involved in hyperkinesia. The causes of the majority of the above hyperkinetic movements can be traced to improper modulation of the basal ganglia by the subthalamic nucleus. In many cases, the excitatory output of the subthalamic nucleus is reduced, leading to a reduced inhibitory outflow of the basal ganglia. Without the normal restraining influence of the basal ganglia, upper motor neurons of the circuit tend to become more readily activated by inappropriate signals, resulting in the characteristic abnormal movements. There are two pathways involving basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry, both of which originate in the neostriatum. The direct pathway projects to the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). These projections are inhibitory and have been found to utilize both GABA and substance P. The indirect pathway, which projects to the globus pallidus external (GPe), is also inhibitory and uses GABA and enkephalin. The GPe projects to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which then projects back to the GPi and GPe via excitatory, glutaminergic pathways. Excitation of the direct pathway leads to disinhibition of the GABAergic neurons of the GPi/SNr, ultimately resulting in activation of thalamic neurons and excitation of cortical neurons. In contrast, activation of the indirect pathway stimulates the inhibitory striatal GABA/enkephalin projection, resulting in suppression of GABAerigc neuronal activity. This, in turn, causes disinhibition of the STN excitatory outputs, thus triggering the GPi/SNr inhibitory projections to the thalamus and decreased activation of cortical neurons. While deregulation of either of these pathways can disturb motor output, hyperkinesia is thought to result from overactivity of the direct pathway and decreased activity from the indirect pathway. Hyperkinesia occurs when dopamine receptors, and norepinephrine receptors to a lesser extent, within the cortex and the brainstem are more sensitive to dopamine or when the dopaminergic receptors/neurons are hyperactive. Hyperkinesia can be caused by a large number of different diseases including metabolic disorders, endocrine disorders, heritable disorders, vascular disorders, or traumatic disorders. Other causes include toxins within the brain, autoimmune disease, and infections, which include meningitis. Since the basal ganglia often have many connections with the frontal lobe of the brain, hyperkinesia can be associated with neurobehavioral or neuropsychiatric disorders such as mood changes, psychosis, anxiety, disinhibition, cognitive impairments, and inappropriate behavior. In children, primary dystonia is usually inherited genetically. Secondary dystonia, however, is most commonly caused by dyskinetic cerebral palsy, due to hypoxic or ischemic injury to the basal ganglia, brainstem, cerebellum, and thalamus during the prenatal or infantile stages of development. Chorea and ballism can be caused by damage to the subthalamic nucleus. Chorea can be secondary to hyperthyroidism. Athetosis can be secondary to sensory loss in the distal limbs; this is called pseudoathetosis in adults but is not yet proven in children. Diagnosis =Definition= There are various terms which refer to specific movement mechanisms that contribute to the differential diagnoses of hyperkinetic disorders. As defined by Hogan and Sternad, ‚Äúposture‚Äù is a nonzero time period during which bodily movement is minimal. When a movement is called ‚Äúdiscrete,‚Äù it means that a new posture is assumed without any other postures interrupting the process. ‚ÄúRhythmic‚Äù movements are those that occur in cycles of similar movements. ‚ÄúRepetitive,‚Äù ‚Äúrecurrent,‚Äù and ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù movements feature a certain bodily or joint position that occur more than once in a period, but not necessarily in a cyclic manner. Overflow refers to unwanted movements that occur during a desired movement. It may occur in situations where the individual's motor intention spreads to either nearby or distant muscles, taking away from the original goal of the movement. Overflow is often associated with dystonic movements and may be due to a poor focusing of muscle activity and inability to suppress unwanted muscle movement. Co-contraction refers to a voluntary movement performed to suppress the involuntary movement, such as forcing one's wrist toward the body to stop it from involuntarily moving away from the body. In evaluating these signs and symptoms, one must consider the frequency of repetition, whether or not the movements can be suppressed voluntarily (either by cognitive decisions, restraint, or sensory tricks), the awareness of the affected individual during the movement events, any urges to make the movements, and if the affected individual feels rewarded after having completed the movement. The context of the movement should also be noted; this means that a movement could be triggered in a certain posture, while at rest, during action, or during a specific task. The movement's quality can also be described in observing whether or not the movement can be categorized as a normal movement by an unaffected individual, or one that is not normally made on a daily basis by unaffected individuals. =Differential diagnosis= Diseases that feature one or more hyperkinetic movements as prominent symptoms include: Huntington's disease Hyperkinesia, more specifically chorea, is the hallmark symptom of Huntington's disease, formerly referred to as Huntington‚Äôs chorea. Appropriately, chorea is derived from the Greek word, khoros, meaning ‚Äúdance.‚Äù The extent of the hyperkinesia exhibited in the disease can vary from solely the little finger to the entire body, resembling purposeful movements but occurring involuntarily. In children, rigidity and seizures are also symptoms. Other hyperkinetic symptoms include: * Head turning to shift eye position * Facial movements, including grimaces * Slow, uncontrolled movements * Quick, sudden, sometimes wild jerking movements of the arms, legs, face, and other body parts * Unsteady gait * Abnormal reflexes * ‚Äúprancing,‚Äù or a wide walk The disease is characterized further by the gradual onset of defects in behavior and cognition, including dementia and speech impediments, beginning in the fourth or fifth decades of life. Death usually occurs within 10‚Äì20 years after a progressive worsening of symptoms. Caused by the Huntington gene, the disease eventually contributes to selective atrophy of the Caudate nucleus and Putamen, especially of GABAergic and acetylcholinergic neurons, with some additional degeneration of the frontal and temporal cortices of the brain. The disrupted signaling in the basal ganglia network is thought to cause the hyperkinesia. There is no known cure for Huntington's disease, yet there is treatment available to minimize the hyperkinetic movements. Dopamine blockers, such as haloperidol, tetrabenazine, and amantadine, are often effective in this regard. Wilson's disease Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson, the neurologist most known for his description of what came to be known as Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare inherited disorder in which patients have a problem metabolizing copper. In patients with WD, copper accumulates in the liver and other parts of the body, particularly the brain, eyes and kidneys. Upon accumulation in the brain, patients may experience speech problems, incoordination, swallowing problems, and prominent hyperkinetic symptoms including tremor, dystonia, and gait difficulties. Psychiatric disturbances such as irritability, impulsiveness, aggressiveness, and mood disturbances are also common. Restless leg syndrome Restless leg syndrome is a disorder in which patients feel uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations in the legs. These sensations usually occur in the evening, while the patient is sitting or lying down and relaxing. Patients feel like they have to move their legs to relieve the sensations, and walking generally makes the symptoms disappear. In many patients, this can lead to insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. This is a very common problem and can occur at any age. Similarly, the syndrome akathisia ranges from mildly compulsive movement usually in the legs to intense frenzied motion. These movements are partly voluntary, and the individual typically has the ability to suppress them for short amounts of time. Like restless leg syndrome, relief results from movement. Post- stroke repercussions A multitude of movement disorders have been observed after either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Some examples include athetosis, chorea with or without hemiballismus, tremor, dystonia, and segmental or focal myoclonus, although the prevalence of these manifestations after stroke is quite low. The amount of time that passes between stroke event and presentation of hyperkinesia depends on the type of hyperkinetic movement since their pathologies slightly differ. Chorea tends to affect older stroke victims while dystonia tends to affect younger ones. Men and women have an equal chance of developing the hyperkinetic movements after stroke. Strokes causing small, deep lesions in the basal ganglia, brain stem and thalamus are those most likely to be associated with post-stroke hyperkinesia. Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy DRPLA is a rare trinucleotide repeat disorder (polyglutamine disease) that can be juvenile-onset (< 20 years), early adult-onset (20‚Äì40 years), or late adult-onset (> 40 years). Late adult-onset DRPLA is characterized by ataxia, choreoathetosis and dementia. Early adult-onset DRPLA also includes seizures and myoclonus. Juvenile-onset DRPLA presents with ataxia and symptoms consistent with progressive myoclonus epilepsy (myoclonus, multiple seizure types and dementia). Other symptoms that have been described include cervical dystonia, corneal endothelial degeneration autism, and surgery-resistant obstructive sleep apnea. Management =Athetosis, chorea and hemiballismus= Before prescribing medication for these conditions which often resolve spontaneously, recommendations have pointed to improved skin hygiene, good hydration via fluids, good nutrition, and installation of padded bed rails with use of proper mattresses. Pharmacological treatments include the typical neuroleptic agents such as fluphenazine, pimozide, haloperidol and perphenazine which block dopamine receptors; these are the first line of treatment for hemiballismus. Quetiapine, sulpiride and olanzapine, the atypical neuroleptic agents, are less likely to yield drug-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia. Tetrabenazine works by depleting presynaptic dopamine and blocking postsynaptic dopamine receptors, while reserpine depletes the presynaptic catecholamine and serotonin stores; both of these drugs treat hemiballismus successfully but may cause depression, hypotension and parkinsonism. Sodium valproate and clonazepam have been successful in a limited number of cases. Stereotactic ventral intermediate thalamotomy and use of a thalamic stimulator have been shown to be effective in treating these conditions. =Essential tremor= The medical treatment of essential tremor at the Movement Disorders Clinic at Baylor College of Medicine begins with minimizing stress and tremorgenic drugs along with recommending a restricted intake of beverages containing caffeine as a precaution, although caffeine has not been shown to significantly intensify the presentation of essential tremor. Alcohol amounting to a blood concentration of only 0.3% has been shown to reduce the amplitude of essential tremor in two-thirds of patients; for this reason it may be used as a prophylactic treatment before events during which one would be embarrassed by the tremor presenting itself. Using alcohol regularly and/or in excess to treat tremors is highly unadvisable, as there is a purported correlation between tremor and alcoholism. Alcohol is thought to stabilize neuronal membranes via potentiation of GABA receptor-mediated chloride influx. It has been demonstrated in essential tremor animal models that the food additive 1-octanol suppresses tremors induced by harmaline, and decreases the amplitude of essential tremor for about 90 minutes. Two of the most valuable drug treatments for essential tremor are propranolol, a beta blocker, and primidone, an anticonvulsant. Propranolol is much more effective for hand tremor than head and voice tremor. Some beta-adrenergic blockers (beta blockers) are not lipid-soluble and therefore cannot cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier (propranolol being an exception), but can still act against tremors; this indicates that this drug's mechanism of therapy may be influenced by peripheral beta-adrenergic receptors. Primidone's mechanism of tremor prevention has been shown significantly in controlled clinical studies. The benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and barbiturates have been shown to reduce presentation of several types of tremor, including the essential variety. Controlled clinical trials of gabapentin yielded mixed results in efficacy against essential tremor while topiramate was shown to be effective in a larger double-blind controlled study, resulting in both lower Fahn- Tolosa-Marin tremor scale ratings and better function and disability as compared to placebo. It has been shown in two double-blind controlled studies that injection of botulinum toxin into muscles used to produce oscillatory movements of essential tremors, such as forearm, wrist and finger flexors, may decrease the amplitude of hand tremor for approximately three months and that injections of the toxin may reduce essential tremor presenting in the head and voice. The toxin also may help tremor causing difficulty in writing, although properly adapted writing devices may be more efficient. Due to high incidence of side effects, use of botulinum toxin has only received a C level of support from the scientific community. Deep brain stimulation toward the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus and potentially the subthalamic nucleus and caudal zona incerta nucleus have been shown to reduce tremor in numerous studies. That toward the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus has been shown to reduce contralateral and some ipsilateral tremor along with tremors of the cerebellar outflow, head, resting state and those related to hand tasks; however, the treatment has been shown to induce difficulty articulating thoughts (dysarthria), and loss of coordination and balance in long-term studies. Motor cortex stimulation is another option shown to be viable in numerous clinical trials. =Dystonia= Treatment of primary dystonia is aimed at reducing symptoms such as involuntary movements, pain, contracture, embarrassment, and to restore normal posture and improve the patient's function. This treatment is therefore not neuroprotective. According to the European Federation of Neurological Sciences and Movement Disorder Society, there is no evidence-based recommendation for treating primary dystonia with antidopaminergic or anticholinergic drugs although recommendations have been based on empirical evidence. Anticholinergic drugs prove to be most effective in treating generalized and segmental dystonia, especially if dose starts out low and increases gradually. Generalized dystonia has also been treated with such muscle relaxants as the benzodiazepines. Another muscle relaxant, baclofen, can help reduce spasticity seen in cerebral palsy such as dystonia in the leg and trunk. Treatment of secondary dystonia by administering levodopa in dopamine-responsive dystonia, copper chelation in Wilson's disease, or stopping the administration of drugs that may induce dystonia have been proven effective in a small number of cases. Physical therapy has been used to improve posture and prevent contractures via braces and casting, although in some cases, immobilization of limbs can induce dystonia, which is by definition known as peripherally induced dystonia. There are not many clinical trials that show significant efficacy for particular drugs, so medical of dystonia must be planned on a case-by-case basis. Botulinum toxin B, or Myobloc, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat cervical dystonia due to level A evidential support by the scientific community. Surgery known as GPi DBS (Globus Pallidus Pars Interna Deep Brain Stimulation) has come to be popular in treating phasic forms of dystonia, although cases involving posturing and tonic contractions have improved to a lesser extent with this surgery. A follow-up study has found that movement score improvements observed one year after the surgery was maintained after three years in 58% of the cases. It has also been proven effective in treating cervical and cranial-cervical dystonia. =Tics= Treatment of tics present in conditions such as Tourette's syndrome begins with patient, relative, teacher and peer education about the presentation of the tics. Sometimes, pharmacological treatment is unnecessary and tics can be reduced by behavioral therapy such as habit-reversal therapy and/or counseling. Often this route of treatment is difficult because it depends most heavily on patient compliance. Once pharmacological treatment is deemed most appropriate, lowest effective doses should be given first with gradual increases. The most effective drugs belong to the neuroleptic variety such as monoamine-depleting drugs and dopamine receptor-blocking drugs. Of the monoamine-depleting drugs, tetrabenazine is most powerful against tics and results in fewest side effects. A non-neuroleptic drug found to be safe and effective in treating tics is topiramate. Botulinum toxin injection in affected muscles can successfully treat tics; involuntary movements and vocalizations can be reduced, as well as life-threatening tics that have the potential of causing compressive myelopathy or radiculopathy. Surgical treatment for disabling Tourette's syndrome has been proven effective in cases presenting with self- injury. Deep Brain Stimulation surgery targeting the globus pallidus, thalamus and other areas of the brain may be effective in treating involuntary and possibly life-threatening tics. History In the 16th century, Andreas Vesalius and Francesco Piccolomini were the first to distinguish between white matter, the cortex, and the subcortical nuclei in the brain. About a century later, Thomas Willis noticed that the corpus striatum was typically discolored, shrinkened, and abnormally softened in the cadavers of people who had died from paralysis. The view that the corpus striatum played such a large role in motor functions was the most prominent one until the 19th century when electrophysiologic stimulation studies began to be performed. For example, Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig performed them on dog cerebral cortices in 1870, while David Ferrier performed them, along with ablation studies, on cerebral cortices of dogs, rabbits, cats, and primates in 1876. During the same year, John Hughlings Jackson posited that the motor cortex was more relevant to motor function than the corpus striatum after carrying out clinical-pathologic experiments in humans. Soon it would be discovered that the theory about the corpus striatum would not be completely incorrect. By the late 19th century, a few hyperkinesias such as Huntington's chorea, post- hemiplegic choreoathetosis, Tourette's syndrome, and some forms of both tremor and dystonia were described in a clinical orientation. However, the common pathology was still a mystery. British neurologist William Richard Gowers called these disorders ‚Äúgeneral and functional diseases of the nervous system‚Äù in his 1888 publication entitled A Manual of Diseases of the Nervous System. It was not until the late 1980s and 1990s that sufficient animal models and human clinical trials were utilized to discover the specific involvement of the basal ganglia in the hyperkinesia pathology. In 1998, Wichmann and Delong made the conclusion that hyperkinesia is associated with decreased output from the basal ganglia, and in contrast, hypokinesia is associated with increased output from the basal ganglia. This generalization, however, still leaves a need for more complex models to distinguish the more nuanced pathologies of the numerous diverse hyperkinesias which are still being studied today. In the 2nd century, Galen was the first to define tremor as ‚Äúinvoluntary alternating up-and-down motion of the limbs.‚Äù Further classification of hyperkinetic movements came in the 17th and 18th centuries by Franciscus Sylvius and Gerard van Swieten. Parkinson's disease was one of the first disorders to be named as a result of the recent classification of its featured hyperkinetic tremor. The subsequent naming of other disorders involving abnormal motions soon followed. Research directions A healthy, neuropathic, and myopathic electromyogram, respectively. Studies have been done with electromyography to trace skeletal muscle activity in some hyperkinetic disorders. The electromyogram (EMG) of dystonia sometimes shows rapid rhythmic bursts, but these patterns can almost always be produced intentionally. In the myoclonus EMG, there are typically brief, and sometimes rhythmic, bursts or pauses in the recording pattern. When the bursts last for 50 milliseconds or less they are indicative of cortical myoclonus, but when they last up to 200 milliseconds, they are indicative of spinal or brainstem myoclonus. Such bursts can occur in multiple muscles simultaneously quite quickly, but high time resolution must be used in the EMG trace to clearly record them. The bursts recorded for tremor tend to be longer in duration than those of myoclonus, although some types can last for durations within the range for those of myoclonus. Future studies would have to examine the EMGs for tics, athetosis, stereotypies and chorea as there are minimal recordings done for those movements. However, it may be predicted that the EMG for chorea would include bursts varying in duration, timing, and amplitude, while that for tics and stereotypies would take on patterns of voluntary movements. In general, research for treatment of hyperkinesia has most recently been focusing on ameliorating symptoms rather than attempting to correct the pathogenesis of the disease. Therefore, now and in the future it may be beneficial to inform the learning of the disease's pathology through carefully controlled, long-term, observation-based studies. As therapies are supported by proven effectiveness that can be repeated in multiple studies, they are useful, but the clinician may also consider that the best treatments for patients can only be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. It is the interplay of these two facets of neurology and medicine that may bring about significant progress in this field.

It is about by with a total surface area of about , making it the world's 24th largest desert. The area of this desert stretches from the Alborz mountain range in the north-west to the Dasht-e Lut in the south-east. It is partitioned among the Iranian provinces of Khorasan, Semnan, Tehran, Isfahan and Yazd. Features In the center of the desert lies the Kavir Buzurg (Great Kavir), which is about 320 km long and wide. In the western part of the desert lies the Daryahcheh-e Namak (\\"salt lake\\"), . It contains some large salt plates in a mosaic-like shape. It is part of a protected ecological zone, the Kavir National Park. One of the most desolate parts of Dasht-e Kavir is the Rig-e Jenn (\\"devil's dunes\\"). Climate and structure Map of biotopes of Iran, showing location of Dasht-e Kavir (beige oval at right center). Dasht-e Kavir's climate is arid; it receives little rain or snow. However, the mountains that surround it provide plenty of runoff‚Äîenough to create vast seasonal lakes, marshlands and playas. Temperatures can reach in summer, and the average temperature in January is . Daytime and nighttime temperatures can vary by as much as over the course of a year. Rain usually falls in winter. The desert soil is covered with sand and pebbles; there are marshes, seasonal lakes and seasonal river beds. The hot temperatures cause extreme vaporization, which leaves the marshes and mud grounds with large crusts of salt. Heavy storms frequently occur and they can cause sand hills reaching up to 40 m in height. Some parts of Dasht-e Kavir have a more steppe-like appearance. Post-Glacial lake system Almost 3,000 years ago, at the start of the post-glacial era, the Kavir was a series of vast lakes: the Asian monsoon reached deep into central Iran, bringing heavy summer rain that formed numerous lakes in the closed basins of the central Iranian Plateau that today comprises the Kavir and other deserts in the area. There are inscriptions at teppeh Sialk noting that a local queen had traveled to visit the ruler of a town (identified as Tell-i Bakun, southeast of Yazd) by \\"sailing the sea\\"! Copious shorelines at various elevations still extant in the Kavir are telltale signs of the post-glacial, monsoonal lakes in central Iran, where desert now dominates. Wildlife Vegetation in the Dasht-e Kavir is adapted to the hot and arid climate as well as to the saline soil in which it is rooted. Common plant species like shrubs and grasses can only be found in some valleys and on mountain tops. The most widespread plant is mugwort. The Persian ground jay is a bird species living in some parts of the desert plateaus, along with Hairy bustards, larks and sandgrouse. Persian gazelles live in parts of steppe and desert areas of the central plateau. Wild sheep (Ovis orientalis), camels, goats (Capra aegagrus)Mohammadian, H. Mammals of Iran. Shabpareh Publishing Institute. Tehran, Iran.2005.. and Persian leopards are common in mountainous areas. Night life brings on wild cats, wolves, foxes, and other carnivores. In some parts of the desert, the Persian onager (gur in Persian) and sometimes even the Asiatic cheetah can be seen. Lizards and snakes live in different places in the central plateau. Cultivation The extreme heat and many storms in Dasht-e Kavir cause extensive erosion, which makes it almost impossible to cultivate the lands. The desert is almost uninhabited and knows little exploitation. Camel and sheep breeding and agriculture are the sources of living to the few people living on its soil. Human settlement is restricted to some oases, where wind-blocking housing constructions are raised to deal with the harsh weather conditions. For irrigation, Iranians developed a sophisticated system of water-wells known as qanats. These are still in use, and modern globally used water-revenue systems are based on their techniques.

It is situated in the De Kaap Valley and is fringed by the Makhonjwa Mountains. It is south of Mbombela and east of Johannesburg. Barberton was the seat of the Umjindi Local Municipality until the day of the 2016 Municipal Elections, when the Umjindi Local Municipality was merged into the Mbombela Local Municipality.  History  = Prehistoric = The Barberton Mountain Range, 2001 image from NASA's Landsat 7 satellite The mountains around Barberton are amongst the oldest in the world, dating back 3.5 billion years, and these mountains include some of the oldest exposed rocks on the planet. These volcanic rocks, which scientists call the Barberton Greenstone Belt, have given direct evidence of the conditions of life on the surface of the very early Earth. In the satellite image, the bare rocks of mountain peaks appear as a pale gray-green, accentuated by the sharp relief of sunlit slopes and their shadows. Deeper shades of green indicate vegetation, including some vegetation on the lower slopes. In the mountain valleys, bright green areas suggest well-watered grassy areas and crops. Deeper green areas are probably forests. The series of bright green circles north of the town of Barberton result from centre-pivot irrigation systems. The area north and west of Barberton appears slightly pale and fuzzy compared to the rest of this image, probably the result of low-lying haze.Barberton Mountains at NASA's Earth Observatory The first form of life on earth, a bacterial micro fossil Archaeosphaeroides barbertonensis was discovered here in 1967 and has been identified as being 3.1 billion years old. = Gold = 19 June 1984, Participants in the Barberton Centenary Trek make their way through the Kaap Valley en route to Barberton for the centenary celebration. In 1881 gold in the Barberton area was discovered by Tom McLachlan who found alluvial gold at Jamestown. However, due to the location (the hot lowveld region was rife with malaria) no one wanted to go there until Auguste Roberts (\\"French Bob\\") discovered gold in Concession Creek on 20 June 1883. This discovery resulted in a gold rush to the area. On 21 June 1884, Graham Barber wrote a letter to the State Secretary to inform him that he and his two cousins Fred and Harry discovered payable gold on state land where the Umvoti Creek entered the De Kaap valley. The State Secretary then asked the Magistrate in Lydenburg to investigate the matter and for David Wilson, the Gold Commissioner, to submit a report. Wilson investigated on 24 July 1884 and declared the township of Barberton. The town was named after Graham Hoare Barber (1835-1888) who discovered a rich gold-bearing reef there in 1884. Barberton became a municipality in 1904. At first it was just a simple mining camp but grew when Edwin Bray, a prospector discovered gold in the hills above Barberton in 1885 and with 14 partners started the Sheba Reef Gold Mining Company. Large amounts of money flowed into Barberton and the first Stock Exchange to operate in the then Transvaal opened its doors. More buildings were erected, billiard saloons and music halls established. The Criterion and Royal Standard hotels were opened. In 1896, Barberton was connected by rail to the Netherlands-South African Railway Company (NZASM)'s Oosterlijn (Pretoria to Louren√ßo Marques) through a specifically constructed side line running from Kaapmuiden to Barberton. Barberton flourished for only a brief period and soon the inhabitants began to move away to the newly discovered gold fields on the Reef. Among the owners of mines in the Barberton area are Pan African Resources. On 5 February 2016, 87 miners were rescued after a cave-in at the main entrance of Makonjwaan Gold Mine, operated by Australian-based Vantage Goldfields. Three people were still missing.

Early life  Born in Kansas City, Missouri, Docking attended public school in Lawrence, Kansas, before attending the University of Kansas, and served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. After the war, Docking moved to Arkansas City, Kansas, where he became a successful banker, and was elected mayor.  Political career  Docking was elected governor in 1966 as a member of the Democratic Party over the incumbent Republican, William Avery, whom Docking harangued for leaving the state when there was work to be done in Kansas. Docking served more terms than any other Kansas governor, but is tied for length of service because of a constitutional amendment approved during his final term which provided that Kansas governors serve four-year terms, and are constitutionally prohibited from running for more than two terms. He was known for his commitment to farmers, small business owners, and the environment. The son of former Gov. George Docking (1957-1961), he was married to Meredith and they had two sons, William and Tom, the latter of whom served as lieutenant governor and ran unsuccessfully for the governorship in 1988. After his service as governor, Docking resumed his former profession of banking in Arkansas City. He donated his papers to the University of Kansas rather than give them to the Kansas State Historical Society, where the papers of his 34 predecessors are stored, with the exception of his father, who burned his gubernatorial papers. Death and legacy He died of emphysema in 1983 in Merriam, Kansas, the day before his 58th birthday, and is interred in Highland Park Cemetery in Kansas City, Kansas, in a plot adjoining his parents'. A State Office building across the street from the capital in Topeka, Kansas bears his name, and his bank in Arkansas City (Union State Bank), which is still owned by the Dockings, is on the National Register of Historic Places. His son, Thomas Docking, was Lt. Governor of Kansas during the tenure of John Carlin as governor. His daughter-in-law, and Thomas' wife, Jill Docking, was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee to succeed Bob Dole in the 1996 U.S. Senate election, losing to Sam Brownback. She was the Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor in the 2014 elections (Paul Davis was the gubernatorial candidate and her running mate).

After starting out as an actress, her father told her to get a proper job, so she became a journalist specialising in theatre with the Islington Gazette for five years, and reviewed for The Times Literary Supplement. Scher's philosophy is based on promoting love, peace and understanding through both learning and professionalism. Her heroes are Martin Luther King Jr., Anne Frank, Nelson Mandela and Winston Churchill. She frequently shares with her pupils various meaningful words or sayings which she calls Winston words after Churchill, but which are not necessarily attributed to him. In the past, Scher was chairperson of the International Song Contest for Peace also in Ireland, and served on the juries at BAFTA, the Sony Awards and the Royal Television Society. As an actress, she appeared in The Battle of St. George Without (1969), You Must Be Joking! (1974) and Anna (2011). Scher is married to Charles Verrall, an acting and public speaking coach who has also written and directed several stage plays and a musical.

The report gained its name from the inquiry chairman, Queen's Counsel Ossie Mazengarb. The Report, its origins and its significance still remain key items in the mythology of 1950s New Zealand social history. This is not to deny the importance of the Report; however, its real significance has been obscured by inaccurate accounts in popular histories and newspaper and magazine articles. It is frequently cited as an example case of moral panic in New Zealand.Gary F. Whitcher, \\"'More than America' some New Zealand responses to American culture in the mid-twentieth century\\", Ph.D. thesis, University of Canterbury, 2011  The Petone incident  On 20 June 1954, shortly after her mother and stepfather had reported her as missing, a 15¬Ω-year-old girl turned up at the local police station in the former Hutt Valley borough of Petone. The report details from page 11: > She stated that, being unhappy at home with her stepfather, she had[...] > been a member of what she called a \\"Milk Bar Gang\\", which [...] met \\"mostly > for sex purposes\\"; she [...] was worried about the future of its younger > members, and desired the police to break up the gang. Shortly after, following a police round up of some of those named, a moral panic ensued in New Zealand, in which the above incident played no small part among several others, including a milk bar murder in Auckland (which resulted in one of the last executions in New Zealand.)  The Inquiry  A review of New Zealand newspapers of the time reveals reports of \\"youths charged with indecent assault upon, or carnal knowledge of\\" underage females. Indeed, the inquiry's report notes this occurred \\"[in] the second week of July 1954\\". After an outbreak of moral panic among the public and in newspaper media, the Crown appointed the Special Committee on 23 July, and it started its work only four days later, on 27 July. With what some contemporary commentators considered unreasonable alacrity, the Committee began hearing evidence on 3 August in Wellington, completing its hearings in Auckland on 10 September. Barely ten days later, on 20 September, the Committee had reported; Hansard records that the responsible cabinet minister had already sent the report to the Government Printer for printing before its actual tabling in Parliament. Unusually for an inquiry report of that era, the report became, one of the biggest jobs for the Government Printer at the time. It was noted that postal staff complained of the weight when carrying out another unusual task: distributing copies of the report to every household in the country. = Conclusions and recommendations = The report came up with 27 conclusions and about 20 recommendations.  Conclusions  Among the conclusions, in summary: * 1 to 4 and 26 dealt with sexual immorality, noting that \\"immorality has been [organised]\\", and the unfairness that the authorities could charge boys for indecent conduct, but not girls. * 5 to 9 urged a tightening of censorship-laws. * 10 urged a \\"closer bond between school and home\\". * 11 discounted the contribution that co-educational schools had made to \\"sexual delinquency\\". * 12 urged tighter administration of a school leaving-age of 15. * 13 recommended notifying school principals of students under government care. * 14 and 21: \\"The school is not the proper place for fully instructing children about sex.\\" However, the report characterised schools as good places to \\"listen to addresses or see appropriate films\\". It also claimed (21) that police found in many incidents that many youths were either \\"too ignorant\\" about sex, or knew too much about it. * 15 appears to attack the previous Labour government's state-housing scheme, recording the belief that \\"the new housing developments\\" contained large numbers of young children without the good modelling of older people and organisations. Similarly, 16 says that despite community-groups doing their best, \\"facilities for recreation and entertainment will not cure juvenile delinquency\\". * 17 placed some blame on parents' allowing consumption of alcohol at \\"young people's parties\\" (without specifying the age of the said young people). * 18 and 19 noted the opinion that parental neglect left children feeling unloved, something the Committee believed conducive to delinquent acts. * 20 appears to blame high wages of the time for discouraging the careful use of money (and thus, the Committee concluded, discouraging self-reliance). * 22 and 23 addressed the state of religion and of family life: the \\"present state of morals in the community has indicated the value of a religious faith\\" and stated that a decline in family life resulted from a lack of respect for the \\"worth\\" of religious and social boundaries. * 24 blamed \\"new concepts\\" coming about due to the destabilising effects of world wars, contraceptives, divorce liberalisation and increasing popularity of sexual relations before marriage. * 25 conveyed the unanimous recommendation that minors should not have access to contraceptives. * 27 urged that the Government take more preventive measures in the field of child welfare.  Recommendations  The recommendations covered legislative proposals, administrative suggestions and even \\"parental example\\". Highlights included: * Crime: ** Research: That long-term research into 'all aspects' of juvenile delinquency should begin. ** Suggested legislative changes: That the legal system should have the ability to charge both girls and boys (implying underage persons) with indecent conduct. Additionally, if children are summonsed, their parents should be similarly compelled to attend court, and that courts should have the power (if the parent's behaviour was said to have \\"conduced\\" the child's offending) to order that parents pay fines and court costs and that parents give an assurance of the child's \\"future good behaviour\\". (Other sanctions suggested by the Committee included suspending social-security benefits relating to the child.) ** Police: That policewomen's duties and training should include dealing with 'girls involved in sexual offences'. ** Social welfare: That child welfare should become an autonomous service under the Minister of Social Welfare. * Censorship: ** Print publications: That tightening of censorship laws should occur to take into account \\"undue emphasis on sex, crime or horror\\". Additionally, that distributors of print publications be registered, with the spectre of cancellation of this licence to print or distribute should they distribute \\"objectionable publications\\" under proposed legislation. ** Films and other publications generally: That the film-censorship office within the Department of Internal Affairs should finish gazetting some regulations as already authorised. Overall, that they and other censorship authorities should liaise regularly to maintain \\"a uniform interpretation of public opinion and taste\\". ** Radio: That the New Zealand Broadcasting Service make sure the crime must never pay become \\"more prominently featured\\" in its radio-dramas, and that a \\"married woman\\" be \\"immediately\\"' appointed to its \\"auditioning panel\\". *Education: ** Schools: That the Department of Education consider the best way to deal with \\"problem pupils in post-primary schools\\". ** Community groups: That the Department of Education consider allowing \\"responsible organisations\\" use of \\"school grounds and buildings\\" in areas with \\"a lack of facilities for recreation and entertainment\\". ** Housing: That the Department of Education consider requesting the setting aside for schoolteachers of some houses in \\"housing settlements\\". ** Parental example: That \\"new laws\\" and \\"stricter administration\\" might \\"allay the well-founded fears of many parents\\", but that the risk existed that parents might relax \\"their own efforts\\". \\"Wise parenthood implies firm control and continual interest in the doings of sons and daughters\\", the Committee advised, but also said that parents' own conduct would be the \\"best example for the [...] rising generation\\".  Follow-up  The cover page of the follow up Report of Juvenile Delinquency Committee (AJHR 1955, I-15). Parliament responded to the Mazengarb Report with a special select committee appointed on September 28, 1954. Its report (AJHR 1955, I-15) was due to be issued on October 1, 1955.

Woods' obituary, The Hutchinson News, Hutchinson, Kansas, 17 March 2001 She also lived in Wichita, Kansas, where she garnered a love for aviation from childhood, watching aircraft come and go, very often every day, as they were manufactured nearby. In 1928, at the age of 19, Jessie left home with her boyfriend, Jimmie Woods, and they married on 28 August 1928 in Wichita. The Woods' then went on to form the Flying Aces Air Circus, which lasted until 1938, setting a record for the longest-lasting air circus of all time. The Woods and other pilots performing with them flew every weekend at different places. Woods was a daredevil. She was also the circus lady, flying aircraft on the circus show, often performing dangerous landings. She also walked on the wings of flying aircraft, parachuting off, or dangling below them, with her knees holding a rope ladder. Once while wing walking, she fell off at ; ordinarily, she did not wear a parachute, but this time she did. The circus closed in 1938. During World War II, Woods served with the Civil Air Patrol and upon returning from the war, she became an aircraft mechanic and flying instructor. In 1941, she and her husband Jimmie leased a field in South Carolina, with the American government shortly after granting the couple licenses to train military pilots. After Jimmie Woods, who became a legend himself because of the connection with the \\"Flying Aces\\" circus, died in the late 1950s, Jessie Woods continued flying all over her home country, gaining a commercial pilot's license. She was admired by many during the era when feminist ideas were gaining prominence among American women. She was employed by the State of Washington and in 1967, was named the state of Washington's pilot of the year. In 1985, she was elected to the OX5 Aviation Pioneers Hall of Fame; in 1991, she received the A.E. Aviation Award from the Zonta Club of St. Petersburg, Florida; in 1994, she was the only woman to be honoured as an Eagle at the Gathering of Eagles, Maxwell Air Force Base, Montgomery, Alabama. She was a member of the Ninety-Nines, International Women Pilots, OX 5 Pioneers, and the Lutheran Church. Jessie E.

The blackbuck is the sole extant member of the genus Antilope. The species was described and given its binomial name by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Two subspecies are recognized. It stands up to high at the shoulder. Males weigh , an average of . Females are lighter, weighing or on average. The long, ringed horns, long, are generally present only on males, though females may develop horns, as well. The white fur on the chin and around the eyes is in sharp contrast with the black stripes on the face. The coats of males show two-tone colouration; while the upper parts and outsides of the legs are dark brown to black, the underparts and the insides of the legs are all white. However, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. The blackbuck is a diurnal antelope (active mainly during the day). Three kinds of groups, typically small, are the female, male, and bachelor herds. Males often adopt lekking as a strategy to garner females for mating. While other males are not allowed into these territories, females often visit these places to forage. The male can thus attempt mating with her. As herbivores, blackbuck graze on low grasses, occasionally browsing, as well. Females become sexually mature at 8 months old, but mate no earlier than 2 years. Males mature later, at 1 1/2 years. Mating takes place throughout the year. Gestation is typically 6 months long, after which a single calf is born. The lifespan is typically 10 to 15 years. The blackbuck inhabits grassy plains and slightly forested areas. Due to their regular need of water, they prefer areas where water is perennially available. The antelope is native to and found mainly in India, while it is extinct in Bangladesh. Formerly widespread, only small, scattered herds are seen today, largely confined to protected areas. During the 20th century, blackbuck numbers declined sharply due to excessive hunting, deforestation, and habitat degradation. The blackbuck has been introduced in Argentina and the United States. In India, hunting of blackbuck is prohibited under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The blackbuck has significance in Hinduism; Indian and Nepali villagers do not harm the antelope. Etymology The scientific name of the blackbuck is Antilope cervicapra. Its generic name stems from the Latin word antalopus (\\"horned animal\\"). The specific name cervicapra is composed of the Latin words cervus (\\"deer\\") and capra (\\"she- goat\\"). The vernacular name \\"blackbuck\\" is a reference to the dark brown to black colour of the dorsal (upper) part of the coat of the males. The earliest recorded use of this name dates back to 1850. Alternative names for the blackbuck are \\"Indian antelope\\", kadiyal, kala hiran, krishna mriga (in Kannada) and krishnasaar (in Hindi); kalvit (in Marathi); krishna jinka (in Telugu); and iralai maan (in Tamil). Taxonomy and evolution The blackbuck is the sole living member of the genus Antilope and is classified in the family Bovidae. The species was described and given its binomial name by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758. Antilope also includes fossil species, such as A. subtorta, A. planicornis, and A. intermedius. Antilope, Eudorcas, Gazella, and Nanger form a clade within their tribe Antilopini. A 1995 study of the detailed karyotype of Antilope suggested that within this clade, Antilope is closest to the Gazella group. A 1999 phylogenetic analysis confirmed that Antilope is the closest sister taxon to Gazella, although an earlier phylogeny, proposed in 1976, placed Antilope as sister to Nanger. In a more recent revision of the phylogeny of the Antilopini on the basis of sequences from multiple nuclear and mitochondrial loci in 2013, Eva Verena B√§rmann (of the University of Cambridge) and colleagues re-examined the phylogenetic relationships and found Antilope and Gazella to be sister genera distinct from the sister genera Nanger and Eudorcas. Male of A. c. cervicapra, note the black extending lower down on the sides Two subspecies are recognised, although they might be independent species: * A. c. cervicapra (Linnaeus, 1758), known as the southeastern blackbuck, occurs in southern, eastern, and central India. The white eye ring of the male is narrow above the eye and the neck is all black in the male and the white on the underside is largely restricted to the belly in both males and females. The black leg stripe is well defined and reaches all along the leg. * A. c. rajputanae Zukowsky, 1927, known as the northwestern blackbuck, occurs in northwestern India. Males have a grey sheen to the dark parts during the breeding season. The white on the underside extends up to half way on the sides of the body and the lower base of the neck of males is white. The white eye ring is broad all around the eye with the leg-stripe going only down to the shanks. Genetics The blackbuck shows variation in its diploid chromosome number. Males have 31-33, while females have 30-32. Males have an XY1Y2 sex chromosome. Unusually large sex chromosomes had earlier been described only in a few species, all of which belonged to Rodentia. However, in 1968, a study found that two artiodactyls, the blackbuck and the sitatunga, too, showed this abnormality. Generally, the X chromosome constitutes 5% of the haploid chromosomal complement, but the X chromosome of the blackbuck this percentage is 14.96. Portions of both peculiarly large chromosomes show delayed replication. A 1997 study found lower protein polymorphism in Antilope in comparison with Antidorcas, Eudorcas, and Gazella. This was attributed to a history of rapid evolution of an autapomorphic phenotype of Antilope. This might have been aided by a particularly strong selection of a few dominant males due to their lekking behaviour. Characteristics The blackbuck is a moderately sized antelope. It stands up to high at the shoulder; the head-to-body length is nearly . In the population introduced to Texas, males weigh , an average of . Females are lighter, weighing or on average. Sexual dimorphism is prominent, as males are heavier and darker than the females. The long, ringed horns, that resemble corkscrews, are generally present only on males, though females may develop horns, as well. They measure , though the maximum horn length recorded in Texas has not exceeded . The horns diverge forming a \\"V\\"-like shape. In India, horns are longer and more divergent in specimens from the northern and western parts of the country. The white fur on the chin and around the eyes is in sharp contrast with the black stripes on the face. The coats of males show two-tone colouration; while the upper parts and outsides of the legs are dark brown to black, the underparts and the insides of the legs are all white. Darkness typically increases as the male ages. On the other hand, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. In Texas, blackbuck moult in spring, following which the males look notably lighter, though darkness persists on the face and the legs. On the contrary, males grow darker as the breeding season approaches. Both melanism and albinism have been observed in wild blackbuck. Albino blackbuck are often zoo attractions as in the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (Andhra Pradesh, India). Blackbuck bear a close resemblance to gazelles, and are distinguished mainly by the fact that while gazelles are brown in the dorsal parts, blackbuck develop a dark brown or black colour in these parts. Distribution and habitat  A trio of blackbuck in the Ranibennur Blackbuck Sanctuary (Karnataka, India) Pair of blackbucks in Rehekuri Blackbuck Sanctuary (Maharashtra, India) Blackbuck prefer grassy plains. Royalty hunting blackbuck with Asiatic cheetah in South Gujarat, 1812 Blackbucks are native to the Indian subcontinent, but extinct in Bangladesh. In Nepal, the last surviving population of blackbuck inhabits the Blackbuck Conservation Area south of the Bardia National Park. In 2008, the population was estimated at 184. In Pakistan, blackbuck occasionally occur along the border with India and a captive population is maintained in the Lal Suhanra National Park. Blackbucks inhabit grassy plains and thinly forested areas where perennial water sources are available for its daily need to drink. Herds travel long distances to obtain water. Scrublands are a good source of forage and cover. Cold climates do not suit the blackbuck. A few blackbucks are present in the Indian Institute of Technology Madras campus, which is adjacent to Guindy National Park. The albino males were an attraction to the campus. Their numbers are diminishing due to habitat loss and attack by the increased number of stray dogs. The British naturalist William Thomas Blanford described the range of the blackbuck in his 1891 The Fauna of British India, including Ceylon and Burma as: Today, only small, scattered herds are seen that are largely confined to protected areas. The antelope was introduced in Texas in the Edwards Plateau in 1932. By 1988, the population had increased and the antelope was the most populous exotic animal in Texas after the chital. As of early 2000s, the population in the United States has been estimated at 35,000. Blackbuck have been introduced into Argentina, numbering about 8,600 individuals (as of the early 2000s).  Ecology and behaviour  A herd of blackbuck The blackbuck is a diurnal antelope (active mainly during the day), though activity slows down at noon as days grow hotter toward summer. Three kinds of typically small groups ‚Äì the female herds, territorial males and bachelor males. A study discovered that group sizes often fluctuate; membership is often dictated by availability of forage and the nature of the habitat. Large herds have an edge over smaller ones in that danger can be detected faster, though individual vigilance is lower in the former. Greater time is spent in feeding by large herds. A disadvantage for large herds, however, is that traveling requires more resources. A study found that herd size reduces in summer. Fast animals, the blackbuck can run at as high as . Males often adopt lekking as a strategy on the part of males to garner females for mating. Territories are established by males on the basis of the local distribution of female groups, which in turn is determined by the habitat, so as to ensure greater access to females. The males actively defend resources in their territories, nearly in size; territories are marked with scent (using preorbital gland and interdigital gland secretions, faeces and urine) While other males are not allowed into these territories, females are allowed to visit these places to forage. The male can attempt mating with visiting females. Lekking is a demanding strategy, as the males often have to bear injuries - thus it is a tactic typically adopted by strong, dominant males. Males may either defend their mates or try to forcibly copulate with them. Weaker males, who may not be dominant, might choose the second method. Blackbuck are severely affected by natural calamities such as floods and droughts, from which they can take as long as five years to recover. Wolves are major predators; a study found that old rutting bulls might be vulnerable to wolves. Cheetahs and pariah dogs are the other predators. Juveniles are also hunted by jackals. Village dogs are reported to kill fawns, but are unlikely to successfully hunt and kill adults.Ranjitsinh, M. K. (1989). The Indian Blackbuck. Natraj Publishers, Dehradun. A recent study conducted at the Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary at Nannaj in Maharashtra has found that blackbuck show flexible habitat-use behaviour as the resources and risks change seasonally in the landscape. Blackbuck use of the refuges, that is, small protected area patches in the area (measuring ~3 km2) was the highest among all the available habitats. Human activities strongly influenced blackbuck, but the presence of the tiny refuges allowed blackbuck to persist in the landscape. =Diet= Blackbuck prefer grasses. Being herbivores, blackbuck graze on low grasses, occasionally browsing as well. They prefer sedges, fall witchgrass, mesquite, and live oak. They have occasionally been observed browsing on acacia trees in the Cholistan Desert. Oats and berseem were found to be palatable and nutritious to captive populations in a study. A study in the Velavadar Black Buck Sanctuary (Gujarat, India) showed that Dichanthium annulatum comprised 35 percent of their diet. Digestion of nutrients, especially crude proteins, was poor in summer, but more efficient in the rainy and winter seasons. Consequently, crude protein intake in summer was very low, even below the recommended value. Blackbuck had a lower food consumption in summer. The fruits of Prosopis juliflora are often eaten, and blackbuck may play a role in their dispersal. Prosopis becomes a significant food item if grasses are scarce. Water is a daily requirement of the blackbuck. =Reproduction= Courtship display in blackbuck Females become sexually mature at eight months, but mate no earlier than two years. Males mature later, at one-and-a-half years. Mating takes place throughout the year; peaks occur during spring and fall in Texas. Two peaks have been observed in India: from August to October and from March to April. Rutting males aggressively establish and defend their territories from other males, giving out loud grunts and engaging in serious head-to-head fights, pushing each other using horns. Aggressive display consists of thrusting the neck forward and raising it, folding the ears and raising the tail. The dominant male pursues the female with his nose pointing upward, smells her urine and shows a flehmen response. The female shows her receptivity by waving her tail and thumping the hindlegs on the ground. This is followed by several mounting attempts, and copulation. The whole process may last as long as six hours. The female will remain still for some time after copulation, following which she may start grazing. The male may then move on to mate with another female. Gestation is typically six months long, after which a single calf is born. Newborn are a light yellow; infant males may have a black patch on the head and the neck. Young are precocial - they can stand on their own soon after birth. Females can mate again after a month of parturition. Juveniles remain active and playful throughout the day. Juvenile males turn black gradually, darkening notably after the third year. The lifespan is typically 10 to 15 years. Threats Blackbuck carved on temple pillar at Lepakshi (16th century) During the 20th century, blackbuck numbers declined sharply due to excessive hunting, deforestation and habitat degradation. Some blackbucks are killed illegally especially where the species is sympatric with nilgai. Until India's independence in 1947, blackbuck and chinkara were hunted in many princely states with specially trained captive Asiatic cheetahs. By the 1970s, blackbuck was locally extinct in several areas. Nevertheless, populations in India have increased from 24,000 in the late 1970s to 50,000 in 2001.  Conservation The blackbuck is listed under Appendix III of CITES. In India, hunting of blackbuck is prohibited under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. It inhabits several protected areas of India, including * in Gujarat: Velavadar Wildlife Sanctuary, Gir Forest National Park; *in Bihar: Kaimur Wildlife Sanctuary; *in Maharashtra: Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary; *in Madhya Pradesh: Kanha National Park *in Rajasthan: Tal Chhapar Sanctuary, National Chambal Sanctuary, Ranthambhore National Park *in Karnataka: Ranibennur Blackbuck Sanctuary; *in Tamil Nadu: Point Calimere Wildlife and Bird Sanctuary, Vallanadu Wildlife Sanctuary, Guindy National Park. Interaction with human beings Akbar hunting blackbuck (Akbarnama, c.1590-5) Pair of blackbucks trained to pull a small carriage The blackbuck has associations with the Indian culture. The antelope might have been a source of food in the Indus Valley civilisation (3300-1700 BCE); bone remains have been discovered in sites such as Dholavira and Mehrgarh. The blackbuck is routinely depicted in miniature paintings of the Mughal era (16th to 19th centuries) depicting royal hunts often using cheetahs. Villagers in India and Nepal generally do not harm the blackbuck. Tribes such as the Bishnois revere and care for most animals including the blackbuck. The blackbuck has been declared as the state animal of Andhra Pradesh. The animal is mentioned in Sanskrit texts as the krishna mrig. According to Hindu mythology, the blackbuck draws the chariot of Lord Krishna. The blackbuck is considered to be the vehicle of Vayu (the wind god), Soma (the divine drink) and Chandra (the moon god). In Tamil Nadu, the blackbuck is considered to be the vehicle of the Hindu goddess Korravai. In Rajasthan, the goddess Karni Mata is believed to protect the blackbuck. In the YƒÅj√±avalkya Sm·πõti, Sage Yagyavalkya is quoted stating \\"in what country there is black antelope, in that Dharma must be known\\", which is interpreted to mean that certain religious practices including sacrifices were not to be performed where blackbuck did not roam. The hide of the blackbuck (krishnajina in Hindi) is deemed to be sacred in Hinduism. According to the scriptures, it is to be sat upon only by brahmins (priests), sadhus and yogis (sages), forest-dwellers and bhikshus (mendicants). Blackbuck meat is highly regarded in Texas. In an analysis, blackbuck milk was found to have 6.9% protein, 9.3% fat, and 4.3% lactose. In some agricultural areas in northern India, the blackbuck are found in large numbers and raid crop fields. However, the damage caused by blackbuck is far lower than that caused by the nilgai. In 2018, Bollywood actor Salman Khan, in a high-profile case, was sentenced to five years imprisonment for poaching a blackbuck in 1998.

The employment-to-population ratio is displayed in blue, and periods of recession are represented with gray bars. M1 of money consisting of currency and liquid deposits, 1959‚Äì2010. Similar chart showing the logged velocity (green) of a broader measure of money M3 that covers M2 plus large institutional deposits. The US no longer publishes official M3 measures, so the chart only runs through 2005. The velocity of money (or the velocity of circulation of money) is a measure of the number of times that the average unit of currency is used to purchase goods and services within a given time period. The concept relates the size of economic activity to a given money supply and the speed of money exchange is one of the variables that determine inflation. The measure of the velocity of money is usually the ratio of gross national product (GNP) to a country's money supply. If the velocity of money is increasing, then transactions are occurring between individuals more frequently. The velocity of money changes over time and is influenced by a variety of factors.Mishkin, Frederic S. The Economics of Money, Banking, and Financial Markets. Seventh Edition. Addison‚ÄìWesley. 2004. p. 520.  Illustration  If, for example, in a very small economy, a farmer and a mechanic, with just $50 between them, buy new goods and services from each other in just three transactions over the course of a year *Farmer spends $50 on tractor repair from mechanic. *Mechanic buys $40 of corn from farmer. *Mechanic spends $10 on barn cats from farmer. then $100 changed hands in the course of a year, even though there is only $50 in this little economy. That $100 level is possible because each dollar was spent on new goods and services an average of twice a year, which is to say that the velocity was 2/\\\\text{year}. Note that if the farmer bought a used tractor from the mechanic or made a gift to the mechanic, it would not go into the numerator of velocity because that transaction would not be part of this tiny economy's gross domestic product (GDP). Relation to money demand The velocity of money provides another perspective on money demand. Given the nominal flow of transactions using money, if the interest rate on alternative financial assets is high, people will not want to hold much money relative to the quantity of their transactions--they try to exchange it fast for goods or other financial assets, and money is said to \\"burn a hole in their pocket\\" and velocity is high. This situation is precisely one of money demand being low. Conversely, with a low opportunity cost velocity is low and money demand is high. In money market equilibrium, some economic variables (interest rates, income, or the price level) have adjusted to equate money demand and money supply. The quantitative relation between velocity and money demand is given by Velocity = Nominal Transactions (however defined) divided by Nominal Money Demand.  Indirect measurement  In practice, attempts to measure the velocity of money are usually indirect. The transactions velocity can be computed as :V_T =\\\\frac{PT}{M} where :V_T\\\\, is the velocity of money for all transactions in a given time frame; :P\\\\, is the price level; :T\\\\, is the aggregate real value of transactions in a given time frame; and :M\\\\, is the total nominal amount of money in circulation on average in the economy (see ‚ÄúMoney supply‚Äù for details). Thus PT is the total nominal amount of transactions per period. Values of PT and M permit calculation of V_T. Similarly, the income velocity of money may be written as :V =\\\\frac{PQ}{M} where :V\\\\, is the velocity for transactions counting towards national or domestic product; and :PQ\\\\, is nominal national or domestic product.  Determination  The determinants and consequent stability of the velocity of money are a subject of controversy across and within schools of economic thought. Those favoring a quantity theory of money have tended to believe that, in the absence of inflationary or deflationary expectations, velocity will be technologically determined and stable, and that such expectations will not generally arise without a signal that overall prices have changed or will change.  Criticism  Ludwig von Mises in a 1968 letter to Henry Hazlitt said: \\"The main deficiency of the velocity of circulation concept is that it does not start from the actions of individuals but looks at the problem from the angle of the whole economic system. This concept in itself is a vicious mode of approaching the problem of prices and purchasing power. It is assumed that, other things being equal, prices must change in proportion to the changes occurring in the total supply of money available. This is not true.\\"Quoted in Hazlitt, Henry.

She called for a provincial investigation into the practices of the York Board of Education and sought help from Ontario Education Minister Sean Conway. She claimed the board was anti-Semitic, based on allegations that there were a disproportionate number of students of the Jewish faith who failed a grade, including her own son. She succeeded in getting the province to investigate. As a result, the province then retested the students that had originally failed a grade. In 1995 she started a local newspaper called the Thornhill Times that published for one year, closing in 1996.

One of her accomplishments as MP was successfully introducing a bill that created a national Alzheimer's strategy. In May 2005 the Liberal Women's Caucus criticized some opposition Conservatives members of making sexist remarks regarding Belinda Stronach's defection to the Liberal party. Kadis said \\"...criticism is expected, understandable. Sexism is not.

Location Because of the school's size, GSE&IS; is located in three buildings on the UCLA campus in Westwood, Los Angeles California. Moore Hall primarily houses the school's administration and education faculty. Built in 1930 and designed by George W. Kelham, Moore Hall is among the most architecturally significant buildings at UCLA, an example of the school's original Romanesque Revival style. During the campus' expansion during the 1950s, the modernist architect Kemper Nomland refurbished Moore Hall. The building was again refurbished by the Los Angeles-based architectural firm Robert Englekirk & Associates in 1993. Moore Hall is located directly south of Powell Library, adjacent to Bruin Walk, Kerkhoff Hall and Ackerman Union, in the middle of campus.UCLA Buildings The Mathematical Sciences Building (popularly known as \\"Math Sciences\\") houses some of the school's research centers, programs, and institutes, in addition to the administrative and faculty offices of the Mathematical Sciences. The building was built in 1957 and designed by Stanton & Stockwell in the mid- century modernist style. The Mathematical Sciences Building is located in the middle of campus, directly south of Moore Hall, at the north-west corner of the Court of Sciences. The GSE&IS; Building primarily houses the information studies faculty and computer and research labs. Built in 1991, the building is located in the northern part of the UCLA campus, off Sunset Boulevard, directly adjacent to the Charles E. Young Research Library, UCLA's main research library.GSEIS Building History The UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies can trace its history back to a state legislative act in 1881 that established a \\"southern branch\\" of the California State Normal School in Los Angeles. When it opened in 1882 (on what is now the site of the Central Library of the Los Angeles Public Library system), its primary responsibility was teacher training. The Department of Education was established in 1894. The school was renamed the Los Angeles State Normal School in 1914, and in 1917 the school was moved to a larger site on Vermont Avenue (on what is now the site of Los Angeles City College). The new facility included an elementary school where teachers-in-training could practice their teaching technique on children. That same year Ernest Carroll Moore (for whom Moore Hall is named) was appointed its director. The University of California opened its southern branch in 1919 by replacing the Los Angeles State Normal School with the University's Teachers College. A southern branch of the College of Letters and Science, which enrolled considerably fewer students than the Teachers College, was also established as part of the campus. Moore became director of the southern campus (later provost) and dean of the Teachers College, a position he held until 1939. The campus moved to its current location in Westwood, Los Angeles in 1929.Los Angeles: Schools and Colleges. University of California History Digital Archives. http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/UCHistory/general_history/campuses/ucla/colleges.html Retrieved March 21, 2007 Moore Hall west side entrance In 1930 Los Angeles City Librarian Everett R. Perry proposed to the president of the University of California the establishment of a library school on the Los Angeles campus of the University. By 1935 the School of Librarianship was opened at the University's campus at Berkeley (now the UC Berkeley School of Information), which was later suspended through World War II. UCLA University Librarian Lawrence Clark Powell, among other Los Angeles leaders, resumed the prewar interest in a library school at UCLA. The Regents of the University of California approved the establishment of the school in 1958. Powell (for whom Powell Library is named) resigned his position as University Librarian to become dean of the new school. The school was established with collaboration from the School of Librarianship at Berkeley. The two schools initially created a single alumni association and doctoral students took courses, when appropriate, at either campus. From its inception the school hired faculty from other disciplines, namely mathematician Robert M. Hayes. With innovation in information technology after World War II, library programs became increasingly multidisciplinary, effectively providing a disciplinary home for the interdisciplinary study of information science. Many library schools have since been repositioned as information schools, schools of information science, or schools of library and information science. See the history of information science. The School of Education and the School of Library and Information Science were incorporated into the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies in 1994. UCLA is the only major research university in the country that combines these two areas of study into a single school or college.GSE&IS; Facts On January 29, 2014, Dean Marcelo Su√°rez-Orozco became the inaugural Wasserman Dean of Education & Information Studies.

It also studies the structure, behavior, and interactions of natural and engineered computational systems. Traditionally, it is concerned with the gathering, manipulation, classification, storage, and retrieval of recorded knowledge. The central notion is the transformation and dissemination of information - whether by computation or communication, whether by organisms or artifacts. In this sense, it is more or less a merge of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, computing science, and related fields.

It is located in Gilgit- Baltistan, Pakistan.This region is disputed, and is claimed by India to be an integral part of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is famous for being one of the hardest peaks in the world to climb: twenty-four years elapsed between the first ascent in 1977 and the second in 2001.   Location  Baintha Brakk rises above the north side of the Biafo Glacier, one of the major glaciers of the central Karakoram. It lies about north of Skardu, the major town of the region, and about north of the roadhead at Askole.Orographical Sketch Map of the Karakoram by Jerzy Wala, 1990. Published by the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research.  Notable features  Baintha Brakk is exceptional in its combination of altitude, height above local terrain, and steepness. It is a complex granite tower, steeper and rockier than most other Karakoram peaks. (The Latok peaks next to Baintha Brakk are similar, however.) For example, its South Face rises over above the Uzun Brakk Glacier in only 2 km (1.24 mi) of horizontal distance.DEM files for the Himalaya/Karakoram (Corrected versions of SRTM data) It is because of this steep, rocky nature that Baintha Brakk has been both so difficult to climb and so attractive a target for extremely high-level mountaineers.  Climbing history  Following two unsuccessful attempts in 1971 and 1976, the peak was first climbed by two Britons, Doug Scott and Chris Bonington, in 1977. (The other members of the party were Mo Anthoine, Clive Rowland, Nick Estcourt, and Tut Braithwaite. Estcourt, Anthoine, and Rowland all reached the lower West Summit, while Braithwaite was injured early on by rockfall.Andy Fanshawe and Stephen Venables, Himalaya Alpine-Style, Hodder and Stoughton, 1995, .) They climbed via the Southwest Spur to the West Ridge, and over the West Summit to the Main Summit. The ascent of the summit block required difficult rock climbing that extended the boundaries of what had been done at over . The descent proved more dangerous still: On the first rappel from the summit, Scott broke both legs. Later, Bonington broke two ribs and contracted pneumonia. Also, much of the week-long descent to base camp was in a major storm. However, they were all able to reach base camp, where they had a long wait for assistance. The second ascent of Baintha Brakk was made by Urs St√∂cker, Iwan Wolf, and Thomas Huber, on 21 July 2001, via the South Pillar route, following their first ascent of the subsidiary peak Ogre III (circa ).American Alpine Journal, 2001, p. 365 They note that there were more than 20 unsuccessful expeditions in the interim.The Himalayan Index lists only ten unsuccessful attempts; however the index is often incomplete. Its entry for the Ogre also mistakenly lists the second ascent as occurring in 2000. Mountain INFO magazine characterized their ascent as \\"arguably the most notable mountaineering achievement during the entire 2001 season.\\"American Alpine Journal, 2001, p. 366 A third ascent by a new line on the peak's South Face was made by Americans Kyle Dempster and Hayden Kennedy on August 21, 2012. Compatriot Josh Wharton had also accompanied them on the climb but had to abandon the attempt at approximately 6800 meters (approximately 22,310 feet) due to altitude sickness.

Kline received a series of official rebukes and reprimands for his legal tactics against abortion providers, and in 2013 his law license was indefinitely suspended by the Kansas Supreme Court, which found \\"clear and convincing evidence\\" that Kline committed numerous violations of conduct rules, which included providing false testimony. Kline appealed his license suspension to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to intervene, leaving the suspension in place. Kline is currently an assistant professor at Liberty University, an evangelical fundamentalist college in Lynchburg, Virginia. Early life and political career Born in Kansas City, Kansas, Kline grew up in Shawnee, a community on the Kansas side of the Kansas City Metropolitan Area. He was the third of five children; his father abandoned the family when Kline was five years old, leaving his mother to be a single parent.Mann, Fred (October 8, 2006). \\"Family, past shape Kline's efforts as attorney general\\", Wichita Eagle; accessed May 15, 2017.

He was a member of the varsity wrestling team with a partial wrestling scholarship, and a member of the cross country team. He earned a B.S. in business communications in 1982. During college, he worked as a weekend radio DJ in Clinton, Missouri and as a summer news broadcaster for Kansas City, Missouri, AM radio station WHB. On Friday, July 17, 1981 he was broadcasting live from the Hyatt Regency Kansas City in Kansas City, Missouri, when two vertically contiguous walkways collapsed onto a Tea Dance being held in the hotel's lobby. The falling walkways killed 114 and injured a further 216 people. At the time, it was the deadliest structural collapse in U.S. history. After graduating college, he worked in public relations for the Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun amusement parks in Kansas City in order to save money for law school. Kline received his J.D. from the University of Kansas School of Law in 1987, and was an Associate Editor for the Kansas Law Review. He entered private practice as an associate with Blackwell Sanders, a large firm in Kansas City specializing in corporate law. He married his wife, Deborah, in 1989, and settled in Shawnee close to where he grew up. The Klines have one daughter, Hillary, born in 1992. They are members of the Central Church of the Nazarene in Lenexa, Kansas. After leaving Blackwell Sanders, Kline hosted two radio programs: The Phill and Mary Show on Kansas City AM station KMBZ, and Face Off With Phill Kline on Topeka AM station WIBW.

Marsh= In December 2005 and April 2006, he successfully argued before the Supreme Court of the United States in Kansas v. Marsh, wherein the Court reversed a ruling made by the Kansas Supreme Court that the state's death penalty was unconstitutional. =Abortion controversy= In 2005, Kline began investigating possible cases of child rape and illegal partial-birth and late-term abortions. In doing so, Kline requested the redacted medical records (without names) of 90 women and girls who either gave birth to a child or had an abortion. His office was ultimately granted these redacted records by the Kansas Supreme Court. On December 21, 2006, Kline charged abortion provider Dr. George Tiller with more than 30 misdemeanors, most involving abortions Tiller allegedly performed on minors. But just hours after the charges were unsealed, a Sedgwick County judge threw them out \\"at the request of Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston, who said her office had not been consulted by Kline.\\" However, on June 28, 2007, a 19-count indictment was unexpectedly filed against Tiller by Kline's successor, Paul J.

The District Attorney who prosecuted Estrada challenged Operation Rescue's claims, stating that Kline and the records had no involvement in the prosecution. Kline was suspended from practicing law due to the fact that he illegally accessed private medical records of women who made the choice to have an abortion. He obtained some records provided on his demand to Dr. Kristin Neuhaus, whose prosecution he pursued after Dr. Tiller's assassination, and illegally disclosed them, including discussing them with then Fox News host Bill O'Reilly on television.Supreme Court Upholds Disbarment of Anti-Abortion Kansas Ex-AG Phill Kline, CounterPunch, Dave Lindorff, May 2, 2014.

Limon= During his tenure, in the case of State v. Limon, Kline defended a Kansas law which provided substantially higher sentencing guidelines for acts of homosexual statutory rape compared to equivalent heterosexual acts. A Kansas trial court upheld the law, the Kansas Court of Appeals affirmed that decision, and the Supreme Court of Kansas declined to hear the case. The party challenging the law was barely 18 at the time of the offense, and both Limon and the other boy were residents of a home for the mentally disabled.

Texas, which held that a similar Texas law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The Attorney General's office continued to pursue the matter, seeking to distinguish the Kansas law from the Texas law. The Kansas Court of Appeals upheld the earlier decision 2-1, but the Kansas Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of Limon and overturned his conviction in 2005. By the time of his release he had served 5¬Ω years of a seventeen-year sentence.

Kline's ethics trial began on February 21, 2011. He testified that he had the right to deceive state agencies to gain information in abortion investigations and that he had no duty to promptly notify a trial judge that he had provided flawed information. On October 13, 2011, the Kansas state Board of Discipline of Attorneys recommended that Kline's law license be indefinitely suspended, citing a pattern of repeatedly misleading statements, \\"dishonest and selfish motives\\", and a failure to \\"take any responsibility for his misconduct.\\" Kline disputed the Board's findings as politically motivated.

History The hoax circulated around Greek websites and was widely reproduced without verification by many reputable sources from newspapers to the then Minister for National Education and Religious Affairs (see Urban legend spread below). According to the \\"Hellenic Quest\\" story, CNN reported that Apple Computer is developing a software product for teaching Ancient Greek language to foreigners and scientists, in the light of the upcoming development of supercomputers that will use Ancient Greek as their programming interface, due to this language's superior logical structure. (This prediction often attributed by the hoax writer to Bill Gates.) A prototype computer that is allegedly under development as part of this project is called \\"Ibycus\\". The text contains a number of factual errors, unproved assertions and exaggerations. The origin of this hoax is not clear. The author probably uses CNN and Apple Computer as a means to give more credibility to the story. The story is sometimes enhanced with linguistic-sounding arguments. It also has several obscure references to the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae project, a project undertaken by the University of California, Irvine for the purpose of digitizing all ancient and medieval Greek texts. The computer prototype \\"Ibycus\\", is the operating system implemented by David W. Packard in the early 1980s to search and browse TLG texts represented in beta code. There is no connection between Ibycus and the so-called \\"Hellenic Quest.\\" The Ancient Greek language (or any other language) has nothing to do with the binary logic that forms the basis of computers' function. Even advanced concepts in computation, such as fuzzy logic, knowledge-based systems and quantum computation have absolutely no use whatsoever for the extreme expressiveness of any of the world's languages anyway, \\"rich and powerful\\" as they may be characterized; the notions understood by computers are very basic.

Biography =Early years= Born Dorothy McGriff in Birmingham, Alabama, her early years were hard, (she later described them as \\"the same old thing\\"). Her minister father left the family when she was six, divorcing her mother thereafter. Dorothy began playing piano in the Baptist Church at age ten, then joined her sisters and brother in the McGriff Singers several years later. Dorothy quit school to work \\"all the standard Negro jobs\\" available in Birmingham in the 1940s: scrubbing floors and working behind the counter in laundries and dry cleaners. She began singing with the Gospel Harmonettes-- then known as the Gospel Harmoneers-- in the early 1940s. She married Willie Love of The Fairfield Four, one of the most popular quartets of the early years of gospel, but divorced him shortly thereafter. She subsequently married Carl Coates of the Sensational Nightingales over a decade later. =Musical success= thumb Coates rose to stardom in the 1950s as a member of The Original Gospel Harmonettes. With her \\"raggedy\\" voice and preacher's fire she could outsing the most powerful hard gospel male singers of the era. She was also a notable composer, writing songs such as \\"You Can't Hurry God (He's Right On Time)\\", \\"99 and a Half Won't Do\\" and \\"That's Enough\\". thumb The Gospel Harmonettes-- later renamed the Original Gospel Harmonettes-- had achieved some fame in an early appearance when the National Baptist Convention came to Birmingham in 1940. Led by Evelyn Starks, an amazing pianist whose style of playing was much imitated, and featuring Mildred Madison Miller, a mezzo soprano who had a down-home sound that came to be a symbol of the group, singing as its lead singer. The group also included, Odessa Edwards, the clear voiced alto whose sermonettes could create a great deal of fervor at performances, Vera Conner Kolb, the piercing soprano of the group whose high notes came with such ease that Marion Williams and other sopranos of the time period imitated her style, and Willie Mae Thomss Newberry Garth, the group's deep-throated alto, the group had a regular half-hour radio show sponsored by A.G. Gaston, a local businessman and community leader. The group first recorded for RCA in 1949, but without Dorothy Love, after appearing on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts television program. Those recordings while not particularly memorable are considered a rare jewel nowadays and include the two songs \\"In the Upper Room\\" and \\"Move on Up a little Higher\\". Their first sides for Specialty Records--\\"I'm Sealed\\" and \\"Get Away Jordan\\"--recorded with Love in 1951 were far more successful, the group recorded a series of hits in the years that followed before disbanding in 1958. Dorothy was the driving force behind the group's success, both on record and in person, singing with such spirit that the other members of the group would occasionally have to lead her back to the stage--a device that James Brown copied and made part of his act in the 1960s, but which was wholly genuine in Love's case. She also took over the role, particularly after Odessa Edwards' retirement, of preacher/narrator, directing very pointed criticisms from the stage of the evils she saw in the church and in the world at large. During the years of her retirement, from 1959 to 1961, Dorothy Love--now Dorothy Love Coates--became active in the Civil Rights Movement, working with Martin Luther King, Jr. As she was fond of telling church audiences, \\"The Lord has blessed our going out and our coming in. He's blessed our sitting in, too.\\" While many other gospel artists were slow to address political issues head-on, Coates spoke out against the war in Vietnam, racism and other evils. Coates was just as plainspoken when criticizing the exploitative treatment that she and other gospel singers received from gospel promoters, both white and black. She reformed the Harmonettes in 1961 and when that group disbanded later in the decade, continued touring with a group known as the Dorothy Love Coates Singers. She recorded, both individually and with her group, on Savoy Records, Vee-Jay Records and Columbia Records in the 1960s and made occasional appearances, but no recordings, after 1980. She appeared in the films \\"The Long Walk Home\\" and \\"Beloved\\" at the end of her career. Coates died in Birmingham on April 9, 2002, of heart failure, at the age of 74. thumb Legacy While Coates vigorously rejected all offers to cross over to pop or soul music, a number of artists, including Little Richard, imitated her sanctified singing style. Other secular songwriters drew on her songs for inspiration, sometimes simply taking the title, as in the case of Wilson Pickett's wholly different soul tune \\"99 and a Half Won't Do\\", and sometimes adapting both lyrics and title, as in the case of the Supremes's hit \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\". Jerry Garcia Band recorded her \\"I'll Be with Thee\\" on Cats Under the Stars, and performed \\"Strange Man\\" in concert. Singer Mavis Staples has stated that Dorothy Love Coates was an influence on her vocal style.

The real Dmitry had died under uncertain circumstances, most likely an assassination in 1591 at the age of nine at his widowed mother's appanage residence in Uglich. The second False Dmitry first appeared on the scene around 20 July 1607, at Starodub. He is believed to have been either a priest's son or a converted Jew, and was relatively highly educated for the time. He spoke both the Russian and Polish languages and was something of an expert in liturgical matters. He pretended at first to be the Muscovite boyar Nagoy, but falsely confessed under torture that he was Tsarevich Dmitry, whereupon he was taken at his word and joined by thousands of Cossacks, Poles, and Muscovites. In the course of the year Jerzy Mniszech, father of Marina Mniszech, widow of False Dmitry I, 'reunited' him with Marina, who miraculously recognized her late husband in this second Dimitry. This brought him the support of the magnates of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth who had supported False Dmitry I. Adam Wi≈õniowiecki, Roman R√≥≈ºy≈Ñski, and Jan Sapieha decided to support the second pretender as well, supplying him with some early funds and 7500 soldiers, among them Aleksander J√≥zef Lisowski, leader of the infamous mercenary band later known as Lisowczycy. He quickly captured Karachev, Bryansk, and other towns, was reinforced by the Poles, and in the spring of 1608 advanced upon Moscow, routing the army of Tsar Vasili Shuisky at Bolkhov. Promises of the wholesale confiscation of the estates of the boyars drew many common people to his side. The village of Tushino, twelve versts from the capital, was converted into an armed camp where Dmitry gathered his army. His force initially included 7,000 Polish soldiers, 10,000 Cossacks and 10,000 other rag-tag soldiers, including former members of the failed Zebrzydowski Rebellion. His forces soon exceeded 100,000 men. He raised to the rank of patriarch another illustrious captive, Philaret Romanov, and won the allegiance of the cities of Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Vologda, Kashin and several others. Sergey Ivanov. The arrival of King Sigismund III Vasa at Smolensk caused a majority of his Polish supporters to desert him and join with the armies of the Polish king. At the same time, a strong Russo-Swedish army under Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky and Jacob De la Gardie approached Tushino, forcing him to flee his camp disguised as a peasant and go to Kostroma, where Marina joined him and he lived once more in regal state. He made another unsuccessful attack on Moscow, and, supported by the Don Cossacks, recovered a hold over all south-eastern Russia. However, he was killed, while half drunk, on 11 December 1610 by a Tatar princeling, Peter Urusov, whom he had flogged. Hetman Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski described this event in his memoirs:≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski had never met Dmitry, but relied on the information from his many sources.

Eventually, Sunfire leaves Big Hero 6 so that he can work at Charles Xavier's X-Corporation office in Mumbai, India. His spot on the team is filled by Sunpyre, a young woman with similar solar- based powers who is pulled into this reality through the Power Purse and therefore comes to idolize Honey Lemon. Similarly, after Silver Samurai is seemingly slain in an altercation with the assassin Elektra in Iraq, his spot on the team is filled by the enigmatic Ebon Samurai. With the two most experienced members of Big Hero 6 gone, Hiro becomes the team's new leader. Sometime during the team's operation, they are attacked by minions of Yandroth. As part of a plan to gain power via superhero battles, Yandroth sends a team of \\"Living Erasers\\" into their building. The Living Erasers are capable of transporting beings out of reality. The entire battle takes place off panel and is only mentioned in conjunction with attacks upon other superhero teams. Later, the members of Big Hero 6 fall victim to a mind- control device implanted within Baymax. Traveling to Canada, the mind- controlled superheroes attack a new incarnation of Alpha Flight at a national park. After a brief battle, the mind-control device is short-circuited and the two teams part as friends. Big Hero 6 returns to Japan to seek out the parties responsible for their mind control. During the \\"Ends of the Earth\\" storyline, Spider-Man calls upon Big Hero 6 to help him defeat Doctor Octopus. The team, now operating from the Giri Institute, confront Doctor Octopus' Octobots, which Dr. Octopus had sent to Japan. They subsequently confront their previous enemy, the Everwraith, and are victorious.Amazing Spider-Man #685 (July 2012), Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth #1 (July 2012). Marvel Comics. Team roster =Silver Samurai= Silver Samurai (Kenuichio Harada), the illegitimate son of Shingen Yashida, is a Japanese mutant with the power to charge almost anything, most notably his katana, with mutant energy (described as a tachyon field). This enables it to slice through any known substance except adamantium. He wears a suit of traditional samurai armor made of a silver metal, hence the name \\"Silver Samurai.\\" He was once the bodyguard for the international terrorist known as the Viper, and later an occasional mercenary, but he became the head of Clan Yashida after his half-sister Mariko Yashida's death. He attempted to pay off his clan's debts to the Yakuza and restore its honor. Although he was once one of Wolverine's greatest enemies, he impressed Wolverine so greatly that Wolverine entrusted him with the care of his adopted daughter, Amiko Kobayashi. The Samurai also helped Wolverine destroy the monster known as \\"Doombringer,\\" and he later helped Logan rescue Amiko and Yukio from their kidnappers. During his time as a hero, the Silver Samurai became the leader of the Big Hero 6. Silver Samurai later became the bodyguard of the Japanese prime minister, but was killed while defending his family from a ninja attack.Wolverine (vol. 4) #1.

He was originally designed to be a hydro-powered robotic synthformer, programmed to serve as Hiro's personal bodyguard, butler, and chauffeur. However, prior to the project's completion, Hiro's father died and the young inventor programmed Baymax's artificial intelligence using the brain engrams of his recently departed father. With the thoughts and emotions of Hiro's father, Baymax became much more than a robotic bodyguard. He also functions as Hiro's best friend and father figure and is by his side nearly every hour of every day. Baymax also feels a deep attachment to Hiro's mother; however, Hiro and Baymax decided it was not in their best interest to inform her that her departed husband's memories were used as the basis for Baymax's artificial intelligence.Big Hero 6 #1 (2008) =Ebon Samurai= In his prior life, the Ebon Samurai (Kiochi Keishicho) was a Tokyo police officer who was slain by Silver Samurai during an attack by HYDRA.

Wielding a demonic katana and permanently bonded to a black variant of his foe's armor, Kiochi was reborn as the Ebon Samurai.Big Hero 6 #2 Upon learning that Silver Samurai had become the bodyguard of the Japanese prime minister, Kiochi abandoned his quest for revenge, realizing that murdering Harada would constitute a betrayal of his country.

The film was released in the United States in November 2014, receiving critical acclaim. It won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature and the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. =Television= In March 2016, Disney announced that a Big Hero 6 television series is in development and will premiere on Disney XD in 2017.

He was the son of George Gilliat, editor of the Evening Standard between 1928‚Äì1933. Sidney was born in the district of Edgeley in Stockport, Cheshire. In the 1930s he worked as a scriptwriter, most notably with Frank Launder on The Lady Vanishes (1938) for Alfred Hitchcock, and Night Train to Munich (1940), directed by Carol Reed. He and Launder made their directorial debut co-directing the home front drama Millions Like Us (1943). From 1945 he also worked as a producer, starting with The Rake's Progress, which he also wrote and directed. He and Launder made over 40 films together, founding their own production company Individual Pictures. While Launder concentrated on directing their comedies, most famously the four St Trinian's School films, Gilliat showed a preference for comedy-thrillers and dramas, including Green for Danger (1946), London Belongs to Me (1948) and State Secret (1950). He wrote the libretto for Malcolm Williamson's opera Our Man in Havana, based on the novel by Graham Greene. He had also worked on the film. Early Life and Career Gilliat was the son of George Gilliat, the editor of the London Evening Standard from 1928 to 1933. He was brought up in New Malden and He was educated at London University, studying English and History. He worked for a period as a journalist at the Evening Standard, later saying he was fired after refusing to interview a grieving widow who was too upset to be spoken to. The film critic of the Evening Standard, Walter Mycroft, went to work at Elstree Studios as a scenario editor, and hired Gilliat to write intertitles for silent films. He was fired after he was overheard criticising a producer's work. =Walter Forde= Gilliat's early screen credits were on films directed by Walter Forde including Red Pearls (1930), Lord Richard in the Pantry (1930), Bed and Breakfast (1930), You'd Be Surprised! (1930), The Ghost Train (1931), The Ringer (1931) and Third Time Lucky (1931). He also wrote The Happy Ending (1931) and A Gentleman of Paris (1931). Gillat's first major credit as a screenwriter was Rome Express (1932) directed by Forde. He and Frank Launder worked on the script for Facing the Music (1933) but they did not actually work together. Gilliat was credited as writer on Friday the Thirteenth (1933); Orders Is Orders (1933); Falling for You (1933) with Jack Hulbert; Jack Ahoy (1934) with Hulbert; Chu Chin Chow (1934); Bulldog Jack (1935) with Hulbert; My Heart is Calling (1935); and Strangers on Honeymoon (1936). He worked on a Will Hay film, Where There's a Will (1936), and a horror film The Man Who Changed His Mind (1936). =Frank Launder= Gilliat's first movie with Launder is Twelve Good Men (1936). They also collaborated on Seven Sinners (1936). Without Launder he did Take My Tip (1937) for Hulbert; A Yank at Oxford (1938) for MGM; Strange Boarders (1938); and The Gaunt Stranger (1938) with Sonnie Hale. Gilliat and Launder collaborated on The Lady Vanishes (1938). Gilliat wrote another for Hay, Ask a Policeman (1939), and was one of several writers on Hitchcock's Jamaica Inn (1939). With Launder he did Inspector Hornleigh on Holiday (1939) and Night Train to Munich (1940), the latter for Carol Reed. For Reed Gilliat wrote on his own a thriller Girl in the News (1940). Gilliat began writing war time shorts such as Mr. Proudfoot Shows a Light (1941). He and Launder worked on They Came by Night (1940), and Reed's The Young Mr. Pitt (1942). Alone, Gilliat adapted Kipps (1941) for Reed. Producers/directors Launder and Gillat wanted to become producers and directors. Their first effort as co-directors was a short, Partners in Crime (1942). Then they made the feature Millions Like Us (1943) which was a success, launching them as producers and directors. According to an obituary of Gilliat: > Gilliat and Launder made an unlikely pair, both physically and > temperamentally Launder spare, dark and easily excited, Gilliat stockier and > with the sort of down-to-earth, practical nature which provided a solid > basis for their working partnership. Gilliat, in fact, always deprecated his > own comic talents, claiming that it was Launder who wrote all the jokes, > though this was a huge overstatement. But certainly they did their best work > together. Their speciality was the thriller-comedy. As writers, their > scripts were noted for clever plotting and shrewd observation of the foibles > of the English character. As directors, Gilliat tended to favour quieter > satire, where Launder excelled in broader farce. But it was difficult > generally to know where the contribution of one ended and the other began, > even though officially they liked to take it in turn to act on each film as > scriptwriter and director.Sidney Gilliat;Obituary The Times; London (UK) > [London (UK)]01 June 1994. Gilliat helped write Two Thousand Women (1944) which Launder directed. Without Launder, Gilliat wrote and directed Waterloo Road (1945) with John Mills and Stewart Granger. But normally both men would produce and write the script and take turns directing. Gilliat directed The Rake's Progress (1945) with Rex Harrison; Green for Danger (1946); and London Belongs to Me (1948). Launder directed I See a Dark Stranger (1946), Captain Boycott (1947), The Blue Lagoon (1949) and The Happiest Days of Your Life (1950). Gilliat directed the thriller State Secret (1950) while Launder did Lady Godiva Rides Again (1951) and Folly to Be Wise (1953). Around this time they announced a film about Dunkirk and a science fiction story but neither was made.BY WAY OF REPORT: PUBLISHER By A.H. WEILER. New York Times 23 July 1950: X5. Instead Gilliat directed The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan (1953), then Launder did The Belles of St Trinian's (1954). The film starred George Cole who later said working for the team meant \\"good scripts but terrible money. If Alastair was in the film it was even worse because he got most of it. But they were wonderful people to work with.\\"Obituary: Frank Launder The Independent 24 Feb 1997: 16. Gilliat did The Constant Husband (1955) with Rex Harrison followed by Launder's Geordie (1955). They wrote and produced, but did not direct The Green Man (1956) and produced The Smallest Show on Earth (1957). Gilliat directed Fortune Is a Woman (1957), a thriller with Jack Hawkins while Launder did Blue Murder at St Trinian's (1957) and The Bridal Path (1959). =British Lion= In 1958 they joined the board of British Lion.British Lion keepers Richmond, Theo; GILLIAT, SYDNEY; Launder, Frank.

Gilliat had a big hit with Only Two Can Play (1962), which he directed. He produced Joey Boy (1965), and then both men directed The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery (1966). They worked on a script, Sex and the British, for two years but had to abandon it when British divorce laws made the concept obsolete. Instead they made Endless Night (1972) which Gilliat directed. He and Launder produced Ooh‚Ä¶ You Are Awful (1972). Personal life Gilliat married Beryl Brewer in the early 1930s. He had two children: Joanna and Caroline Gilliat, and three grandchildren: Amanda Eliasch n√©e Brown a writer and Fashion Editor/Artist, Toby Brown and the late Camilla Horn n√©e Russell. Sidney Gilliat died in Wiltshire, England on 31 May 1994 aged 86. Sidney Gilliat has four great grandchildren: Charles (a drag queen named Miss Evie Lake), Jack Eliasch, Lara, and Alicia Horn. His brother was the producer Leslie Gilliat who worked with him. Appraisal According to one obituary \\"if wanted to give new generations, or foreigners, some idea of the way the British were in the thirties and forties, one could do no better than show them the films with which Sidney Gilliat was connected... [He] had unfailing good humour, and an unerring feeling for time, place and character. These were most noticeable in the comedy-thrillers, in which the realistic treatment disguised far-fetched plots. \\"Obituary: Sidney Gilliat Bergan, Ronald. The Guardian 1 June 1994.

At roughly 2:40am EST, two Norfolk Southern trains collided near the Avondale Mills plant in Graniteville. Nine people were killed and over 250 people were treated for toxic chlorine exposure. The accident was determined to be caused by a misaligned railroad switch. Accident On January 5, 2005, NS local train P22 (lead engine GP59 #4622) began its daily operation. The regularly assigned conductor and engineer were both off duty on January 5, and the jobs were filled for the day from a list of available standby employees. At the end of their scheduled run, train P22's crew parked the train on a siding near the Avondale Mills plant. The train crew contacted the local train dispatcher at 7:53PM and 7:54PM to clear two track warrants that were protecting train P22's use of the tracks. Although the railroad switch for the Avondale Mills siding was supposed to be set for mainline operation before P22's crew departed for the night, the train's brakeman later told the NTSB that he was \\"not 100 percent sure\\" he had aligned the switch for mainline operation, and that he \\"might have made a mistake.\\" No train operated through the area or used the affected tracks for the rest of the day. At 2:38AM Eastern Standard Time on January 6, 2005, NS freight train 192 (lead engines SD60s #6653 and #6593) approached Graniteville at approximately 48 miles per hour. Train 192 entered emergency braking when the engineer saw the improperly aligned switch, but there was not sufficient distance for Train 192 to stop. At 2:39AM, Train 192 was diverted by the improperly lined switch onto the siding and collided with P22. The collision derailed both lead engines, 16 of 192's 42 freight cars, and one of P22's freight cars. Train 192 was transporting chlorine gas, sodium hydroxide and cresol. One of 192's tank cars (loaded with 90 tons of chlorine) ruptured, releasing about 60 tons of the gas. About 30% of the load was recovered by industrial responders. Nine people died (eight at the time of the accident, one later as a result of chlorine inhalation), and at least 250 people were treated for chlorine exposure. In total, 5,400 residents within one mile (1.6 km) of the crash site were forced to evacuate for nearly two weeks while HAZMAT teams and cleanup crews decontaminated the area. Victims View of Graniteville Train Wreck in the morning after, from above Aerial closeup of the accident scene Nine people lost their lives in the Graniteville train disaster on the day of the accident: *Christopher Seeling, 28, of West Columbia, South Carolina, engineer of NS train 192 (was found at the crash site and later died at the hospital); *Willie C. Shealey, 43, of Graniteville, employee of Avondale Mills Inc. (was found in the wooded area near the Woodhead Division of Avondale Mills Inc.); *Willie L. Tyler, 57, of Graniteville, employee of Avondale Mills Inc. (was found about 25 feet inside the entrance to the Woodhead Division of Avondale Mills Inc. and later died at the hospital); *John Laird, 24, of North Augusta, South Carolina, employee of Avondale Mills Inc. (was also found in the wooded area near the Woodhead Division of Avondale Mills Inc.); *Fred \\"Rusty\\" Rushton, III, 41, of Warrenville, South Carolina, employee of Avondale Mills Inc. (was found on the loading dock of the Stevens Steam Plant, owned by Avondale Mills Inc.); *Steven Bagby, 38, of Augusta, Georgia, employee of Avondale Mills Inc. (was found in a break area in the Gregg Division of Avondale Mills Inc.); *Allen Frazier, 58, of Ridge Spring, South Carolina, employee of Avondale Mills Inc. (was found in an office in the Gregg Division of Avondale Mills Inc.); *Joseph L. Stone, 21, of Quebec, Canada, an employee of JW Express Trucking Company (was found in the truck's sleeper cab); and *Tony DeLoach, 56, of Graniteville, South Carolina (was found in his home on Main Street near the train wreck). On April 21, 2005, one more death was attributed to the accident. Leonard Mathis, a brick mason in Graniteville, was driving home from a convenience store just after the accident occurred. As he was traveling home, he passed through a portion of the chlorine cloud that resulted from the collision. His health deteriorated from that point on. Economic consequences Norfolk Southern announced that it expected the disaster to cost between $US 30 and $40 million, including the corporation's self- insurance retention under its insurance policies and other uninsured costs, but not any fines or penalties that might be imposed. On May 25, 2005, lawyers involved in the damages claims against Norfolk Southern announced that they had reached a preliminary agreement on settlements for area residents and business that were evacuated but did not seek medical attention. In this preliminary settlement, Norfolk Southern would offer each resident who was evacuated and did not seek medical attention within 72 hours of the accident a flat amount of $2,000 for the evacuation plus $200 per person per day of the evacuation. These amounts are separate from any property damage claims. Claims that involve injury or death are not included in this settlement, but are still being negotiated. On May 22, 2006, Avondale Mills' CEO, Robert Williams Sr., announced that his firm would close all its plants, corporate and sales offices no later than July 25, throwing more than 4,000 workers across four states out of work. Mr. Felker cited the 2005 derailment as the primary reasons for the company's failure. The wreck knocked out the Gregg plant of Avondale mills, which was a key pillar to the survival of the company in a shrinking United States textile market. The plant accounted for 40% of the company's sales. Stephen Felker Jr., Avondale's manager of corporate development stated,\\"We were prepared to weather the storm of global competition. What we weren't prepared for was an event such as this derailment, which was completely beyond our control.\\" Avondale Mills Inc. reached a $215 million settlement with its insurance company for damages caused by the train derailment and fatal chemical spill. Graniteville residents assumed that since the plant would have been fully insured and/or covered by Norfolk Southern's accident insurance, that the owners chose to take the settlement money and leave rather than rebuild the damaged plant. However, G. Stephen Felker Sr. stated \\"We do not believe that the settlement fully compensates us for the full value of the losses incurred as a result of the Norfolk Southern derailment\\" and said that the company intends to pursue a lawsuit or seek a settlement against Norfolk Southern. That suit ended with another settlement, for an undisclosed sum. Findings and recommendations On November 29, 2005, the NTSB issued a report officially blaming the accident on the P22 train crew's failure to reline the switch for mainline operations. The report concluded that neither equipment failure nor crew fatigue or drug or alcohol use was a factor in the accident. It further concluded that the level and immediacy of emergency response to the accident was wholly appropriate for the situation. As a result of this accident and a similar accident on the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway on January 8, 2005, the United States Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) released to railroads a reminder of federal regulations on procedures for turnout operation and safety procedures. Among the federal rules regarding turnouts are: *The normal position for turnouts on mainline tracks is for mainline through traffic. *When trains are required to clear the mainline track, they will not report that the track is clear until there are no obstructions on the mainline track and all turnouts are set for the mainline position and locked in place. The FRA further recommended that railroads should: *ensure that their internal regulations include adequate safety procedures regarding turnout position. *implement a paper trail to ensure adequate inspection of turnout position before a mainline track is declared cleared. Litigation Avondale Mills filed suit against Norfolk Southern claiming that the railroad was negligent in its operations through Graniteville and that this alleged negligence was the root cause of the accident. After the accident, Avondale Mills was closed, laying off thousands of employees and paid more than $140 million on cleanup and repair expenses. The trial opened on March 10, 2008, in federal court in Columbia, South Carolina. On April 7, 2008, Norfolk Southern and interests representing Avondale Mills, and its surviving entities, reached a confidential out of court settlement. On April 24, 2008, Norfolk Southern was sued by the U.S. EPA for violations of the Clean Water Act, as Horse Creek had been polluted. In a similar lawsuit in Pennsylvania, where a derailed Norfolk Southern runaway train crashed, the state of Pennsylvania sued the railroad for similar violations and won several million dollars for environmental remediation. However, fines may be minimal when compared to the damage to the surrounding environment. On March 8, 2010, Norfolk Southern Railway Company agreed to pay $4 million penalty to resolve alleged violations of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and hazardous materials laws for a 2005 chlorine spill in Graniteville, S.C. Under the settlement filed in federal court in Columbia, S.C., Norfolk Southern will be required to pay a civil penalty of $3,967,500 for the alleged CWA violations, to be deposited in the federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The alleged CWA violations, included in an amended complaint filed in March 2009, are for the discharge of tons of chlorine, a hazardous substance, from a derailed train tank car and thousands of gallons of diesel fuel from ruptured locomotive engine fuel tanks. For the alleged Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) violation for failure to immediately notify the National Response Center of the chlorine release, Norfolk Southern will pay a penalty of $32,500, to be deposited in the Hazardous Substance Superfund. Under the terms of the agreement, Norfolk Southern will provide incident command system training to environmental and transportation personnel; stock nearby Langley Pond with at least 3,000 fish to replace fish killed by the chlorine spill; and post the telephone number for the National Response Center to facilitate spill reporting. Further, the settlement includes a supplemental environmental project (SEP) valued at $100,000 to plant vegetation along the banks of Horse Creek to decrease erosion and sedimentation, thereby improving water quality in Horse Creek. Related information On May 24, 2005, Norfolk Southern was awarded the TRANSCAER National Achievement Award for 2004. TRANSCAER is an acronym for Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response, which aims to promote emergency preparedness among first responders and communities for accidents that involve chemical releases. Part of the reasons for NS's selection for this award were the emergency preparedness training that the railroad held in 18 of the 22 states through which the railroad hauls hazardous materials. Texas folk artist Doug Burr memorialized the Graniteville accident in his song \\"Graniteville\\" in his 2007 released album On Promenade. The song is fictionalized account of a husband attempting to rouse his wife from sleep to escape the dangers of the chemical spill.

It was his second film in English, written by Polanski and G√©rard Brach. The cast includes Donald Pleasence, Fran√ßoise Dorl√©ac, Lionel Stander, Jack MacGowran, Iain Quarrier, Geoffrey Sumner, Ren√©e Houston, William Franklyn, Trevor Delaney, Marie Kean. It also features Jacqueline Bisset (credited as Jackie Bisset) in a small role, in her second film appearance. The black and white cinematography is by Gil Taylor. Plot Gruff American gangster Dickey pushes his broken-down car along a causeway through rising seawater while his eccentric companion Albie lies inside, bleeding from a gunshot wound after a bungled robbery. Cut off by the unexpected rising tide, they are on the only road to a bleak and remote tidal island (Lindisfarne in Northumberland), where, in a dark castle on a hilltop, a deeply neurotic and effeminate middle-aged Englishman named George lives with his promiscuous young French wife Teresa. Dickey disconnects the phone lines and proceeds to hold the two hostage while awaiting further instructions from his underworld boss, the mysterious Katelbach. When Albie dies from his injuries, Dickey decides to take over the castle. George briefly entertains some of his obnoxious friends who show up at the castle unannounced, leading Dickey to pose as a servant while Teresa begins to flirt with one of the guests, Cecil. Dickey eventually gets word that his boss Katelbach is not going to come, so he demands George drive him to the mainland by causeway. George, who has had enough of Dickey's bullying, suddenly goes berserk and shoots him dead with his own gun (Teresa had stolen Dickey's pistol from his coat pocket and encouraged George to use it). Before dying, Dickey manages to retrieve his tommy gun from his broken-down car, which he had hidden away in the chicken house. Too weak to fire the gun at George, Dickey collapses to the ground and the automatic discharge from the weapon causes the car to explode in flames inside the chicken house. Fearful of being implicated in the killing (and of possible reprisals from Katelbach's other henchmen), Teresa frantically insists that she and George abandon the castle together. But George is in a state of shock and seems unable to leave. Desperate and afraid, Teresa runs off by herself and hides in a closet. She is later rescued by Cecil, who had returned to retrieve his rifle. Now utterly alone, George runs along the beach at daybreak. He finally sits down on a rock in the fetal position and weeps hysterically as the early morning tide rises around him. Cast * Donald Pleasence as George * Fran√ßoise Dorl√©ac as Teresa * Lionel Stander as Dickey * Jack MacGowran as Albie * Iain Quarrier as Christopher * Geoffrey Sumner as Christopher's father * Ren√©e Houston as Christopher's mother * Robert Dorning as Philip Fairweather * Marie Kean as Marion Fairweather * William Franklyn as Cecil * Jacqueline Bisset as Jacqueline * Trevor Delaney as Nicholas Production The film was shot on location in 1965 on the island of Lindisfarne (also known as Holy Island) off the coast of Northumberland, England. Lindisfarne Castle, which served as the home in the film, is now a National Trust property and can be toured by the public; despite the passage of time, the building and its surroundings are largely unchanged. Interpretation Like Polanski's previous film Repulsion, released the year before, it explores themes of horror, frustrated sexuality and alienation, which have become characteristic of many of the director's films, especially Rosemary's Baby and The Tenant. Cul-de-Sac has been compared in tone and theme with the works of Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter, and these similarities are underscored by the casting of two principal roles in the film: Jack MacGowran was renowned for his stage performances of Beckett's plays and Donald Pleasence originated the role of Davies in Pinter's The Caretaker. The film's German title is Wenn Katelbach kommt (When Katelbach Comes).

Question Do you approve of the proposed law for the alteration of the Constitution entitled 'Constitution Alteration (Monopolies) 1910'? The proposal was to add section 51a to the Constitution to read as follows: > 51a. When each House of the Parliament, in the same session, has by > Resolution declared that the industry or business of producing manufacturing > or supplying any specified goods, or of supplying any specified services, is > the subject of a monopoly, the Parliament shall have power to make laws for > carrying on the industry or business by or under the control of the > Commonwealth, and acquiring for that purpose on just terms any property used > in connexion with the industry or business.

He spent most of his working life on the Isle of Anglesey. Life Tunnicliffe was born in 1901 in Langley, Macclesfield, England, the fourth surviving child of William Tunnicliffe (died 20 June 1925) of Lane Ends Farm, Sutton, near Macclesfield,Principal Probate Registry calendars 1925, T-Tu, p. 143 a tenant farmer, formerly a boot and shoemaker,1901 England Census ‚Äì National Archives, RG13/3315, f. 29, p. 7 and Margaret (died 21 February 1942).1911 England Census ‚Äì National Archives, RG14/21493, ED. 6, Schedule 22Principal Probate Registry calendars 1942, T-Tu, p. 690 He spent his early years living on the farm at Sutton, where he saw much wildlife. As a young boy he attended Sutton St. James' C.E. Primary School, and in 1916 he began to study at the Macclesfield School of Art.http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/CandW/TunnicliffeL.htm He went on to win a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London.The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales. John Davies, Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) pg892 He married in 1929 at the Methodist Church, Whalley Range, Manchester, to Winifred Wonnacott (24 June 1902 ‚Äì 27 June 1969),England & Wales, Death Index, 1916‚Äì2007Principal Probate Registry calendars 1969, T-Tu, p. 267 a fellow art student, from Hollywood, near Belfast.England & Wales, Marriage Index, 1916‚Äì2005 In 1947 he moved from Manchester to a house called \\"Shorelands\\" at Malltraeth, on the estuary of the Afon Cefni on Anglesey, where he lived until his death in 1979. Work Tunnicliffe worked in several media, including watercolor painting, etching and aquatint, wood engraving, woodcut, scraperboard (sometimes called scratchboard), and oil painting. A Snowy Owl, Anglesey, date unknown. Much of Tunnicliffe's work depicted birds in their natural settings and other naturalistic scenes. He illustrated Henry Williamson's Tarka the Otter. His work was also used to illustrate Brooke Bond tea cards and as a result was seen by millions of young people in the United Kingdom during the 1950s and 1960s. He also illustrated a number of books, including the Ladybird books. His work was characterised by its precision and accuracy, but also by the way in which he was able to portray birds as they were seen in nature rather than as stiff scientific studies. From March 1953, he painted many of the cover illustrations for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds's (RSPB) magazine Bird Notes, and several for the later Birds magazines. Two of the originals are on long-term loan to the gallery at Oriel Ynys M√¥n, but in 1995 the RSPB sold 114 at a Sotheby's auction, raising ¬£210,000; the most expensive being a picture of a partridge, which sold for ¬£6,440.RSPB Birds magazine, Vol 16 No 01, February‚ÄìApril 1996, page 10 At his death, much of his personal collection of work was bequeathed to Anglesey council on the condition that it was housed together and made available for public viewing. This body of work can now be seen at Oriel Ynys M√¥n (The Anglesey Gallery) near Llangefni. His work is still celebrated with the Charles and Winifred Tunnicliffe Memorial Art Competition, which is held annually at Hollinhey Primary School, Sutton, which itself is built on land which was formerly part of the farm he lived on as a boy.

Baldwin's small machine shop, established in 1825, grew to become Baldwin Locomotive Works, one of the largest and most successful locomotive manufacturing firms in the United States. The most famous of the early locomotives was Old Ironsides, built by Matthias Baldwin in 1832. Baldwin was also a strong advocate of abolitionism. Early years Matthias W. Baldwin was born December 10, 1795, in Elizabethtown, New Jersey. He was the youngest of five children born to a prosperous carriage builder named William Baldwin. Following his father's death in 1799, executors of the Baldwin estate proved unequal to the task, however, and his widow and children were left in difficult financial circumstances owing to their poor management. Although he received a very satisfactory common school education, Baldwin's inclination and aptitude related to mechanical tinkering from an early age. Toys would be deconstructed and reassembled to learn their inner workings and spare bits and pieces of machinery would be put to new use in a makeshift workshop inside his mother's home. Baldwin's first stationary steam engine, built in 1828. In 1811 the 16-year-old Baldwin was made an apprentice jewelry maker to the Woolworth Brothers of Frankford, Pennsylvania (now part of the City of Philadelphia). Apprenticeship in these days was a virtually coercive relationship marked by long hours of labor and miserable compensation. In 1817, shortly before the fixed term of his indenture was completed, Baldwin moved together with his mother to Philadelphia. There the budding jewelry maker was employed by the firm of Fletcher & Gardner, one of the leading jewelry manufacturers of the city. Baldwin proved to be a valuable journeyman employee over the course of the next two years. In 1819 Baldwin quit Fletcher & Gardner and began to work as an independent silversmith. Baldwin quickly proved himself a skilled and innovative craftsman, and developed a revolutionary new technique for making gold plate. Rather than the painstaking application of gold leaf to base metal, Baldwin's method of manufacture made use of soldering a piece of gold to the base metal and rolling the two together until the requisite thickness was attained. Baldwin's technique came to gain wide acceptance as the industry standard although, unfortunately for him, it was never protected through acquisition of a patent. Machinery maker During the middle 1820s demand for jewelry and silverware suddenly experienced a dramatic decline, forcing Baldwin to search for a new occupation. In 1825, Baldwin went into partnership with a machinist named David Mason to form a company which made industrial equipment for printers and bookbinders: tools, dies, and machines that had previously been exclusively imported from Europe. The pair became involved in the manufacture of printing cylinders and perfected an improved process for the etching of steel plates. The needs of the growing firm demanded both larger quarters and an improved power source. In 1828 Baldwin devised and constructed his first steam engine, a stationary device that produced 5 horsepower of output and remained in use in the shop for four decades. Baldwin's engine was not only the most powerful of its day but also incorporated mechanical innovation to power rotary motion, which ultimately came to have application in transport, including marine engine design. The original engine still survives in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. Demand for steam engines proved to be great and Baldwin and Mason quickly supplanted their printing machinery business with an engine-making division. Within a decade the firm would be regarded as the top engine maker in the country. Locomotive builder Baldwin's Old Ironsides engine, manufactured in 1832. Baldwin put his knowledge of stationary steam engines to new use in 1831 when he constructed his first experimental steam locomotive. Based on designs first shown at the Rainhill Trials in England, Baldwin's prototype was a small demonstration engine that was displayed at Peale's Philadelphia City Museum. The engine was strong enough to pull a few cars that carried four passengers each. This locomotive was unusual for the time in that it burned coal, which was available locally, instead of wood. The next year Baldwin built his first commissioned steam locomotive for the fledgling Philadelphia, Germantown & Norristown Railroad. This engine, nicknamed Old Ironsides, traveled at the rate of only in initial trials made on November 23, 1832, but the machine was later refined and improved so that a peak speed of was attained. It weighed over 5 tons, with diameter rear wheels, cylinders with stroke and a diameter boiler which took 20 minutes to raise steam. This locomotive was a 2-2-0 (Whyte notation) type, meaning it had one unpowered leading axle and one powered driving axle. Although contracted for $4,000, owing to performance shortcomings a compromise price of $3,500 (equal to $ today) between the railroad and the budding Baldwin Locomotive Works was ultimately agreed upon and received. Baldwin was issued \\"Art of managing and supplying fire for generating steam in locomotive-engines\\" in 1836. As the text of the patent explained \\"The intention of this new mode of managing the fire is to enable me, at each water station, or any convenient place to have a clear coal fire waiting the arrival of the engine so that the grate or fire- place which has been in use, may be detached or slid out, and that containing the clear fire, made to occupy its place.\\" Personal life A statue of Baldwin in front of Philadelphia City Hall. Baldwin was a devout member of the Presbyterian Church and a consistent donor to religious and secular charitable causes throughout his life. In 1824 he was a founder of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. In 1835, he donated money to establish a school for African- American children in Philadelphia and continued to pay the teachers' salaries out of his own pocket for years thereafter. Baldwin was an outspoken supporter for the abolition of slavery in the United States, a position that was used against him and his firm by competitors eager to sell locomotives to railroads based in the slaveholding South. Baldwin was a member of the 1837 Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention and emerged as a defender of voting rights for the state's black male citizens. Baldwin married a distant cousin in 1827, Sarah C. Baldwin. Together, they had three children. One of his last philanthropic efforts was the donation of 10% of his company's income to the Civil War Christian Mission in the early 1860s. Death and legacy Matthias Baldwin memorial in Laurel Hill Cemetery Baldwin died on September 7, 1866, at his country home in Wissinoming, and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. At the time of its founder's death, the Baldwin Locomotive Works had produced some 1,500 steam locomotives. The company ultimately produced a total of some 75,000 steam locomotive engines, before it terminated production in 1956. A statue of Baldwin was first erected in Philadelphia in 1906, and moved in front of Philadelphia City Hall in 1936. In late May 2020, it was briefly defaced with the words \\"colonizer\\" and \\"murderer\\", and was cleaned soon afterward. The incident increased interest in Baldwin's legacy, according to the president of the volunteer group Friends of Matthias Baldwin Park.

The title was chosen because, according to the makers of the movie, 41.11 ¬∞C is \\"The Temperature at Which the Brain Begins to Die\\", which is the film's tag-line. The film addresses five charges made against George W. Bush in Moore's film and criticizes 2004 Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry. It was released during the run-up to the 2004 United States Presidential general election. It took six weeks to make Celsius 41.11. The production was funded and the film distributed to a limited number of movie theaters by Citizens United, a conservative political organization. Celsius 41.11 performed less well at the box office than comparable left-leaning documentaries and significantly poorer than Fahrenheit 9/11. The producer attributed this to voter fatigue and to a timetabling clash with the World Series. The critics' response was described as \\"irk[ed]\\" by the BBC. A number of critics described the film as a campaign advertisement for George W. Bush. Several believed that the movie would appeal primarily to convinced supporters of George W. Bush and was unlikely to sway undecided voters or change the opinion of Kerry supporters. The critics felt the film shared the flaws of Fahrenheit 9/11 without sharing all of its virtues; in particular, it was criticised for a comparative lack of emotion. The reliability of some of the individuals interviewed was questioned by The New York Times and The Boston Globe. Critics frequently compared the style to that of a PowerPoint presentation with some adding that the speed with which the film had been produced was evident in the quality of the finished product. Opinions as to the quality of the arguments advanced varied with Michael Graham of the National Review stating that the film had done a \\"solid job\\" in answering Moore's arguments whilst Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide called the film a \\"shrill, repetitive screed\\". Conception and production The production of Celsius 41.11 was funded by the conservative political organization Citizens United. The organization's president, David Bossie, was surprised at the success of Fahrenheit 9/11 both at the box office and in rallying support for the Democratic political position. \\"After seeing Moore's impact, I wanted to counterpunch\\", he said to the Los Angeles Times in 2004, adding that, \\"Documentaries have become a weapon of the left\\". Celsius 41.11 took six weeks to make and includes a song, \\"John Boy\\", specially written and performed by the country music singer Larry Gatlin. Celsius 41.11 was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America because it contains a graphic image of an Iraqi torture victim and includes swearing on two occasions. The film's producers disagreed with the rating, stating that it wasn't \\"consistent with other films in theaters.\\" They choose to appeal the rating but were ultimately unsuccessful. Synopsis Celsius 41.11 defends Bush against five of the arguments advanced by Fahrenheit 9/11 and additionally criticizes John Kerry, arguing that his opposition to the Vietnam War and his military service in that same war are contradictory positions. The opening images of the film are of the second plane hitting the World Trade Center on September 11. The film then moves to clips of the demonstrations against the war in Iraq, including an interview with an unnamed protester who says she would be happy to live under a dictatorship if the ruler provided universal health care. The next segment shows images of dead children. The film alleges that a feud between the White House and the CIA resulted in Bill Clinton refusing to broker the surrender of Osama bin Laden in 1997. It also contains a list of the terrorist attacks that have occurred since the Iran hostage crisis that one reviewer described as \\"chilling\\". Speeches made by John Kerry and running mate John Edwards on the danger posed by the weapons of mass destruction Iraq was accused of possessing are also included. Participants *Fred Thompson ‚Äì politician, former senator *Charles Krauthammer ‚Äì neo-conservative columnist, political commentator *Michael Ledeen ‚Äì foreign policy specialist *Mansoor Ijaz ‚Äì media commentator on terrorism *Michael Barone ‚Äì political analyst, pundit, journalist *Michael Medved ‚Äì neo-conservative political commentator *Fred Barnes ‚Äì neo-conservative political commentator *Joshua Muravchik ‚Äì scholar specialising in Middle East politics, democracy and the history of socialism *Barbara Comstock ‚Äì politician *Victoria Toensing ‚Äì lawyer, legal commentator *Bill Sammon ‚Äì Vice-president of Fox News *John O'Neill ‚Äì Vietnam War veteran, lawyer and spokesman for Swift Vets and POWs for Truth *Alice S. Fisher - lawyer Theatrical release Citizens United were prohibited by the Federal Elections Commission from advertising the movie on television or funding the broadcast of the movie on television during the 60 days before the election when restrictions apply to political broadcasts by outside organizations. The premiere of Celsius 41.11 took place at the Loews theatre in Georgetown (Washington, D.C.) on September 28, 2004 and was attended by the author Jerome Corsi and the sister of the pilot whose plane crashed into the Pentagon on September 11, Debra Burlingame. Celsius 41.11 was also shown at the first Liberty Film Festival. Both Lions Gate Entertainment (the distributors of Fahrenheit 9/11) and Fox Searchlight (which specialises in the distribution of independent films) declined the opportunity to distribute the film to cinemas. David Bossie, the film's executive producer, believed that the distributors rejected the film on ideological grounds, whilst Lionel Chetwynd and Ted Steinberg felt that the close proximity of the election which gave the film an abnormally short shelf-life put the distributors off. Celsius 41.11 was eventually self-distributed by Citizens United. It was screened in 116 cinemas on its opening weekend and had a three-week theatrical run. Although the film was popular in conservative areas, on average box office takings were below those for comparible left-leaning political documentaries such as Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry and Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism. Lionel Chetwynd suggested that the low audiences were due to the film's late release date with respect to the 2004 United States Presidential campaign adding that opening on the same weekend as the World Series may have compounded the problem. Citizens United subsequently printed 200,000 DVDs of the film, many of which were given to its supporters. Response In common with Fahrenheit 9/11, Celsius 41.11 proved to be a contentious film. It received 42 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 11 reviews and an 11% rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews. The BBC described the newspaper critics response as \\"irk[ed]\\" commenting that \\"many newspapers, while not disagreeing with the facts of the documentary, have not been impressed with it as a piece of entertainment.\\" Reviewers generally agreed that the film would appeal most to those who were already convinced supporters of George W. Bush and was unlikely to change the views of those who opposed him. Kerry Lengel of The Arizona Republic said, \\"Celsius 41.11 isn't going to change many minds.\\" Michael Graham of the National Review said, \\"I just don‚Äôt think there are a lot of people left willing to be persuaded. Some conservatives will watch and say ‚ÄúSee, I told you so!‚Äù Liberals will watch and dismiss the arguments as partisan. Undecideds‚Ä¶well, they won‚Äôt watch it.\\" Desson Thompson of The Washington Post and Robert Koehler of Variety said that the film preached to the choir. Some reviewers said that Celsius 41.11 felt like a campaign ad for Bush or, possibly, an attack ad against Kerry. =Comparisons to Fahrenheit 9/11= Michael Graham of the National Review praised Celsius 41.11 saying that \\"unlike Michael Moore‚Äôs film, Celsius 41.11 is an actual documentary\\" and that the film was \\"far more logical\\" than Fahrenheit 9/11. However, Graham also added that \\"41.11 isn't nearly as emotionally powerful as Moore‚Äôs film\\", a view with which Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel concurred. Philip Kennicott of The Washington Post described Moore's film, Fahrenheit 9/11, as \\"well crafted\\" believing that, while Moore had angered the targets of his film he \\"went the extra mile, creatively, to do so\\". In contrast Kennicott described Celsius 41.11 as \\"dull, lazy and inconsistent\\". Celsius 41.11 was criticised for sharing some of what reviewers perceived to be the flaws of Fahrenheit 9/11. For example, Desson Thomson of The Washington Post (although generally positive about Celsius 41.11) said that in the case of both films \\"the spleen factor could poison small children\\". Writing in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Duane Dudek said, \\"as with Fahrenheit 9/11, it's impossible to separate the facts and analysis presented in Celsius from the filmmakers' intent.\\" However, Celsius 41.11 was additionally criticised for failing to share what the reviewers perceived to be virtues of Moore's film. Robert Koelher of Variety said that \\"...\\"Celsius\\" shares Moore's blatant agit-prop but none of his humor or entertainment sense\\". Similarly, Michael Atikinson of The Village Voice regarded the film as \\"deliberately ap[ing] Michael Moore's modus operandi, minus the humor or any sense of sympathy for real people.\\" Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe concluded that \\"...\\"Celsius 41.11\\" doesn't have anything on anyone as pointedly damning or funny as some of what Moore shows of the current Bush administration.\\" =Comparison to FahrenHYPE 9/11= Manohla Dargis of The New York Times compared Celsius 41.11 unfavorably to FahrenHYPE 9/11, another documentary film aimed at rebutting the arguments made by Michael Moore. While Dargis felt that the purpose of FahrenHYPE 9/11 was the detailed rebutting of the arguments put forward by Moore's film, she felt that the purpose of Celsius 41.11 was to \\"make you afraid ‚Äî very, very afraid\\". She stated that Celsius 41.11 \\"presents a vision of the world verging on the apocalyptic\\". Dargis concluded \\"finally [the film is] interesting only because it represents another unconvincing effort on the part of conservatives to mount a viable critique of Mr. Moore.\\" =Criticisms of the production= The Boston Globe and The New York Times both questioned the reliability of some of the individuals interviewed. The Globe called the experts \\"occasionally dubious\\" saying that they \\"offer[ed] drive-by disses and plain untruths\\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was particularly critical of the film for not detailing the extent of Mansoor Ijaz's investments in the Middle East or \\"just how intimately familiar he was with the nonsense of the Clinton White House\\". Both publications, however, spoke well of the contributions of Fred Thompson with The New York Times calling him \\"thoughtful\\" and the Globe adding that \\"with his level head and reflective words, [he] makes partisanship seem dignified.\\" Several critics felt that insufficient time had been spent on the film. Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide said that it \\"bears all the hallmarks of having been thrown together in a heated rush\\", a criticism echoed by Robert Koehler of Variety who called the editing \\"choppy\\". Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe described the film as \\"a seemingly last-minute series of talking heads and montages\\". A number of critics compared the style of the film to that of a PowerPoint presentation. =Overall response to the film= Opinions of the arguments advanced by the film varied widely. Michael Graham of the National Review said that the movie \\"does a solid job of logically confronting the (for lack of a better word) arguments Moore makes against Bush\\". Desson Thomson of The Washington Post concluded that \\"there are some very thought- provoking points, and the movie deserves a balanced listening-to.\\" Tom Keogh of the Seattle Times felt that the arguments presented were \\"lightly persuasive\\" but that \\"there is nothing new here or usefully evenhanded.\\" He eventually concluded, \\"It's not that Moore's film doesn't deserve an argument. But it does deserve a more thoughtful one.\\" Duane Dudek said that \\"some of the film's charges are troubling\\", although he went on to note that \\"the film's arguments are the echo chamber opposite of Mr. Moore's\\". Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe called the film \\"a crude polemical mush\\". Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide called it a \\"shrill, repetitive screed\\" Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com said it is \\"so bad it's almost like performance art\\". Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice wrote a particularly stinging review calling the movie a \\"desperate four-waller\\" and \\"a cut-rate vision of flabby white men defending their own bloodthirsty opportunism\\". Selecting it as one of the five worst films of 2004, Matthew Lucas of The Dispatch (Lexington) said of the film, \\"Displaying nowhere near the artistic flair that Michael Moore possesses, this film shows you that no matter what your political affiliations are, Moore makes a much more entertaining case.\\" References External links 2004 films Films about Michael Moore 2004 documentary films Citizens United Productions films ","title":"Celsius 41.11"},{"id":"1370977","text":"Ticho House Ticho House Entrance Ticho House (, Beit Tikho) is a historical home in Jerusalem, Israel, now functioning as a museum, administered as part of the national Israel Museum, which includes a restaurant and cultural center.

In Sanskrit Trivedi means 'one that knows the three Vedas‚Äô, from tri = 'three' + veda ‚Äò(sacred) knowledge' leading to vedi = 'to see'. Similar family names are Chaturvedi (one who knows four vedas) and Dwivedi (one who knows two vedas). Origin of surname Though the common assumption is that Trivedi means 'one who knows three vedas', oral Hindu tradition has an alternative explanation. In Sanskrit, Tri = 'three' and Vedi = 'to see'. Therefore, a Trivedi is one with 'three-fold vision', or someone who is able to see into the past, present, and future. The spiritual connotation is that a Trivedi is a master of time and can see into the past and future. The more practical explanation is that a Trivedi is a master Historian; one who is well-versed in History and can best guide the public for decisions that will impact the future. There is no limit to the number of vedas an individual can learn, therefore there is no reason why a Dwivedi or Trivedi could not learn all four vedas. The explanation that a Trivedi only knows three out of four vedas is a very superficial translation of a Sanskrit surname with deeper meaning. Geographical distribution Trivedi is a pan-North Indian Brahmin surname. Within India, Trivedi surname will most commonly be encountered in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. In ancient India, there was much mobility of Brahmins through vast regions depending on where their expertise was needed. At that time, most people in North/Central India spoke Sanskrit, so a Trivedi could easily move around between regions with no language barrier. As the languages evolved from Sanskrit into the local languages of modern times, a Trivedi that resided in a particular region adapted that language. As of 2014, there are approximately 112,129 people in the world with surname Trivedi. Of those, approximately 88.6% of all known bearers of the surname Trivedi were residents of India.

It can be regarded as the Cantonese equivalent of the English fuck. Its Mandarin cognate, , is also used by young people in Taiwan to mean \\"cool\\" (in this context it is not censored on TV broadcasts, but considered as a sub-culture). In classic Chinese Diu is a word in the Cantonese language. It appears frequently in the text of the classic novel Water Margin, and is written as È≥• (meaning \\"bird\\", pronounced ni«éo in Mandarin and niu5 in Cantonese when used in this usual sense). It is used as an emphatic adjective with a function similar to the English \\"fucking\\", \\"bloody\\" or \\"god damned\\". For example, > Water Margin, Chp. 29 Diu means primarily the penis. It is written as Â±å when used in this sense, but usually as È≥• when used as an emphatic adjective. For example, > Romance of the Western Chamber (), Act 5, Scene 3 () has its female equivalent Â±Ñ (pronounced bƒ´ in Mandarin and bei1 in Cantonese) in the traditional Chinese written language. In the Yuan Dynasty operas, the word, meaning penis, is sometimes written as È†π. For example, > Jiu Fengchen (), Act 1 () In Hong Kong and Macau The written form [+] is mainly seen in Hong Kong, for example, on graffiti. In Cantonese, it is used as a transitive verb meaning to copulate. In a manner similar to the English word fuck, it is also used to express dismay, disgrace, disapproval and so on. For example, someone may shout \\"diu lei!\\" (\\"fuck you!\\" or \\"fuck off!\\") at somebody when he or she finds that other person annoying. \\"Diu Lei Lo Mo!\\" (, \\"fuck your mother\\")Hutton, Christopher and Bolton, Kingsley; A Dictionary of Cantonese Slang, page 95; University of Hawai'i Press, Honolulu; 2005 is a highly offensive profanity in Cantonese when directed against a specific person instead of used as a general exclamation. In contrast to the English phrase \\"fuck your mother\\", which indicates that the person being attacked commits sexual acts with his own mother, the Cantonese expression has the implied meaning of \\"I fuck your mother\\". The form is absent in the Big-5 character set on computers. The Government of Hong Kong has extended Unicode and the Big-5 character set with the Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set (HKSCS), which includes Chinese characters only used in Cantonese, including the Five Great Profanities. The government explained that the reason for these characters being included is to allow for the Hong Kong Police to record criminal suspects' statements. Consequently, these characters are now also in Unicode. In English, \\"damn\\" gives birth to its euphemism \\"darn\\"; similarly in Cantonese, especially Hong Kong Cantonese, diu has yiu (), tiu (), siu (), chiu (), biu (), and hiu () as its euphemisms, which all rhyme with \\"iu\\".

After being expelled from Italy with the rise of Fascist Benito Mussolini, he went to Moscow, where he became an operative for the Soviet Comintern. He was sent to Mexico, where he was implicated in at least two assassination attempts - of Cuban communist Julio Mella and Russian Leon Trotsky, there in exile. Later Vidali was active in other locations, finally leading the new communist part in the Free Territory of Trieste beginning in 1947 after World War II. He later represented the community in Parliament after it was annexed by Italy.  Early life  He was born in the small coastal town of Muggia, then part of the county of Istria in the Austro- Hungarian Empire, and now part of Italy. As a teenager, he joined the socialist movement in the nearby port city of Trieste. At the age of twenty, Vidali is said to have been one of the founders of the Italian Communist Party. In 1922 he was expelled from the country after Benito Mussolini ascended to power with the Fascist movement. Vidali was described as a Bolshevik in the file kept on him by the police in Fascist Italy. Comintern agent Vidali found refuge in the Soviet Union, relocating to Moscow. Working for the International Red Aid, Vidali was sent by the Comintern to Mexico to discipline its national party, according the Mexican Communist Party. During this period, Vidali became romantically involved with photographer and communist activist Tina Modotti, who had a previous liaison with artist Diego Rivera and was then involved with Cuban communist Julio Antonio Mella, then in Mexico. =Murder of Julio Mella= According to Tennant, Vidali's interest in Modotti was related to his killing her current lover, Mella. Mella was among the founders of the Comintern version of the Communist Party of Cuba (Tennant, 1999). Mella had fled Cuba for Mexico in Gerardo Machado‚Äôs time, where he joined and then left the Mexican Communist Party. Diego Rivera portrayed Vidali, Modotti, and Mella in his mural In the Arsenal. He included the figure of Tina Modotti holding a belt of ammunition on the right side of the mural. Vidali is shown staring over her shoulder and wearing a black hat. Modotti gazes lovingly at Julio Antonio Mella (shown with a light colored hat). Given Rivera's personal knowledge of these people, some analysts or critics suggest that his portrayal was evidence of Vidali's and Rivera's involvement in Mella's assassination. Rivera was subsequently expelled from the Mexican Communist Party. In early December 1928, Mella was expelled from the Mexican Communist Party for his association with Trotskyites, but he was readmitted two weeks later. Mella was killed by gunshot in Mexico City on January 10, 1929, an incident believed to be a political assassination. Modotti was by Mella's side as he was shot. She was seen holding his arm, allegedly in a manner similar to her portrayal in Rivera's mural. Vidali is believed to have used the revolver he commonly carried to murder Mella. Modotti was known to keep an M1911 pistol in her house. Officially, Jos√© Agust√≠n L√≥pez (said to have no particular political affiliations) was charged with Mella's murder; two other known criminals, Jose Magri√±at and Antonio Sanabria, were also suspects. Police investigators received conflicting eyewitness reports, which are notoriously unreliable. In one version, Mella and Modotti were walking alone, whereas another said that Vidali was walking together with the two. Mella was shot at point-blank range, and neither Modotti nor Vidali were injured. Modotti gave a false name to the investigators, and, although police were suspicious of her alibi, she was released soon after being arrested. Magri√±at was also set free: he was ultimately killed in Cuba (allegedly by communists) in 1933Albers, 2002 The official position of the present Cuban government is that Mella was killed on Machado's orders. It acknowledges that Modotti was known to have been a Stalinist operative in a number of countries. Some in Cuba continue to believe that Vidali killed Mella. How Machado's men could have operated alone and independently in the highly politicized environment of Mexico City is not explained. According to Abers (2002), both Magri√±at and Rivera (who had just returned from Cuba) would have warned Mella that he was in danger. Spanish Civil War Vidali was ordered to go to Spain, where he arrived in May 1936 under the pseudonym of Carlos Contreras. He ked efforts to prepare, supervise and coordinate the Antifascist Worker and Peasant MilitiasStanley G Payne, Spanish Civil War, The Soviet Union, and Communism, Yale Press, 2004 (MAOC), organized by the Spanish Communist Party since 1934. This was before the Spanish Civil War broke out. Because he had performed military training in the soviet Frunze Academy, Vidali, and other comrades such as Enrique L√≠ster, are credited with markedly improving the preparation of the militias. As a senior advisor for the Comintern in Spain,Alejandro de Quesada, The Spanish Civil War 1936-39 (2), Osprey Publishing, 2015 Vidali headed the 5th Regiment (Quinto Regimiento). It was responsible for the political formation of MAOC's regiments.Antony Beevor, The Battle for Spain, 2006 In the 1937 pro-Republican propaganda film The Spanish Earth, Vidali was shown addressing an assembly of military personnel. In Mexico and Italy Vidali returned to Mexico. He was identified as involved in the May 24, 1940 attack on Leon Trotsky's residence in Mexico City, a failed assassination attempt. Iosif Grigulevich, a Soviet NKVD operative, and Mexican painter David Alfaro Siqueiros were also involved in the assault. Vidali is thought to have been involved with the insertion of assassin Ram√≥n Mercader into Trotsky's inner; Mercader killed Trotsky later that year. Vittorio Vidali returned to Trieste in 1947 after World War II, when the Free Territory of Trieste was established. He soon became one of the most influential members of the Communist Party there. In 1948, after the Tito-Stalin split, Vidali became the leader of the party, and conducted a thorough effort to decrease the influence of Tito in Trieste's Communist organizations. He also worked to reduce the influence of the Yugoslav Party on the Communist Party of the Free Territory of Trieste. He strengthened connections with the Italian Communists. During this period, he also clashed with the local Slovene minority that had been influential among Trieste's Communist before his arrival. After 1954, when Trieste became part of Italy again, Vidali was elected to and served as a member of Italian Parliament from this area. Reputation Reportedly Tina Modotti said to Valent√≠n Gonz√°lez in Spain, after he had decided not to kill Vidali, words to the effect: \\"You should have shot him, I hate him\\". But she continued: \\"I have to follow him until I die\\" (which she did). The exploits of Vidali in carrying out Trotsky's assassination, and lethal purges of agents in the Soviet Union and Fulgencio Batista's Cuba (such as Sandalio Junco in the latter) ) gained him attention. Juli√°n Gorkin likened Vidali's activities, including known travels through Cuba before and after Fidel Castro's coming to power, and his presence in Turkey, Mexico, and Spain in relation to Soviet Communist activities to the farflung exploits of British writer Ian Fleming's well-known MI-6 character in his James Bond series of novels.

After becoming a political activist, Mella had studied law in the University of Havana but was expelled in 1925. He was working against the government of Gerardo Machado, who became a dictator of Cuba. Mella left the country, reaching Central America. He traveled north to Mexico City, where he worked with other exiles and communist supporters against the Machado government. He was assassinated in 1929, but historians still disagree on the parties behind his death. The 21st-century Cuban government regards Mella as a communist hero and martyr. Some historians believe that Mella was a victim of the Stalin-Trotsky struggle, which played out internationally. Former leader Leon Trotsky was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1929, ultimately settling in Mexico City. He was assassinated there in 1940. Early life Mella was born Nicanor McPartland in 1903 in Havana.A R G E N P R E S S . i n f o - JULIO ANTONIO MELLA - 9 / 8 / 2008 at www.argenpress.info His father was Nicanor Mella Bre√° (1851‚Äì1929), a tailor and son of Mat√≠as Ram√≥n Mella Castillo, one of the heroes of the Dominican Republican war of independence. Mella's mother was Cecilia McPartland, daughter of Irish immigrants.Julio Antonio Mella -BIOGRAFIA- at www.cubaliteraria.com Although Cecilia was not married to Nicanor senior, they initially named Mella after his father. As children, Nicanor Mella and his younger brother Cecilio went to New Orleans with their mother while she convalesced from lung troubles. Later the boys returned to Cuba to live with their father's wife Mercedes Berm√∫dez Ferreira. She acted as their stepmother. At that time, Mells's name was changed from Nicanor to Antonio, and his younger brother was renamed as Nicasio Mella. Antonio Mella engaged in secondary studies at Chandler College in Marianao, Havana, and Colegio Mim√≥. His step-mother, Mercedes Berm√∫dez Ferreira, died in 1915. After visiting the US again in 1917, Mella returned to Cuba. He prepared for the University of Havana at Academia Newton before being sent to boarding school at the prestigious Escolapios of Guanabacoa. After being expelled from here, Mella finished his secondary studies at the public Instituto de la Habana and/or Instituto de Segunda Ense√±anza of Pinar del R√≠o, in 1921. Mella became a political activist and was first arrested during the democratic rule (1921‚Äì1924) of Alfredo Zayas. He studied law at the University of Havana, emerging as a radical leader. Students forcibly occupied Havana University and sought power through demands for changes to improve their education and academic independence, including: modernization of textbooks, autonomy for the university, free education for all, and more unusually, for students to serve as head of the university for a day. History of Cuba Timetable: 1905 thru 1928 at www.historyofcuba.comEl Origen de la Revolucion Cubana at www.amigospais-guaracabuya.org Mella was soon involved in the political struggle against Gerardo Machado, a future Cuban president. The student organized the formal founding of the Moscow-directed, \\"internationalist\\" Partido Comunista de Cuba. At this time he was also associated with women radicals Rosario Guillaume (Charito) and Sarah Pascual. He was expelled from the University after being arrested and accused of a bomb plot. After being released from jail in late 1925, Mella fled to Central America in early 1926, and headed north to Mexico City.  Ancestors Foundation of the \\"internationalized\\" Cuban Communist Party Mella in 1928 Cuba had a number of communist and/or anarchist parties, especially in Havana and in the eastern area of Cuba, at least as early as the beginning of the Cuban Republic. Possibly the first was founded in 1906 near Manzanillo by Agust√≠n Mart√≠n Veloz (Martinillo). The original \\"internationalized\\" Communist Party of Cuba was formed in the 1920s when Gerardo Machado was president and then dictator of the country. This organization is said to be related to several fronts, including the anti-imperialist league and its anti-clerical analogue. This party was formally recognized by Moscow in 1925. Contacts with Moscow representatives were said to be made in a restaurant at 687 Compostela Street, at the corner of Luz Street in Havana. The founders of the Cuban Communist Party are listed as: Julio Antonio Mella, Juan Marinello, Alejandro Barreiro, Carlos Bali√±o, Alfonso Bernal del Riesgo, Jes√∫s Men√©ndez, Carlos Rafael Rodr√≠guez, L√°zaro Pe√±a, Blas Roca, Rub√©n Mart√≠nez Villena, Anibal Escalante, Emilio Roig and Fabio Grobart. Fabio Grobart (aka Abraham Semjovitch; Alberto Blanco) was born in Bialystok, Poland, in 1905 and died in Cuba on October 22, 1994. He was a member of the Soviet-dominated Comintern and was often considered a covert, Moscow-appointed leader of the Communists in the Caribbean area.Castro el infiel at www.cartadecuba.orgFabio Grobart, founder (Cuban Communist Party), dies October 22 in History at www.brainyhistory.comJos√© Cant√≥n Navarro - The First Cuban Communist Party: Its banner was never lowered (2005) at www.walterlippmann.comhttp://lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/castro/1987/19870823 Other founders also used pseudonym: Mella used such names as Cauht√©moc Zapata, Kim (El Machete), and Lord McPartland in his writing. The revolutionary known as Blas Roca was born Francisco Calder√≠o.Blas Roca: maestro de revolucionarios at www.latinamericanstudies.org Alejandro Barreiro is sometimes considered an anarchist,Presencia del Autenticismo en el Presidio at www.autentico.org although the Communist Party of Cuba claims him as their own. Barriero is said to have gone mad in 1929, when Mexican police raped his daughters after searching his house. The pseudonyms chosen by some of these \\"actors\\" often included historical references. For instance Fabio or, in English, Fabian, referred to Roman consul Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, known to have used stealthy tactics. Fabian Socialism was an English socialist movement, to which playwright George Bernard Shaw belonged, which advocated stealthy democratic change. The Cuban Communist Party was later renamed as the People's Socialist Party for electoral reasons. Its policy was dictated from Moscow. At one time, it supported the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado. Later it supported Fulgencio Batista, in whose government Dr. Juan Marinello and Carlos Rafael Rodriguez were ministers without portfolio.Dolgoff S: The Cuban Revolution at Dan Ward, Pfitzer College, California USA Although covert communist support was given to Castro and Che Guevara in the Sierra Maestra, the People's Socialist Party was officially critical of Fidel Castro's rise to power until the summer of 1958. Mexico Mella fled Machado's repression in Cuba. He escaped through Cienfuegos, Cuba, reaching Honduras in 1926. He traveled from there through Guatemala and into Mexico, settling in Mexico City. In Mexico, he wrote for a number of newspapers: Cuba Libre, El Libertador, Tren Blindado (\\"The Armored Train\\", a Trotskyist symbol),Cuba: ¬øUn complot internacional de mentirosos? at lahaine.org El Machete, and the Bolet√≠n del Torcedor (which is published in Havana).Julio Antonio Mella -BIOGRAFIA- at www.cubaliteraria.com Additionally, in 1926, he founded the Asociaci√≥n de Nuevos Emigrados Revolucionarios Cubanos. Death At the time of his murder, he was working as a Cuban Marxist revolutionary in Mexico. He worked with other exiles and supporters to organize the overthrow of the Cuban government of General Gerardo Machado. This cause was an embarrassment to the Cuban Communist Party, which was trying to gain power by establishing a modus vivendi with Machado. Cuban communists were also disturbed by suspecting that Mella had fallen under the influence of former Soviet leader Leon Trotsky, who lived in exile in Mexico. Mella was assassinated on January 10, 1929, while walking home late at night with photographer Tina Modotti, believed to be Comintern operative. The Mexican government tried to implicate Modotti in the murder, publishing nude photographs of her by American Edward Weston in an attempt to generate public opinion against her. Muralist Diego Rivera was highly active in defending her and exposing the Mexican government's crude attempt to frame her. Analysts have not reached consensus on the parties responsible for Mella's assassination: the dictatorial Cuban government; the result of Trotsky-Stalin Communist Party feuding; or by a combination of these interests. While two known criminals were charged with his murder, there was speculation that Italian Communist assassin Vittorio Vidali had committed the crime. Murder of Julio Mella Many political murders, often of communist backsliders and other \\"heretics\\" such as Trotskyists, have been attributed to Vidali's \\"bloody hand\\". Outside of Cuba, he was believed responsible for Mella's death. Mella and Vidali had both been involved with Modotti in sexual relationships. All three figures are represented in Diego Rivera's mural In the Arsenal.Diego, Lupe, Tina y Frida Kahlo at www.chapingo.mx Because Diego Rivera was close to these three, some observers interpreted his mural as evidence of being involved in the plot against Mella. Rivera was expelled from the Mexican Communist Party in 1929, also suspected of Trotskyite leanings. The police investigating this crime received conflicting eyewitness reports. In one version, Mella and Modotti were walking alone, in another Vidali was said to be walking with Mella and Modotti. Mella's wounds were made from point blank range, and neither Modotti or Vidali were injured. As Modotti initially gave a false name to the investigators, the police were suspicious of her alibi. She was arrested, but soon released. Officially Jos√© Agust√≠n L√≥pez (said to have no particular political affiliations) was charged with Mella's murder, but two other known killers, Jos√© Magri√±at and Antonio Sanabr√≠a, were also suspected. Magri√±at was arrested but soon released. He was killed by Communists in Cuba in 1933.Albers, 2002 The official position of the present Cuban government is still that Mella was killed at Gerardo Machado's orders, but it admits that Tina Modotti was a Stalinist operative who operated in a number of countries. Yet there are some even in Cuba who seem to believe that Vidali did it.Vittorio Vidali, Tina Modotti, el stalinismo y la revoluci√≥n at www.fundanin.orgBlatter, Jeremy and Istvan R√©v 2004 Unearthing The Spanish Earth, Open Society Archives, Budapest, Hungary \\"... Lastly, we have Vittorio Vidali. Vidali was most certainly a Comintern agent, \\"accidental death\\" specialist, and like most of the others found refuge in Moscow after the war, but in Vidali's case he is known to have joined the NKVD. We also may remember that Vidali was one of the two especially noted sources of advice to Joris IvensFranqui, Carlos (group translated, apparently from French editions de Seuil, 1976) 1980 Diary of the Cuban Revolution [Hard bound] A Seaver Book, Viking/Penguin Press, New York . Page 37 This author gives a version of the death of communist dissident 'Julio Antonio Mella' which by omission of the usual communist diatribe against Machado, clearly implicates the Communist International in this assassination. Adding to the mystery, according to Albers (2002), both Magri√±at and Diego Rivera, who had just returned from Cuba, had warned Mella that he was in danger. Funeral and symbolism Young Communist League (UJC) logo on a wall in Havana. It shows (from left to right) the stylized faces of Julio Mella, Camilo Cienfuegos and Che Guevara. On September 29, 1933 the troops of Fulgencio Batista, less than a month in power, broke up a procession to bury his ashes in Havana. Perhaps six people were shot under confused circumstances.History of Cuba: 1929 thru 1955 at www.historyofcuba.com There is a small park on Infanta Street, near the Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca chess club, that commemorates this event. Mella's bust (now replaced by a far larger obeliskP6060009.JPG at www.vanderbilt.edu) stood in a small park on San Lazaro Avenue slightly east and downhill of Havana University and is the object of much Marxist veneration. Before the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion, this bust was often blown down at night and could be heard in the silence after the explosion rumbling in a most frightening way as it rolled eastwards. Each time, by next morning it was rapidly restored to its pedestal. In Caimito, a small town in Artemisa Province, there is a camp called Campamento Internacional Julio Antonio Mella honoring him. The town of Mella, in Santiago de Cuba Province, was named after him.

An edited version was previously published in November 1935 in The American Magazine as The Pirate Saint. Some paperback editions append the article The to the title (The Saint Overboard). The book was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder & Stoughton in 1936 (followed by an American edition by The Crime Club). Plot summary Simon Templar, alias The Saint, is enjoying a pleasure cruise along the French coast aboard his yacht, the Corsair when he is awakened in the middle of the night by the sound of gunfire and shouting from another vessel (the Falkenberg) anchored nearby. The source of the commotion is a group of men pursuing a young woman who is swimming frantically away from the other ship. Templar rescues the woman who, after some considerable hesitation, identifies herself as Loretta Page, a private detective who is investigating the mysterious disappearance of sunken treasure from the Atlantic. When she learns her rescuer is The Saint, she enlists his help in tracking down a group of modern-day pirates. These pirates, led by Kurt Vogel, are using newly developed bathyscape technology to reach the sea floor and scour recent shipwrecks for gold and other booty before officially sanctioned salvage operations arrive. And Vogel is not against committing cold-blooded murder to keep his operation going. Hampered by Loretta's detective firm superior, who harbors a deep distrust of Templar, as well as Simon's growing love for Loretta, The Saint sets out to stop Vogel's operation. In the process he reunites with some of his colleagues from previous adventures Roger Conway and Peter Quentin. Orace, Templar's longtime manservant, makes his first major appearance since the very first Saint novel, Meet - The Tiger!. And it is Orace who complicates Templar's mission when he accidentally kills one of Vogel's men, which leads to Vogel forcing Templar (on pain of Loretta's possible death) to take the dead man's place on a salvage operation in the Channel Islands. =Notes= * Aside from the return of Peter Quentin, Roger Conway and Orace, this book also features the first reference to Templar's other partner, Hoppy Uniatz since The Saint Goes On (although Uniatz is not involved in the plot). This is also the first Saint book to suggest a serious relationship between Templar and a woman other than his longtime girlfriend Patricia Holm, who is not mentioned once in this book (she returns in subsequent volumes, however). In the previous novel The Saint in New York Templar expresses affection for Fay Edwards while She Was a Lady has Templar partnering with a female thief named Jill Trelawney, however in both cases Templar indicates that he is not \\"available\\" due to his relationship with Holm; no such reference is made in Saint Overboard. * Some editions contain an introduction by Charteris in which he discusses the diving technology used in the book. The 1963 reprint by Fiction Publishing Company includes a modified version of this introduction in which Charteris apologizes for the outdated technology. * This is one of the few Saint books to include a map showing the locations of the major events in the book. Film adaptation plans The film rights to Saint Overboard were purchased by RKO Studios for adaptation as part of its popular series of Saint movies during the 1940s. Ultimately, however, no such film was ever produced. Radio adaptation A one-hour radio play, starring Paul Rhys as the Saint and Patsy Kensit as Loretta Page, was broadcast in 1995.

(12 April 1914 ‚Äì 23 August 2013) was a British cinematographer, best known for his work on films such as Dr. Strangelove, A Hard Day's Night (both 1964), Repulsion (1965), The Omen (1976), and Star Wars (1977). In the course of his career, he collaborated with directors like Roman Polanski, Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, and Mike Hodges. He was nominated for two BAFTA Awards, and received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the British Society of Cinematographers. Early life The son of a Hertfordshire builder, Taylor grew up in Bushey Heath. A paternal uncle was a newsreel cameraman and contact with him from the age of ten gave Taylor early experience of working with cameras and developing film stock. As a teenager, he studied architecture before deciding to pursue a career in film. While his father disapproved of the film industry, populated he thought by \\"harridans, whores and gypsies\\", it was his mother who consented to their son's altered career plans. A neighbour offered Taylor, aged 15, a job as a camera assistant to William Shenton, a cinematographer working for Gainsborough Studios at their Islington base. In 1929, Taylor worked on the studio's final two silent films. Shenton took Taylor to Paris where he worked on two more silent films, before returning to Gainsborough.Ellis, p. 74 He then worked at Elstree for British International Pictures, where he was clapper loader on the Alfred Hitchcock film Number Seventeen (1932). Despite his junior status, formally a second camera assistant, Taylor was entrusted with some of the special effects work, including the use of mattes, to disguise the roofs of poorly-maintained buildings. During six years service in World War II as an officer in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, he became an operational cameraman flying in Avro Lancaster bombers, documenting the damage after British bombing raids. Taylor recalled: \\"This was requested by Winston Churchill, and my material was delivered to 10 Downing Street for him to view. He was keen for the public to see what our lads were doing. I did 10 of those operations, including raids on Cologne and Dresden\\".  Career  After demobilisation, he worked for Two Cities Films. In Fame Is the Spur (1947), he worked on a dream sequence using deep focus. The Boulting brothers were the co-producers of the film and they placed Taylor under contract. For the Boultings, Taylor, now promoted to full cinematographer, or director of photography, shot The Guinea Pig (US, The Outsider, 1948), Seven Days to Noon (1950) and High Treason (1951). The text is reprinted from From this point, Taylor began to use bounced and reflected light gaining a more naturalistic look, whereas the use of direct light was still the common practice by his contemporaries. Because it was necessary for London to look unpopulated in Seven Days to Noon, the first of three \\"end of the world films\\" Taylor worked on, it was necessary for him to arise at five- o-clock in the morning during a seven-week shoot. =Kubrick, Lester and Polanski= Taylor worked on a number of films commended for their black and white photography, such as Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove and Richard Lester's A Hard Day's Night (both 1964). Taylor, without Kubrick who was unwilling to fly in an aircraft, filmed material in the Arctic to be used as background plates in the flying sequences. He commented later: \\"Strangelove was at the time a unique experience because the lighting was to be incorporated in the sets, with little or no other light used\\". Concerning the war room set designed by Ken Adam: \\"Lighting that set was sheer magic, and I don‚Äôt quite know how I got away with it all\\". He continued: \\"Much of it was the same formula based on the overheads as fill and blasting in the key on faces from the side\\". Although Kubrick and Taylor had a rapport, he found the director to be autocratic. An easier project to work on was the Richard Lester film with The Beatles which was heavily improvised. With Lester, Chris Pizzello wrote in 2003, Taylor \\"adopted a roving, multiple-camera technique (aided by new, versatile 10:1 zoom lenses) so that the Beatles could move about freely and not worry about technicalities like hitting marks. This fast, fresh brand of filmmaking was a perfect fit for the film‚Äôs tiny budget, tight schedule and simple black-and-white aesthetic\\". Taylor and five other operators on the film used hand-held Arriflex cameras. \\"The key is not to hold the camera completely still\\", he once commented \\"but to let it 'breathe' with you, to move with it\\". His work on Dr Strangelove led Roman Polanski to seek Taylor for Repulsion (1965). In committing to the Polish director's first English-language film, Taylor rejected the opportunity to work on a Bond film (Thunderball) because he thought Polanski \\"was a very interesting guy\\". According to Polanski in his 1984 autobiography, Repulsions executive producer Michael Klinger \\"protested that Gil Taylor was one of the most expensive cameramen in the business, but I held out for Taylor and I got him\\". Taylor said his \\"aim was to get a stronger negative and good shadows in the final print. The shadows are what make good movies\\". Their collaboration continued with Cul-de-sac (1966) and Macbeth (1971), the third and last film he shot with Polanski. According to Ronald Bergan, \\"although shot in colour\\", Macbeth, \\"is as near to black and white as possible, with its grey, misty landscape\\". Taylor received BAFTA nominations over two consecutive years for the first two collaborations. =Later work in colour= Hitchcock requested Taylor work on his penultimate film Frenzy (1972). Despite a claim in Ronald Bergan's obituary of the cinematographer that Hitchcock was unaware the two men had worked together forty years earlier, according to Taylor they had stayed in touch. Hitchcock never looked through the camera, because of his use of storyboards, leaving decisions to Taylor. The tracking shot, up and down a flight of stairs and then into the street, which invisibly merged shots from a studio set and street location took a day to achieve with the switch disguised by the movement of an extra in front of the camera. Taylor's later films include The Omen (1976), and Star Wars (1977). On Star Wars, he established principles about visual aesthetics which have been maintained in the later films in the series. He told Mark Newbold in 2005: > \\"I wanted to give Star Wars a unique visual style that would distinguish it > from other films in the science fiction genre. I wanted Star Wars to have > clarity because I think space isn‚Äôt out of focus, also I was mindful that > there was an enormous amount of process work to be done in America with > Dykstra after we had finished shooting in England, and a crisp result would > help this process\\". Taylor found George Lucas an elusive person to consult, leading Taylor to make his own decisions as how to shoot the picture after multiple readings of the script.Ellis, p. 77‚Äì8 Differences of opinion between the director and cinematographer led to 20th Century Fox, for whom Taylor had shot The Omen, intervening to retain him on the picture. After the experience of working on Star Wars, Taylor decided he would never work again with Lucas. His last film credit was Don't Get Me Started released in 1994, but he continued to work on commercials for some time afterwards. Taylor was a founder member of the British Society of Cinematographers, receiving their lifetime achievement award in 2001. He received an international award from the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC) in 2006. Personal life Taylor met his wife, former script supervisor Dee (n√©e Vaughan), while both were working on comedian Tony Hancock's film, The Punch and Judy Man (1963), and married in 1967. The couple had a son and daughter. Taylor also had a son and daughter from an earlier marriage. He died on 23 August 2013, aged 99, at his home on the Isle of Wight.

History  Bus advertisement for Brooke Bond in Oslo, Norway 1955 Brooke Bond & Company was founded by Arthur Brooke, who was born at 6 George Street, Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, England, in 1845. In 1869 he opened his first tea shop at 23 Market Street, Manchester. Brooke chose the business name because it was his 'bond' to his customers to provide quality teas, hence Brooke Bond. The firm expanded into wholesale tea sales in the 1870s. In 1903, Brooke Bond launched Red Label in British India. The company opened a packing factory in Goulston Street, Stepney, London, in 1911.Stepney Borough Guide, 1960, p. 62 Brooke Bond's most famous brand is PG Tips, launched in 1930. By 1957, Brooke Bond was probably the largest tea company in the world, with one third share of both the British and Indian tea markets. The company merged with Liebig in 1968, becoming Brooke Bond Liebig, which was acquired by Unilever in 1984. The Brooke Bond name was significantly decreased by Unilever, however, the Brooke Bond tea brand was reintroduced on sale in 2019 in the UK after a 20 year absence. Gold Crown Foods Ltd was licensed by Unilever to use the Brooke Bond name for the Brooke Bond 'D' and Brooke Bond Choicest brands. Today, the licence for D Tea is held by Typhoo, who used to sell it through their website ‚Äì it had identical packaging to before minus the words 'Brooke Bond' - although it is not currently available. It was also regularly sold across Britain in Poundland stores. The Brooke Bond brand is still used in other countries, especially in India. In Pakistan, Brooke Bond Supreme is the number-one-selling tea brand. Unilever markets it as being stronger than its Lipton Yellow Label blend. In North America Brooke Bond's primary product was Red Rose Tea. Red Rose is still sold by Unilever in Canada, but in the United States is now marketed by Redco Foods. The Brooke Bond factory is at Trafford Park near Manchester. Brands and origins Brooke Bond Taj Mahal tea leaves are grown in estates of Upper Assam, Darjeeling and Tripura. It grows on the northern banks of the great Brahmaputra, which floods its banks every monsoon, creating a rich, humid soil. There is plentiful rain in the monsoon and humidity lasts through the year. The soil and weather together give Assam Tea its 'terroir' ‚Äì a dark red brew, a strong malty flavor and deep body. Brooke Bond Red Label, the Indian blend, is made in tea manufacturing units of Assam, Coochbehar, Darjeeling and some parts of Meghalaya. The manufacturing process of tea includes the stages of withering (leaving tea leaves to dry), rolling/cutting (through which complex series of chemical changes known as oxidation are initiated), drying and then grading into sizes. Brooke Bond Taaza is made of High Quality fresh Green Tea Leaves. Brooke Bond Supreme is imported to Pakistan, made from Kenyan tea leaves. Cards From 1954 until 1999, packets of Brooke Bond tea included illustrated cards, usually 50 in a series, which were collected by many children. One of the most famous illustrators of the cards was Charles Tunnicliffe, the internationally acclaimed bird painter. Most of the initial series were wildlife-based, including 'British Wild Animals', 'British Wild Flowers', 'African Wild Life', 'Asian Wild Life', and 'Tropical Birds'. From the late 1960s, they included historical subjects, such as 'British Costume', 'History of the Motor Car', and 'Famous Britons'. The last series in the 1990s concentrated on the Chimps of the TV adverts. Complete sets and albums in good condition are highly sought after collectors' items. The inclusion of these cards in packets of tea ceased in 1999. There were about 85 separate titles issued around the world: 59 series issued in the UK (1954‚Äì1999), 17 series in Canada (1959‚Äì1974; 7 of these were also issued in the US, 1960‚Äì66), 6 series in what was Rhodesia (1962‚Äì66), and 3 series in South Africa (1965‚Äì67). Many of them have since been reprinted.

There are two different subclasses that are both named Sa'ar 4.5. The first subclass was initially called Chochit (), but renamed to Aliya (). Two Aliya-subclass boats are in service with the Mexican Navy. The second subclass was initially called Nirit () but renamed to Hetz (). History The original construction plan for Sa'ar 4.5-class missile boats included: Two (2) helicopter-equipped boats (Aliya subclass) : * INS Aliya * INS Geula Three (3) ordinary missile boats (Hetz subclass): * INS Romach (launched and commissioned in 1981), * INS Keshet (launched and commissioned in 1982) and * INS Nirit The keel of INS Nirit was laid in 1984 but the construction ceased due to lack of funds and it was finally launched in 1990 and commissioned in 1991 with some modern equipment, eventuality renamed to INS Hetz. Consequently the older INS Romach and INS Keshet were upgraded to match INS Hetzs specifications. , , and INS Yaffo' commissioned in 1997, 1997, and 1998 respectively. Particularly INS Kidon and INS Yaffo were built comprising various older systems that were disassembled from Sa'ar 4-class boats with the same names, atop brand new Sa'ar 4.5-class hulls. INS Tarshish possibly also comprised some weapon systems dismounted from the Sa'ar 4-class missile boat with the same name, atop a new Sa'ar 4.5-class hull. Another two further- upgraded Sa'ar 4.5 Hetz-subclass missile boats called and were commissioned in 2002 and 2003, raising the number of Sa'ar 4.5 Hetz-subclass missile boats to eight. Beginning in the mid-2020s, the Israeli Navy is planing to begin replacing the Sa'ar 4.5 boats with the future Reshef-class ships. These long vessels will be based on Israel Shipyards' design. Subclasses =Aliya subclass= INS Aliya in 1985. INS Geula in 1982. The first two Sa'ar 4.5 boats were Aliya subclass. Two boats of this version were built and launched in 1980, the first one being , followed by . Additionally to the anti-ship missiles, these missile boats were equipped with aviation facilities that could accommodate two (one on a regular basis) Bell 206, MD 500, or HH-65 helicopters. Eurocopter Panther was the last helicopter deployed on these boats in the Israeli Navy. The Aliya subclass are the smallest warships with a helipad and helicopter hangar. In August 1984, INS Aliya and INS Geula were sent to destroy a terrorist facility in Nahr al-Bared, northern Lebanon. Two MD 500 Defenders from INS Aliya and another two from INS Geula successfully hit the target. In July 1985, INS Aliya and INS Geula carried out a similar mission near Nahr al-Bared. =Hetz subclass= INS Romach in front, in back in 2008 Sa'ar 4.5 Hetz-subclass missile boats lack the helicopter facilities of the Aliya subclass, but have more weapon systems fitted. They are largely based on the with improvements in electronic systems: command and control, detection, classification and identification, fire control system, radar (EL/M-2258 active electronically scanned array), sonar, electronic warfare and communications. The engines and propulsion systems were also upgraded. The boat itself is longer than the s to accommodate the new systems. Users =Israel= As of 2019, eight Hetz-subclass boats are in service with the Israeli Navy. =Mexico= In January 2004 both INS Aliya and INS Geula were sold to Mexico for service in the Mexican Navy.

He purchased four stores from Jack Goldin in the 1960s. Raymond Ackerman was chairman until he stepped down in 2010. Biography After graduating from the University of Cape Town with a Bachelor of Commerce, he joined the Greatermans group in the Ackermans division in 1951 at the age of 20 as a trainee manager. Ackermans had been founded just after World War I by his father Gus, but was sold to the Greatermans group in 1940. Ackerman was eventually offered a position at Greatermans head office in Johannesburg. In the early 1950s, food retailing supermarkets first began to appear on the scene in South Africa. Norman Herber, chairman of Greatermans decided to start a food retailer called Checkers. Ackerman was eventually put in charge of Checkers, making a resounding success of the business. Ackerman won the Outstanding Young South African award in 1965, along with Gary Player and by 1966, at the age of 35, he was the managing director of 85 Checkers stores; however, he was fired in the same year. In response, using his severance pay and a bank loan, Ackerman bought four stores in Cape Town trading under the name Pick 'n Pay. Under his leadership, Pick 'n Pay eventually grew into one of Africa's largest supermarket chains, with a thirty seven billion Rand turnover (2006 figure) and more than 124 supermarkets, 14 hypermarkets and 179 franchised outlets. The Pick 'n Pay Group employs more than 30,000 people in several African countries.  Family  Pick n Pay is a business giant run as a family business. His wife Wendy and his four children, Suzanne, Kathryn, Jonathan, and Gareth, all work for Pick 'n' Pay or for its charity. On 21 October 2009, Gareth took over his father's duties, and on 1 March 2010, the chairmanship as well.  Consumer rights and community engagement  Ackerman campaigned heavily for consumer rights. He lobbied Anton Rupert for cheaper cigarette prices and with the government over the price of bread. His biggest fight was with the authorities to deregulate gasoline prices, though this was unsuccessful. To keep prices low, the firm imports branded products. The Ackerman family's support for the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital dates to Gus's involvement in funding its establishment in 1956. In 2006, the Ackermans donated R4 million to the hospital. Pick 'n' Pay was very involved with Cape Town's bid to bring the 2004 Summer Olympics to South Africa. On 14 February 2005, the Raymond Ackerman Academy of Entrepreneurial Development opened in Cape Town to develop business skills and train future managers and leaders for South Africa. Awards He received an honorary doctorate in law from Rhodes University in 1986. His alma mater, the University of Cape Town, awarded him an honorary doctorate in commerce in 2001. He was voted 79th in the Top 100 Great South Africans in 2004. In November 2004, the Financial Times named him the only South African among the world's 100 greatest business leaders. In South Africa, he is often ranked with Harry Oppenheimer and Anton Rupert. Ackerman, together with his wife Wendy were awarded the 2010 David Rockefeller Bridging Leadership in Africa Award by The Synergos Institute Southern Africa office.

Medicalization can be driven by new evidence or hypotheses about conditions; by changing social attitudes or economic considerations; or by the development of new medications or treatments. Medicalization is studied from a sociologic perspective in terms of the role and power of professionals, patients, and corporations, and also for its implications for ordinary people whose self-identity and life decisions may depend on the prevailing concepts of health and illness. Once a condition is classified as medical, a medical model of disability tends to be used in place of a social model. Medicalization may also be termed \\"pathologization\\" or (pejoratively) \\"disease mongering\\". Since medicalization is the social process through which a condition becomes a medical disease in need of treatment, medicalization may be viewed as a benefit to human society. According to this view, the identification of a condition as a disease will lead to the treatment of certain symptoms and conditions, which will improve overall quality of life. Development of the concept The concept of medicalization was devised by sociologists to explain how medical knowledge is applied to behaviors which are not self-evidently medical or biological. The term medicalization entered the sociology literature in the 1970s in the works of Irving Zola, Peter Conrad and Thomas Szasz, among others. According to Dr. Cassell's book, The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine (2004), the expansion of medical social control is being justified as a means of explaining deviance. These sociologists viewed medicalization as a form of social control in which medical authority expanded into domains of everyday existence, and they rejected medicalization in the name of liberation. This critique was embodied in works such as Conrad's \\"The discovery of hyperkinesis: notes on medicalization of deviance\\", published in 1973 (hyperkinesis was the term then used to describe what we might now call ADHD). Nevertheless, opium was used to pacify children in ancient Egypt before 2000 BC. These sociologists did not believe medicalization to be a new phenomenon, arguing that medical authorities had always been concerned with social behavior and traditionally functioned as agents of social control (Foucault, 1965; Szasz,1970; Rosen). However, these authors took the view that increasingly sophisticated technology had extended the potential reach of medicalization as a form of social control, especially in terms of \\"psychotechnology\\" (Chorover,1973). In the 1975 book Limits to medicine: Medical nemesis (1975), Ivan Illich put forth one of the earliest uses of the term \\"medicalization\\". Illich, a philosopher, argued that the medical profession harms people through iatrogenesis, a process in which illness and social problems increase due to medical intervention. Illich saw iatrogenesis occurring on three levels: the clinical, involving serious side effects worse than the original condition; the social, whereby the general public is made docile and reliant on the medical profession to cope with life in their society; and the structural, whereby the idea of aging and dying as medical illnesses effectively \\"medicalized\\" human life and left individuals and societies less able to deal with these \\"natural\\" processes. The concept of medicalization dovetailed with some aspects of the 1970s feminist movement. Critics such as Ehrenreich and English (1978) argued that women's bodies were being medicalized by the predominantly male medical profession. Menstruation and pregnancy had come to be seen as medical problems requiring interventions such as hysterectomies. Marxists such as Vicente Navarro (1980) linked medicalization to an oppressive capitalist society. They argued that medicine disguised the underlying causes of disease, such as social inequality and poverty, and instead presented health as an individual issue. Others examined the power and prestige of the medical profession, including the use of terminology to mystify and of professional rules to exclude or subordinate others. Tiago Correia (2017) offers an alternative perspective on medicalization. He argues that medicalization needs to be detached from biomedicine to overcome much of the criticism it has faced, and to protect its value in contemporary sociological debates. Building on Gadamer's hermeneutical view of medicine, he focuses on medicine's common traits, regardless of empirical differences in both time and space. Medicalization and social control are viewed as distinct analytical dimensions that in practice may or may not overlap. Correia contends that the idea of \\"making things medical\\" needs to include all forms of medical knowledge in a global society, not simply those forms linked to the established (bio)medical professions. Looking at \\"knowledge\\", beyond the confines of professional boundaries, may help us understand the multiplicity of ways in which medicalization can exist in different times and societies, and allow contemporary societies to avoid such pitfalls as \\"demedicalization\\" (through a turn towards complementary and alternative medicine) on the one hand, or the over-rapid and unregulated adoption of biomedical medicine in non-western societies on the other. The challenge is to determine what medical knowledge is present, and how it is being used to medicalize behaviors and symptoms.  Professionals, patients, corporations and society  Several decades on the definition of medicalization is complicated, if for no other reason than because the term is so widely used. Many contemporary critics position pharmaceutical companies in the space once held by doctors as the supposed catalysts of medicalization. Titles such as \\"The making of a disease\\" or \\"Sex, drugs, and marketing\\" critique the pharmaceutical industry for shunting everyday problems into the domain of professional biomedicine. At the same time, others reject as implausible any suggestion that society rejects drugs or drug companies and highlight that the same drugs that are allegedly used to treat deviances from societal norms also help many people live their lives. Even scholars who critique the societal implications of brand-name drugs generally remain open to these drugs' curative effects ‚Äî a far cry from earlier calls for a revolution against the biomedical establishment. The emphasis in many quarters has come to be on \\"overmedicalization\\" rather than \\"medicalization\\" in itself. Others, however, argue that in practice the process of medicalization tends to strip subjects of their social context, so they come to be understood in terms of the prevailing biomedical ideology, resulting in a disregard for overarching social causes such as unequal distribution of power and resources. A series of publications by Mens Sana Monographs have focused on medicine as a corporate capitalist enterprise.Ajai R Singh, Shakuntala A Singh, 2005, \\"Medicine as a corporate enterprise, patient welfare centered profession, or patient welfare centered professional enterprise?\\" Mens Sana Monographs, 3(2), p19-51Ajai R Singh, Shakuntala A Singh, 2005, \\"The connection between academia and industry\\", Mens Sana Monographs, 3(1), p5-35Ajai R Singh, Shakuntala A Singh, 2005, \\"Public welfare agenda or corporate research agenda?\\", Mens Sana Monographs, 3(1), p41-80. Conversation between doctor and patient The physician's role in this present-day notion of medicalization is similarly complex. On the one hand, the doctor remains an authority figure who prescribes pharmaceuticals to patients. However, in some countries, such as the US, ubiquitous direct-to-consumer advertising encourages patients to ask for particular drugs by name, thereby creating a conversation between consumer and drug company that threatens to cut the doctor out of the loop. Additionally, there is a widespread concern regarding the extent of the pharmaceutical marketing direct to doctors and other healthcare professionals. Examples of this direct marketing are visits by salespeople, funding of journals, training courses or conferences, incentives for prescribing, and the routine provision of \\"information\\" written by the pharmaceutical company. The role of patients in this economy has also changed. Once regarded as passive victims of medicalization, patients can now occupy active positions as advocates, consumers, or even agents of change. The antithesis of medicalization is the process of paramedicalization, where human conditions come under the attention of alternative medicine, traditional medicine or any of numerous non-medical health approaches. Medicalization and paramedicalization can sometimes be contradictory and conflicting, but they also support and strengthen each other since they both ensure that questions of health and illness stay in sharp focus in defining human conditions and problems.  Areas  A 2002 editorial in the British Medical Journal warned of inappropriate medicalization leading to disease mongering, where the boundaries of the definition of illnesses are expanded to include personal problems as medical problems or risks of diseases are emphasized to broaden the market for medications. The authors noted: > Inappropriate medicalisation carries the dangers of unnecessary labelling, > poor treatment decisions, iatrogenic illness, and economic waste, as well as > the opportunity costs that result when resources are diverted away from > treating or preventing more serious disease. At a deeper level it may help > to feed unhealthy obsessions with health, obscure or mystify sociological or > political explanations for health problems, and focus undue attention on > pharmacological, individualised, or privatised solutions. For many years, marginalized psychiatrists (such as Peter Breggin, Paula Caplan, Thomas Szasz) and outside critics (such as Stuart A. Kirk) have \\"been accusing psychiatry of engaging in the systematic medicalization of normality\\". More recently these concerns have come from insiders who have worked for and promoted the American Psychiatric Association (e.g., Robert Spitzer, Allen Frances). Benjamin Rush, the father of American psychiatry, claimed that Black people had black skin because they were ill with hereditary leprosy. Consequently, he considered vitiligo as a \\"spontaneous cure\\". According to Franco Basaglia and his followers, whose approach pointed out the role of psychiatric institutions in the control and medicalization of deviant behaviors and social problems, psychiatry is used as the provider of scientific support for social control to the existing establishment, and the ensuing standards of deviance and normality brought about repressive views of discrete social groups. As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions code menaces to authority as mental diseases during political disturbances. The HIV/AIDS pandemic allegedly caused from the 1980s a \\"profound re-medicalization of sexuality\\". p.3Carole S. Vance \\"Anthropology Rediscovers Sexuality: A Theoretical Comment.\\" Social Science and Medicine 33 (8) 875-884 1991 The diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder has caused some controversy, and psychologist Peggy Kleinplatz has criticized the diagnosis as the medicalization of normal human behavior, that occurred while fluoxetine (also known as Prozac) was being repackaged as a PMDD therapy under the trade named Sarafem.Offman A, Kleinplatz PJ (2004). Does PMDD Belong in the DSM? Challenging the Medicalization of Women's Bodies. The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality, Vol. 13 Although it has received less attention, it is claimed that masculinity has also faced medicalization, being deemed damaging to health and requiring regulation or enhancement through drugs, technologies or therapy. According to Kittrie, a number of phenomena considered \\"deviant\\", such as alcoholism, drug addiction, prostitution, pedophilia, and masturbation (\\"self-abuse\\"), were originally considered as moral, then legal, and now medical problems. Innumerable other conditions such as obesity, smoking cigarettes, draft malingering, bachelorhood, divorce, unwanted pregnancy, kleptomania, and grief, have been declared a disease by medical and psychiatric authorities who hold impeccable institutional credentials. Due to these perceptions, peculiar deviants were subjected to moral, then legal, and now medical modes of social control. Similarly, Conrad and Schneider concluded their review of the medicalization of deviance by identifying three major paradigms that have reigned over deviance designations in different historical periods: deviance as sin; deviance as crime; and deviance as sickness. According to Mike Fitzpatrick, resistance to medicalization was a common theme of the gay liberation, anti-psychiatry, and feminist movements of the 1970s, but now there is actually no resistance to the advance of government intrusion in lifestyle if it is thought to be justified in terms of public health. Moreover, the pressure for medicalization also comes from society itself. Feminists, who once opposed state intervention as oppressive and patriarchal, now demand more coercive and intrusive measures to deal with child abuse and domestic violence. According to Thomas Szasz, \\"the therapeutic state swallows up everything human on the seemingly rational ground that nothing falls outside the province of health and medicine, just as the theological state had swallowed up everything human on the perfectly rational ground that nothing falls outside the province of God and religion\\".

There are a number of other Picasso museums. Picasso Museum, Paris, (Hotel Sal√©, 1659) Picasso Museum, Paris, main entrance Massacre in Korea, one of the most famous works of the collection The Mus√©e Picasso is an art gallery located in the H√¥tel Sal√© in rue de Thorigny, in the Marais district of Paris, France, dedicated to the work of the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso (1881‚Äì1973). The museum collection includes more than 5,000 works of art (paintings, sculptures, drawings, ceramics, prints, engravings and notebooks) and tens of thousands of archived pieces from Picasso‚Äôs personal repository, including the artist's photographic archive, personal papers, correspondence, and author manuscripts. A large portion of items were donated by Picasso‚Äôs family after his death, in accord with the wishes of the artist, who lived in France from 1905 to 1973.Mus√©e Picasso, The Collection Building The h√¥tel particulier that houses the collection was built between 1656 and 1659 for Pierre Aubert, seigneur de Fontenay, a tax farmer who became rich collecting the gabelle or salt tax (the name of the building means \\"salted\\"). The architect was Jean Boullier from Bourges, also known as Boullier de Bourges; sculpture was carried out by the brothers Gaspard and Balthazard Marsy and by Martin Desjardins. It is considered to be one of the finest historic houses in the Marais. The mansion has changed hands several times by sale or inheritance. The occupants have included the Embassy of the Republic of Venice (1671), then Fran√ßois de Neufville, duc de Villeroi; it was expropriated by the State during the French Revolution; in 1815 it became a school, in which Balzac studied; before housing the Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures in 1829. It also housed the municipal √âcole des M√©tiers d'Art. It was acquired by the City of Paris in 1964, and was granted historical monument status in 1968. Ancien h√¥tel Aubert de Fontenay ou Sal√©, actuellement mus√©e national Picasso The mansion was restored by Bernard Vitry and Bernard Fonquernie of the Monument historique in 1974‚Äì1980. The Hotel Sal√© was selected for the Mus√©e Picasso after some contentious civic and national debate. A competition was held to determine who would design the facilities. The proposal from Roland Simounet was selected in 1976 from amongst the four that were submitted. Other proposals were submitted by Roland Castro and the GAU (Groupement pour l'Architecture et l'Urbanisme), Jean Monge, and Carlo Scarpa. For the most part, the interior of the mansion (which had undergone significant modifications) was restored to its former spacious state. Collection =Formation of the collection= Pablo Picasso, 1918, Portrait d'Olga dans un fauteuil (Olga in an Armchair), oil on canvas, 130 √ó 88.8 cm In 1968, France created a law that permitted heirs to pay inheritance taxes with works of art instead of money, as long as the art is considered an important contribution to the French cultural heritage. This is known as a dation, and it is allowable only in exceptional circumstances. Dominique Bozo, a curator of national museums, selected those works that were to become the dation Picasso. This selection was reviewed by Jean Leymarie and ratified in 1979. It contained work by Picasso in all techniques and from all periods, and is especially rare in terms of its excellent collection of sculptures. Upon Jacqueline Picasso's death in 1986, her daughter offered to pay inheritance taxes by a new dation. The collection has also acquired a number of works through purchases and gifts. Stair hall (escalier d'honneur) of the H√¥tel Sal√© Picasso once said \\"I am the greatest collector of Picassos in the world.\\" He had amassed an enormous collection of his own work by the time of his death in 1973, ranging from sketchbooks to finished masterpieces.

This is complemented by Picasso's own personal art collection of works by other artists, including Renoir, C√©zanne, Degas, Rousseau, Seurat, de Chirico and Matisse. It also contains some Iberian bronzes and a good collection of African art, by which Picasso was greatly inspired. The museum also contains a large number of works that Picasso painted after his seventieth birthday.Selection of works from the Mus√©e Picasso =Presentation of the works= The museum has made an effort to present works by cartoonists who mocked or caricatured Picasso's work from the 1950s. There are a few rooms with thematic presentations, but the museum largely follows a chronological sequence, displaying painting, drawings, sculptures and prints. Other items include photographs, manuscripts, newspaper clippings and photographs to provide additional contextual information. The second floor has a special area set aside for temporary exhibitions and prints. The third floor contains the library, the documentation and archives department (reserved for research), and the curator's offices. Management =Funding= More than 5,000 works were donated by Picasso‚Äôs family after his death in 1973 under a law permitting heirs to contribute art in lieu of tax payments.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Pamir language family was sometimes referred to as the Ghalchah languages by western scholars.In his 1892 work on the Avestan language Abraham Valentine Williams Jackson, The later Iranian languages, New Persian, Kurdish, Afghan, Ossetish, Baluchi, Ghalach and some minor modern dialects.\\" The term Ghalchah is no longer used to refer to the Pamir languages or the native speakers of these languages. One of the most prolific researchers of the Pamir languages was Soviet linguist Ivan Ivanovich Zarubin.  Geographic distribution  Map of modern Iranian languages. The Pamir languages are spoken in the extreme east of the distribution, in the purple-shaded area. The Pamirian languages are spoken primarily in the Badakhshan Province of northeastern Afghanistan and the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region of eastern Tajikistan. Pamirian languages are also spoken in Xinjiang and the Pamir language Sarikoli is spoken beyond the Sarikol Range on the Afghanistan-China border and thus qualifies as the easternmost of the extant Iranian languages. Wakhi communities are also found in the adjacent Chitral District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in Gojal, Gilgit Baltistan in Pakistan. The only other living member of the Southeastern Iranian group is Pashto.  Classification  No features uniting the Pamir languages as a single subgroup of Iranian have been demonstrated.Antje Wendtland (2009), The position of the Pamir languages within East Iranian, Orientalia Suecana LVIII \\"The Pamir languages are a group of East Iranian languages which are linguistically quite diverse and cannot be traced back to a common ancestor. The term Pamir languages is based on their geographical position rather than on their genetic closeness. Exclusive features by which the Pamir languages can be distinguished from all other East Iranian languages cannot be found either.\\" The Ethnologue lists the Pamir languages along with Pashto as Southeastern Iranian,Southeastern Iranian Family Tree. SIL International. Ethnologue: Languages of the World. however, according to Encyclopedia Iranica, the Pamirian languages and Pashto belong to the North-Eastern Iranian branch.Nicholas Sims-Williams, Eastern Iranian languages, in Encyclopaedia Iranica, Online Edition, 2010. \\"The Modern Eastern Iranian languages are even more numerous and varied. Most of them are classified as North-Eastern: Ossetic; Yaghnobi (which derives from a dialect closely related to Sogdian); the Shughni group (Shughni, Roshani, Khufi, Bartangi, Roshorvi, Sarikoli), with which Yazghulyami (Sokolova 1967) and the now extinct Wanji (J. Payne in Schmitt, p. 420) are closely linked; Ishkashmi, Sanglichi, and Zebaki; Wakhi; Munji and Yidgha; and Pashto.\\" Members of the Pamirian language area include four reliable groups: a Shughni-Yazgulyam group including Shughni, Sarikoli, and Yazgulyam; Munji and Yidgha; Ishkashimi and related dialects; and Wakhi. They have the subject-object-verb syntactic typology.  Subgroups  =Shughni-Yazgulami branch= The Shughni, Sarikoli, and Yazgulyam languages belong to the Shughni-Yazgulami branch. There are about 75,000 speakers of languages in this family in Afghanistan and Tajikistan (including the dialects of Rushani, Bartangi, Oroshor, Khufi, and Shughni). In 1982, there were about 20,000 speakers of Sarikoli in the Sarikol Valley located in the Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County in Xinjiang Province, China. Shughni and Sarikoli are not mutually intelligible. In 1994, there were 4000 speakers of Yazgulyam along the Yazgulyam River in Tajikistan. Yazgulyam is not written. The Vanji language was spoken in the Vanj river valley the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region in Tajikistan, and was related to Yazgulyam. In the 19th century, the region was forcibly annexed to the Bukharan Emirate and a violent assimilation campaign was undertaken. By the end of the 19th century the Vanji language had disappeared, displaced by Tajik Persian. Most language speakers and others in Tajikistan refer to languages in this group as 'Pamirski\\" or 'Pamir'. (e.g. \\"I can speak Pamir, Ishkashem and Wakhi\\") =Munji-Yidgha branch= The Munji and Yidgha languages are closely related. There are about 6,000 speakers of Yidgha in Upper Lotkoh Valley, Chitral District, Pakistan, and in 1992 there were around 2,500 speakers of Munji in the Munjan and Mamalgha Valleys of Badakhshan Province, northeastern Afghanistan. Munji-Yidgha shares with Bactrian a development *√∞ > , absent from the other three Pamir groups =Sanglechi-Ishkashimi= There are about 2,500 speakers of Sanglechi and Ishkashmi in Afghanistan and Tajikistan (dialects: Sanglechi, Ishkashmi, Zebaki). They are not written languages. =Wakhi= There are around 58,000 speakers of the Wakhi language in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, China, Pakistan, and Russia.  Status  The vast majority of Pamir speakers in Tajikistan and Afghanistan also use Tajik (Persian) as a literary language, which is--unlike the languages of the Pamir group--a Southwestern Iranian tongue. The language group is endangered, with the total number of speakers roughly around 100,000 in 1990.

More specifically, in an open economy (an economy with foreign trade and capital flows), private saving plus governmental saving (the government budget surplus or the negative of the deficit) plus foreign investment domestically (capital inflows from abroad) must equal private physical investment. In other words, the flow variable investment must be financed by some combination of private domestic saving, government saving (surplus), and foreign saving (foreign capital inflows). This is an \\"identity\\", meaning it is true by definition. This identity only holds true because investment here is defined as including inventory accumulation, both deliberate and unintended. Thus, should consumers decide to save more and spend less, the fall in demand would lead to an increase in business inventories. The change in inventories brings saving and investment into balance without any intention by business to increase investment. Also, the identity holds true because saving is defined to include private saving and \\"public saving\\" (actually public saving is positive when there is budget surplus, that is, public debt reduction). As such, this does not imply that an increase in saving must lead directly to an increase in investment. Indeed, businesses may respond to increased inventories by decreasing both output and intended investment. Likewise, this reduction in output by business will reduce income, forcing an unintended reduction in saving. Even if the end result of this process is ultimately a lower level of investment, it will nonetheless remain true at any given point in time that the saving-investment identity holds.  Algebraic statement  Illustration of the saving identity with the three sectors, the computation of the surplus or deficit balances for each, and the flows between them.CBO-An Update to the Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028-Retrieved November 12, 2018 In a closed economy with government, we have :Y = C + I + G \\\\to I = Y - C - G meaning that whatever of aggregate output (Y) is neither consumed by the private (C) nor the government (G) must be what is invested (I). But it is also true that :Y = C + S + T \\\\to S = Y - T - C where T is the amount of taxes levied; this equation says that saving is disposable income (Y-T) minus consumption. Combining both expressions (by solving for Y - C on one side and equating) gives :I + G = S + T \\\\to I = \\\\underbrace{S}_{\\\\text{private saving}} + \\\\underbrace{(T - G)}_{\\\\text{public saving}} In an open economy, a similar expression can be found. The national income identity now is :Y = C + I + G + (X - M) where (X-M) is the balance of trade (exports minus imports). Private saving is still S = Y - T - C, so again combining (by solving for Y - C on one side and equating) gives :I + G + (X - M) = S + T \\\\to I = \\\\underbrace{S}_{\\\\text{private saving}} + \\\\underbrace{(T - G)}_{\\\\text{public saving}} + \\\\underbrace{(M - X)}_{\\\\text{capital inflow}} =Intended and unintended investment= In the above equations, I is total investment, both intended and unintended (with unintended investment being unintended accumulation of inventories). With this interpretation of I, the above equations are identities: they automatically hold by definition regardless of the values of any exogenous variables. If I is redefined as only intended investment, then all of the above equations are no longer identities but rather are statements of equilibrium in the goods market.  Views from classical macroeconomic theorists  = Adam Smith = Adam Smith notes this in The Wealth of Nations and it figures into the question of general equilibrium and the general glut controversy. In the general equilibrium model savings must equal investment for the economy to clear. The economy grows as division of labor increases productivity of laborers. This increased productivity in laborers creates a surplus that will be split between capitalists‚Äô expenditure on goods for themselves and investment in other capital. The accumulation of saving and parsimony of capitalists leads to greater increases in capital which leads to a more productive state. Smith advocates this parsimony of profit as a virtue. Smith provides the example of the colonial United States for the positive relationship between the wage fund and investment in capital. He says that England is a much more wealthy economy than anywhere in America; however, he believes that the true wealth lies within the market for wage funds and the growth rate of the population. The colonies have a much higher wage rate than England due to a lower cost of provisions and necessities to survive, which result in a higher competition for human capital among the ‚Äúmasters‚Äù of the economy, which in turn raises the wage rate and increases the wage fund. The core of this phenomenon is why Adam Smith believes in the saving-investment identity. The reason why wages go up and there is competition between employers is the result of a constant influx of capital that is equal to or greater than the rate at which the amount of labor increases. = David Ricardo = To understand why Ricardo‚Äôs view of the saving-investment identity differed from Smith‚Äôs, one must first examine Ricardo‚Äôs definition of rent. This rent adds no new value to society, but since land-owners are profit seeking, and since population is increasing in this time of growth, land that yields beyond the value of sustenance for workers is sought out and the return on those pieces of land suffers and lower rent. This is the basis for what Ricardo believed about the saving-investment identity. He agreed with Smith that parsimony and saving was a virtue, and that saving and investment were equal, but he introduced the notion that returns diminish as population decreases. The diminished rate of return results in something Ricardo calls the stationary state, which is when eventually a minimum profit rate is reached at which new investment (i.e., additional capital accumulation) ceases. As long as profits are positive, the capital stock is increasing, and the increased demand for labor will temporarily increase the average wage rate. But when wage rates rise above subsistence population increases. A larger population re-quires a greater food supply, so that, barring imports, cultivation must be extended to inferior lands (lower rent). As this occurs, rents increase and profits fall, until ultimately the stationary state is reached.

Life  = Childhood and education = M√ºren was born in the Hisar district of Bursa, at the wooden house number 30 on Ortapazar Road as the only child of Kaya and Hayriye M√ºren. His family were originally from Skopje. His father was a timber merchant. He was a small and impatient boy. At the age of 11 he was circumcised in Bursa.\\"Batmayan G√ºne≈ü Zeki M√ºren\\" documentary. Publisher: K√ºr≈üat √ñzk√∂k. TRT. Release date: 10‚Äì12 September 1996. M√ºren went to the Bursa Osmangazi School (later Tophane School and Alkƒ±ncƒ± School). When he was at school, his musical ability was discovered by his teachers and he started to have a prominent role at school musicals. His first ever role was the character of a shepherd in one of these musicals. He finished his secondary school in Bursa and then asked his father to let him go to Istanbul. There he attended the Istanbul Boƒüazi√ßi High School. He finished the school and ended up as the number-one student. After passing his exams, he was enrolled at the Istanbul State Academy of Fine Arts (now Mimar Sinan University). = Music career = On 19 November 1953, Zeki M√ºren gave his first concert at the Great Cinema in Atat√ºrk Boulevard In 1950, while he was a university student, he took part at TRT Istanbul Radio's music competition and ranked number-one out of 186 contestants. On 1 January 1951, he had his first live performance on Istanbul Radio, which was praised by critics. During this performance, he was accompanied by musicians Hakkƒ± Derman, Serif ƒ∞√ßli, ≈û√ºkr√º Tunar, Refik Fersan and Necdet Gezen. Hamiyet Y√ºceses subsequently called the program and congratulated him on his performance. In those years, TRT Ankara Radio was the most listened radio in Anatolia, and Istanbul Radio could not be heard clearly from all parts of Anatolia. At the same week, the clarinetist ≈û√ºkr√º Tunar, took M√ºren to his own recording studio in Ye≈üilk√∂y and he recorded his song \\"Muhabbet Ku≈üu\\" on phonograph record. Thanks to this record, M√ºren became known all over Anatolia. After the success of his first live performance and his first record, M√ºren began to perform different songs on Turkish radios. His radio programs went on air for 15 years, most of which included live performances. M√ºren subsequently focused on giving concerts and recording new songs. He had his first live concert on 26 May 1955. He would usually wear his self-designed clothes on stage. He brought various innovations such as dressing uniforms and using T podium. Together with Behiye Aksoy, he performed at Maksim Casino for 11 years. In 1976, he became the first Turkish artist to perform at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Throughout his career, M√ºren recorded 600 cassettes and phonograph records. His first song recorded on a phonograph was \\"Bir Muhabbet Ku≈üu\\" by ≈û√ºkr√º Tunar.

The reverse shows Nike standing, holding a wreath. Kharoshthi legend. Taxila mint. The Sakas, or Scythians, were nomadic Eastern Iranian people. Sanskrit texts including the Manusmriti (X,44), Ramayana and Mahabharata mention the Sakas. The Mahabharata (II.32.17) situated the Sakas along with the Pahlavas (Parthians) and Yona (Ionians) in the north-west. The Sakas from Sakastan defeated and killed the Parthian king Phraates II in 126 B.C. Indo-Scythians established themselves in the Indus around 88 B.C., during the end of Mithridates II of Parthias reign. The Sakas and Pahlavas became closely associated during the Saka migration. This can be demonstrated from various sources, such as the adoption of names and titles. Maues took the title of \\"Great King of Kings\\", an exceeded version of a traditional Persian royal title.  Maues Campaigns  Maues is the first recorded ruler of the Sakas in the Indus. He is first mentioned in the Moga inscription: : \\"In the seventy eighth, 78, year the Great King, the Great Moga, on the fifth, 5, day of the month Panemos, on this first, of the Kshaharata and Kshatrapa of Chukhsa - Liaka Kusuluka by name - his son Patika - in the town of Takshasila...\\" Moga inscription Mauses is possibly mentioned the Maira inscription in the Salt Range in Pakistan as 'Moasa'. Maues vastly expanded his domain by conquering key cities along the Indus. This included seizing Taxila in Punjab, and Gandharas capital city Pushkalavati from the Indo-Greek Kingdoms. Maues has overstruck coins belonging to Archebius as well as Apollodotus II in Taxila. The Sakas extend their power up to Mathura during his reign. = Route of the Invasions = When precisely and under what circumstances Maues arrived in India is uncertain, but the expulsion of the Scythian (Saka/Sai) peoples from Central Asia is referred to in the Han Shu, where the cause given is their confrontation with the Ta Y√ºeh-chih, themselves undergoing an enforced migration. It is stated that ‚Äúwhen the Ta Y√ºeh-chih turned west, defeated and expelled the king of the Sai, the latter moved south and crossed over the Suspended Crossing.‚Äù That this route (from the Pamirs into the Gilgit valley) was used in Maues‚Äô time is confirmed by the discovery of inscriptions in the Chilas/Gilgit area bearing his name (Dani, 1983 and 1995, pp. 52, 55).

Machene may have been a daughter of one of the Indo-Greek houses.RC Senior \\"Indo-Scythian coins and history\\", Vol IV, p.xxxvi. An Indo- Greek king, Artemidoros, also issued coins where he describes himself as \\"Son of Maues\\". = Buddhist Coins = A few of the coins of Maues, struck according to the Indian square standard, seemingly depict a King in a cross- legged seated position. This may represent Maues himself, or possibly one of his divinities. It has been suggested that this might also be one of the first representations of the Buddha on a coin, in an area where Buddhism was flourishing at the time, but the seated personage seems to hold a sword horizontally, which favors the hypotheses of the depiction of the king Maues himself. Also, Maues struck some coins incorporating Buddhist symbolism, such as the lion, symbol of Buddhism since the time of the Mauryan king Ashoka. The symbolism of the lion had also been adopted by the Buddhist Indo-Greek king Menander II. Maues therefore probably supported Buddhism, although whether sincerely or for political motives is unclear. His coins also included a variety of other religious symbols such as the bull of Shiva, indicating wide religious tolerance.

The screenplay by Ronald Harwood is based on the novel Theatre (1937) by W. Somerset Maugham. The original film score was composed by Mychael Danna. Plot Set in London in 1938, the film focuses on highly successful and extremely popular theatre actress Julia Lambert (Annette Bening), whose gradual disillusionment with her career as she approaches middle age has prompted her to ask her husband, stage director Michael Gosselyn (Jeremy Irons), and his financial backer Dolly de Vries (Miriam Margolyes) to close her current production to allow her time to travel abroad. They persuade her to remain with the play throughout the summer; and Michael introduces her to Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), an enterprising American, who confesses his deep appreciation of her work. Seeking the passion missing from her marriage, and anxious to fill the void left when her close friend Lord Charles (Bruce Greenwood) suggested they part ways to avoid scandalous gossip, Julia embarks on a passionate affair with the young man and begins to support him so he may enjoy the glamorous lifestyle to which she has introduced him. Their relationship revives her, sparking a distinct change in her personality. Always hovering in the background and offering counsel is the spirit of her mentor, Jimmie Langton (Michael Gambon), the theatrical manager who gave Julia her start and made her a star, while flesh-and-blood Evie (Juliet Stevenson) serves as her personal maid, dresser, and confidante. Michael suggests they invite Tom to spend time at their country estate, where he can become better acquainted with their son Roger (Tom Sturridge). At a party there, Tom meets aspiring actress Avice Crichton (Lucy Punch), and, when Julia sees him flirting with the pretty young woman, she becomes jealous and anxious and angrily confronts him. He slowly reveals himself to be a callous, social- climbing, gold-digging gigolo, and Julia is shattered when their affair comes to an end. Avice, now romantically involved with Tom, asks him to bring Julia to see her perform in a play in the hope the actress will induce her husband to cast her in a supporting role in Julia's upcoming project. The play is dreadful, and Avice is not much better. Backstage, Julia compliments her even- worse co-star and barely acknowledges Avice, although she promises to tell Michael about her. Afterwards, she forces Tom to admit he loves Avice, then - although her heart is broken by his admission - she assures him she will insist the ingenue be cast in her next play. When Julia's performance in her current play begins to suffer from her personal discontent, Michael closes the production; and Julia visits her mother (Rosemary Harris) and her Aunt Carrie (Rita Tushingham) in Jersey, where Lord Charles comes to visit her. Julia suggests a romantic tryst, and he gently tells her that he's gay. Meanwhile, back in London, Avice auditions for Michael; and, although Julia resents it, she is given the role. Julia returns home to begin rehearsals for the new play. Shortly after, she learns from her son that Avice has been one of Michael's casual trysts. Still, she is uncharacteristically solicitous toward the girl, making suggestions that place her in the spotlight and insisting her own wardrobe be drab to allow Avice to shine. What her director and fellow cast members don't realize is there's a method to her seeming madness - Julia has planned her sweet revenge for the opening night performance, during which she successfully affirms her position as London theatre's foremost diva by upstaging every aspect of Avice‚Äôs performance. Production notes Filming began in June 2003. Exteriors were shot on location in London and Jersey. Interiors were filmed in Budapest, including inside the Danubius Hotel Astoria, and Kecskem√©t in Hungary. The soundtrack features a number of popular songs of the era, including \\"They Didn't Believe Me\\" by Jerome Kern and Herbert Reynolds; \\"Life is Just a Bowl of Cherries\\" by Lew Brown and Ray Henderson; \\"Mad About the Boy\\" by No√´l Coward; \\"I Get a Kick Out of You\\" by Cole Porter; \\"She's My Lovely\\" by Vivian Ellis; \\"Bei Mir Bist Du Schon\\" by Sholom Secunda, Jacob Jacobs, Sammy Cahn, and Saul Chaplin; and \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" by Otto A. Harbach and Jerome Kern. The film premiered at the Telluride Film Festival and was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival, the San Sebasti√°n Film Festival, the Vancouver International Film Festival, the Calgary Film Festival, and the Chicago International Film Festival before opening in the US in limited release. The film grossed $14,339,171 at the box office.Being Julia at BoxOfficeMojo.com Cast Critical reception Being Julia has received fairly positive reviews, with Bening receiving acclaim for her performance, and an average score of 65/100 at the review aggregator Metacritic. In his review in The New York Times, A.O. Scott called the film \\"a flimsy frame surrounding a brightly colored performance by Annette Bening, whose quick, high-spirited charm is on marvelous display . . . She gives Being Julia a giddy, reckless effervescence that neither Mr. Szabo's stolid direction nor Ronald Harwood's lurching script . . . are quite able to match . . . Ms. Bening walks right up to the edge of melodramatic bathos (the hallmark of the kind of plays in which Julia stars) and then, in a wonderful climactic coup de th√©√¢tre, turns it all into farce. Being Julia may not make much psychological or dramatic sense, but Ms. Bening, pretending to be Julia (who is always pretending to be herself), is sensational.\\"The New York Times review Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said, \\"Annette Bening plays Julia in a performance that has great verve and energy, and just as well, because the basic material is wheezy melodrama. All About Eve breathed new life into it all those years ago, but now it's gasping again . . . I liked the movie in its own way, while it was cheerfully chugging along, but the ending let me down; the materials are past their sell-by date and were when Maugham first retailed them. The pleasures are in the actual presence of the actors, Bening most of all, and the droll Irons, and Juliet Stevenson as the practical aide-de-camp, and Thomas Sturridge, so good as Julia's son that I wonder why he wasn't given the role of her young lover.\\"Chicago Sun-Times review In the San Francisco Chronicle, Carla Meyer described the film as \\"a one-woman show\\" and added, \\"There are several notable actors in it, most of them quite good, but it's the glorious Annette Bening who hoists this flawed production on her mink-wrapped shoulders and makes it work . . . Her stage background at American Conservatory Theater shows in her multilayered tour de force.\\"San Francisco Chronicle review Todd McCarthy of Variety observed, \\"Annette Bening has fun running the vast gamut of her emotions, be they authentic or manufactured. But Istvan Szabo's new film, like the W. Somerset Maugham novel upon which it's based, is a minor affair, a confection based on dalliances and the way a set of sophisticated theater people handle them, that lacks true distinction . . . Working in a much lighter vein than usual, Szabo has said he studied the films of Ernst Lubitsch and Billy Wilder in preparation for this picture. Unfortunately, Being Julia has little to do with the specifically Viennese strain of wise and winkingly cynical romantic comedy perfected by those two masters of the sexual charade and nearly everything to do with the world of pre-war London theater. This is a film that, above all else, needed to be steeped in Britishness, in the very particular mores and manners of the time; as a Canadian production mostly shot in Budapest by a Hungarian director and an American star and a number of Canuck thesps, this just doesn't happen. The deficiencies may be intangible, but they deprive film of the solid footing it requires . . . The majority of the seriocomic doings, while superficially diverting, provide neither indelible wit nor the gravitas of a genuinely meaningful comedy of manners (see Oscar Wilde), leaving a relatively wispy impression in its wake.\\"Variety review In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers awarded the film two out of a possible four stars and commented, \\"Annette Bening can act - watch American Beauty or Bugsy or The Grifters - but she works too hard to prove it in Being Julia . . . Director Istvan Szabo overplays his hand and traps [her] in a role that's all emoting, no emotion.\\"Rolling Stone review Mark Kermode of The Observer said, \\"Annette Bening makes a claim for an Oscar nomination . . . Chewing up the scenery in lipsmacking form, she savours the ribald dialogue like an overripe wine, spitting venom and self-pity in equally bilious measures, lending much needed weight to this contrived fluff.\\"The Observer review Awards and nominations * Academy Award for Best Actress (Annette Bening, nominee) * Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture Comedy or Musical (Bening, winner) * Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role - Motion Picture (Bening, nominee) * Satellite Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Bening, winner) * Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Jeremy Irons, nominee) * Genie Award for Best Motion Picture (nominee) * Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role (Bruce Greenwood, nominee) * National Board of Review Award for Best Actress (Bening, winner) * London Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress (Bening, nominee) * Bangkok International Film Festival Golden Kinnaree Award for Best Actress (Bening, winner; tied with Ana Geislerova for ≈Ωelary) * Bangkok International Film Festival Golden Kinnaree Award for Best Film (nominee) * European Film Award for Best Director (nominee) * European Film Award for Best Cinematography (nominee) * Southeastern Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress (Bening, winner) References External links  * 2004 films American films Canadian films English-language films 2004 romantic comedy-drama films American romantic comedy-drama films Canadian romantic comedy-drama films Films about actors Films based on British novels Films directed by Istv√°n Szab√≥ Films featuring a Best Musical or Comedy Actress Golden Globe winning performance Sony Pictures Classics films Films set in 1938 Films set in London Films set in the Channel Islands Films shot in London Films shot in Hungary Films scored by Mychael Danna Films with screenplays by Ronald Harwood 2004 comedy films 2004 drama films ","title":"Being Julia"},{"id":"1371114","text":"A hardware black screen of death that occurs when the system hard drive is unable to load the master boot record. The screen is blank apart from a flashing white cursor. The black screen of death is an error screen displayed by some operating systems after encountering a critical system error which can cause the system to shut down. Windows 3.x An example of an EMM386 Error Message in Windows 3.0 that results in a black screen during Standard Mode. In Windows 3.x the black screen of death is the behavior that occurred when a DOS-based application failed to execute properly. It was often known to occur in connection with attempting certain operations while networking drivers were resident in memory. (Commonly, but not exclusively, it was seen while the Novell NetWare client for DOS, NETX, was loaded.). The issue was fixed in most instances by adding an additional section in the SYSTEM.INI of affected clients with the text TimerCriticalSection = 10000. The following files were also updated, vtdapi.386, vnetware.386 and vipx.386 According to Wallace McClure of ASP.net, the phrase was originally coined in mid-1991 by Ed Brown, a technician with The Coca-Cola Company's IT department in Atlanta, GA. He reports that the company was rolling out Windows 3.0 within the Global Marketing group and when the users would attempt to run WordPerfect, they would receive a black screen.  Later versions of Windows  MS-DOS, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8 also display a Black Screen of Death when the operating system cannot boot. This is usually due to a missing file. This also happens when the user enables file compression on all files and the operating system compresses. Often the user must reinstall Windows, if the missing file is critical to the boot process. However, more often than not the boot screen will inform the user of the missing file. If the operating system is compressed, it will not be able to boot, even into safe mode. However, booting from another device and uncompressing the files will usually solve the issue. In late 2009, several new reports of the Black Screen of Death in Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 emerged. At first several claims pointed at a Windows Update. It was later recanted by Prevx as an erroneous report. Microsoft reported that no security update was causing the issue, and it may be tied to malware. In other cases, the black screen was replaced with the Blue Screen of Death. The Black Screen of Death may also be caused by certain components of a computer overheating. Early builds of Windows 8 featured a black screen of death, in place of the traditional blue screen, that appeared to indicate a Stop error. This black screen was simplified compared to the previous blue screen, omitting instructions that the user is recommended to take.

The game follows Kate Walker, an American lawyer tasked with overseeing the major sale of a company and her subsequent journey across Europe and Russia to find the brother of the recently deceased owner. Alongside the main plot, the story also consists of a subplot involving Kate's personal life. Syberia was a commercial success, with sales above 500,000 units worldwide by 2005. It was acclaimed by critics for its intelligent script and use of graphic design that encompassed elements of art nouveau and clockpunk fiction. Its success led to it being followed by two major sequels - Syberia II, released on 30 March 2004, and Syberia 3, released on 20 April 2017. On 19 August 2019, it was announced that a fourth game had already been in production for 18 months and was to be titled Syberia: The World Before.https://www.microids.com/syberia- the-world-before-kate-walker-returns-for-a-new-adventure/  Gameplay  Kate and Oscar on the train Syberia is a third-person, mouse-driven, semi- realistic/semi-surrealistic adventure game in which the player must solve various puzzles and follow certain procedures in order for the story line to proceed. As a purely graphical adventure game, Syberia follows the guidelines introduced by Broken Sword.  Plot  The game begins when American lawyer Kate Walker is sent by her law firm to the fictional French village of Valadil√®ne to oversee the corporate takeover of a family-owned spring- automaton toy factory. When Kate arrives, she finds that the recently deceased owner, Anna Vorarlberg, had informed the village notary before her death that her brother Hans is alive, despite her father claiming he was dead and buried. Realising that Hans is now the owner of the factory, Kate learns she must get his approval in order to allow the takeover to proceed. Investigating the Vorarlberg estate, she learns that Hans not only exists, but was also injured in a cave outside the village during his youth, while attempting to retrieve a prehistoric doll of a man riding a mammoth. The resulting accident stunted his development, leaving him mentally handicapped and causing him to develop an obsession to finds mammoths to ride as the doll depicts. Despite proving extremely creative with making automatons, his father disapproved of his obsession, and disowned him as a direct result. Learning that Hans lies somewhere further east across the continent, Kate discovers that the only way to reach him is via a specially designed clockwork locomotive, built by Anna at her brother's request, and manning it with special animatronic man named Oscar. Before leaving, Kate is tasked with retrieving items important to Hans, that Oscar requires before he can allow them to depart - the mammoth doll and two clockwork music boxes. Acquiring all of them, the pair eventually begin their journey eastwards, stopping at Barrockstadt, a failing university. While Kate seeks a means for them to continue, she explores the establishment and soon learns more about Han's interests in a mysterious tribe of people known as the Youkol, who lived with and domesticated mammoths that reside on the titular island of Syberia (inspired by the real-life location of Wrangel Island in Siberia, the last place on earth where mammoths survived). Upon moving on, Kate's journey brings her to Komkolzgrad, a dusty Communist-era industrial mining complex run by the eccentric and somewhat crazy Serguei Borodine. Finding that he stole Oscar's hands for his automaton organist work, she agrees to help him bring Helena Romanski, a washed-up opera singer who he is obsessed with, back to the complex to sing for him in order to get back the hands. Helping out a drunk test pilot named Boris to fix one of Hans inventions - a clockwork flying machine - Kate gains his assistance in operating an airship that takes her to the Aralbad spa, only to discover that Helena has become disillusioned in believing she is too old to sing, prompting Kate to help her recover. Returning to the mining complex with Kate, Helena performs for Borodine, only to be imprisoned by him in his desire to keep her at his side as his personal opera singer. Refusing to allow this to happen, Kate rescues Helena, recovers Oscar's hands, and attempts to leave with both via the train. Although Borodine attempts to stop them, Kate makes use of some dynamite to thwart his efforts, killing him in the process, and allowing the train to continue onwards, reaching Aralbad. Upon arriving, Kate finds Hans waiting at the spa, delighted that she has brought him the train and Oscar. Showing little concern for his sister's death, Hans signs the factory release papers without reading them. Before Kate boards a plane that will bring her back to New York, she quickly changes her mind and rushes to rejoin Hans on the train, offering to help him realise his dream, abandoning her job and her unfaithful fianc√© back home.  Development  The game was produced entirely in Montreal by 35 people under the direction of Beno√Æt Sokal on a budget of ‚Ç¨2 million using Virtools Development Environment 2.1. Its budget was the highest of any Micro√Øds game by that time.https://web.archive.org/web/20030801202054/http://www.justadventure.com/Press_Releases/June18_02Syberia.shtm Beno√Æt Sokal indicated in an interview that at one time the development team were considering to create one single game for the Syberia story, but decided not to, as it was so large. Sokal's earlier game, Amerzone, is located in the same fictional universe and Syberia contains some references to it. Paradise, another one of Sokal's adventure games, has no connections to Syberia. It does, however, use a similar interface and art direction.  Reception  =Sales= Syberia was a commercial success. According to Cedric Orvoine of Micro√Øds, the game surpassed 225,000 units in sales by February 2003, and had achieved nearly 350,000 global sales across its console and computer versions by September. In France, the Agence fran√ßaise pour le jeu vid√©o reported that Syberias computer release had sold 50,000 units by September 2003, before the launch of its console versions. Micro√Øds announced plans that month to ship 50,000 and 20,000 units, respectively, of the PlayStation and Xbox versions in France. In North America, its computer version sold 60,158 retail copies during 2003 alone, and Orvoine noted in early 2004 that its Xbox version was \\"selling way over our initial expectations\\" in the region. Michel Bams of Beno√Æt Sokal's White Birds Productions said that Syberia had reached \\"nearly 500,000 copies\\" in global sales that February, a number it surpassed by late 2005, according to Ubisoft.

It likewise won IGN's \\"Reader's Choice Award for Adventure Games\\" (2002). Computer Games Magazine declared it the tenth-best computer game of 2002, and presented it with an award for outstanding art direction. Similarly, the game won GameSpot's \\"Best Graphics (Artistic) on PC\\" prize. Syberia was also nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' \\"Story or Character Development\\" and \\"PC Action/Adventure Game\\" awards; the Game Developers Choice Awards' \\"Excellence in Visual Arts\\" prize; and GameSpot's \\"Best Story on PC\\" and \\"Best Game No One Played on PC\\" awards. While awarding the game, the editors of Computer Gaming World called Syberia \\"the most emotionally rich adventure game since the great Sanitarium and a worthy reminder of how rewarding this struggling genre can be when put in the right hands.\\" PC Gamers Chuck Osborne praised its visuals and \\"epic story\\"; he concluded, \\"As Kate Walker, not only are you searching for the missing heir to an automaton factory in France, but you're also embarking on a feminist journey of self-discovery.\\" In 2011, Adventure Gamers named Syberia the 15th- best adventure game ever released. Legacy = Sequels = Syberia was followed by a sequel, Syberia II, which continued Kate Walker's voyage to Syberia. In 2008, the Syberia series website was relaunched. In 2012, Micro√Øds revealed that Benoit Sokal had officially signed a contract with Anuman to write the story of Syberia 3 and that official development had started. Additionally the project was overseen by Elliot Grassiano, the original founder of Micro√Øds. Syberia 3 was released in April 2017. A 4th installment has been confirmed. The title of the game will be Syberia: The World Before and it will arrive in 2021. A demo of the prologue is already available to download through steam. It is confirmed that Kate Walker returns for this adventure. =Ports= In 2006, MC2 France announced that a version of Syberia adapted by Tetraedge Games was released for smartphones using Symbian and Windows Mobile. In 2008, Micro√Øds announced that with Mindscape they would be releasing the mobile version of Syberia for the Nintendo DS in October 2008. On 30 October 2008 they announced that DreamCatcher Games would be publishing the Nintendo DS version of Syberia in North America, for release in December 2008. An iOS version of the game was released in December 2014. The Nintendo DS port took heavy criticism, receiving a 3.5/10 from GameSpot: most of the voice acting was stripped out and the graphics were simply shrunk down from the PC version which rendered many small plot-necessary objects almost impossible to locate.

Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972), was a United States Supreme Court case involving the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, specifically the right of defendants in criminal cases to a speedy trial. The Court held that determinations of whether or not the right to a speedy trial has been violated must be made on a case-by-case basis, and set forth four factors to be considered in the determination.. Facts and trial On July 20, 1958, an elderly couple in Christian County, Kentucky were murdered in their home by intruders, later identified as Willie Barker and Silas Manning. Believing that the case against Manning was the stronger of the two, and that Manning's testimony was needed to convict Barker (in his own case, Manning exercised his right under the Fifth Amendment to not incriminate himself), the prosecution chose to try Manning first, hoping that once convicted, Manning would later voluntarily testify against Barker. At the outset of Manning's trial on October 23, 1958, the prosecution sought and obtained the first of what would be 16 continuances in Barker's trial. The prosecution, however, encountered numerous difficulties in getting a conviction against Manning;It would take a total of six trials before Manning was convicted of both murders. The first and fourth trials ended in a hung jury. The second trial resulted in a conviction but was overturned on grounds of illegally obtained evidence. The third trial also resulted in a conviction but was overturned on grounds of failure to allow a change of venue. The fifth and sixth trials resulted in murder convictions which Manning chose not to appeal. it would not be until December 1962 that Manning would be convicted in the second of the two murders. As the Christian County Circuit Court only held three terms each year (in February, June, and September), for each term the prosecution would seek a continuance in the Barker case, until the beginning of the following term, while the Manning cases were ongoing.Continuances were granted in the Barker case in October 1958 (#1), February 1959 (#2, in an exception to the pattern this continuance was granted for one month only), March 1959 (#3), June 1959 (#4), September 1959 (#5), February 1960 (#6), June 1960 (#7), September 1960 (#8), February 1961 (#9), June 1961 (#10), September 1961 (#11), February 1962 (#12), June 1962 (#13), September 1962 (#14), March 1963 (at the beginning of the Court's term in February 1963, the prosecution moved to set the trial date for March 19 of that year, but when that date arrived the prosecution requested and was granted Continuance #15), and June 1963 (#16). Barker, through his counsel, did not object to any of the first eleven continuances. But on the 12th continuance (February 1962) Barker's counsel filed a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds, which was rejected. Barker's counsel did not object to the 13th or 14th continuances, but objected to the 15th continuance (March 1963 on the date of Barker's trial; the prosecution sought a continuance due to illness of the former sheriff, the chief investigating officer in the case) as well as the 16th continuance (June 1963, requested for the sheriff's continued illness; while granting the continuance the Circuit Court ruled that the matter had to come to trial at the next term or would be dismissed for lack of prosecution). The final trial date was set for October 9, 1963 and on that date, after Barker's counsel made another unsuccessful motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds, the trial was finally commenced; with Manning the chief prosecution witness, Barker was convicted and given a life sentence. Appeals Barker appealed his conviction on speedy trial grounds to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which affirmed it in 1964. In 1970 Barker filed a habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. Though the District Court denied the petition, it granted Barker the right to proceed in forma pauperis and a certificate of probable cause to appeal. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision in 1971. The Sixth Circuit argued that Barker had waived any speedy trial claims up through February 1963 (which the Sixth Circuit erroneously believed was the first date that Barker's counsel objected to a further continuance)Counsel for the Commonwealth of Kentucky conceded at oral argument before the Supreme Court that Barker's counsel first objected in February 1962, not February 1963. and that the eight-month period between February and October 1963 (the period between the objection and the actual trial) was not unduly long. Further, the Sixth Circuit ruled that granting a continuance based on the sheriff's illness was a justifiable reason for a delay. The United States Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari in 1972. The Supreme Court decision =Opinion of the court= The Supreme Court first noted that \\"[t]he right to a speedy trial is generically different from any of the other rights enshrined in the Constitution for the protection of the accused\\" for three reasons: *First, the Court noted that \\"there is a societal interest in providing a speedy trial which exists separate from, and at times in opposition to, the interests of the accused\\". The Court commented on the backlog of cases, mainly in urban courts, that often enable defendants to negotiate a plea for a lesser offense. The Court also noted that persons released on bond had the opportunity to commit further crimes,The Court specifically commented that \\"[i]t must be of little comfort to the residents of Christian County, Kentucky, to know that Barker was at large on bail for over four years while accused of a vicious and brutal murder of which he was ultimately convicted.\\" \\"the longer an accused is free awaiting trial, the more tempting becomes his opportunity to jump bail and escape\\", and that \\"delay between arrest and punishment may have a detrimental effect on rehabilitation.\\" The Court also noted that if the accused cannot make bail, that too can make rehabilitation difficult, that a lengthy pre-trial detention can be costly, and that \\"society loses wages which might have been earned, and it must often support families of incarcerated breadwinners.\\"Barker, 407 U.S. at 520-21. *Second, the Court noted that \\"deprivation of the right may work to the accused's advantage.\\" As the time between arrest and trial lengthens, witnesses may become unavailable and/or their memories fade; if the witnesses were for the prosecution the case may be seriously weakened (as the prosecution has the burden to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt).Barker, 407 U.S. at 521. *Finally, the Court noted that the concept is more vague than with other rights, in that the Court \\"cannot definitely say how long is too long in a system where justice is supposed to be swift but deliberate.\\" The Court then noted that there were two competing approaches as to how to handle the uncertainty regarding \\"how long is too long\\"; neither of which it accepted: *One approach (supported by the American Bar Association) was to \\"hold that the Constitution requires a criminal defendant to be offered a trial within a specified time period.\\" The Court rejected this approach, stating that there was \\"no constitutional basis for holding that the speedy trial right can be quantified into a specified number of days or months.\\"Barker, 407 U.S. at 523. *The other approach was to \\"restrict consideration of the right to those cases in which the accused has demanded a speedy trial.\\" In other words, if the defendant did not specifically demand a trial, the defendant waived his/her right to appeal the matter. The Court also rejected this approach, as it considered a speedy trial to be a fundamental right, and quoting Carnley v. Cochran the Court ruled that \\"[p]resuming waiver from a silent record is impermissible. The record must show, or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandably rejected the offer. Anything less is not waiver.\\"Barker, 407 U.S. at 526. As a balancing test, the Court adopted four factors to be considered in determining, on a case-by-case basis, whether a defendant has been prejudiced by the lack of a speedy trial:Barker, 407 U.S. at 530. #the length of delay, #the reason for the delay, #the time and manner in which the defendant has asserted his right, and #the degree of prejudice to the defendant which the delay has caused. Taking these factors into consideration, though, Barker's conviction was upheld. The court agreed that the period of time between initial arrest and trial - over five years - was \\"extraordinary\\" and that only seven months of the delay was justifiable (the period of the ex-sheriff's illness).The Court also stated that some delay to secure Manning's testimony against Barker would have been permissible, \\"but more than four years was too long a period, particularly since a good part of that period was attributable to the Commonwealth's failure or inability to try Manning under circumstances that comported with due process.\\" However, the Court also ruled that Barker was not prejudiced by the delay, since none of Barker's witnesses were harmed by the delay. More importantly, the Court determined that Barker did not want a speedy trial (a fact that Barker's counsel conceded at oral argument). The Court speculated that Barker's reason was his gambling on Manning's acquittal (the evidence against Manning not being strong as evidenced by two hung juries and two appellate court reversals), believing that if Manning was acquitted, he would never be tried (which Barker's counsel also conceded at oral argument). The Court further noted that, after Barker's counsel objected to the February 1962 continuance, he did not object to the June or September 1962 continuances; only in March 1963, after Manning's convictions became final, were objections raised to further continuances (this time brought about by the ex-sheriff's illness, which Barker conceded was a justifiable reason). =Concurring opinion= Justice White, joined by Justice Brennan, concurred in the verdict, and specifically commented that an overcrowded docket would not be a reasonable basis for a delay.

He is considered to have played a role behind the scenes in the elevation of Vespasian to the throne.  Life  His name shows that he had passed by adoption from the gens Mucia to the gens Licinia. Mucianus was sent by Claudius to Armenia with Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo. He was a suffect consul during the reign of Nero, most likely during the years 63 or 64.See Judith B. Ginsberg, \\"Nero's consular policy\\", American Journal of Ancient History, 6 (1981), p. 68 n. 55 for a discussion of the year of Mucianus' consulship. Mucianus served as governor of Syria in 67 AD, following the outbreak of the Jewish revolt during the previous year. The future emperor Vespasian had been sent on a special mission to Judaea in 66 AD to put down the revolt. Initially, Mucianus and Vespasian were poorly disposed towards one another, however the feud was resolved by the beginning of 69.Caldwell, Thomas (2015). The Career of Licinius Mucianus (MA). The University of Melbourne, 96-106. (https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/91093) After the death of Galba, Mucianus and Vespasian both swore allegiance to Otho, but when the civil war broke out, Mucianus persuaded Vespasian to take up arms against Vitellius, who had seized the imperial throne. It was agreed that Vespasian should stay behind to settle affairs in the East, while Mucianus made his way through Asia Minor and Thrace to attack Vitellius. On his way there, he defeated a Dacian invasion of Moesia. Mucianus reached Rome the day after the death of Vitellius, finding Domitian, Vespasian's son, at head of affairs, but until the arrival of Vespasian the real master of Rome was Mucianus. Mucianus never wavered in his allegiance to Vespasian, whose favor he retained in spite of his arrogance. He is mentioned in the records of the Arval Brethren in the year 70; Mucianus may have been admitted following Vespasian's entrance to Rome, although Ronald Syme admits that he may have been co-opted in absentia by Galba.Syme, Some Arval Brethren (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), p. 13 He was appointed consul (suffect) for the third time in 72.Paul Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for A.D. 70‚Äì96\\", Classical Quarterly, 31 (1981), p. 188. The date of one of his three consulates, possibly the first, is unknown. As no mention is made of Mucianus during the reigns of Titus or Domitian, he probably died during the reign of Vespasian; Syme believes his death happened before 78.Syme, Some Arval Brethren, p. 15  Writings  A clever writer and historian, Mucianus collected the speeches and letters of Romans of the older republican period, probably including a corpus of proceedings of the Senate (res gesta senatus). He was also the author of a memoir, chiefly dealing with the natural history and geography of the East, a text often quoted by Pliny as the source of miraculous occurrences.See See also * Mucia (gens) * Licinia (gens) References  Further reading  * 1st-century Roman governors of Syria Licinius Mucianus Licinius Ancient Roman generals Licinius Licinius Licinius 1st-century historians Mucianus, Gaius 1st-century Romans 1st-century writers ","title":"Mucianus"},{"id":"1371163","text":"Yockey may refer to: People * Chauncey W.

It has one lane in each direction, with few overtaking lanes. The highway runs along the eastern coast of the Eyre Peninsula but just so far inland as to allow only glimpses of the Gulf in certain places. The first Europeans to traverse most of this route, in April 1840, were Governor Gawler and John Hill, who explored on horseback from Port Lincoln to the Middleback Range near the location of the site of Whyalla. In general, after leaving Port Augusta the highway passes through hot and arid saltbush-covered and scrub terrain. It soon passes through the largest and most significant town along the route, which is the steel city of Whyalla. Continuing southwest it connects with such coastal towns as Cowell, Port Neill and Arno Bay which have good fishing spots. The terrain here is interspersed with broad-acre grain cropping in suitable localities, and the scenery gets greener the more it heads southwest towards Port Lincoln.

The London Canon Tables (British Library, Add MS 5111) is a Byzantine illuminated Gospel Book fragment on vellum from the sixth or seventh century. It was possibly made in Constantinople. The fragment consists of two folios of two illuminated canon tables ‚Äì of unusual construction ‚Äì set beneath an ornamental arcade and the Letter by Eusebius of Caesarea which usually prefaces canon tables. The fragment is bound together with a twelfth-century Gospel Book (British Library, Add. MS 5111 and 5112) which is thought to have belonged to one of the monasteries on Mount Athos. The folios are 220 by 150 mm. They were originally larger, but were trimmed to their current size when they were bound with the twelfth century Gospel Book. The two folios are stained gold, an attribute even rarer than purple-stained folios such as are in the Vienna Genesis. The arches and the columns of the arcades are filled by brightly coloured abstract ornamentation. This ornamentation causes the arcade to lose much of its structural sense. Below each of the arches, there is a medallion with a portrait painted in classical style. As there would have been twelve of these arches it is likely these portraits represent the Apostles, although there is no direct connection between the Canon Tables or the letter of Eusebius and the twelve Apostles. The numbers of corresponding Gospel sections, as listed in the London Canon Tables, differ strikingly from any other surviving manuscript of the Eusebian canons. Eberhard Nestle, who was among the first biblical scholars to call attention to the value of the Eusebian canons for the New Testament textual criticism, dismissed the London Canon Tables as an example of de luxe manuscripts whose \\"text-critical value stands in reverse proportion to their artistic\\". The art historian Carl Nordenfalk, however, suggested that the London Canon Tables, \\"instead of being an example of careless copying, presuppose another section division than that of Eusebius himself\\".

Occasionally, NYA transports utility poles and electrical transformers to the LIPA facility in Hicksville, which has its own spurs. NYA also moves municipal solid waste in sealed containers on COFC trains. NYA serves Belmont Park, delivering boxcars, usually BNSF's, full of feed for the race track's horses. For occasions such as the Super Bowl or St. Patrick's Day, the NYA transports 30 rail cars of beer per week, with each car holding 3,500 cases.

NYA carries nearly 1 million tons of gravel a year from Connecticut quarries. The LIRR and the New York City Transit Authority occasionally receive new rail cars, and ship out old, retired equipment for scrapping by way of the Bay Ridge Branch. =Traffic= NYA moved 30,000 carloads in 2018, up from approximately 9,200 when it began operating in May 1997. The majority of its deliveries take place during the night, when fewer commuter trains are running. About 15 percent of freight cars transported by the NYA are floated across New York Harbor from Jersey City to NYA's railyard in Sunset Park on the Brooklyn waterfront. The barge operation is managed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, but the number of cars transferred to NYA by that method has been restricted by the use of only one aging barge that has a 14-car capacity. The Port Authority is adding two new barges, each with a capacity of 18 cars, and by 2023 the cross-harbor system is expected to transport 25,000 cars annually, up from 5,000 per year circa 2018.

He discovered it in 1901 after his thesis adviser, David Hilbert, asked him to prove that it was not possible to immerse the real projective plane in three-dimensional space. Boy sketched several models of the surface, and discovered that it could have 3-fold rotational symmetry, but was unable to find a parametric model for the surface. It was not until 1978 that Bernard Morin found the first parametrisation, with the aid of computers. After completing his dissertation, Boy worked as a high school teacher in Krefeld, Germany.

Starring the British comedian Tony Hancock, it was written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson. The film was made by Associated British Picture Corporation and distributed by Warner-Path√© (ABPC's distribution arm). Plot Tony, a disaffected London office clerk (Hancock) catches the train to Waterloo Station each morning as he has done for 14 years. In the city he sits as one of many identical clerks in a dull office. Each worker wears a bowler hat and carries an umbrella. One day his boss (John Le Mesurier) catches him drawing faces instead of working, and he is asked to step into his office. His ledgers are full of poor quality caricatures of fellow workers. He is told to take the afternoon off but does not. He leaves at exactly 5.30pm as does everyone else. Back at his lodgings, in a mid-terraced brick Victorian house, somewhere in outer London, Tony dons his artist's smock, and resumes work on his masterpiece, \\"Aphrodite at the Waterhole\\"... a truly horrendous but huge sculpture. His landlady Mrs Cravat (Irene Handl) complains about the hammering noise. He explains he cannot afford a model and it represents \\"women as he sees them\\". She treatens to evict him if he does not remove the statue. As he remonstrates with his copy of Van Gogh's self-portrait on his wall, the floor creaks and the statue falls through, luckily missing his landlady below. In his office attire he goes to a local cafe seeking a coffee \\"with no froth\\". Due to a poster on the wall he decides to go to Paris. He takes a train... Aphrodite is on a flat-bed wagon to the rear...she loses her head going through a tunnel. Loading the headless statue onto a ship it bursts its net and is lost in the sea. On the ferry he throws his bowler hat and umbrella into the sea. Unfortunately it is raining heavily when he arrives in France. Arriving in Paris, Tony walks along the River Seine and looks at the artists. In the evening he goes to a cafe in Montmartre and meets a group of English-speaking artists. Here he meets Paul, who speaks passionately about art. He orders a half litre of vin ordinaire and they drink together. Paul invites Tony to share his studio and flat, just up the road. The landlady Madame Laurent hears them enter and demands the rent. Tony loves the atmosphere in the studio. Tony is asked to critique Paul's paintings ... \\"Your colours are the wrong shape\\" he says. Paul admires the child-like style of Tony's work: \\"infantile art\\". Josey, a red-haired, blue- lipped beatnik visits and invites Tony and Paul to a very large mansion, filled with artwork. Here the Dali-esque owner, Jim Smith, is sleeping on the bookcase (because he is writing a book). At a party a group of young people all dressed alike hang on Tony's every word. They all think he is fantastic. Inspired by Jim Smith, Tony starts sleeping on top of the wardrobe and brings a cow to live in the flat. He then tries his first Action painting. Paul decides to leave, and gifts Tony his art. As his reputation spreads he is visited by Sir Charles Broward, an art collector and buyer who is attracted to Paul's work. Sir Charles asks Tony if Paul's works are his and Tony says they were \\"a gift\\". This is misinterpreted. Tony's own work is labelled awful. After the first exhibition he goes to a posh restaurant with Sir Charles. He orders egg and chips... when pushed to choose something more he orders snails, egg and chips and a cup of tea. Sir Charles takes Tony to Monte Carlo, where he goes to dinner with a number of rich guests. One wife, Mrs Carreras, wishes to be painted by Tony. Her husband, after some debate, commissions a sculpture. Tony injures his fingers while hammering and later at dinner the wife hand feeds him, much to the embarrassment of all. Carreras offers to buy Tony's entire art collection for ¬£50,000. On the Carreras yacht, Tony dresses as a bird for the fancy dress party. Mrs Carreras dresses as a cat. She tells him she loves him. He rejects her and she threatens to shoot him. On deck, he unveils the statue to the horror of all and Mrs Carreras accuses him of assaulting her. The statue drops through the ship and Tony escapes on the yacht's launch. Still dressed as a bird, Tony goes to the airport and says he wants to fly to Britain. \\"Wouldn't you rather take a plane?\\" the attendant quips. He returns to Mrs Cravat (and Paul). At the London exhibition, it is revealed that Paul is the true artist and \\"the rubbish\\" is Tony's work.

The since-demolished railway station used at the beginning of the film, was Bingham Road in the Croydon suburb of Addiscombe, named Fortune Green South in the film. In The Rebel, existentialist themes are explored by mocking Parisian intellectual life and portraying the pretensions of the English middle class. Galton and Simpson had previously satirised pseudo-intellectuals in the Hancock's Half Hour radio episode \\"The Poetry Society\\" (1959), in which Hancock attempts to imitate the style of the pretentious poets and fails, and is infuriated when his idiot friend Bill does the same and wins their enthusiastic approval. The film also includes scenes parodying modern art. The scene showing Hancock splashing paint onto a canvas and riding a bike over it is a lampoon of the work of Action Painter William Green, while the childlike paintings of Hancock, referred to as the 'infantile school' or the 'shapeist school', parody the naive style. In 2002, the London Institute of 'Pataphysics organised an exhibition consisting of recreations of all the art works seen in the film.Fisher Hancock: The Definitive Biography, p. 307 There is still dispute whether the drawings and paintings, attributed to Hancock and his roommate, were all produced by the same artist, Alistair Grant (1925-1997). or whether Hancock's poor quality 'Infantilist School' artworks were actually produced as a joke by the British modernist painter, John Bratby. Release and reception The Rebels British premiere was at the Plaza Cinema in London's West End on 2 March 1961, following a screening at the Beirut Film Festival. An anonymous reviewer (most likely Dudley Carew) in The Times, at the time of the film's British release, said Hancock had \\"made the transition from small to large screen\\" in this film \\"with gratifying success\\". According to the Motion Picture Herald, the film was the 6th most popular movie at the UK box office in 1961. Hancock was nominated for a BAFTA Film Award in 1962 as the Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles‚Äô. On its release in the USA, under the title Call Me Genius, the film was not well received. Bosley Crowther in The New York Times wrote: \\"Norman Wisdom can move over. The British have found a low comedian who is every bit as low as he is and even less comical\\". He thought it was derivative. A reviewer writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline website commented: \\"In this film, comic rebellion places artists as the antithesis of workers and there is a kind of lazy shorthand at work that conflates artists with Paris, existentialism, angry young men, beatniks and beat poets. Cod philosophical discussions of what art is about permeate the film, but this reflects the times accurately\\". Galton and Simpson wrote in January 2012 that the best review they ever received was from artist Lucien Freud who reportedly described it as the best film made about modern art. Quotes On Mrs. Crevatte seeing one of Hancock's pictures on the wall: * Mrs. Crevatte; What's this 'orrible thing? * Hancock; That, is a self-portrait. * Mrs. Crevatte; Who of? * Hancock; Laurel and Hardy!! On Mrs. Crevatte first encountering Hancock's Aphrodite at the Waterhole * Mrs. Crevatte; Here, have you been having models up here - have there been naked women in my establishment? * Hancock; Of course there haven't. I can't afford thirty-bob an hour. I did that from memory. That is women as I see them. * Mrs. Crevatte; Oh! ... You poor man! The abstract expressionist painting scene: * Hancock: It's worth 2000 quid of anybody's money that is! A definition of Existentialism *Josey We only live in the present; there is no future. Why kill time when you can kill yourself? As he takes his leave of the Paris Art World at his final exhibition: * Hancock: Ladies and gentlemen, I shall now bid you all good day. I'm off! I know what I was cut out to do and I should have done it long ago. YOU'RE ALL RAVING MAD!! None of you know what you're looking at. You wait 'til I'm dead, you'll see I was right!

Alternatively known as Mashishing, Lydenburg is situated on the Sterkspruit/Dorps River tributary of the Lepelle River at the base of the Long Tom Pass. The name is derived from the Dutch Lijdenburg, or \\"Town of Suffering\\".South Africa Lydenburg has become the centre of the South African fly-fishing industry and is an agricultural and mining hub. History The earliest known forms of African sculpture in southern Africa dating back to AD 400 were found in the area in the late 1950s. Mashishing later renamed Lydenburg was colonized in 1849 by a group of Voortrekkers under the leadership of Andries Potgieter when they abandoned their previous settlement Ohrigstad (to the north) due to a malaria epidemic. The town became the capital of the Lydenburg Republic ('De Republiek Lydenburg in Zuid Afrika') in 1856 and later in 1857 joined the Republic of Utrecht but in 1860 both these republics joined the Zuid Afrikaanse Republiek (ZAR).The town became the capital of the Lydenburg District of the South African Republic (ZAR). Lydenburg became important because it was on the wagon route to the port of Delagoa Bay (now Maputo Bay) which was free of British control. In 1871 construction of the road was started by Abraham Espag under the orders of President Thomas Fran√ßois Burgers. The first wagons arrived in Lydenburg from Delagoa Bay in 1874. On 6 February 1873 alluvial gold was discovered and within 3 months the Lydenburg goldfields was proclaimed. The First Boer War broke out between Britain and the Transvaal Republic in 1880. A British garrison under Lieutenant Walter Hillyar Colquhoun Long (uncle of the 1st Viscount Long) took control of Lydenburg to control the goldfields. It was from here that the ill-fated 94th Regiment under the command of Lieutenant- Colonel Philip Robert Anstruther marched to Pretoria. The remainder of the garrison at Lydenburg was besieged from 6 January 1881, following Long's refusal to surrender the garrison on 23 December 1880. By 1910 the railway reached Lydenburg. In 1927 Lydenburg became a municipality. A side street in Lydenburg = Name change = In June 2006 it was announced that Arts and Culture minister, Pallo Jordan, approved the name change of Lydenburg back to its original name Mashishing (meaning \\"long, green grass\\").http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Lydenburg-takes-on-new- name-20060906 However the decision was taken to court and ruled illegal and ordered the name to be changed back to Lydenburg. However the Township outside Lydenburg is called Mashishing. Road signs still say Lydenburg and businesses and local building such as the Lydenburg Museum have still kept the old name. However some road signs say Mashishing when a person is actually entering the more developed, richer, Lydenburg area.

It is in the civil parish of Ballyroan and in the former barony of Cullenagh. The R425 regional road passes through the village. History Ballyroan is an ancient settlement, though its origins are obscure. A castle likely stood there in the Middle Ages, as one Conall √ì M√≥rdha, son of Daibh√≠ √ì M√≥rdha, lord of Laois, is attested to have \\"built the castle of Baile atha in roine\\" in the fourteenth century. The area remained in the hands of the O'Mores until the sixteenth century; it is listed in the possessions of Conall √ì M√≥rdha (d. 1537). An Irish Volunteer Corps was established in Ballyroan in mid-1914. They would become the only corps in Laois to support Eoin MacNeill over John Redmond during the debate as to whether the Irish Volunteers should participate in the First World War. On April 3 1920, the abandoned RIC police barracks in Ballyroan were attacked and burned. In 1831, Ballyroan had a population of 714. In 1841, on the eve of the Great Famine, it had a population of 637. The size of the village has since declined considerably. In 1996, the population was 173; in 2002, it was 142. =Education= The village has a long educational history. In 1686, Alderman John Preston founded a private school in the village known as Ballyroan School, endowed with lands in Cappaloughlan. The school was in a large slated building erected at a cost of ¬£500, which has since been demolished. Protestant boys received a free education, while Catholic boys paid ¬£1 per quarter. In the nineteenth century, the school moved to Abbeyleix. The Brigidine Sisters came to the village in 1877 and opened a school operating under a Catholic ethos. Three sisters (nuns) from the Abbeyleix Community took up residence in their newly built convent on 25 September of that year. Their convent and school closed in 1974. Ballyroan was home to separate boys' and girls' primary schools until 2017, when they were amalgamated into a single national school in a new building. The school is named for Pope John Paul II. Sport The local Gaelic football club is Ballyroan Abbey GAA. A former club was Ballyroan GAA. Ballyroan was the first village in Leinster to play football in 1889.

The commune contains 25 villages and in the 2009 census had a population of 23,099. The town lies just to the north of the Hombori Tondo mesa on the R15 highway linking Mopti and Gao. Climate Hombori has a borderline between a hot desert climate (BWh) and a hot semi-desert climate (BSh). Almost all the rainfall occurs between late June and the middle of September.. The mean annual rainfall in the period 1950-2007 was 372 mm but there are large year-to-year variations. The mean air temperature is 30.2 ¬∞C with the highest monthly average occurring in May (42 ¬∞C) and the lowest in January (17.1 ¬∞C). The provision of drinking water in the commune is difficult as there is no continuous aquifer which can be tapped by deep wells. Sites and fame The town is known for its vernacular architecture of rock- built houses with narrow alleyways and tunnels. The area around Hombori features rock formations similar in appearance to those in the more well known Monument Valley and includes the Needles of Gami, a popular rock climbing location. Mount Hombori, Mali's highest point at 1153 meters, is nearby. History Hombori is an ancient village of the Dogon people; its exact age is unknown. After the invasion of the Moroccon Saadi dynasty in 1591, one part of the royal family of Gao established themselves in Hombori. The Songhai, now the majority population, later followed the royal refugees to this area. 280px Hombori remains a focus of Songhai Empire traditions but was also a strategic point for the conquest of southern Mali by the Songhai successor states. Those local villages deeper in the hills (for example Tabi, 30 km away) were never conquered or directly colonised, and retain their traditional cultures. The Songhai leadership were largely coopted by the French Colonial administration upon their arrival around 1900, while much of the Dogon community fled to nearby mountains, a process that had earlier begun to escape Moorish slave raids. The religion of the community is Islam by a vast majority. Sufism and Shiism are the dominant belief systems in the area. Some sequences of Souleymane Ciss√©'s film, Yeelen, were shot in Hombori.

It is the capital of Taoud√©nit Region. The salt is dug by hand from the bed of an ancient salt lake, cut into slabs, and transported either by truck or by camel to Timbuktu. The camel caravans (azalai) from Taoudenni are some of the last that still operate in the Sahara Desert. In the late 1960s, during the regime of Moussa Traor√©, a prison was built at the site and the inmates forced to work in the mines. The prison was closed in 1988. Salt mining The earliest mention of Taoudenni is by al-Sadi, in his Tarikh al-Sudan, who wrote that in 1586 when Moroccan forces attacked the salt mining center of Taghaza (150 km north west of Taoudenni) some of the miners moved to 'Tawdani'. In 1906 the French soldier √âdouard Cortier visited Taoudenni with a unit of the camel corps (m√©haristes) and published the first description of the mines. At the time the only building was the Ksar de Smida, which had a surrounding wall with a single small entrance on the western side. The ruins of the ksar are 600 m north of the prison building.The ruins of the ksar are at . A plan of the ksar was published by Cortier in 1906, p. 327. The Taoudenni mines are located on the bed of an ancient salt lake. The miners use crude axes to dig pits, which usually measure 5 m by 5 m with a depth of 4 m. The miners first remove 1.5 m of red clay overburden, then several layers of poor quality salt before reaching three layers of high quality salt. The salt is cut into irregular slabs that are around 110 cm x 45 cm by 5 cm in thickness and weigh around 30 kg. Two of the high quality layers are of sufficient thickness to be split in half, so that 5 slabs can be produced from the three layers. Having removed the salt from the base area of the pit, the miners excavate horizontally to create galleries from which additional slabs can be obtained. As each pit is exhausted another is dug, so there are now thousands of pits spread over a wide area. Over the centuries salt has been extracted from three distinct areas of the depression, with each successive area located further to the south west. The three areas can be seen clearly on satellite photographs. At the time of √âdouard Cortier's visit in 1906 the mining area was 3 km south of the ksar; in the 1950s the active mines were located in an area 5 km from the ksar, while the current mines are at a distance of 9 km.. The actives mines in 2007 were located near . In 2007-2008 there were around 350 teams of miners, with each team usually consisting of an experienced miner with 2 labourers, giving a total of around 1000 men. The men live in primitive huts constructed from blocks of inferior quality salt and work at the mines from October to April, avoiding the hottest months of the year, when only about 10 of them remain. The slabs are transported across the desert via the oasis of Araouane to Timbuktu. In the past they were always carried by camel, but recently some of the salt has been moved by four-wheel drive trucks.. By camel the journey to Timbuktu takes around three weeks, with each camel carrying either four or five slabs. The typical arrangement is that for each four slabs transported to Timbuktu, one is for the miners and the other three are payment for the camel owners. Up to the middle of the 20th century the salt was transported in two large camel caravans (azala√Ø), one leaving Timbuktu in early November and a second leaving Timbuktu in late March, at the end of the season. Horace Miner, an American anthropologist who spent seven months in the town, estimated that in 1939-40 the winter caravan consisted of more than 4,000 camels and that the total production amounted to 35,000 slabs of salt. Jean Clauzel records that the number of slabs reaching Timbuktu increased from 10,515 in 1926 to 160,000 (4800 t) in 1957-1958. However, in the early 1970s the production decreased, and at the end of the decade was between 50,000 and 70,000 slabs. Prison A military post and a prison were built at Taoudenni in 1969 during the regime of Moussa Traor√©. The prison was used to detain political prisoners until 1988, when it was closed. Many of the prisoners were government officials who had been accused of plotting against the regime. The prisoners worked in the salt mines and many of them died. To the east of the ruins of the prison building is a cemetery containing 140 individual graves, of which only a dozen have names. They include: * Yoro Diakit√©, head of the first provisional government following the coup of 19 November 1968, who died in 1973. * Ti√©coro Bagayoko, head of security services from 1968 to 1978, who died in August 1983. * Kissima Doukara, Minister of Defence 1968-1978. * Youssouf Balla Sylla, police chief of the 3rd Arrondissement of Bamako. * Jean Bolon Samak√©, head of the Goundam Cercle in 1969, who died in 1973. Climate Taoudenni is a remote site in the hottest region on the planet, located over a hundred and sixty kilometres from the nearest inhabited location of any size. The region is located in the middle of the Sahara Desert, in the southern part of the Tanezrouft (one of the harshest areas on the planet, known for extreme heat and aridity), and features an extreme version of the hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh). The region features a torrid, hyper-arid climate with unbroken sunshine all year- long. Averages high temperatures exceed 40‚ÑÉ (104‚Ñâ) from April to September and reach an extreme peak of 48‚ÑÉ (118.2‚Ñâ) in July, the highest value for such an elevation above sea level. Winters are also very warm compared to the world average. High temperatures average close to 27‚ÑÉ (80.6‚Ñâ) in the coolest month. The mean annual daily temperature is around 29‚ÑÉ (84.2‚Ñâ), among the highest in the world. The annual average rainfall is between 10 mm (0.39 in) and 20 mm (0.78 in) which mainly falls from July to October. On average, Taoudenni sees 3,700 hours of bright sunshine annually, with 84% of daytime hours being sunny. The site is also located in one of the driest regions on the globe.

Flyways generally span continents and often pass over oceans. Although applying to any species of migrating bird, the concept was first conceived and applied to waterfowl and shore birds. The flyways can be thought of as wide arterial highways to which the migratory routes of different species are tributaries. An alternative definition is that a flyway is the entire range of a migratory bird, encompassing both its breeding and non-breeding grounds, and the resting and feeding locations it uses while migrating. There are four major north/south flyways in North America and six covering Eurasia, Africa and Australasia. History The passing of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in the United States resulted in a need for more information on bird migration. Frederick Charles Lincoln was put in charge and improved methods for trapping and banding, developed record-keeping procedures, recruited banders, fostered international cooperation, and promoted banding as a tool for research and wildlife management. He found it was possible to establish the routes used by waterfowl during their annual migrations and he developed the flyway concept, a key idea in the management and regulation of hunting of migratory birds; by establishing the routes used, estimates of population sizes could be made and suitable protection could be put in place. The Saloum Delta in Senegal, on the East Atlantic Flyway The special vulnerability of waterfowl and shorebirds on their international migrations, with their specific needs for suitable wetland stopovers, resulted in the signing of the Ramsar Convention in 1971. As a result, over 2300 Ramsar sites have been established around the world, many being situated on flyways where they provide the vital habitat needed by the birds on their journeys. Flyways Many bird populations migrate long distances twice a year. The most common pattern involves flying north in the spring to breed in the temperate parts of the northern hemisphere or the Arctic during summer and returning southward in the autumn to wintering grounds in warmer regions, often on the other side of the equator. A similar pattern occurs in the southern hemisphere with birds flying south to breed and north to overwinter, but on a much smaller scale. The flyway, or route, taken by different bird species varies, but each population has its traditional staging points along the route where birds feed to build up their energy reserves to prepare for the next migratory stage; the route used on the spring migration may be different from that used in the autumn and will depend on such factors as wind direction and the availability of food at staging points. Flyways may not be the shortest route available but may have curves or doglegs. Birds of different species may follow similar routes, and populations from one area may merge with other groups and diverge to reach different destinations. Flyways tend to avoid obstacles such as mountain ranges and oceans, running parallel to the barriers and following routes along the coast or along major river valleys. Passerines often fly on a broader front across the terrain, either flying over or circumventing obstacles on the route, according to their evolutionary adaptations. In selecting routes, birds may overcompensate for predicted winds. Terrestrial birds tend to travel over land, raptors need routes where thermals can give them the lift they require, sea birds prefer ocean routes and wetland birds need routes with suitable staging sites; deltas and coastal wetlands provide reliable food sources for this purpose whereas inland wetlands are less predictable. Flyways of the Americas N. American waterfowl: Atlantic, Mississippi, Central, and Pacific Flyways. The Atlantic Flyway starts in northern Canada and Greenland and follows the Atlantic coast of Canada and the United States to the Caribbean Sea, and on to tropical South America. The Mississippi Flyway starts from northeastern Canada and passes over the Great Lakes, following the lower Ohio River, the Missouri and the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico, and on to Central and South America. There are no mountain barriers on this route. The Central Flyway starts from central Canada and crosses the Great Plains before continuing southwards to the Gulf of Mexico, merging with the Mississippi Flyway. There are no mountain barriers on this route. The Pacific Flyway is a north-south flyway for birds migrating from breeding grounds in Alaska and Canada to their overwintering areas in South America, some species travelling as far south as Patagonia. The Allegheny Front flyway in the central Appalachian Mountains is an important flyway for migratory birds traveling from their northern breeding grounds to their southern wintering sites. Flyways of Eurasia, Africa, and Australasia Central Asian, East Asian-Australasian and West Pacific migratory bird flyways The East Atlantic Flyway starts from northern North America, Greenland, Iceland, northern Europe and western Siberia and leads to wintering areas in western Europe and North Africa, with some birds continuing down the west coast of the continent to South Africa. The Black Sea-Mediterranean Flyway starts from northern and western Siberia and leads across Asia, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea to northern Africa. Little has been published about birds using this flyway. The Asian‚ÄìEast African Flyway starts from the northern breeding grounds of water birds in Siberia and leads across Asia to East Africa. Little has been published about birds using this flyway. The Central Asian Flyway starts from the northern breeding grounds of water birds in Siberia and leads across Asia to the Indian subcontinent. Little has been published about birds using this flyway. The East Asian‚ÄìAustralasian Flyway starts at the Taymyr Peninsula in Russia and Alaska and extends southwards to southeastern Asia, Australia and New Zealand. This flyway overlaps with the West Pacific Flyway. About 60 species of shorebird use this route. The West Pacific Flyway links New Zealand and the east coast of Australia, through the central Pacific Ocean and the east coast of northern Asia, including Japan and the Korean Peninsula, ending up in eastern Siberia, including the Chukchi and Kamchatka Peninsulas, and Alaska. This flyway overlaps with the East Asian‚ÄìAustralasian Flyway.

It is associated with the concepts of self-fulfilling prophecy and stereotyping. Labeling theory holds that deviance is not inherent in an act, but instead focuses on the tendency of majorities to negatively label minorities or those seen as deviant from standard cultural norms.Source Wikipedia. 2013. Labeling Theory: Social Constructionism, Social Stigma, Deinstitutionalisation, George Herbert Mead, Howard S. Becker, Labelling. General Books LLC. The theory was prominent during the 1960s and 1970s, and some modified versions of the theory have developed and are still currently popular. Stigma is defined as a powerfully negative label that changes a person's self-concept and social identity.Macionis, John, and Linda Gerber. 2010. Sociology (7th ed.). London: Pearson Education Canada. Labeling theory is closely related to social-construction and symbolic- interaction analysis. Labeling theory was developed by sociologists during the 1960s. Howard Saul Becker's book Outsiders was extremely influential in the development of this theory and its rise to popularity. Labeling theory is also connected to other fields besides crime. For instance there is the labeling theory that corresponds to homosexuality. Alfred Kinsey and his colleagues were the main advocates in separating the difference between the role of a \\"homosexual\\" and the acts one does. An example is the idea that males performing feminine acts would imply that they are homosexual. Thomas J. Scheff states that labeling also plays a part with the \\"mentally ill\\". The label doesn't refer to criminal but rather acts that aren't socially accepted due to mental disorders. Theoretical basis Labeling theory attributes its origins to French sociologist √âmile Durkheim and his 1897 book, Suicide. Durkheim found that crime is not so much a violation of a penal code as it is an act that outrages society. He was the first to suggest that deviant labeling satisfies that function and satisfies society's need to control the behavior. As a contributor to American Pragmatism and later a member of the Chicago School, George Herbert Mead posited that the self is socially constructed and reconstructed through the interactions which each person has with the community. The labeling theory suggests that people obtain labels from how others view their tendencies or behaviors. Each individual is aware of how they are judged by others because he or she has attempted many different roles and functions in social interactions and has been able to gauge the reactions of those present. This theoretically builds a subjective conception of the self, but as others intrude into the reality of that individual's life, this represents \\"objective\\" (intersubjective) data which may require a re-evaluation of that conception depending on the authoritativeness of the others' judgment. Family and friends may judge differently from random strangers. More socially representative individuals such as police officers or judges may be able to make more globally respected judgments. If deviance is a failure to conform to the rules observed by most of the group, the reaction of the group is to label the person as having offended against their social or moral norms of behavior. This is the power of the group: to designate breaches of their rules as deviant and to treat the person differently depending on the seriousness of the breach. The more differential the treatment, the more the individual's self-image is affected. Labeling theory concerns itself mostly not with the normal roles that define our lives, but with those very special roles that society provides for deviant behavior, called deviant roles, stigmatic roles, or social stigma. A social role is a set of expectations we have about a behavior. Social roles are necessary for the organization and functioning of any society or group. We expect the postman, for example, to adhere to certain fixed rules about how he does his job. \\"Deviance\\" for a sociologist does not mean morally wrong, but rather behavior that is condemned by society. Deviant behavior can include both criminal and non-criminal activities. Investigators found that deviant roles powerfully affect how we perceive those who are assigned those roles. They also affect how the deviant actor perceives himself and his relationship to society. The deviant roles and the labels attached to them function as a form of social stigma. Always inherent in the deviant role is the attribution of some form of \\"pollution\\" or difference that marks the labeled person as different from others. Society uses these stigmatic roles to them to control and limit deviant behavior: \\"If you proceed in this behavior, you will become a member of that group of people.\\" Whether a breach of a given rule will be stigmatized will depend on the significance of the moral or other tenet it represents. For example, adultery may be considered a breach of an informal rule or it may be criminalized depending on the status of marriage, morality, and religion within the community. In most Western countries, adultery is not a crime. Attaching the label \\"adulterer\\" may have some unfortunate consequences but they are not generally severe. But in some Islamic countries, zina is a crime and proof of extramarital activity may lead to severe consequences for all concerned. Stigma is usually the result of laws enacted against the behavior. Laws protecting slavery or outlawing homosexuality, for instance, will over time form deviant roles connected with those behaviors. Those who are assigned those roles will be seen as less human and reliable. Deviant roles are the sources of negative stereotypes, which tend to support society's disapproval of the behavior. =George Herbert Mead= One of the founders of social interactionism, George Herbert Mead, focused on the internal processes of how the mind constructs one's self-image. In Mind, Self, and Society (1934),Mead, George Herbert. 1934. Mind, Self, and Society. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. https://archive.org/details/mindselfsocietyf00mead. he showed how infants come to know persons first and only later come to know things. According to Mead, thought is both a social and pragmatic process, based on the model of two persons discussing how to solve a problem. Mead's central concept is the self, the part of an individual's personality composed of self-awareness and self- image.Macionis, John J. 2012. Sociology (14th ed.). Boston: Pearson. . Our self-image is, in fact, constructed of ideas about what we think others are thinking about us. While we make fun of those who visibly talk to themselves, they have only failed to do what the rest of us do in keeping the internal conversation to ourselves. Human behavior, Mead stated, is the result of meanings created by the social interaction of conversation, both real and imaginary. =Thomas Scheff= Thomas J. Scheff (1966), professor emeritus of Sociology at UCSB, published the book Being Mentally III: A Sociological Theory. According to Scheff, society has perceptions about people with mental illness. He stated that everyone in the society learns the stereotyped imagery of mental disorder through ordinary social interaction. From childhood, people learn to use terms like \\"crazy,\\" \\"loony,\\" \\"nuts,\\" and associated them with disturbed behaviors. The media also contributes to this bias against mentally ill patients by associating them with violent crimes. Scheff believes that mental illness is a label given to a person who has a behavior which is away from the social norms of the society and is treated as a social deviance in the society. Once a person is given a label of \\"mentally ill person\\", s/he receives a set of uniform responses from the society, which are generally negative in nature. These responses from the society compel to the person to take the role of a \\"mentally ill person\\" as s/he starts internalizing the same. When the individual takes on the role of being mentally ill as her/his central identity, s/he becomes a stable mental ill person. Chronic mental illness is thus a social role and the societal reaction is the most determinant of one's entry into this role of chronically ill. According to Scheff hospitalization of a mentally ill person further reinforces this social role and forces her/him to take this role as her/his self-perception. Once the person is institutionalized for mental disorder, s/he has been publicly labeled as \\"crazy\\" and forced to become a member of a deviant social group. It then becomes difficult for a deviant person to return to her/his former level of functioning as the status of 'patient' causes unfavorable evaluations by self and by others. =Frank Tannenbaum= Frank Tannenbaum is considered the grandfather of labeling theory. His Crime and Community (1938),Tannenbaum, Frank. 1938. Crime and Community. New York: Columbia University Press. describing the social interaction involved in crime, is considered a pivotal foundation of modern criminology. While the criminal differs little or not at all from others in the original impulse to first commit a crime, social interaction accounts for continued acts that develop a pattern of interest to sociologists. Tannenbaum first introduced the idea of \\"tagging.\\"O'Grady, William. 2011. Crime in Canadian Context. Ontario: Oxford University Press. While conducting his studies with delinquent youth, he found that a negative tag or label often contributed to further involvement in delinquent activities. This initial tagging may cause the individual to adopt it as part of their identity. The crux of Tannenbaum's argument is that the greater the attention placed on this label, the more likely the person is to identify themselves as the label. Kerry Townsend (2001) writes about the revolution in criminology caused by Tannenbaum's work: > \\"The roots of Frank Tannenbaum's theoretical model, known as the > 'dramatization of evil' or labeling theory, surfaces in the mid- to late- > thirties.

Archived from the > original on 2009-04-26. Retrieved 2010-05-29. =Edwin Lemert= Sociologist Edwin Lemert (1951) introduced the concept of \\"secondary deviance.\\" The primary deviance is the experience connected to the overt behavior, say drug addiction and its practical demands and consequences. Secondary deviation is the role created to deal with society's condemnation of the behavior of a person. With other sociologists of his time, Lemert saw how all deviant acts are social acts, a result of the cooperation of society. In studying drug addiction, Lemert observed a very powerful and subtle force at work. Besides the physical addiction to the drug and all the economic and social disruptions it caused, there was an intensely intellectual process at work concerning one's own identity and the justification for the behavior: \\"I do these things because I am this way.\\" There might be certain subjective and personal motives that might first lead a person to drink or shoplift. But the activity itself tells us little about the person's self-image or its relationship to the activity. Lemert writes: \\"His acts are repeated and organized subjectively and transformed into active roles and become the social criteria for assigning status.‚Ä¶When a person begins to employ his deviant behavior or a role based on it as a means of defense, attack, or adjustment to the overt and covert problems created by the consequent societal reaction to him, his deviation is secondary.\\"Lemert, Edwin M. 1951. Social Pathology. New York: Mcgraw-Hill. =Howard Becker= While it was Lemert who introduced the key concepts of labeling theory, it was Howard Becker who became their successor. He first began describing the process of how a person adopts a deviant role in a study of dance musicians, with whom he once worked. He later studied the identity formation of marijuana smokers. This study was the basis of his Outsiders published in 1963. This work became the manifesto of the labeling theory movement among sociologists. In his opening, Becker writes: > \\"‚Ä¶social groups create deviance by making rules whose infraction creates > deviance, and by applying those rules to particular people and labeling them > as outsiders. From this point of view, deviance is not a quality of the act > the person commits, but rather a consequence of the application by other of > rules and sanctions to an 'offender.' The deviant is one to whom that label > has been successfully applied; deviant behavior is behavior that people so > label.\\" While society uses the stigmatic label to justify its condemnation, the deviant actor uses it to justify his actions. He wrote: \\"To put a complex argument in a few words: instead of the deviant motives leading to the deviant behavior, it is the other way around, the deviant behavior in time produces the deviant motivation.\\"Becker, Howard. 1973 [1963]. Outsiders. New York: Free Press. Becker's immensely popular views were also subjected to a barrage of criticism, most of it blaming him for neglecting the influence of other biological, genetic effects and personal responsibility. In a later 1973 edition of his work, he answered his critics. He wrote that sociologists, while dedicated to studying society, are often careful not to look too closely. Instead, he wrote: \\"I prefer to think of what we study as collective action. People act, as Mead and Blumer have made clearest, together. They do what they do with an eye on what others have done, are doing now, and may do in the future. One tries to fit his own line of action into the actions of others, just as each of them likewise adjusts his own developing actions to what he sees and expects others to do.\\" Francis Cullen reported in 1984 that Becker was probably too generous with his critics. After 20 years, Becker's views, far from being supplanted, have been corrected and absorbed into an expanded \\"structuring perspective.\\"Cullen, Francis. 1984. Rethinking Crime and Deviance Theory. Totowa, NJ: Bowman and Allanheld. =Albert Memmi= In The Colonizer and the Colonized (1965), Albert Memmi described the deep psychological effects of the social stigma created by the domination of one group by another. He wrote: > The longer the oppression lasts, the more profoundly it affects him (the > oppressed). It ends by becoming so familiar to him that he believes it is > part of his own constitution, that he accepts it and could not imagine his > recovery from it. This acceptance is the crowning point of oppression.Memmi, > Albert. 1965. The Colonizer and the Colonized. New York: Orion Press. In Dominated Man (1968), Memmi turned his attention to the motivation of stigmatic labeling: it justifies the exploitation or criminalization of the victim. He wrote: > Why does the accuser feel obliged to accuse in order to justify himself? > Because he feels guilty toward his victim. Because he feels that his > attitude and his behavior are essentially unjust and fraudulent.‚Ä¶ Proof? In > almost every case, the punishment has already been inflicted. The victim of > racism is already living under the weight of disgrace and oppression.‚Ä¶ In > order to justify such punishment and misfortune, a process of > rationalization is set in motion, by which to explain the ghetto and > colonial exploitation.Memmi, Albert. 1968. Dominated Man. New York: Orion > Press. Central to stigmatic labeling is the attribution of an inherent fault: It is as if one says, \\"There must be something wrong with these people. Otherwise, why would we treat them so badly?\\" =Erving Goffman= Perhaps the most important contributor to labeling theory was Erving Goffman, President of the American Sociological Association (ASA), and one of America's most cited sociologists. His most popular books include The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life,Goffman, Erving. 1959. The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. New York: Anchor Books. Interaction Ritual, and Frame Analysis.Goffman, Erving. 1974. Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. His most important contribution to labeling theory, however, was Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity published in 1963. Unlike other authors who examined the process of adopting a deviant identity, Goffman explored the ways people managed that identity and controlled information about it.  Goffman's key insights  The modern nation state's heightened demand for normalcy. Today's stigmas are the result not so much of ancient or religious prohibitions, but of a new demand for normalcy: > \\"The notion of the 'normal human being' may have its source in the medical > approach to humanity, or in the tendency of large-scale bureaucratic > organizations such as the nation state, to treat all members in some > respects as equal. Whatever its origins, it seems to provide the basic > imagery through which laymen currently conceive themselves.\\"Goffman, Erving. > 1963. Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity. Englewood Cliffs, > NY: Prentice-Hall. Living in a divided world, deviants split their worlds into: (1) forbidden places where discovery means exposure and danger; (2) places where people of that kind are painfully tolerated; and (3) places where one's kind is exposed without need to dissimulate or conceal. Dealing with others is fraught with great complexity and ambiguity: > \\"When normals and stigmatized do in fact enter one another's immediate > presence, especially when they attempt to maintain a joint conversational > encounter, there occurs one of the primal scenes of sociology; for, in many > cases, these moments will be the ones when the causes and effects of stigma > will be directly confronted by both sides.\\" \\"What are unthinking routines > for normals can become management problems for the discreditable.‚Ä¶ The > person with a secret failing, then, must be alive to the social situation as > a scanner of possibilities, and is therefore likely to be alienated from the > simpler world in which those around them apparently dwell.\\" Society's demands are filled with contradictions: > On the one hand, a stigmatized person may be told that he is no different > from others. On the other hand, he must declare his status as \\"a resident > alien who stands for his group.\\" It requires that the stigmatized individual > cheerfully and unselfconsciously accept himself as essentially the same as > normals, while at the same time he voluntarily withholds himself from those > situations in which normals would find it difficult to give lip service to > their similar acceptance of him. \\"One has to convey the impression that the > burden of the stigma is not too heavy yet keep himself at the required > distance. \\"A phantom acceptance is allowed to provide the base for a phantom > normalcy.\\" Familiarity need not reduce contempt. In spite of the common belief that openness and exposure will decrease stereotypes and repression, the opposite is true: > \\"Thus, whether we interact with strangers or intimates, we will still find > that the fingertips of society have reached bluntly into the contact, even > here putting us in our place.\\" =David Matza= In On Becoming Deviant (1969), sociologist David MatzaMatza, David. 1969. On Becoming Deviant. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. gives the most vivid and graphic account of the process of adopting a deviant role. The acts of authorities in outlawing a proscribed behavior can have two effects, keeping most out of the behavior, but also offering new opportunities for creating deviant identities. He says the concept of \\"affinity\\" does little to explain the dedication to the behavior. \\"Instead, it may be regarded as a natural biographical tendency born of personal and social circumstances that suggests but hardly compels a direction or movement.\\" What gives force to that movement is the development of a new identity: > \\"To be cast as a thief, as a prostitute, or more generally, a deviant, is to > further compound and hasten the process of becoming that very thing.\\" \\"In > shocked discovery, the subject now concretely understands that there are > serious people who really go around building their lives around his > activities‚Äîstopping him, correcting him, devoted to him. They keep records > on the course of his life, even develop theories on how he got that way.... > Pressed by such a display, the subject may begin to add meaning and gravity > to his deviant activities. But he may do so in a way not especially intended > by agents of the state.\\" \\"The meaningful issue of identity is whether this > activity, or any of my activities can stand for me, or be regarded as proper > indications of my being. I have done a theft, been signified a thief. am I a > thief? To answer affirmatively, we must be able to conceive a special > relationship between being and doing‚Äîa unity capable of being indicated. > That building of meaning has a notable quality.\\"  The \\"criminal\\"  As an application of phenomenology, the theory hypothesizes that the labels applied to individuals influence their behavior, particularly the application of negative or stigmatizing labels (such as \\"criminal\\" or \\"felon\\") promote deviant behavior, becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy, i.e. an individual who is labeled has little choice but to conform to the essential meaning of that judgment. Consequently, labeling theory postulates that it is possible to prevent social deviance via a limited social shaming reaction in \\"labelers\\" and replacing moral indignation with tolerance. Emphasis is placed on the rehabilitation of offenders through an alteration of their labels. Related prevention policies include client empowerment schemes, mediation and conciliation, victim-offender forgiveness ceremonies (restorative justice), restitution, reparation, and alternatives to prison programs involving diversion. Labeling theory has been accused of promoting impractical policy implications, and criticized for failing to explain society's most serious offenses.Vito, Gennaro F., Jeffery R. Maahs, and Ronald M. Holmes. 2006. Criminology: Theory, Research And Policy (2nd ed.). Sudbury: Jones & Bartlett. Some offenses, including the use of violence, are universally recognized as wrong. Hence, labeling either habitual criminals or those who have caused serious harm as \\"criminals\\" is not constructive. Society may use more specific labels such as \\"murderer\\" or \\"rapist\\" or \\"child abuser\\" to demonstrate more clearly after the event the extent of its disapproval, but there is a slightly mechanical determinism in asserting that the application of a label will invariably modify the behavior of the one labeled. Further, if one of the functions of the penal system is to reduce recidivism, applying a long-term label may cause prejudice against the offender, resulting in the inability to maintain employment and social relationships. The \\"mentally ill\\" The social construction of deviant behavior plays an important role in the labeling process that occurs in society. This process involves not only the labeling of criminally deviant behavior, which is behavior that does not fit socially constructed norms, but also labeling that which reflects stereotyped or stigmatized behavior of the \\"mentally ill\\". Labeling theory was first applied to the term \\"mentally ill\\" in 1966 when Thomas J. Scheff published Being Mentally Ill. Scheff challenged common perceptions of mental illness by claiming that mental illness is manifested solely as a result of societal influence. He argued that society views certain actions as deviant and, in order to come to terms with and understand these actions, often places the label of mental illness on those who exhibit them. Certain expectations are then placed on these individuals and, over time, they unconsciously change their behavior to fulfill them. Criteria for different mental illnesses are not consistently fulfilled by those who are diagnosed with them because all of these people suffer from the same disorder, they are simply fulfilled because the \\"mentally ill\\" believe they are supposed to act a certain way so, over time, come to do so.Scheff, Thomas J. 1984. Being Mentally Ill (2nd ed.). Piscataway: Aldine Transaction. Scheff's theory had many critics, most notably Walter Gove who consistently argued against Scheff with an almost opposite theory; he believed that society has no influence at all on \\"mental illness\\". Instead, any societal perceptions of the \\"mentally ill\\" come about as a direct result of these people's behaviors. Most sociologists' views of labeling and mental illness have fallen somewhere between the extremes of Gove and Scheff. On the other hand, it is almost impossible to deny, given both common sense and research findings, that society's negative perceptions of \\"crazy\\" people has had some effect on them. It seems that, realistically, labeling can accentuate and prolong the issues termed \\"mental illness\\", but it is rarely the full cause.Gove, Walter R. (1975). Labelling of Deviance: Evaluating a Perspective. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons Inc. Many other studies have been conducted in this general vein. To provide a few examples, several studies have indicated that most people associate being labeled mentally ill as being just as, or even more, stigmatizing than being seen as a drug addict, ex- convict, or prostitute (for example: Brand & Claiborn 1976). Additionally, Page's 1977 study found that self declared \\"ex-mental patients\\" are much less likely to be offered apartment leases or hired for jobs. Clearly, these studies and the dozens of others like them serve to demonstrate that labeling can have a very real and very large effect on the mentally ill. However, labeling has not been proven to be the sole cause of any symptoms of mental illness. Peggy Thoits (1999) discusses the process of labeling someone with a mental illness in her article, \\"Sociological Approaches to Mental Illness\\". Working off Thomas Scheff's (1966) theory, Thoits claims that people who are labeled as mentally ill are stereotypically portrayed as unpredictable, dangerous, and unable to care for themselves. She also claims that \\"people who are labeled as deviant and treated as deviant become deviant.\\"Thoits, Peggy A. 1999. \\"Sociological approaches to mental illness.\\" Pp. 121‚Äì138 in A Handbook for the Study of Mental Health: Social Contexts, Theories, and Systems, edited by A. V. Horwitz & T. L. Scheid. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. . This statement can be broken down into two processes, one that involves the effects of self-labeling and the other differential treatment from society based on the individual's label. Therefore, if society sees mentally ill individuals as unpredictable, dangerous and reliant on others, then a person who may not actually be mentally ill but has been labeled as such, could become mentally ill. The label of \\"mentally ill\\" may help a person seek help, for example psychotherapy or medication. Labels, while they can be stigmatizing, can also lead those who bear them down the road to proper treatment and (hopefully) recovery. If one believes that \\"being mentally ill\\" is more than just believing one should fulfill a set of diagnostic criteria (as Scheff ‚Äì see above ‚Äì would argue), then one would probably also agree that there are some who are labeled \\"mentally ill\\" who need help. It has been claimed that this could not happen if \\"we\\" did not have a way to categorize (and therefore label) them, although there are actually plenty of approaches to these phenomena that don't use categorical classifications and diagnostic terms, for example spectrum or continuum models. Here, people vary along different dimensions, and everyone falls at different points on each dimension. Proponents of hard labeling, as opposed to soft labeling, believe that mental illness does not exist, but is merely deviance from norms of society, causing people to believe in mental illness. They view them as socially constructed illnesses and psychotic disorders.Link, Bruce G., and Jo C. Phelan. 1999. \\"The Labelling Theory of Mental Disorder (II): The Consequences of Labeling.\\" A Handbook for the Study of Mental Health: Social Contexts, Theories, and Systems. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. The \\"homosexual\\" The application of labeling theory to homosexuality has been extremely controversial. It was Alfred Kinsey and his colleagues who pointed out the big discrepancy between the behavior and the role attached to it.Kinsey, Alfred C., W. P. Pomeroy, C. E. Martin, and P. H. Gebhard. 1953. Sexual Behavior in the Human Female. Philadelphia: W. B. Saunders. They had observed the often negative consequences of labeling and repeatedly condemned labeling people as homosexual: > It is amazing to observe how many psychologists and psychiatrists have > accepted this sort of propaganda, and have come to believe that homosexual > males and females are discretely different from persons who respond to > natural stimuli. Instead of using these terms as substantives which stand > for persons, or even as adjectives to describe persons, they may better be > used to describe the nature of the overt sexual relations, or of the stimuli > to which an individual erotically responds.‚Ä¶ It would clarify our thinking > if the terms could be dropped completely out of our vocabulary. Males do not > represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual.‚Ä¶ Only the > human mind invents categories and tries to force facts into pigeonholes. The > living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects. The > classification of sexual behavior as masturbatory, heterosexual, or > homosexual, is, therefore, unfortunate if it suggests that only different > types of persons seek out or accept each kind of sexual activity. There is > nothing known in the anatomy or physiology of sexual response and orgasm > which distinguishes masturbatory, heterosexual, or homosexual reactions. In > regard to sexual behavior, it has been possible to maintain this dichotomy > only by placing all persons who are exclusively heterosexual in a > heterosexual category and all persons who have any amount of experience with > their own sex, even including those with the slightest experience, in a > homosexual category.‚Ä¶ The attempt to maintain a simple dichotomy on these > matters exposes the traditional biases which are likely to enter whenever > the heterosexual or homosexual classification of an individual is involved. Erving Goffman's Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity distinguished between the behavior and the role assigned to it: > The term \\"homosexual\\" is generally used to refer to anyone who engages in > overt sexual practices with a member of his own sex, the practice being > called \\"homosexuality.\\" This usage appears to be based on a medical and > legal frame of reference and provides much too broad and heterogenous a > categorization for use here. I refer only to individuals who participate in > a special community of understanding wherein members of one's own sex are > defined as the most desirable sexual objects, and sociability is > energetically organized around the pursuit and entertainment of these > objects. Labeling theory was also applied to homosexuality by Evelyn HookerHooker, Evelyn. 1956. \\"A Preliminary Analysis of Group Behavior of Homosexuals.\\" Journal of Psychology 42(2): 217‚Äì25. .Hooker, Evelyn. 1958. \\"Male Homosexuality in the Rorschach.\\" Journal of Projective Techniques 22(1): 33‚Äì54. . .Hooker, Evelyn. 1967. Final Report of the Task Force on Homosexuality. Washington, D.C.: National Institute of Mental Health. and by Leznoff and Westley (1956), who published the first sociological study of the gay community.Leznoff, M., and W. A. Westley. 1956. \\"The Homosexual Community.\\" Social Problems 3(4): 257‚Äì63. . . Erving Goffman and Howard Becker used the lives of gay-identified persons in their theories of labeling and interactionism. Simon and Gagnon likewise wrote: \\"It is necessary to move away from the obsessive concern with the sexuality of the individual, and attempt to see the homosexual in terms of the broader attachments that he must make to live in the world around him.\\"Simon, W., and J. H. Gagnon. 1967. \\"Homosexuality: The Formulation of a Psychological Perspective.\\" Journal of Health and Social Behavior 8(3): 177‚Äì85. . . . British sociologist Mary McIntosh reflected the enthusiasm of Europeans for labeling theory in her 1968 study, \\"The Homosexual Role:\\"McIntosh, Mary. 1968. \\"The Homosexual Role.\\" Social Problems 16(2):182‚Äì92. . . > \\"The vantage-point of comparative sociology enables us to see that the > conception of homosexuality as a condition is, itself, a possible object of > study.

The deviancy can thus be seen as legitimate for him and he can > continue in it without rejecting the norm of society.\\" Sara Fein and Elaine M. Nuehring (1981) were among the many who supported the application of labeling theory to homosexuality. They saw the gay role functioning as a \\"master status\\" around which other roles become organized. This brings a whole new set of problems and restrictions: > Placement in a social category constituting a master status prohibits > individuals from choosing the extent of their involvement in various > categories. Members of the stigmatized group lose the opportunity to > establish their own personal system of evaluation and group membership as > well as the ability to arrive at their own ranking of each personal > characteristic.‚Ä¶ For example, newly self-acknowledged homosexual individuals > cannot take for granted that they share the world with others who hold > congruent interpretations and assumptions; their behavior and motives, both > past and present, will be interpreted in light of their stigma.Fein, Sara, > and Elain M. Nuehring. 1981. \\"Intrapsychic Effects of Stigma: a process of > Breakdown and Reconstruction of Social Reality.\\" Journal of Homosexuality > 7(1):4‚Äì6. . Perhaps the strongest proponent of labeling theory was Edward Sagarin. In his book, Deviants and Deviance, he wrote, \\"There are no homosexuals, transvestites, chemical addicts, suicidogenics, delinquents, criminals, or other such entities, in the sense of people having such identities.\\"Sagarin, Edward. 1975. Deviants and Deviance. New York: Praeger. Sagarin's position was roundly condemned by academics in the gay community. Sagarin had written some gay novels under the pseudonym of Donald Webster Cory. According to reports, he later abandoned his gay identity and began promoting an interactionist view of homosexuality.DuBay, W. 1967. Gay Identity: The Self Under Ban. Jefferson, NC: McFarland. A number of authors adopted a modified, non-deviant, labeling theory. They rejected the stigmatic function of the gay role, but found it useful in describing the process of coming out and reconciling one's homosexual experiences with the social role.

Barry Adam (1976) took those authors to task for ignoring the force of the oppression in creating identities and their inferiorizing effects. Drawing upon the works of Albert Memmi, Adam showed how gay-identified persons, like Jews and blacks, internalize the hatred to justify their limitations of life choices. He saw the gravitation towards ghettos was evidence of the self-limitations: > A certain romantic liberalism runs through the literature, evident from > attempts to paper over or discount the very real problems of > inferiorization. Some researchers seem bent on 'rescuing' their subjects > from 'defamation' by ignoring the problems of defeatism and complicit self- > destruction. Avoidance of dispiriting reflection upon the day-to-day > practice of dominated people appears to spring from a desire to 'enhance' > the reputation of the dominated and magically relieve their plight. Careful > observation has been sacrificed to the 'power of positive thinking.'Adam, > Barry. 1978. The Survival of Domination. New York: Elsevier. Strong defense of labeling theory also arose within the gay community. Dan Slater of the Los Angeles Homosexual Information Center said, \\"There is no such thing as a homosexual lifestyle. There is no such thing as gay pride or anything like that. Homosexuality is simply based on the sex act. Gay consciousness and all the rest are separatist and defeatist attitudes going back to centuries-old and out-moded conceptions that homosexuals are, indeed, different from other people.\\"Leopold, A. 1975. \\"The Angry Men; Broadsides from the H. I. C.\\" In Touch. p. 26. In a later article, Slater (1971) stated the gay movement was going in the wrong direction: > Is it the purpose of the movement to try to assert sexual rights for > everyone or create a political and social cult out of homosexuality? > ‚Ä¶Persons who perform homosexual acts or other non-conforming acts are > sexually free. They want others enlightened. They want hostile laws changed, > but they resent the attempt to organize their lives around homosexuality > just as much as they resent the centuries-old attempt to organize their > lives around heterosexuality.Slater, Don. 1971. Vectors 8 (7):28‚Äì9. William DuBay (1967) describes gay identity as one strategy for dealing with society's oppression. It solves some problems but creates many more, replacing a closet of secrecy with one of gay identity. A better strategy, he suggests, is to reject the label and live as if the oppression did not exist. Quoting Goffman, he writes, \\"But of course what is a good adjustment for the individual can be an even better one for society.\\" DuBay contends that the attempt to define homosexuality as a class of persons to be protected against discrimination as defined in the statutes has not reduced the oppression. The goal of the movement instead should be to gain acceptance of homosexual relationships as useful and productive for both society and the family. The movement has lost the high moral ground by sponsoring the \\"flight from choice\\" and not taking up the moral issues. \\"Persons whom we confine to back rooms and bars other societies have honored as tenders of children, astrologers, dancers, chanters, minstrels, jesters, artists, shamans, sacred warriors and judges, seers, healers, weavers of tales and magic.\\" DuBay refers to the \\"gay trajectory,\\" in which a person first wraps himself in the gay role, organizing his personality and his life around sexual behavior. He might flee from his family and home town to a large gay center. There, the bedeviling force of the stigma will introduce him to more excessive modes of deviance such as promiscuity, prostitution, alcoholism, and drugs. Many resist such temptations and try to normalize their life, but the fast lanes of gay society are littered with the casualties of gay identity. Some come to reject the label entirely. \\"Accomplishing the forbidden, they are neither gay nor straight. Again learning to choose, they develop the ability to make the ban ambiguous, taking responsibility and refusing explanations of their behaviors.\\" John Henry Mackay (1985) writes about a gay hustler in Berlin adopting such a solution: \\"What was self-evident, natural, and not the least sick did not require an excuse through an explanation.‚Ä¶ It was love just like any other love. Whoever could not or would not accept it as love was mistaken.\\"Mackay, John Henry. 1985. The Hustler. Boston: Alyson Publications. There are those who reject the \\"gay label\\" for reasons other than shame or negative connotations. They do not reject their homosexuality. It is \\"gay\\" as an adjective they reject. Writer Alan Bennett and fashion icon Andr√© Leon Talley reject being labeled as a gay writer, a gay fashion designer. These men are openly gay, but believe when gay is used as an adjective, the label confines them. Modified labeling theory Bruce Link and colleagues (1989) had conducted several studies which point to the influence that labeling can have on mental patients.Link, Bruce G., Francis T. Cullen, Elmer Struening, Patrick E. Shrout, and Bruce P. Dohrenwend. 1989. \\"A modified labeling theory approach to mental disorders: An empirical assessment.\\" American Sociological Review 54(3):400‚Äì23. . . Through these studies, taking place in 1987, 1989, and 1997, Link advanced a \\"modified labeling theory\\" indicating that expectations of labeling can have a large negative effect, that these expectations often cause patients to withdraw from society, and that those labeled as having a mental disorder are constantly being rejected from society in seemingly minor ways but that, when taken as a whole, all of these small slights can drastically alter their self concepts. They come to both anticipate and perceive negative societal reactions to them, and this potentially damages their quality of life. Modified labeling theory has been described as a \\"sophisticated social- psychological model of 'why labels matter. In 2000, results from a prospective two-year study of patients discharged from a mental hospital (in the context of deinstitutionalization) showed that stigma was a powerful and persistent force in their lives, and that experiences of social rejection were a persistent source of social stress. Efforts to cope with labels, such as not telling anyone, educating people about mental distress/disorder, withdrawing from stigmatizing situations, could result in further social isolation and reinforce negative self-concepts. Sometimes an identity as a low self-esteem minority in society would be accepted. The stigma was associated with diminished motivation and ability to \\"make it in mainstream society\\" and with \\"a state of social and psychological vulnerability to prolonged and recurrent problems\\". There was an up and down pattern in self-esteem, however, and it was suggested that, rather than simply gradual erosion of self-worth and increasing self-deprecating tendencies, people were sometimes managing, but struggling, to maintain consistent feelings of self-worth. Ultimately, \\"a cadre of patients had developed an entrenched, negative view of themselves, and their experiences of rejection appear to be a key element in the construction of these self-related feelings\\" and \\"hostile neighbourhoods may not only affect their self-concept but may also ultimately impact the patient's mental health status and how successful they are.\\"Wright, E. R., W. P. Gronfein, and T. J. Owens. 2000. \\"Deinstitutionalization, social rejection, and the self-esteem of former mental patients.\\" Journal of Health and Social Behavior 41(1):68‚Äì90. . . .

She was ordered by the Chamber of Commerce of Stettin (until 1945 Germany, since 1945 Szczecin, Poland). The economy of the city of Stettin strongly depended on the free access of ships to and from the Baltic Sea. Therefore, icebreakers were used to keep the shipping channels free from ice during the winter. For the first time in Germany, the construction was characterized by a new bow design called Runeberg-bow. This new bow design broke the ice using a novel method. It was not broken by the weight of the ship but by a sharp cutting edge. Future development of icebreakers was influenced by this bow form. Stettin in Rostock harbour Although diesel- engines were already in wide use by 1933, Stettin was equipped with a steam piston engine. Unlike diesel engines, steam piston engines can be reversed within a very short period of approximately 3 to 4 seconds. This was important during manoeuvres of the ship under icey conditions in order to liberate the ship if it were to get stuck. With the special hull design and an engine power with a maximum horsepower of 2200, measured at the cylinders, Stettin was able to break ice up to a thickness of half a meter, at a constant speed of one to two knots. Thicker ice could only be broken by boxing, a process in which the ship ran several attacks until the ice gave way. The icebreakers of Stettin were handled by the shipping company Braeunlich, which ran a seaside resort ferry service along the coast during the summer. Its other ships had similar engines, so a single technical staff could be employed year round. Stettin was run by a crew of 22 men. This system was in place until the end of World War II. From 1933 to 1945, Stettin was used in German Navy (Kriegsmarine) service on the Oder River between Stettin and Swinem√ºnde (≈öwinouj≈õcie), as well as on the Baltic Sea. On the night of 8 April 1940, Stettin participated in the capture of Copenhagen by participating in a surprise landing of German troops in Copenhagen together with the railway ferry/minelayer Hansestadt Danzig. Stettin is also one of two or three surviving vessels of the east Prussia evacuation fleet. From 1945 on, she was used by the waterway and navigation authorities in Hamburg on the river Elbe. In 1981, Stettin was slated to be scrapped due to uneconomic costs. However, with the establishment of a development association, thousands of working hours, and support by generous sponsors, the ship was saved. Today, she is a technical culture monument. Her homeport is the museum port of Oevelgoenne in Hamburg, Germany. During summertime, Stettin cruises with guests on occasions like \\"Hamburg port birthday,\\" \\"Hansesail Rostock,\\" and \\"Kieler Woche,\\" and is also used as a charter vessel.

As an active member of the Lithuanian National Revival, he wrote for and edited many Lithuanian publications and joined the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party. As his views turned from socialism to communism, he became one of the founders and leaders of the Lithuanian Communist Party and headed the short-lived Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and Lithuanian‚ÄìBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Litbel) in 1918‚Äì19. After the failure of these republics, Mickeviƒçius left for Soviet Russia, where he continued to lead Lithuanian communists and worked for the Communist International (Comintern). Biography =Early life and education= Mickeviƒçius was born in 1880 in the village of Wy≈Çkowyszki, Wy≈Çkowyszki district, to a Lithuanian family of wealthy farmers. Suvalkija was then part of Congress Poland, a client state of the Russian Empire. Following the January Uprising of 1863, the tsarist government imposed Lithuanian press ban which outlawed materials printed in the Lithuanian language. Vincas's father Simonas and elder brother Juozas were Lithuanian patriots. His uncle Antanas Mickeviƒçius was daraktorius, a founder of and a teacher at underground Lithuanian schools. Vincas Mickeviƒçius was early exposed to old illegal issues of Auszra monthly magazine hidden at their home. Around 1888‚Äì1892 he was tutored at home and attended a Lithuanian school run by his uncle. From 1892 to 1897, Mickeviƒçius studied at Marijampolƒó Gymnasium. In 1895, he became an active participant in the Lithuanian National Revival when his brother Juozas introduced him to the secret book smuggling society Sietynas, a group that printed Lithuanian books and periodicals in East Prussia, smuggled them and disseminated in Lithuania. After graduating from the Gymnasium in 1897, Mickeviƒçius enrolled at the Sejny Priest Seminary, but was expelled after a year for his illegal political activities. He was a member of the secret Lithuanian Clerical Society and participated in the dissemination of illegal Lithuanian press. Around 1898‚Äì1899, Mickeviƒçius tutored at Sakalai, a Lithuanian school run by Povilas Vi≈°inskis. Since 1888, he was active Varpininkas ‚Äì a member of the patriotic organization, named after Varpas newspaper, aimed at raising Lithuanian consciousness, promoting education, Lithuanian language and culture. Mickeviƒçius was contributing to Varpas and ≈™kininkas. Mickeviƒçius chose his pen name Kapsukas, a diminutive version of Vincas Kapsas, one of the pen names of Vincas Kudirka, founder of Varpas. In 1900, Mickeviƒçius was admitted to Jelgava Gymnasium. In 1901 he was expelled for storing illegal Lithuanian press and belonging to yet another Lithuanian book smuggling society K≈´dikis. Secret police search at his home produced a large amount of illegal Lithuanian literature. Mickeviƒçius was indicted in political case for anti-tsarist activities. To avoid arrest, he escaped via East Prussia to Switzerland. Vincas Mickeviƒçius-Kapsukas in Jelgava Gymnasium in 1901. =Social democrat and imprisonment= From 1901 to 1903, Mickeviƒçius studied philosophy, sociology and political economy at University of Bern in Switzerland. Around the same time (1902‚Äì1903) he became a co-editor of Varpas and the editor of ≈™kininkas in Tilsit. During his stay in Tilsit, Mickeviƒçius gained access to the Printing House archives and published historic materials from the Auszra days and materials pertaining to the founding of Varpas. In 1902, the Varpininkai Congress founded the Lithuanian Democratic Party (LDP). Mickeviƒçius became one of its first members. By 1903, Mickeviƒçius felt that the LDP did not go far enough in its political goals. The LDP sought autonomy within Russia as opposed to full independence. They also did not adequately address social issues. In 1903 he left the LDP and joined the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party (LSDP). Mickeviƒçius was not willing to sever his ties with the Varpininkai, however, and clashed with LSDP leadership (Augustinas Janulaitis), who did not want to cooperate with the Varpininkai. To bridge the gap between the LSDP and the Varpininkai he founded the social-patriotic organization Draugas in 1904, although he still technically remained a member of the LSDP. After prolonged negotiations, in 1905 Draugas merged with the LSDP and Mickeviƒçius was elected a member of the Central Committee of the LSDP. He at that time belonged to the federalist wing of the LSDP, which promoted the idea of an independent Lithuania in a federation with Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and Latvia (former territories of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth). Russia was not part of their designs. The federalists fought with the autonomist wing of the LSDP, who promoted Lithuanian autonomy within Russia. Around the same time (1904‚Äì1906), Mickeviƒçius founded and edited magazines Draugas and Darbininkas. From 1906 to 1907 he also contributed to and edited Naujoji Gadynƒó and Skardas. During the Revolution of 1905, Mickeviƒçius organized anti-tsarist peasant demonstrations and strikes in Suvalkija and northern Lithuania. Mickeviƒçius was briefly detained by authorities but, with no evidence against him, he managed to talk his way out. In December 1905, he was arrested under the name of J. Jaks-Tyris and convicted of revolutionary activities, but managed to escape from a prison hospital in Suwa≈Çki in 1906. He was arrested again in May 1907 and sentenced to 3 years for anti-tsarist activities. Among his defenders in the Suwa≈Çki court were attorneys Alexander Kerensky, who, after the 1917 February revolution, was the head of Russian government, and M. F. Volkenstein, who employed V. Ulyanov (Lenin) back in 1893. In 1909, after authorities discovered that Mickeviƒçius was the same person who escaped from prison in 1906, he was sentenced to an additional 8 years of katorga. He did his time in the Vilnius, Suwa≈Çki, Warsaw, and Vladimir Prisons until 1913. In 1913, to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the Romanov Dynasty, Tsar Nicholas II decreed the amnesty for certain non-violent prisoners. Mickeviƒçius, as a political prisoner of non-violent nature, was released from prison and exiled to the Yenisei region in Siberia. In December 1913, Mickeviƒçius escaped from the exile with fake documents. For several weeks in early 1914 he was in hiding in Latvia and Lithuania (count Nikolai Zubov offered him a hiding place in his Medemrodƒó estate, now in Agluonai village). There he prepared for his emigration and was authorized by Mykolas Bir≈æi≈°ka to act abroad on behalf of the LSDP. With the help of local activists, Mickeviƒçius crossed the border to Prussia and traveled to Austria with fake documents. In 1914 in Krak√≥w, then part of the Austrian Grand Duchy of Cracow, he met Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. In 1914 Mickeviƒçius became a member of Vilnis editorial staff. He stayed in Krak√≥w until the beginning of the World War I and then emigrated through Switzerland to Great Britain. From 1914 to 1916, he lived in Great Britain. Mickeviƒçius headed the LSDP chapter in Scotland. In 1915‚Äì1916, he edited Socialdemokratas and Rankpelnis in Bellshill, Scotland. In 1916, he left Great Britain for the United States where he lived until 1917. He joined the American Lithuanian Socialist Union (ALSU) and took over management of all major left press. He edited left wing science and literature monthly magazine Naujoji Gadynƒó in Philadelphia and newspaper Kova. =Communist revolutionary= In 1917, after the Russian February Revolution, Mickeviƒçius was no longer a fugitive. He arrived from the United States to Petrograd (presently Saint Petersburg) and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Bolshevik) (RSDLP(b)). In 1917, he became the editor of Lithuanian socialist (later communist) newspaper Tiesa. In August 1917, he participated in the 6th congress of RSDLP(b) in Petrograd and supported the creation of the Communist International (Comintern). After the 1917 Russian October Revolution, Mickeviƒçius served as the Commissar of the Soviet government for Lithuanian affairs and was a member of the Central Bureau of the Lithuanian Sections under the Central Committee of the RSDLP(b) and then of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (RCP(b)). In late 1918, Mickeviƒçius returned to Lithuania (then still occupied by Germany; see Ober Ost) to head the socialist revolution there. Lithuania was contested by many forces: the German occupation was still in place, the Council of Lithuania proclaimed independence on February 16, 1918, the Polish government was in favor of a Polish‚ÄìLithuanian federation (in the spirit of the former Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth). The socialist forces (LSDP, social democratic labor party, Jewish Bund, social democrats-revolutionaries etc.) were actively organizing in Vilnius and other Lithuanian towns. In early October, the founding congress of the Lithuanian Communist Party took place in Vilnius. In December, elections were held for the Vilnius Soviet of Workers' Deputies electing 96 communists and their non-affiliated sympathizers, 60 Bund members, 22 Mensheviks and 15 LSDP members (social democrats). On 8 December 1918 the Vilnius Soviet formed the Provisional Revolutionary Workers' and Peasants' Government of Lithuania. Mickeviƒçius was elected the Chairman of the new government (Prime Minister) and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. On 16 December 1918 the Mickeviƒçius government issued a manifesto, in which they dismissed German occupational administration and proclaimed the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. German occupying forces were still stationed in Vilnius but started leaving in late December 1918, while the Red Army moved westward trying to regain lands given up by the Brest-Litovsk Treaty. On 2 January 1919 the Polish Committee forces (Samoobrona) took control over Vilnius. The Council of Lithuania withdrew to Kaunas the same day. The Red Army entered Vilnius on 5 January and the Mickeviƒçius government reestablished its control. On 27 February 1919 the Lithuanian SSR and Belarusian SSR were merged and the Lithuanian‚ÄìBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Litbel) was formed. Mickeviƒçius served as the Chairman and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Litbel government. Polish military offensive of 1919 against the Red Army was pushing into the territory of Litbel, while newly established Lithuanian Army was taking control of central and western Lithuania. The support for Mickeviƒçius' government mostly came from the city proletariat and farm laborers. Lithuanian farmers mostly supported the Council of Lithuania, who promised land to those who cultivate it. In an agrarian country, as Lithuania was at that time, farmers' support was essential. Understanding his limited support base, Mickeviƒçius resisted Lenin's demands to recruit more Lithuanians to the Red Army and reported to Lenin that such an effort would be counter- productive and would reduce Lithuanian support for his government. By August 1919 almost entire Litbel territory was under occupation. In July 1920, the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Peace Treaty was concluded, and the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic ceased to exist. =Later life= From late 1921 until the end of his life in 1935, Mickeviƒçius lived in Moscow. He was a delegate to the Second through Sixth Congresses of the Comintern. Working on the Executive Committee of the Comintern from 1923 to 1935, he became a candidate member of the Executive Committee of the Comintern in 1924 and a member in 1928. Kapsukas was a delegate to the Eleventh, Twelfth, and Fourteenth through Seventeenth RCP(b) Congresses. He was elected a candidate member of the Central Committee of the RCP(b) at the Eighth Congress (1919). From 1921 until 1935, Mickeviƒçius was on the editorial board of Lithuanian communist periodicals Tiesa, Kibirkstis, Balsas, Komunaras, and Komunistas. Kapsukas died on 17 February 1935 in a hospital in Moscow. The official report listed the cause of death as the complications from tuberculosis. His wife, Elena Domicƒólƒó Tautkaitƒó, was executed in 1937 for \\"Trotskyist activities\\" and their three children were adopted and taken home by their maternal aunt. Political views and personality Mickeviƒçius is a case study of gradual drift from social-patriotic nationalist to Marxist internationalist. His early views were greatly influenced by his patriotic family and by the Lithuanian National Revival. The leaders of this movement came mostly from emancipated peasants. Their Lithuanian origin and relatively weak Polonization were responsible for the nationalist character of this movement, while their peasant roots shaped the social program. Many social ideas were carried over from the January Uprising of 1863. Therefore, many future social democrats belonged to the Lithuanian National Revival. Vincas Kudirka was a member of the Proletariat Party and was arrested when he was helping re-print Marx's Das Kapital, and Mickeviƒçius called himself a social-patriot. During the 1905 revolution, Mickeviƒçius dedicated all his energy to fighting for free Lithuania. He already saw the freedom of Lithuania through the glasses of social justice. To him social justice, human dignity and individual freedom were more important than national independence. According to writer O. Pleirytƒó-Puidienƒó, a witness of the 1905 revolution, \\"Kapsukas was literally a martyr of the idea of social democracy and [free] Lithuania. Always breathless, hungry, without real shelter he travelled across Lithuania spreading national awareness and enlightenment. Of course, social democratic voices mattered to him most, but he also passionately loved his Lithuania. (Lith. Kapsukas buvo staƒçiai socialdemokrat≈≥ partijos ir lietuvi≈≥ idƒójos kankinys. Visuomet u≈ædusƒôs, alkanas, be tikros pastogƒós slankiojo jis po LietuvƒÖ ne≈°iodamas tautinƒØ supratimƒÖ ir ≈°viesƒÖ. Be abejo socialdemokrat≈≥ balsai jam rupejo labiausiai, bet ir savo LietuvƒÖ jis mylƒójo kar≈°tai).\\" During his prison years (1907‚Äì1914), Mickeviƒçius read works of Marx, Kautsky, Plekhanov and other Marxists and his views drifted profoundly toward Marxism. Later in exile and emigration, he met Yakov Sverdlov, Vladimir Lenin, Nikolai Bukharin and Leon Trotsky who also influenced his views. By 1918 he considered himself a Marxist. However, until his last days Mickeviƒçius venerated his mentor Vincas Kudirka and retained deep respect for Povilas Vi≈°inskis. According to Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas, Bolsheviks knew that for him Lithuania mattered more than narrow party directives: ‚ÄùThe same [attitude] could be noticed through his entire communist activities in Vilnius: he cared about Lithuania not in a communist way. Everybody felt that, even his fellow bolsheviks. (Lith. Ta pat galƒójai pasergƒóti per visƒÖ jo komunisti≈°kƒÖ veikimƒÖ Vilniuje: jam Lietuva ne komunisti≈°kai r≈´pƒójo. Tai visi jautƒó, net jo sƒóbrai bol≈°evikai).‚Äù Postage stamp of the USSR with a portrait of Vincas Mickeviƒçius-Kapsukas Personal life His father, Simonas (Simas) Mickeviƒçius (1830‚Äì1915) was a wealthy farmer. From his first marriage to Barbora Kriauƒçi≈´naitƒó (~1840‚Äì1870), Simonas had daughter Konstancija Mickeviƒçi≈´tƒó. With Ona Kur≈°ƒónaitƒó (~1850‚Äì1934), his second wife, Simonas had two sons: Juozapas (1872‚Äì1950) and Vincas. Vincas Mickeviƒçius married Vanda Did≈æiulytƒó (1881‚Äì1941) in 1901 in Mintauja (now Jelgava, Latvia). They divorced in 1913 after the death of their daughter Vanda in 1913. He married Elena Domicƒólƒó Tautkaitƒó (1893‚Äì1937) in 1922 in Moscow, Russia. They had three children: J≈´ra Mickeviƒçi≈´tƒó (1921‚Äì2008), Vincas Mickeviƒçius (1925‚Äì2014) and Lena Mickeviƒçi≈´tƒó (1927‚Äì2001). Legacy Vincas Mickeviƒçius-Kapsukas was the author of more than 50 works on politics, history, philosophy, and literature and around 2000 articles. He also wrote memoirs, essays, and short stories. Between 1937 and 1953, Mickeviƒçius was on Stalin's \\"gray list,\\" not officially an \\"enemy of state,\\" but not to be mentioned in public. After Stalin's death in 1953, the communist government of Lithuania, especially the first secretary of the Lithuanian Communist Party, Antanas Snieƒçkus, started reviving the memory of Mickeviƒçius. Gradually, the commemoration of Mickeviƒçius' legacy grew to the point of idolization. Streets, squares, museums and ships were named after him, and several monuments were erected. =Named after Vincas Mickeviƒçius-Kapsukas= * 1955‚Äì1989: Marijampolƒó city and region * 1956‚Äì1989: Vilnius University * 1964‚Äì1989: Award of the Lithuanian Journalists Union Bibliography * Lietuvos bur≈æuazijos stiprƒójimas ir jos reikal≈≥ rei≈°kƒójai, 1914 * J.

History =Early history= Hazel Grove is made up of three separate townships: Norbury, Torkington and Bosden-cum-Handforth. Norbury (Nordberie) was mentioned in the Domesday Survey in 1086.http://www.domesdaybook.co.uk/cheshire2.html Each of the townships were manorial lands. Until the 17th century, the area was known exclusively by each of the respective townships. In 1560, Richard Bullock built a smithy on the corner of what is now Torkington Park. This building later became the Bullock Smithy Inn and gradually the whole area became known as Bullock Smithy. The Bull's Head pub and Bullock Smithy Inn at the Hazel Grove tram terminus around 1900 =Non-conformists= There were no churches in the area until the end of the 16th century. The church consisted of a very basic chapel, without communion. It was a favoured hotbed of the north-east Cheshire Non-conformist movement. After the Restoration in 1662, it was forbidden for ministers to preach without the Book of Common Prayer. The minister of Norbury Chapel, John Jolie, went to preach, but found that the door was locked. He and his followers broke down the door and he preached as usual. Subsequently, he was tried for Non-conformity, but it was decided that Norbury Chapel was not a consecrated place. In 1750, John Wesley preached in Bullock Smithy describing it as \\"... one of the most famous villages in the county for all manner of wickedness.\\" =Religion= London Road, Hazel Grove around 1900 By 1833, the village had grown to over 3,000 people and it was decided the area should have its own parish. In July 1834, the Church of St Thomas was consecrated at Norbury. =Name change= The village elders began to tire of the jokes surrounding the name Bullock Smithy. The Manchester Guardian had carried a humorous story about an auctioneer trying to sell a rare book. No bidders were coming forward, so in an act of encouragement he told the crowd \\"Come on, where's tha al from? Bullock Smithy? Because tha don't know a book from a brick.\\" In 1835, it was decided that the village would be known as Hazel Grove. The name Hazel Grove had been used in the village previously. An area called Hassel Grave near High Lane appears on a map of 1674 and an area near Poise Brook was locally known as Hazel Grove. The present Grove Inn had been called the Hazel Grove Inn since it opened; however, on 26 September 1836, the name was officially changed. Civic Hall at Hazel Grove Governance The village was part of the civil parish of Norbury, which was included in the Stockport Rural District of Cheshire from 1894 to 1900. From 1900 to 1974, Hazel Grove was part of the Hazel Grove and Bramhall civil parish and urban district. Hazel Grove and Bramhall civil parish was abolished in 1974 and its former area was transferred to Greater Manchester to form part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport. Though the constituency of Hazel Grove is named after it, the western part of the village actually lies in the Cheadle constituency. Its current MP is William Wragg of the Conservatives. Transport Notable features of Hazel Grove include the A6 road, a major thoroughfare running from Luton to Carlisle, which passes through the centre of the area. There have been many attempts and plans to build a by-pass for the large amount of heavy traffic which uses the A6 on its way into and around Stockport and south Manchester and, in early 2015, the plans for the by-pass were finalised and put into effect. The by-pass was completed in October 2018. Hazel Grove is the southern terminus for the 192 bus route, which runs along the A6 to Manchester via Stockport. The suburb is served by Hazel Grove railway station, which is on the Hope Valley and Buxton lines from Stockport. Hazel Grove (Midland) was situated between the railway overbridges at the south end of the town and was only open from 1902 until 1917. The local tram services to Stockport, Reddish and Manchester terminated near Norbury Church and the Rising Sun pub until about 1950, when they were replaced by buses and the cobbles on the A6 were covered by tarmac. At the start of the operation of the tram services, Hazel Grove residents were ‚Äì jokingly ‚Äì alleged to black- lead the tramlines early in the morning. Education Hazel Grove has a number of primary schools and Hazel Grove High School. The main primary schools in the area are: Hazel Grove Primary School, Torkington Primary School, Norbury Hall Primary School and Moorfield Primary School. There are two local Catholic primary schools: St Simon's and St Peter's. Economy London Road Most residents work outside the village. The village is also home to the UK Adidas headquarters, who have their main warehouse on the edge of Hazel Grove, and the nearby Stepping Hill Hospital which is the main maternity and A&E; hospital serving the Stockport and south Manchester areas. Mirlees, Bickerton and Day established a factory in October 1908, where diesel engines were manufactured for many years. Nexperia (formerly NXP, Philips, Mullard) have a semiconductor manufacturing plant (wafer Fab) off Bramhall Moor Lane in Hazel Grove. The site has been there for over 25 years and currently employs around 650 people. Before that, the site was at School Street, which has an interesting history. Before 1939, the site beside the Marcliff (later Warwick) cinema at the south end of the village had a garage and petrol station (opposite Jack Sharp's greyhound track), which was converted at the outbreak of war into an aircraft factory, occupying the entire triangle between Macclesfield Road and the two railway lines. This seemed also to have been extended behind the Norbury Church, in School Street. At the end of the war, prefabs were built. The Macclesfield Road site was taken over later for pharmaceuticals by British Schering. Eventually, G.E.C. started a transistor factory at the School St address. Both of these locations are now light industrial estates housing a number of small businesses, some still in the original buildings. Hazel Grove \\"High Street\\" (London Road) and its surrounding area is the largest district centre in Stockport Borough with a diverse range of small shops and larger supermarkets, public houses, restaurants and takeaways. Sport and recreation Speedway racing was staged at the Hazel Grove Greyhound Stadium in 1937, although details of the meetings are sketchy. Greyhound racing meetings were held every Saturday afternoon for many years, until the track was closed around 1960. In the 1970s, part of the site was made into an extension of the local football pitches on Torkington Park for amateur teams to use, until the site was sold and redeveloped; partly as a Carpetright store, partly as the Greyhound Industrial Estate. Hazel Grove has several recreational centres: Hazel Grove Sports Centre, in the grounds of Hazel Grove High School, Hazel Grove Pools and Target Fitness and Torkington Park which provides crown green bowling, tennis courts and football pitches. Hazel Grove Snooker Club, on Macclesfield Road, has been a notable centre of national snooker competitions since its establishment in November 1984. Being one of the largest snooker venues in the UK, the club has hosted a substantial number of WPBSA (later WSA) and ESPB competitions throughout the last three decades, leading to two confirmed and referee-verified 147 breaks at the club (Jason Prince in British Open Qualifier, 13 January 1999, and Nick Dyson in UK Tour Event 4, 2 March 1999). The club has also hosted major disability sports events, such as the WDBS Northern Classic 2019 for participants with learning and physical disabilities and the WDBS DS Active Workshop 2019 providing snooker training for players with Down's Syndrome. There is also a tennis and bowling club on Douglas Road and two cricket clubs, Hazel Grove CC and Norbury CC. The latter includes a lacrosse club and crown green bowling club, each with their own facilities. Hazel Grove Football Club was founded in 1957 and play their home games at Torkington Park. The club was taken over by new management in 2014 and plays in the Manchester Saturday Morning Football League. Norbury Athletic is a junior football club based opposite the high school on Jacksons Lane.

Her parents were John Totter, who was born in Slovenia with birth name Janez, and Ida Mae Totter. Her father was of Austro-Slovenian descent and her mother was Swedish American. She had two brothers, Folger and George, and a sister, Collette. Totter graduated from Joliet High School, where she acted in school plays. According to Totter, she was a Methodist who also began her career performing in several productions for her local church as well as being involved with the YWCA players.An Interview With Audrey Totter, Skip E. Lowe, 1989 Career =Radio= Totter began her acting career in radio in the latter 1930s in Chicago, only 40 miles northeast of Joliet. She played in soap operas, including Painted Dreams, Road of Life, Ma Perkins, and Bright Horizon. =Film= Following success in Chicago and New York City, Totter was signed to a seven-year film contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She made her film debut in Main Street After Dark (1945) and established herself as a popular female lead in the 1940s. Although she performed in various film genres, she became most widely known to movie audiences for her work in film noir.

She reportedly was dissatisfied with her MGM career and agreed to appear in Any Number Can Play only after Clark Gable intervened. After leaving MGM, she worked for Columbia Pictures and 20th Century Fox, but the quality of her films dropped, and by the late 1950s, her film career was in decline, though she continued to work steadily for television. =Television= In 1954, Totter appeared in the pilot episode of the later 1957‚Äì58 detective series, Meet McGraw with Frank Lovejoy and in 1955, she appeared in an episode of Science Fiction Theatre entitled \\"Spider, Inc\\".

Later in 1958, Totter played boarding house owner Beth Purcell in another NBC Western series, Cimarron City. The episodes were supposed to have rotated among star George Montgomery as the mayor, John Smith as blacksmith/deputy sheriff Lane Temple, and Totter, but when the writers failed to feature her character, she left the series. In 1960, she was in an episode of Alfred Hitchcock presents: ‚Äú Madame Mystery‚Äù.

She was ordered from a shipyard in Finland in 1975. A fire broke out in her auxiliary generator compartment in 2007, putting her out of commission until April 2017. Background The ship was named after Juli√°n Ir√≠zar. In 1903, when he held the rank of Lieutenant, he commanded the Argentine corvette during a successful mission to rescue the Swedish Antarctic Expedition of Professor Otto Nordenskj√∂ld, after the expedition had been trapped by the Antarctic winter. The vessel was built at the W√§rtsil√§ Helsinki Shipyard in Finland, under a contract signed in 1975 between the Argentine Navy and the shipyard. Ir√≠zar was launched in February 1978 and was formally commissioned on December that year, arriving in Argentina on 23 March 1979. She replaced the elderly icebreaker , which was then retired from active service. Almirante Ir√≠zars peacetime missions include annual campaigns to resupply and rotate the personnel assigned to the Argentine Antarctic outposts, as well as conducting and supporting scientific endeavors in Antarctica. She has also conducted several passenger tours to Patagonia and the Antarctic. The ship's homeport is at the Argentine Navy's Buenos Aires Naval Anchorage () in the capital city of Buenos Aires. Service ARA Almirante Ir√≠zar docked at her homeport in Buenos Aires, Argentina. ARA Almirante Ir√≠zar as seen from above, showing hangars and landing deck. During the Falklands War () the vessel served as a troop transport and then as a hospital ship, a role for which her crew included medical personnel from the Argentine Army in addition to the naval medical staff. In April 1982, while operating north of the Falklands, the boilers of tanker ARA Punta M√©danos failed and she lost all propulsion; Almirante Ir√≠zar towed her back to Puerto Madryn (about 330 miles west) in rough weather, the trip took about 60 hours. Punta M√©danos couldn't be repaired, and was unable to continue operations during the war. After the end of the war, she was converted into a hospital ship. The ship gained attention in 2002, when she attempted to rescue the supply vessel Magdalena Oldendorff, which was trapped in pack ice off Antarctica. Even though Ir√≠zar failed to break Magdalena Oldendorff free, she managed to move it to a safer position and resupply the ship with food, medicine and medical personnel until the ice melted and Magdalena Oldendorff could return to open sea. =2004 incident= On 15/16 March 2004, the ship entered a maritime area designated as conservation zones under the jurisdiction of the Falkland Islands and issued demands for other ships to identify themselves. This prompted a protest from the British government to the Argentine government over its policing of seas under Falkland jurisdiction. The diplomatic note also re-asserted British sovereignty over the islands. =2007 fire= On 10 April 2007 at 22:00 UTC‚àí03:00, a massive fire broke out in the auxiliary generator compartment. By midnight, captain Guillermo Tarapow had ordered the evacuation. Argentine Navy and Argentine Coast Guard aircraft, including P-3 Orion and Hercules C-130 aircraft, operated to keep track of the 24 lifeboats. The 296 persons aboard the icebreaker ‚Äîincluding civilians of the Antarctic bases‚Äî were helped by the nearest ships, the Panamanian tanker Scarlet Ibis and a Uruguayan fishing vessel. The icebreaker was returning from its annual Antarctic summer campaign, and the incident took place some east of Puerto Madryn. The crew arrived safely in Puerto Madryn on 12 April. There were no casualties. The vessel's captain remained aboard alone for almost 24 hours after seeing his crew safely evacuated from the ship. Starting 11 April, destroyer , corvettes ARA Granville, and , avisos ARA Gurruchaga, , and , and Coast Guard , surrounded the icebreaker and began rescue operations. Buzos Tacticos and members of the Rescue Team () of the Argentine Navy boarded the ship and extinguished the fire. On 18 April, the ship started being towed to the Puerto Belgrano naval base. Irizar finally arrived to Puerto Belgrano on 20 April. The fire caused the loss of the two Sea King helicopters stored in their hangar, worth million each. These have been replaced by four Sea Kings transferred from the US government. Following this incident the British government offered to supply Argentine bases in Antarctica in support of scientific missions, using . This offer was turned down by the Argentine government, instead they leased the Russian icebreaking vessel Vasily Golovnin for the subsequent Antarctic summer campaigns at a cost of US$2m/month. The Dutch cargo vessel Timca was hired for the 2012/13 campaign. Vasily Golovnin would again carry out the following Antarctic campaign. = Upgrade = Tandanor shipyard in 2011. After a long period in Puerto Belgrano due to legal issues surrounding the incident, Ir√≠zar finally arrived in Buenos Aires on 3 September 2008 to be taken to Tandanor's shipyard for repairs. Repairs were expected to be completed in 2010 but continued into 2011, and were supervised by Norwegian shipyard Aker Yards. , the refit had thus far cost over million and the ship was not expected to be ready until late 2013. In , it was disclosed that the ship was still awaiting the necessary repairs and that sea trials had been delayed by a year, with oppositors claiming the money spent ‚Äîsome million plus another million in contracting supplying vessels‚Äî could have been used to buy a new ship; a month later, it was announced that work regarding control panels was still pending. The Tandanor shipyard repaired the fire damage and also reconfigured the vessel to increase laboratory space from up to . This allows the ship to be used primarily as a research vessel in addition to its role of resupplying the southernmost Antarctic base Belgrano II. The diesel engines have been replaced by four new ones purchased from MAN in October 2011. The main radar of Ir√≠zar was also repaired in Argentina by CITEDEF.La Armada Argentina solicit√≥ una cotizaci√≥n para la reparaci√≥n del radar del Ir√≠zar y √©sta fue de 5.5 millones de d√≥lares, mientras que el CITEDEF lo reparar√° por 1.3 millones de d√≥lares Work was initially estimated to be finished by November 2011, but it was not until April 2017 that the icebreaker was declared seaworthy again. On 4 July, Almirante Ir√≠zar sailed for open sea trials for the first time in ten years. After departing Buenos Aires, the vessel headed to a dry dock in the main base of Argentine Navy, Puerto Belgrano, where the icebreaker underwent tests and verifications prior to ice trials in the Antarctic and return to full service. On November 2017, the ship came back to Buenos Aires after successfully passing its \\"ice test\\", the last stage of its restoration work that left it ready for service again. It was confirmed that it will be present on the Antarctic 2018 campaign.El rompehielos Irizar lleg√≥ al puerto de Buenos Aires y formar√° parte de la campa√±a ant√°rtica Nuestromar.org.ar, 4 November 2017.

They are commonly referred to as the Lubicon Lake Nation, Lubicon Cree, or the Lubicon Lake Cree. This should not be confused with the Lubicon Lake Band #453, which is a separate entity created by the Government of Canada by Order in Council in 1973. Lands claim dispute The Nation has been embroiled with the Government of Canada regarding disputed land claims for decades. In 1899, a government party visited northern Alberta for the arranged large-scale surrender of the Lubicon lands.Darlene Arbeau Ferreira, \\"Oil and the Lubicons Don‚Äôt Mix: A Land Claim in Northern Alberta in Historical Perspective\\" in The Canadian Journal of Native Studies, vol. 12, no. 1, 1992, 2. However, many of the Lubicon people were never contacted and continued to live in their traditional ways, by hunting and gathering on the land. During the oil rush of the 1970s, the province of Alberta leased areas of the Lubicon lands for resource exploration and exploitation. The oil, gas, and lumber industry on Lubicon territory has caused damaging repercussions on the natural environment, the Lubicon culture, and people.Turner, Lisle. Our Land, My People: The Struggle of the Lubicon Cree. Amnesty International, 2008. Amnesty International has commented on the struggle of the Lubicon by issuing a report imploring the Canadian government to respect the land rights of the Lubicon. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has found Canada in violation of article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They have repeated their call for Canada to take immediate action to avoid irreparable damage. This call was first made by the UN Human Rights Committee in 1990 in a case known as Lubicon Lake Band v Canada, and was repeated in 2003 and 2006. The struggle has been described in a book, Last Stand of the Lubicon Cree, by John Goddard. Repeated attempts to gerrymander and politically overthrow Lubicon leadership, especially that led by internationally renowned Chief Bernard Ominayak, have been organized by the Government of Canada and the Province of Alberta, and documented by the Lubicon Lake Nation. Current chief and leadership issues The current Chief of the Muskotew Sakahikan Enowuk or Lubicon Lake Nation is Chief Bernard Ominayak. The Treaty 8 Nations of Alberta do not recognize the Nation as an Indian Band. Chief Bernard Ominayak has been the chief of the small First Nation since the 1970s. Prior to this, Chief Walter Whitehead served the Lubicon before stepping aside to allow Ominayak to run for the position. The Nation has 5 elected Councillors: Bryan Laboucan, Dwight Gladue, Cynthia Tomlinson, Dwight Sawan, and Larry Ominayak. Since the 1980s, the Government of Canada has capitalised on divisions and dissent within the Nation and has recognised groups of dissenting Lubicons as new First Nations, such as the Woodland Cree First Nation and the Loon River Cree Nation. More recent attempts include attempts by Billy Joe Laboucan to create the Little Buffalo Cree Band in 1999 and 2004 following a failed election bid to lead the Lubicon Lake Nation. Steven Noskey led a similar dissenting council created in 2009. The Lubicon Lake Nation Council continued to be led by Chief Bernard Ominayak, who was unanimously re-elected and asked to hold the position \\"Chief for Life\\" by motion of the entire Lubicon membership in attendance; Ominayak refused. On the week of July 23, 2012, Noskey notified the Canadian government that he was stepping down, leaving Ominayak as the sole chief for the nation. This leadership resolution was ratified in writing by the majority of Lubicon citizens. In 2015, the Lubicon Lake Nation Government held a by-election to fill the vacant seat left by long-time Councillor Alphonse Ominayak, who had died unexpectedly. Ominayak is remembered for his tireless work to protect Lubicon land, environment, and way of life in the face of massive oil and gas development. Ominayak additionally contributed greatly to the international human and indigenous rights work started by Chief Bernard Ominayak at the United Nations Human Rights Committee. In the December 3, 2015 by-election, Cynthia Tomlinson became the first woman elected to the Government of the Lubicon Lake Nation Council. Tomlinson previously served as head of the Lubicon Lake Nation Youth Council and Lands & Negotiations Advisor to the Chief & Council. Tomlinson carries a bachelor's degree in Native American Studies from the University of Lethbridge. She is also an experienced public speaker on Indigenous rights and Indigenous legal orders, whose list of accomplishments include presenting at such institutions as the McGill Centre for Human Rights & Legal Pluralism and the University of Ottawa Faculty of Law.

He was hired by the club in 1965 to help the team stave off relegation; he combined many prospects from Estudiantes' la tercera que mata (\\"the killer juveniles\\") with a small number of outside talent, and built one of the most successful teams in the history of Argentine football. The first championship of the so-called \\"Golden Era\\" came in 1967, when Estudiantes became the first \\"small\\" team to win an Argentine championship. The team came back from three goals down to beat Platense in the semifinal 4‚Äì3, then took the crown with a convincing 3‚Äì0 victory over Racing Club. Estudiantes then took second place in the Nacional championship, qualifying for the 1968 Copa Libertadores, which Estudiantes won after defeating Brazilian side Palmeiras. In that year's Intercontinental Cup, Estudiantes defeated Bobby Charlton's Manchester United 1‚Äì0 in Buenos Aires, and achieved a 1‚Äì1 tie at Old Trafford on 16 October 1968. The Intercontinental title remains the highest achievement in Estudiantes' history. The team would go on to win the Copa Libertadores twice more, in 1969 against Nacional from Uruguay and in 1970 against Pe√±arol also from Uruguay. Estudiantes lost their Intercontinental Cup finals to A.C. Milan and Feyenoord, respectively, but they did win the less prestigious Copa Interamericana in 1969. =1974‚Äì1982= In 1974, Zubeld√≠a coached the San Lorenzo de Almagro team that won the Nacional title. He also won two Colombian League titles with Atl√©tico Nacional in 1976 and 1981. On 17 January 1982 Zubeld√≠a died of a heart attack in Medell√≠n, Colombia at the age of 54, while setting a bet on horse race. Tactics Zubeld√≠a was a harbinger of tactical changes; he was the first manager to thoroughly research rival team's tactics and playing style. Pre-planned plays off free kicks and tactical fouls to stop rival advances were highly criticized at the time, but have since been adopted by virtually every team in the world. So are other practices, like the offside trap (having the defense step forward in sync to force opposing players into an offside position) and using screens at corner kicks. Legacy Zubeld√≠a's legacy was carried to fruition by the key tactical player of his Estudiantes, Carlos Bilardo, who went on to become one of the most successful coaches in Argentine history. Bilardo dedicated to his mentor both the 1982 Metropolitano title won by Estudiantes and the 1986 FIFA World Cup title won by Argentina.

Joyo.com was founded in early 2000 by Chinese entrepreneur, Lei Jun in Beijing, China. The company primarily sold books and other media goods, shipping to customers nationwide. Joyo.com was renamed to ‚ÄúAmazon China‚Äù when sold to Amazon Inc. in 2004 for US$75 Million. Amazon China closed its domestic business in China in June 2019, offering only products from sellers located overseas History = Original = Joyo.com was founded by Chinese entrepreneur and owner of Kingsoft, Lei Jun, in May 2000. Kingsoft decided to make Joyo.com into an online bookstore in 1999. Joyo.com was originally a site offering programs for downloading onto desktop computers. It later transitioned to become an online bookstore and was the second online retailer of books in China after DangDang. They continued to expand their inventory and was in 2003 considered to be one of the largest online retailers of media goods worldwide. Lenovo Group Ltd. and Kingsoft Corp. were shareholders of Joyo.com until Tiger Technology Management LLC entered the corporation by investing $52 American dollars for about 20% of Joyo's stakes, making them the third largest stakeholder. The Joyo.com primarily merchandised goods such as books, music and videos to consumer nationwide. In 2004 was Joyo.com acquired by the American multinational technology company, Amazon.com Inc. The company was rebranded and renamed in October 2011 to Amazon China. Amazon made many changes to Joyo, like redesigning the website by adding categories and self-serving features, as well as implementing new payment methods. Amazon also changed the webpage URL to http://z.cn, but continued to be hosted at www.amazon.cn. Amazon China sold foreign fashion brands, home interior, toys, personal care and technology to their Chinese customers. Amazon were planning on establishing operations in Shanghai's free trade zone. =Acquisition= Amazon.com Inc. acquired Joyo.com in August 2004 and was bought for approximately US $75 million, where about $72 million was paid in cash and $3 million in stock options. The acquisition deal also included control over other Chinese subsidiaries and partners owned by Joyo.com. Amazon.com Inc. was already present and operating in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the UK before they entered the Chinese marked. At the time, Joyos headquarters were located in the British Virgin Islands. Amazon.com Inc.‚Äôs CEO, Jeff Bezos, expressed excitement over the acquisition, but recognised the challenges of entering the Chinese market. Though being fully owned by Amazon, Joyo.com kept its name and branding until 2007, the name Joyo Amazon replaced Joyo and the website Amazon.cn was launched. Joyo continued to operate partly independently from other sites owned by Amazon for a couple of years. It expanded the variety of products being sold, including technology, cosmetics and baby products.  Sales revenues  Joyo.com was one of the largest online retailers before Amazon acquired the company and grew rapidly after it was launched. The sales revenues reached 56 million yuan in 2001 and 150 million yuan in 2003. According to the at the time president of Joyo.com, Lin Shuixin, Joyo generated in the second quarter of 2003 a 70% growth in revenues. After the acquisition, Amazon China struggled to continue the growth and compete with local competitors. Due to changes in operation, salaries, customer service and technology by instructions from Amazon, Joyo lost US$13 after the acquisition according to ChinaByte. The New York Times wrote that Amazon China sold less in China than in Japan which was Amazons smallest market at the time. They were only responsible for about 6% of Amazons business in total and therefore not large enough to be included in Amazons annual reports. In 2013, Amazon China reported fiscal sales of US$74,4 billion, while their competitor, Alibaba had sales for approximately US$420 billion in 2014.  E-commerce in China  E-commerce is very popular in China and is the home of the world's largest market for e-commerce and are responsible for approximately 50% of the online purchases occurring. China is the world's largest digital community with approximately 830 million internet users per 2018. China are among the worlds larges exporter of commercial goods, and sold in 2016 about five times as much as Japan. The US is especially important for Chinese manufacturers as the number of China-based sellers are growing on Amazon. Today, are Alibaba owned companies TaoBao and Tmall together make up approximately 55% of the Chinese e-commerce market and JD.com about 25%. Seller feedback is highly valued on many Chinese e-commerce sites, and many offer rebates or gifts in exchange for comments or ratings. The concept is named \\"Rebate For Feedback\\" (RFF) and was founded by economist Li Lingfang.Lingfang, Li 6.9.06, Reputation, Trust, and Rebates: How Online Auction Markets can Improve their Feedback Mechanisms, University of California, URL: https://www.economics.uci.edu/files/docs/colloqpapers/f06/grad/Li.pdf Taobao launched a system where buyers were able to receive ‚Äùrefund points‚Äù that could be collected and used as a coupon with another purchase. = Counterfeit products = Counterfeit products are common in China, as the country is responsible for about 63,2% of the worlds production of fake goods. Hong Kong is the worlds second largest producer. Amazon has been admitted in 2019 to have a problem with vendors selling counterfeit products, and that the majority of these were located in mainland China. Amazon is legally not responsible for the counterfeit products sold through their website as the products are sold through third parties, and has been critiqued for lack of action to fight the issue. In 2018 were two programs named, Transparency program and Project Zero, implemented by Amazon, aiming to eliminate counterfeit products on their site. = Singles Day Shopping Festival = In 2009, Alibaba and JD.com released a Global Shopping Festival held on the 11th of November, also known as Singles Day in China. Singles Day was supposedly started in the 1990s by a group of university students in China who bought themselves gifts to oppose Valentines Day. November 11 was later popularized and promoted by e-commerce retailers like Alibaba as a day to celebrate the lonely ones by buying gifts for themselves. On this day, retailers offer products like phones, clothing and health care packages to a highly discounted price. Singles Day have become an important day for Chinese e-commerce and are considered to be about four times bigger than Black Friday in the US Alibaba sold around 200,000 different brand and generated about US$38 billion in sales on Singles Day in 2019, this despite being in the middle of a trade war with the US. Singles Day is used by many online retailers, but is primarily associated with Alibaba. Despite generating huge sales, have Singles Day been heavily critiqued by environmental activists for contributing to large greenhouse gas emissions.  Competition  In the early 2000s, was DangDang considered the largest competitor to Joyo.com. They were especially similar, as they both focused on selling books as their main business and offered products large discounts on the same products. There was an increase in number of Chinese e-commerce business in the early 2000. These companies grew rapidly along with the rising popularity for online shopping, especially among younger consumers. The competition for consumers rose and Alibaba became the largest and most popular in China after a few years in the market. Amazon.cn offered express delivery for the major Chinese cities, like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, but their competitors usually offered faster delivery to a cheaper price or free, regardless of city. Amazon.cn also had a minimum spend amount for their Chinese customers for all purchases on their website, which varied from 59 yuan to 200 yuan based on item. Amazon Inc. minimum spend policy also applies in other countries, but come with free national express delivery as well. After the acquisition in 2004, were Amazons biggest competitors in China, Dangdang, Taobao, Pinduoduo, Alibaba, Tmall and JD.com. They are similar in terms of business model and variety of products being sold. In comparison to Alibaba and DangDang, did Amazon not have the same intense marketing approach as their competitors, that often had big sales promotions and campaigns during Chinese holidays. = Alibaba = Picture of Alibaba's headquarters Chinese e-commerce site Alibaba is today considered to be the largest e-commerce retailer in China based on yearly revenue sales. Alibaba has approximately 654 million users and has had a steeper growing rate than Amazon Alibaba was also established in 1999, by founder Jack Ma with a team of 17 friends in Hangzhou, China. Due to their similarities, is Alibaba often referred to as the \\"Chinese Amazon\\" despite being two separate companies with little connection to each other. Alibaba and Amazon are similar in products sold and popularity. The largest differences deal with their business model as Amazon sells own products, while Alibaba operates a platform that connects sellers and customers and do not own any inventory themselves. Alibaba has several subsidiaries and operates within numerous markets. They primarily focus on e-commerce, but also operate within the technological market. Alibaba has its own payment platform named Alipay, which is used both online and in stores worldwide. They have also developed a messaging app, Dingtalk, which is recognised as the world's largest professional communication app. =Termination= Amazon.com Inc. announced in 2019 that it would close down their business in China by the 18 July 2019 to focus on cross-border selling to Chinese consumers. Amazon China faced tough competition as the rivals like Alibaba started to gain more popularity. They struggled for many years to gain traction and eventually stopped growing. According to Ker Zheng, a marketing specialist at Azoya, they had little competitive advantage in China compared to the other countries they were operating in. According to iResearch China, Amazon's market share was less than 1% when they decided to shut down as Amazon China. Amazon continues to offer limited services in China, like Amazon Prime, but without the on-demand video benefits. Customers can still enter the webpage amazon.cn, but can only access products imported from Amazon sites located overseas. This includes the US, UK, Germany or Japan. Vendors located in China are also able to sell their products to consumers overseas and there are estimated about 200,000 Chinese sellers active on Amazon, selling to overseas buyers, especially in the US.

Early life and first marriage Born in Sutton, Surrey, England, she was the daughter of John Christoforides, a Cypriot tobacco merchant, and Mildred Nightingale-Boyes. For a number of years she worked as personal secretary for the wealthy Canadian financier James Hamet Dunn, 1st Baronet. Eventually their working relationship became personal although he was thirty-six years her senior. In 1942 she became his third wife after she had nursed him back to health from a coronary thrombosis which nearly claimed his life; his second wife was absent from his bedside during this crisis. She had been a devoted employee and he would seek her input on most every business matter for the rest of his life. The couple maintained homes in England, France, and at the Canadian seaside resort of St. Andrews in New Brunswick, the province of her husband's birth. In the late 1940s, Lady Dunn and her husband developed a friendship with the Spanish artist Salvador Dal√≠ who painted several portraits of them, notably Equestrian Fantasy - Portrait of Lady Dunn. These works are now on permanent display at the Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Second marriage Known as Christofor to her family and friends, on the death of her husband in 1956 she became the beneficiary of a large estate and also the administrator of a fund to be used for charitable purposes. One of her late husband's closest friends was his fellow New Brunswicker, Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook who acted as her advisor. The two developed a very close friendship and Lord Beaverbrook, who had been a widower for many years, came to have great respect for her. In June 1963 the eighty-four-year-old Beaverbrook and the fifty-three-year-old Lady Dunn married. Lord Beaverbrook had already used his fortune to greatly benefit the citizens of the province of New Brunswick in Canada. By virtue of their marriage, Aitken was able to name her the legal overseer of a large part of his estate that he wished to go to further charitable works. Philanthropist Lord Beaverbrook died a year after their marriage and Lady Beaverbrook was left with the responsibility of large benevolent fund. With this, and the funds from her first husband's estate, she became one of Canada's most prominent philanthropists. On behalf of her first husband considerable funds were donated to his alma mater, Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1967, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Law (LL.D.) from that institution and in 1968 she was appointed the University's Chancellor, a position she held for the next twenty-seven years. Assassination attempt Lady Beaverbrook's high-profile in British society and the publicity from her philanthropic work resulted in an assassination attempt. On May 4, 1971 a bomb was strapped to the underside of her Rolls-Royce Phantom VI car (which is coloured green and brown, her horse racing colours), placed there by The Angry Brigade, a British terrorist group. The device was detected before it exploded. The car is now part of the collection at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu. Personal interests A devotee of show horses and equestrian events, she was also a leading race- horse owner, spending a vast amount of money on horses. Her horses almost always had names made up of seven letters. Amongst the many thoroughbreds she owned were: * Boldboy - a gelding, who won twelve group races including the Lockinge Stakes and Sprint Cup, on his retirement he was the highest ever stakes-winning gelding to have raced in the United Kingdom * Bustino - won the 1974 St. Leger Stakes and the 1975 Coronation Cup and was her highest rated racehorse * Relkino - won the 1977 Lockinge Stakes and Benson and Hedges Gold Cup as well as being runner-up in the 1976 Epsom Derby * Niniski - a son of the great Nijinsky II, he won the 1979 Prix Royal-Oak at Longchamp and the Irish St. Leger, then became one of the leading sires in flat racing. * Petoski - won the 1985 Prince of Wales's Stakes and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes * Minster Son - won the 1988 St. Leger Stakes * Terimon - runner-up in the 1989 Epsom Derby and won the 1991 International Stakes * Mystiko - won the 1991 2,000 Guineas She started owning horses in the late 60s and initially had her horses trained by Sir Gordon Richards. In 1971 on his retirement, she transferred them to Dick Hern. In later years she had horses with Clive Brittain. She bred horses as well as owning them. Legacy: The Christofor Foundation Lady Beaverbrook died in 1994 having donated the equivalent of nearly $300 million (at today's value) to support education, cultural undertakings and wildlife preservation. In addition to the charitable trusts from both of her husbands, the Christofor Foundation for charitable purposes was established by friends out of her personal estate. A lover of animals, among the many philanthropic causes Lady Beaverbrook supported, the established the Sir James Dunn Animal Welfare Centre at the University of Prince Edward Island with a $2.2 million gift. Amongst other worthwhile causes, the Foundation from her personal estate also helped fund the Science East Association in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Because the Province of New Brunswick was home to both of her husbands, it contains many institutions built with funding from their estates. However, large contributions were made to numerous causes throughout the four Atlantic Provinces, most notably in education. In her memory, the Sir James Dunn Foundation of Saint John, New Brunswick made a $1 million donation toward the establishment of a student residence bearing her name at Acadia University in Wolfville, Nova Scotia.

The term was coined by critic Edouard Dujardin on the occasion of the Salon des Ind√©pendants, in March 1888.Dujardin, √âdouard: Aux XX et aux Ind√©pendants: le Cloisonism√© (sic!), Revue ind√©pendante, Paris, March 1888, pp. 487-492 Artists √âmile Bernard, Louis Anquetin, Paul Gauguin, Paul S√©rusier, and others started painting in this style in the late 19th century. The name evokes the technique of cloisonn√©, where wires (cloisons or \\"compartments\\") are soldered to the body of the piece, filled with powdered glass, and then fired. Many of the same painters also described their works as Synthetism, a closely related movement. In The Yellow Christ (1889), often cited as a quintessential cloisonnist work, Gauguin reduced the image to areas of single colors separated by heavy black outlines. In such works he paid little attention to classical perspective and boldly eliminated subtle gradations of color--two of the most characteristic principles of post-Renaissance painting. The cloisonnist separation of colors reflects an appreciation for discontinuity that is characteristic of Modernism.William R.

Biography = Early life = His interest in composition and piano began after hearing his father playing piano. His first attempts at \\"little melodies\\" were designed to be played with the only two fingers on his right hand that were capable of playing the instrument. After realizing that he would not be able to progress, he shifted his focus to the French horn. From 1969 to 1971, he studied horn, music theory, and music history at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen. While at the conservatory, his music was inspired by his mentors Per N√∏rg√•rd and Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen. In the 1980s, he continued his studies attending seminars with Gy√∂rgy Ligeti. = Early career = Abrahamsen is considered to have been part of a trend called the \\"New Simplicity\\", which arose in the mid-1960s as a reaction against the complexity and perceived aridity of the Central European avant- garde. Abrahamsen‚Äôs first works conformed to the tenets of this movement, particularly the circle around the Darmstadt School. For Abrahamsen, this meant adopting an almost naive simplicity of expression, as in his orchestral piece Skum (\\"Foam\\", 1970). Around this time, he was also involved with a group called the Gruppen for Alternativ Musik, which was designed to allow musicians to \\"perform new music in alternative forms,\\" and \\"to develop socially and politically committed music.\\"Anders Beyer, \\"Abrahamsen, Hans\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). These ideals can be seen in his Symphony in C which was originally titled Anti-EEC Sats (Anti-EEC Movement). The title was changed \\"after the composer came to the realization that ' music cannot be against.'\\" His style soon altered and developed into a personal dialogue with Romanticism which can be seen in his orchestral work Nacht und Trompeten. In 1982, he found early success when this piece was performed by the Berlin Philharmonic. The conductor of that performance, notable composer Hans Werner Henze, soon became a champion of Abrahamsen's music. = Hiatus = From 1990 to 1998, Abrahamsen completed only one work, a short song. According to the composer, ‚Äú[he] couldn't find the way to make what [he] wanted.‚Äù The prevailing attitudes about complexity in music caused him to be \\"paralyzed by the white paper.\\" Coming out of his hiatus, he began working on new arrangements of Johann Sebastian Bach. The orchestrations of these arrangements included many nods to minimalist composers foreshadowing aesthetic changes in Abrahamsen's music. = Return to music = After his return to composition, his music was radically changed. It combined his early artistic attitudes with newer artistic goals with a modernist stringency and economy into a larger individual musical universe. Notable works since his return to composition include a piano concerto written for his wife Anne-Marie Abildskov, and the extended chamber work Schnee (\\"Snow\\"), where the paring- down of material appears to reach a new extreme. Schnee has also received attention for its construction from both arch-shaped and straight-line processes that unfold over the work's duration and for innovative details such as its inline, composed retuning intervals. Abrahamsen's let me tell you, a song cycle for soprano and orchestra based on the novella of the same name by Paul Griffiths, was premiered on 20 December 2013 by the Berlin Philharmonic, with soprano soloist Barbara Hannigan (to whom the work is dedicated), conducted by Andris Nelsons. Franz Welser-M√∂st led the Cleveland Orchestra in the U.S. premiere in January 2016. Abrahamsen won the $100,000 2016 Grawemeyer Award for this work. The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra gave the British premiere of the song cycle in 2014. The same year CBSO co-commissioned from Abrahamsen a concerto for piano left hand. Left, Alone received its world premiere in Cologne in January 2016, performed by pianist Alexandre Tharaud, for whom the concerto was composed. Four months later, Tharaud gave the British premiere for the CBSO, conducted by Ilan Volkov. Abrahamsen has written that being \\"born with a right hand that is not fully functional\\" has given him \\"a close relationship with the works written for the left hand by Ravel and others.\\" His first opera Snedronningen (The Snow Queen) is a free adaptation of the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. It was premiered at the Danish Opera House on 13 October 2019 and received its first performance in English (by Bayerische Staatsoper) at the National Theater in Munich on 21 December 2019.

The title is from a poem praising Cromwell by John Milton, perhaps the most famous and accomplished poet of the English Commonwealth. Fraser's goal is to \\"rescue\\" Oliver Cromwell and rehabilitate his reputation as a statesman and leader, while not glossing over his obvious faults. From Fraser's point of view, one of Cromwell's main flaws was his tendency to lose his temper in the heat of battle and this character flaw explains the Massacre at Drogheda (1649) and much of his conduct fighting the Irish during the English Civil War. His other main character fault was to see events as the result of \\"providence\\" which led him into self-justification of his sometimes harsh decisions. The decision to kill Charles I happened (according to Cromwell) because it was willed by God. Cromwell saw himself as the instrument of his creator and often delayed making decisions because he was looking for \\"signs from God\\" to confirm his decisions. Cromwell's character strengths were his decisiveness as a political leader and effectiveness as a war leader. Also Fraser greatly admires Cromwell's ability to rise from modest origins to the pinnacle of political power in England. He understood people and how to gain their loyalty and respect. Fraser counts him as one of greatest leaders history has produced. Fraser succeeded in \\"humanising\\" Cromwell and the book received much critical acclaim when it was published. It succeeded in exploding the myth of Cromwell as a scheming power hungry hypocrite and presented the man as a complex person, a man who changed the course of history but also as a man of his age, not a tyrant, but a person who struggled with his conscience and truly lived according to his beliefs.

Iacobucci was born September 26, 1953, in Buenos Aires, Argentina to Dr. Guillermo and Costantina Iacobucci. His father, a biochemist, moved his family to the U.S. in 1960 to work first for E.R. Squibb & Sons (a predecessor to pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb), and then Coca-Cola. Roberto Goizueta, then Chairman of Coca-Cola, became a close friend of the Iacobucci family and, subsequently, Ed's godfather. Iacobucci graduated from Georgia Tech with a BSc in systems engineering in 1975. =Career= Iacobucci began his career at IBM in 1979 where he worked on the commercial software and personal computer business. While at IBM, Iacobucci held architecture and design leadership responsibilities for IBM DOS and OS/2, and led the joint IBM-Microsoft design for multi-tasking personal computer operating systems. In 1989, Iacobucci left IBM to co-found Citrix Systems. He led the company as chairman and chief technology officer through its market and product development phases. Citrix grew and was named to both the Nasdaq 100 and S&P; 500 indexes. In 1997, Iacobucci forged a five-year joint development agreement with Microsoft to include Citrix's multi-user capabilities within Microsoft Windows NT Server. He served as chairman of Citrix through 2000, when he retired. In 2002, Iacobucci co-founded and served as president and CEO of DayJet Corporation, an on-demand airline service that sold individual seats via a time sensitive pricing scale and utilized the Eclipse 500 very light jet. Dayjet built a computer system for solving highly complex optimization problems, and announced a five-year strategic agreement with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). After starting operations in 2007, DayJet ceased operations in 2008 when it was no longer able to secure its planned growth capital. Between 2002 and 2007 he was a member of the SCO Group's board of directors. In 2011, Iacobucci founded VirtualWorks, which helps manage data.

In historical Christian practice, such blowing appears most prominently in the liturgy, and is connected almost exclusively with baptism and other ceremonies of Christian initiation, achieving its greatest popularity during periods in which such ceremonies were given a prophylactic or exorcistic significance, and were viewed as essential to the defeat of the devil or to the removal of the taint of original sin.See Franz Josef D√∂lger, Der Exorzismus im altchristlichen Taufrituel, Studien zur Geschichte und Kultur des Altertums 3 (Paderborn, 1909), chap. 7 \\"Die Exsufflatio\\" (pp. 118-130); Edmond Mart√®ne, De antiquis ecclesiae ritibus libri tres (Venice, 1763), I.1.viii-xiv (\\"Ritus instituendi catechumeni\\"); Rudolf Suntrup, Die Bedeutung der liturgischen Geb√§rden und Bewegungen in lateinischen und deutschen Auslegungen des 9. bis 13. Jahrhunderts (Munich, 1978), pp. 307-310; and Henry A. Kelly, The Devil at Baptism: Ritual, Theology, and Drama (Ithaca, 1985). Ritual blowing occurs in the liturgies of catechumenate and baptism from a very early period and survives into the modern Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Maronite, and Coptic rites.Alongside Mart√®ne and Suntrup (cited above), convenient collections of illustrative material include W.

Catholic liturgy post-Vatican II (the so-called novus ordo 1969) has largely done away with insufflation, except in a special rite for the consecration of chrism on Maundy Thursday.F. L.

For the Maronite rite, derived from the ancient Syriac liturgy, see Mysteries of Initiation, Baptism, Confirmation, Communion according to the Maronite Antiochene Church, (Washington, DC, 1987); summarized by Bryan D.

Insufflation vs. exsufflation From an early period, the act had two distinct but not always distinguishable meanings: it signified on the one hand the derisive repudiation or exorcism of the devil; and, on the other, purification and consecration by and inspiration with the Holy Spirit. The former is technically \\"exsufflation\\" (\\"blowing out\\") and the latter \\"insufflation\\" (\\"blowing in\\"), but ancient and medieval texts (followed by modern scholarship) make no consistent distinction in usage. For example, the texts use not only Latin insufflare ('blow in') and exsufflare ('blow out'), or their Greek or vernacular equivalents, but also the simplex sufflare ('blow'), halare ('breathe'), inspirare, exspirare, etc.P. Pashini, et al., ed., Enciclopedia Cattolica (Florence, 1949-1954), s.v. \\"insufflazione,\\" pp. 55-56. Compare Neale, The Ancient Liturgies of the Gallican Church..., p. 266, note m; Whitaker, Documents of the Baptismal Liturgy, p. 256; Kelly, The Devil at Baptism, p. 235. D√∂ger, Der Exorzismus im altchristlichen Taufrituel, p. 130 similarly distinguishes between exsufflation and \\"halation\\"; and Suntrup, Die Bedeutung der liturgischen Geb√§rden, p. 307 warns that the distinction is a hard one to maintain. The Episcopal Dictionary of the Church, s.v. insufflation (accessed 14 Jan 2007) similarly says that \\"the distinction between insufflation and exsufflation has not always been preserved.\\" And the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3rd ed., p. 839, is content to give both inspirational (\\"to symbolize the influence of the Holy Spirit\\") and exorcistic (\\"the expulsion of evil spirits\\") meanings under the single heading of \\"insufflation.\\" Typical is the 8th-century Libellus de mysterio baptismatis of Magnus of Sens, one of a number of responses to a questionnaire about baptism circulated by Charlemagne. In discussing insufflation as a means of exorcising catechumens, Magnus combines a variety of mostly exsufflation-like functions‚âà > \\"Those who are to be baptised are insufflated by the priest of God, so that > the Prince of Sinners [i.e. the devil] may be put to flight from out of > them, and that entry for the Lord Christ might be prepared, and that by his > insufflation they might be made worthy to receive the Holy > Spirit.\\"Patrologia Latina, 102:982D. This double role appears as early as Cyril of Jerusalem's 4th-century Mystagogic Catacheses; as Edward Yarnold notes, \\"Cyril attributes both negative and positive effects [to insufflation]. ‚Ä¶ The rite of breathing on the [baptismal] candidate has the negative effect of blowing away the devil (exsufflation) and the positive effect of breathing in grace (insufflation).\\"Cyril of Jerusalem, by Edward J. Yarnold (London: Routledge, 2000), p. 203. History =Early period= What might neutrally be called \\"sufflation\\" is found in some of the earliest liturgies dealing with the protracted process of initiation known as the \\"catechumenate,\\" which saw its heyday in the 4th and 5th centuries. The earliest extant liturgical use is possibly that of the Apostolic Tradition attributed to Hippolytus of Rome, from the 3rd or 4th century, and therefore contemporary with Cyril in the east:The date is controversial. The text is usually connected with practice in Rome and dated in its earliest form to the early 3rd century. But the surviving text is fragmentary, many portions surviving only in much later versions in several different languages. Chapter 20, the relevant chapter, is perhaps from the 4th century (see Maxwell E. Johnson, The Rites of Christian Initiation: Their Evolution and Interpretation (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1999), 78-81). For the standard reconstruction of the text, see Bernard Botte, La \\"Tradition Apostolique,\\" 42-45 (chapter 20). Whitaker, Documents, p. 4, reprints the translation of Gregory Dix, The Treatise on the Apostolic Tradition, p. 32 (sect. xx.8). Botte renders the Coptic original of the sufflation passage as \\"exsufflet,\\" though Kelly (Devil at Baptism, p. 87) points out that the significance of the gesture is uncertain. Geoffrey Cumming gives the more neutral translation \\"breathe on\\": Hippolytus: A Text for Students (Bramcote, Notts, 1976), p. 18, as reproduced more fully below. > Those who are to be baptized should ‚Ä¶ be gathered in one place. ‚Ä¶ And [the > bishop] should lay his hands on them and exorcize all alien spirits, that > they may flee out of them and ever return into them. And when he has > finished exorcizing them, he shall breathe on their faces; and when he has > signed their foreheads, ears, and noses, he shall raise them up.Cuming's > translation, reprinted by Maxwell Johnson, Rites of Christian Initiation, p. > 74. =Distribution, geographical and functional= The practice entered the baptismal liturgy proper only as the catechumenate, rendered vestigial by the growth of routine infant baptism, was absorbed into the rite of baptism. Both exsufflation and insufflation are well established by the time of Augustine and in later centuries are found widely. By the Western high Middle Ages of the 12th century, sufflation was geographically widespread, and had been applied not only to sufflating catechumens and baptizands,Nearly universally. E.g.

G. Henderson, ed., Liber Pontificalis Chr. Bainbridge Archiepiscopi Eboracensis, Surtees Society Publications 61 (Durham, 1875 for 1873), 254, 256). =Medieval period= Most of these variations persist in one branch or another of the hybrid Romano- Germanic rite that can be traced from 5th-century Rome through the western Middle Ages to the Council of Trent, and beyond that into modern (Tridentine) Roman Catholicism. As the 'national' rites such as the Ambrosian tradition in northern Italy and the Spanish Mozarabic rite faded away or were absorbed into international practice, it was this hybrid Roman-Gallican standard that came to dominate western Christendom, including Anglo-Saxon and medieval England, from the time of Charlemagne, and partly through his doing, through the high and late Middle Ages and into the modern period. Roman practice around the year 500 is reflected in a letter by a somewhat mysterious John the Deacon to a correspondent named Senarius. The letter discusses the exsufflation of catechumens at length.John the Deacon, Epistola ad Senarium, ed. A. Wilmart, \\"Analecta Reginensia (Vat. Reg. Lat. 69),\\" Studi e testi 59 (1933), 172; trans. Whitaker, Documents of the Baptismal Liturgy, 155. The Stowe Missal, Irish in origin but largely Gallican in form, contains a prebaptismal sufflation of unclear significance.F. E. Warren, Liturgy and Ritual of the Celtic Church (Oxford, 1881; rpt. with introduction by Jane Stevenson, Woodbridge, Suffolk, 1987), 209; The Stowe Missal, ed. George F. Warner, Henry Bradshaw Society 32 (London, 1915), 25. The other Gallican rites are largely devoid of sufflation, though the so-called Missale Gothicum contains a triple exsufflation of baptismal water,Neale, Gallican Liturgies, 97; or L. C. Mohlberg, ed., Missale Gothicum, Rerum Ecclesiasticarum Documenta, Series Maior, Fontes 5 (Rome, 1961), 67. and a prebaptismal insufflation of catechumens is found in the hybrid Bobbio MissalNeale, Gallican Liturgies, 266 and the 10th-century Fulda sacramentary, alongside the more common baptismal exsufflation.Fulda Sacramentary, 332 (¬ß2631) and 343 (¬ß2679-80). The 11th- century North-Italian baptismal ritual in the Ambrosian Library MS. T.27.Sup. makes heavy use of the practice, requiring both insufflation and triple exsufflation of the baptismal candidates in modum crucis, and insufflation of the font as well.Lambot, North Italian Services, 5, 11, 16, 33. The \\"Hadrianum\\" version of the Gregorian Sacramentary, sent to Charlemagne from Rome and augmented probably by Benedict of Aniane, contains an insufflation of the baptismal font,Jean Deshusses, Le Sacramentaire Gr√©gorien, vol. 1, Spicilegium Friburgense 16 (Fribourg, 1971), 188; the rubric here is reconstructed by Deshusses from a wide variety of variants. On the attribution of the Hadrianum supplement to Benedict, see Deshusses, 1:63-7 and vol. 3, Spicilegium Friburgense 28 (Fribourg, 1982), 66-75, as well as his earlier article \\"Le 'Suppl√©ment' au sacramentaire gr√©gorien: Alcuin ou S. Beno√Æt d'Aniane?\\" Archiv f√ºr Liturgiewissenschaft 9.1 (1965): 48-71. as does the mid-10th-century Ordo Romanus L,Ordo L, xxxix.50; Michel Andrieu, ed., Les Ordines Romani du Haut Moyen Age, vol. 5, Spicilegium Sacrum Lovaniense, √âtudes et Documents, fasc. 29 (Louvain, 1961), 281. the basis of the later Roman pontifical. Ordo Romanus L also contains a triple exsufflation of the candidates for baptism, immediately preceding the baptism itself.Ordo L, xx.5; Andrieu, 5:131. This section was probably also originally found in Ordo XI according to Andrieu (2:376). Most of the numerous Carolingian expositions of baptism treat sufflation to some extent.See Jean-Paul Bouhot, \\"Explications du rituel baptismal √† l'√©poque carolingienne,\\" Revue des √©tudes augustiniennes 24 (1978): 278-301; and Susan A. Keefe, \\"Carolingian Baptismal Expositions: A Handlist of Tracts and MSS,\\" in Carolingian Essays, ed. Uta-Renate Blumenthal (Washington, DC, 1983), 169-238. One anonymous 9th-century catechism is unusual in distinguishing explicitly between the exsufflation of catechumens and the insufflation of baptismal water,Andr√© Wilmart, \\"Une cat√©ch√®se baptismale du IXe si√®cle,\\" Revue B√©n√©dictine 57 (1947): 199 (Keefe, \\"Expositions,\\" text 50). but most of the tracts and florilegia, when they treat both, do so without referring one to the other; most confine themselves to exsufflation and are usually content to quote extracts from authorities, especially Isidore and Alcuin.E.g. in Keefe's texts 34/6 and 3: Jean-Paul Bouhot, \\"Alcuin et le 'De Catechizandis Rudibus,'\\" Recherches Augustiniennes 15 (1980): 224; and Wilmart, Analecta, 158. Particularly popular was Isidore's lapidary remark in the Etymologies to the effect that it is not the human being (\\"God's creature\\") that is exsufflated, but the Prince of Sinners to whom that person is subjected by being born in sin,Sciendum est quod non creatura Dei in infantibus exorcizatur aut exufflatur, sed ille sub quo sunt omnes qui cum peccato nascuntur; est enim princeps peccatorum. Etymologiarum,VI.xix.56; ed. W. M. Lindsay (Oxford, 1911). a remark that echoed Augustine's arguments against the Pelagians to the effect that it was not the human infant (God's image) that was attacked in sufflation, but the infant's possessor, the devil. Particularly influential was Alcuin's brief treatment of the subject, the so-called Primo paganus, which in turn depended heavily on John the Deacon.Alcuin's comments are contained in two genuine letters (numbers 134, to Odwin, and 137, to monks in the south of France), ed. Ernst D√ºmmler, Epistolae Karolini Aevi, 2, MGH Epistolae 4 (Berlin, 1895), 202 and 214; and in a third letter of dubious authenticity, ostensibly to Charlemagne, ed. Patrologia Latina 98:938B. The three letters are nearly verbatim identical in their description of exsufflation: Primo paganus catechumenus fit, accedens ad baptismum; ut renuntiet maligno spiritui et omnibus eius pompis. Exsufflatur etiam; ut, fugato diabolo, Christo Deo nostro paretur introitus (MGH, 214, = Keefe text 9, Bouhot, 280-82. The Primo paganus formed the basis of Charlemagne's famous circular questionnaire on baptism, part of his effort to harmonize liturgical practice across his empire; and many of the seventeen extant direct or indirect responses to the questionnaire echo Alcuin, making the process a little circular and the texts a little repetitious.For the various replies, see Wilmart, 154; Bouhot, 286-93; and Keefe, passim. The burden of Alcuin's remarks, in fact, appears above in the quotation from the Libellus of Magnus of Sens, one of the respondents.The Libellus of Magnus of Sens is Keefe's text 15 (Bouhot, 287). The questionnaire assumed that exsufflation of or on the part of the candidate for baptism was generally practiced ‚Äî it merely asks what meaning is attached to the practice: > \\"Concerning the renunciation of Satan and all his works and pomps, what is > the renunciation? and what are the works of the devil and his pomps? why is > he breathed upon? (cur exsufflatur?) why is he exorcised?\\"See J. D. C. > Fisher, Christian Initiation: Baptism in the Medieval West (London, 1965), > 59. The text (Keefe's text 14; Bouhot, 286) is readily available in Dorothy > Bethurum's edition of the Homilies of Wulfstan (Oxford, 1957), 302-3, and > less readily in Jean Michel Hanssens, Amalarii...opera 1, Studi e test 138 > (1948), 235-6. Most of the respondents answered that it was so that, with the devil sent fleeing, the entry of the Holy Spirit might be prepared for. In England On the other side of the Channel, in Anglo-Saxon England, sufflation is mentioned in Bishop Wulfstan's collection of Carolingian baptismal expositions, the Incipit de baptisma, and in the two vernacular (Old English) homilies based on it, the Quando volueris and the Sermo de baptismate. The Incipit de baptisma reads: \\"On his face let the sign of the cross be made by exsufflation, so that, the devil having been put to flight, entry for our Lord Christ might be prepared.\\"In cuius ‚Ä¶ facie a sacerdote per exsufflationem signum crucis sit, ut effugeto diabolo, Cristo Domino nostro preparetur introitus. Wulfstan, Homilies, ed. Bethurum, Homily VIIIa (p. 169, ll. 8-10). For the relationship between the three pieces, see pp. 302-4. For the parallel passages in the vernacular homilies, see Homily VIIIb (p. 172, ll. 14-22) and Homily VIIIc (pp. 176-7, ll. 29-35). Wulfstan's collection draws on a variety of Carolingian sources, but in this passage quotes almost verbatim the De Ordine Baptismi of Theodulf of Orleans (yet another Alcuin- derivative reply to Charlemagne; Keefe text 16), ed. in Patrologia Latina 105:225B. Among English liturgical texts proper, the 10th-century Leofric Pontifical (and Sacramentary) dictates an insufflation of baptizands, a triple insufflation of the baptismal water, and an 'exhalation' of holy oil.F. E. Warren, ed., The Leofric Missal as used in the Cathedral of Exeter during the Episcopate of its First Bishop, A. D. 1050-1072 (Oxford, 1883), 236-37, 259. This text may, however, originate on the Continent: see H. M. J. Bantin, Two Anglo-Saxon Pontificals, Henry Bradshaw Society 104 (London, 1989), xxiii-xxv. The contemporary, and genuinely English, Egbert Pontifical, from York, lacks mention of sufflation. In the 11th century, the Salisbury Pontifical (BL Cotton MS Tiberius C.1) and the Pontifical of Thomas of Canterbury require insufflation of the font; the Missal of Robert of Jumi√®ges (Canterbury) has an erased rubric where it may have done likewise, as well as having an illegible rubric where it probably directed the exsufflation of catechumens, and retaining the old ordo ad caticuminum ex pagano faciendum, complete with its sufflation ceremony; and an English Ordo Romanus (BL Cotton MS Vitellius E.12) contains a triple exsufflation of baptizands.W. G. Henderson, ed., York Manual, 144, 136, 133, 142; H. A. Wilson, ed., The Missal of Robert of Jumi√®ge, Henry Bradshaw Society 11 (London, 1896), 93, 98, 101. Various 12th- century texts include signing and triple exsufflation of the holy oil (Sarum), triple exsufflation of baptizands (the Ely, Magdalene, and Winton Pontificals), and insufflation of the font in modum crucis (Ely and Magdalene, followed by most later texts).See the Bainbridge Pontifical, appendix 3, 254; York Manual, 147, 149. Such are the origins of the late medieval sufflation rites, which were in turn retained in regularized form in post-Tridentine Catholicism. =Sufflation in Protestantism= Sufflation did not last long in any of the churches arising from the magisterial or radical reformations. Martin Luther's first attempt at a baptismal liturgy, the Tauffbuchlin (Taufb√ºchlein) of 1523 (reprinted 1524 and 1525) did retain many ceremonies from the late Medieval ritual as it was known in Germany, including a triple exsufflation of baptizands. But in an epilogue, Luther listed this ceremony among the adiaphora ‚Äî i.e., the inessential features that added nothing to the meaning of the sacrament: > \\"The least importance attaches to these external things, namely breathing > under the eyes, signing with the cross, placing salt in the mouth, putting > spittle and clay on the ears and nose, anointing with oil the breast and > shoulders, and signing the top of the head with chrism, vesting in the > christening robe, and giving a burning candle into the hand, and whatever > else ‚Ä¶ men have added to embellish baptism. For ‚Ä¶ they are not the kind of > devices that the devil shuns.\\"Luther's Works 53:103, Weimar Ausgabe 12:48; > cited in Spinks, Reformation and Modern Rituals, 10. The Lutheran Strasbourg Taufb√ºchlein of June 1524, composed by Diobald Schwartz, assistant to Cathedral preacher Martin Zell, on the basis of the medieval rite used in Strasbourg combined with elements of Luther's 1523 rite, also retains baptismal exsufflation;Text in F. Hubert, Die Strassburger liturgischen Ordnungen in Zeitalter der Reformation (G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoek und Ruprecht, 1900), 25ff.; transl. in Fisher, Christian Initiation: the Reformation Period, 30-33. so does Andreas Osiander in Nuremberg, in the same year.Fisher, Christian Initiation, 18. The dependence of Schwartz and Osiander on Luther appears from their use of his distinctive rubric \\"breathe under the eyes\\" ‚Äî not found in the medieval rites. But thereafter the practice vanished from Lutheranism, and indeed from Protestantism generally. Luther's revised edition of 1526 and its successors omit exsufflation altogether, as do the Luther-influenced early reformed rites of England (Thomas Cranmer's Prayer Book of 1549) and Sweden (the Manual of Olavus Petri), despite the former's conservative basis in the medieval Sarum ritual and the latter's strong interest in exorcism as an essential part of the baptismal ritual.For a handy comparison, see The Manual of Olavus Petri, 1529, ed. Eric E. Yelverton (London: SPCK, 1953), p. [110]. Similarly in the Swiss Reformation (the Zwinglian/Reformed tradition), only the very earliest rites retain sufflation, namely the ceremony published by Leo Jud, pastor of St. Peter's in Zurich, in the same year (1523) as Luther's first baptismal manual.English translation in Fisher, Christian Initiation: the Reformation Period, 126ff.; discussed briefly in Spinks, Reformation and Modern Rituals, 31, and fully in H. O. Old, The Shaping of the Reformed Baptismal Rite in the Sixteenth Century (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1992). =Sufflation in Protestant-Roman Catholic debate= Though sufflation does not appear in Protestant practice, it definitely appears in Protestant polemic, where it is usually treated as an un-Scriptural and superstitious (i.e., in the Protestant view, a typically Roman Catholic) practice, and even one reeking of enchantment or witchcraft. It appears as such, for example in the work of Henry More (the 'Cambridge Platonist') on evil. His argument essentially reverses that of Augustine. Augustine had said to the Pelagians (to paraphrase): \\"you see that we exorcize and exsufflate infants before baptising them; therefore they must be tainted with sin and possessed by the devil since birth.\\" More replies, in effect, \\"Infants cannot be devil-possessed sinners; therefore, ceremonial exorcism and exsufflation is presumptuous, frightening, and ridiculous,\\" in a word \\"the most gross and fundamental Superstitions, that look like Magick or Sorcery\\": > \\"The conjuring the Devil also out of the Infant that is to be baptized would > seem a frightful thing to the Infant himself, if he understood in what an > ill plight the Priest supposes him, while he makes three Exsufflations upon > his face, and uses an Exorcistical form for the ejecting of the foul Fiend. > ‚Ä¶ And it is much if something might not appear affrightful to the Women in > this approaching darkness. For though it be a gay thing for the Priest to be > thought to have so much power over the Stygian Fiend, as to Exorcize him out > of the Infant; yet it may be a sad consideration with some melancholick > women laden with Superstition, to think they are never brought to bed, but > they are delivered of a Devil and Child at once.\\"Henry More, A Modest > Enquiry into the Mystery of Iniquity (London, 1664), 68. Sufflation appears in Roman Catholic anti-Protestant polemic, as well. The relative antiquity of the practice, and its strong endorsement by the Protestants' favorite Father, Augustine, made it a natural element in Catholic arguments that contrasted the Protestant with the ancient and Apostolic church. A true church, according to Roman Catholic apologists, would be: > \\"A Church that held the exorcismes exsufflations and renunciations, which > are made in baptisme, for sacred Ceremonies, and of Apostolicall > tradition.... A Church which in the Ceremonies of baptisme, vsed oyle, > salte, waxe, lights, exorcismes, the signe of the Cross, the word Epheta and > other thinges that accompanie it; to testifie ... by exorcismes, that > baptisme puts vs out of the Diuells possession.Jacques Davy Du Perron, The > reply of the most illustrious Cardinall of Perron, to the ansvveare of the > most excellent King of Great Britaine (Douay. 1630) 72. This was argued on the grounds that some of these ceremonies were demonstrably ancient, and all of them might be. > \\"Sundry Ceremonies vsed in baptisme, and other Sacraments, as Exorcismes, > Exsufflations, Christening, and the like mentioned by S. Augustine and by > diuers other ancient Fathers ..., these being practised by the Primitiue > Church (which is graunted to be the true Church) and compared to the > customes of Protestants, and vs, in our Churches, will easily disclose, > which of the two, they or we, do more imitate, or impugne the true Church of > antiquity.\\"Humphrey Leech; Robert Persons, Dutifull and respective > considerations vpon foure seuerall heads of proofe and triall in matters of > religion ... By a late minister & preacher in England (Saint-Omer, 1609), > 210 To which a Protestant reply was that sufflation was not ancient enough, and could not be proved to be apostolic: > \\"It was plain then there was no clear Tradition in the Question, possibly > there might be a custome in some Churches postnate to the times of the > Apostles, but nothing that was obligatory, no Tradition Apostolicall.

The liberty of > prophesying, 2. Prayer ex tempore, 3. Episcopacie : together with a sermon > preached at Oxon.... (London, 1648), 87 Sufflation was judged by Protestant critics to be irrational, mysterious, and obscure, an increasingly important factor by the close of the 17th century and the dawn of the Enlightenment: > \\"Mystery prevail'd very little in the first Hundred or Century of Years > after Christ; but in the second and third, it began to establish it self by > Ceremonies.

It was said to be a human invention, imposed by the arbitrary whim of a tyrannical prelate against the primitive Gospel freedom of the church: > \\"[Some bishop] ... taking it into his head that there ought to be a trine- > immersion in baptism; another the signation of the cross; another an unction > with oil; another milk and honey, and imposition of hands immediately after > it; another insufflation or breathing upon the person's face to exorcise the > Devil...

(London(?), 1767), p. 86. =Prospects= Though liturgical sufflation is almost gone, at least from the Western churches, its revival is not inconceivable. Liturgical renewal movements always seem to look to the 'classic' catechumenate of the 4th and 5th centuries for inspiration. Insufflation has indeed been re-introduced into the Catholic \\"new catechumenate.\\" But many ceremonies dating from that or the medieval period have been re-imported even into Protestant rites during the last couple of decades. Perhaps even more likely is a revival in the context of the growth of the Roman Catholic Church in Africa and in Asia, where locally and culturally meaningful ceremonies have often revolutionized practice, and where the exorcistic function of baptism has taken on a new vitality. For example, a pure insufflation is apparently practiced in the Philippine Independent Church,Peter Jagger, Christian Initiation 1552-1969... (London, 1970), 292. This is basically a Roman rite with some Anglican-like features. and Spinks mentions a pre-baptismal ceremony used by the Christian Workers' Fellowship of Sri Lanka, in which the candidates are struck with a cane and their faces are breathed upon.Spinks, Reformation and Modern Rituals, 203, citing Francis Wickremesinghe, \\"An Asian Inculturation of the Baptismal Liturgy,\\" in David R. Holeton, ed., Growing in Newness of Life (Toronto: Anglican Book Centre, 1993), 213-217. It is not clear whether the latter represents a revival of historical sufflation, or a wholly new ceremony derived from local custom. Significance and associations There were at least three kinds of association that particularly influenced how liturgical sufflation came to be understood: Biblical antecedents; liturgical setting; and extra-liturgical (cultural) analogs. =Biblical antecedents= Three Biblical passages recur repeatedly with reference to insufflation narrowly defined, all of them referring to some kind of life-giving divine breath. The first and most commonly cited is (echoed by and ), in which God first creates man and then breathes into him the breath of life, in order to give him (as the passage was later interpreted) a human soul.\\"His life is of less worth than clay, because he failed to know the one who formed him and inspired him with an active soul and breathed into him a living spirit [Vulg. 'insufflavit ei spiritum vitalem']\\" Wisdom 15:10-11 (RSV); \\"The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life\\" Job 33:4 (RSV). Cp. Psalm 33:6. The second passage, , reinterprets the Genesis passage prophetically, in foreseeing God resurrecting the dead bones of exiled Israel by means of his life-giving breath.\\"Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain [Vulg. 'insuffla super interfectos istos'], that they may live.... And the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet\\" Ezekiel 37:9-10 (RSV). And finally, in , Christ is represented as conveying the Paraclete to his disciples, and so initiating the commissioned church, by breathing on them, here too, very possibly, with implicit reference to the original creation.\\"He breathed [on them?] [Vulg. insufflavit] and said to them, 'receive the Holy Spirit'\\" John 20:22 (RSV). The two passages were connected explicitly in later Christian exegesis: the same breath that created man re-created him. > \\"[Insufflation] signifies, To blow into, Gen. 2. 7. This sheweth mans soul > not to be of the earth, as his body was, but of nothing, by the insufflation > of God, and so differing from the spirit of beasts, Eccl. 3. 21. This word > is used also, when Christ to make men new creatures, inspired his Apostles > with the holy Ghost, Joh. 20. 21.\\"Thomas Wilson, ed. John Bagwell, A > complete Christian dictionary wherein the significations and several > acceptations of all the words mentioned in the Holy Scriptures of the Old > and New Testament are fully opened, expressed, explained ... (London, 1661) > p. 337. > \\"The Lord God, saith the Text, formed man of the dust of the ground, and > breathed into his Nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living Soul. > His Body made of Earth, but his Soul the Breath of God. ‚Ä¶ We must not > understand it grosly; for so Breath is not attributable unto God, who is a > simple and perfect Spirit; but ‚Ä¶ as a figurative expression of God's > communicating unto Man that inward Principle, whereby he lives and acts, not > only in common with, but in a degree above other Animals. ‚Ä¶ The Learned P. > Fagius takes notice of three things in the Text of Moses, which do conclude > the Immortality of the Soul of Man. I. Insufflatio illa Dei: This > Inspiration from God spoken of: For he that breaths into another, > contributes unto him aliquid de suo somewhat of his own: And therefore, > saith he, when our B.

The associations with creation, rebirth, initiation, and revivification created by these passages of Scripture suited insufflation for a role in baptism as it has been most commonly regarded: as figuring the waters of creation (over which the Spirit brooded); as figuring the womb of rebirth; and as figuring (in Saint Paul's metaphor) the tomb, into which the Christian joins Christ in descending, and from which the Christian likewise joins Christ in ascending, dead to the old life but made alive again in Christ.Romans 6:3-5. There are also Biblical antecedents for exsufflation, properly speaking, that is, exorcistic blowing, especially the numerous Old Testament passages in which \\"the breath of God\\" is the vehicle or symbol not of life but of death and destruction ‚Äî an expression of the wrath of God: \\"by the breath of God they perish / and by the blast of his anger they are consumed\\" (Job 4:9, RSV).Cp. Isaiah 11:4 (\\"with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked\\"). The same power is attributed metaphorically to Christ: \\"The lawless one will be revealed, and the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of his mouth\\" (2 Thessalonians 2:8, RSV). Even less obvious passages could be associated with liturgical exsufflation. Jesse of Amiens, for example, interprets Psalm 34 (Vulg. 35):5 as descriptive of the fate of exsufflated devils: \\"\\"Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them on!\\"Psalm 34:5 (RSV) (Vulg. 35:5); Jesse of Amiens, Patrologia Latina 105:786D. And the apocryphal Acts of Thomas describes a baptismal ceremony which, though it does not explicitly contain a breathing ceremony, may imply one, \\"Let the gift come by which, breathing upon thine enemies, thou didst make them draw back and fall headlong, and let it dwell in this oil, over which we name thy holy name.\\"Acts of Thomas, ¬ß157; trans. in New Testament Apocrypha, ed. Edgar Hennecke; rev. by Wilhelm Schneemelcher; trans. R. McL. Wilson (Cambridge, 1992), 2:401. The Biblical allusion is apparently to John 18.6. God's breath can be fiery, consuming all it touches: \\"I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath\\" (Ezekiel 21:31, RSV).Vulg. \\"In igne furoris mei sufflabo in te.\\" Cp. the fiery brimstone breath of God in Isaiah 30:33. Some of the interpretations of exsufflation may reflect this. Cyril of Jerusalem, for example, when he discusses exsufflation in his catechetical sermons, interprets the liturgical practice in terms of fire: > \\"The breathing of the saints and the invocation of the name of God, like > fiercest flame, scorch and drive out evil spirits.\\"Catechesis XX.3, > Patrologia Graeca 33:1079/80; trans. Gifford, 147. In the pre-catechetical > lectures he seems to combine the fire of God's wrath and the Biblical motif > of the refiner's fire (Malachi 3:2, 1 Peter 1:7, Revelation 3:18): \\"as the > goldsmith..., as it were breathing on the gold which is hid in the hollow of > the forge, stimulates the flame it acts upon and so obtains what he is > seeking; so also exorcizers..., setting the soul on fire in the crucible of > the body, make the evil spirit flee.\\" Procatechesis ¬ß9; ed. F. L. Cross, 5-6 > (Patrologia Graeca 33:347/8-349/350); trans. Cross, 45. Fire remains a theme in later liturgical exorcisms, for devils, as Nicetas is reported to have said, \\"are purged by exorcisms as by fire\\":Nicetas quoted in Bouhot, De catechizandis rudibus, 225 (¬ß67). \\"we come against you, devil, with spiritual words and fiery speech; we ignite the hiding places in which you are concealed.\\"Liber Ordinum, ed. F√©rotin, 75; trans. in Kelly, 248 (cp. 237-37). Cp. Lambot, North Italian Services, 16. =Liturgical context= More importantly, perhaps, fire is physically and symbolically associated with sufflation because of the traditional placement of baptism within the Paschal vigil ‚Äî a setting heavy with symbolism of light and fire: the blessing of the Paschal candle, the lighting of the \\"new fire,\\" and the singing of the Exultet and the Lumen Christi. The intimate connection between divine breath and divine fire appears in its most visually arresting form during the benediction of the font, in which, according to most orders, the candle is dipped in the font while the priest declares the power of the Holy Spirit to have descended into the water: the sufflation of the font in most cases directly precedes or accompanies the immersion of the candle.Amalarius, Liber Officialis, I.xxv.2 (ed. Hanssens, 2:134-5) and I.xxvi (2:136-8); the Gellone Sacramentary, ed. Dumas, 99 (¬ß704d); many manuscripts of the Hadrianum (ed. Deshusses 1:188, ¬ß374e); Ordo Romanus L xxxix.50 (ed. Andrieu 5:280-1); the Missal of Robert of Jumi√®ge, 98-9; the York Manual, 15, 136*, 144*, 149*, 153*; Suntrup, 417-8. Their close association can again be illustrated from Wulfstan's baptismal homilies: > \\"By the breath that the priest breathes into the font when he blesses it, > the devil is straightway driven out from it. And when the priest dips the > consecrated candle in the water, then that water forthwith becomes imbued > with the Holy Ghost.\\"Wulfstan, Homily VIIIb (ed. Bethurum, p. 173, ll. > 39-43); cp. Homily VIIIa (p. 170, ll. 36-40) and Homily VIIIc (p. 179, ll. > 73-6). Similar considerations bind sufflation closely to imagery of light and darkness, specifically of the movement of the baptizand from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light (a very common theme), and to the sign of the cross (a very common action), among others that could be mentioned. John the Deacon uses light-dark imagery to explain exsufflation in exorcism as a transition: > The exsufflated person is exorcised so that ... having been delivered from > the power of darkness, he might be translated into the kingdom ... of > God.Wilmart, 172; thence also in many of the Carolingian expositions, e.g. > in Keefe's tet 32, ed. Friedrich Stegm√ºller, \\"Bischof Angilmodus √ºber die > Taufe...,\\" R√∂mische Quartalschrift f√ºr Christliche Altertumskunde und > Kirchengeschichte 52 (1957): 20; and text 25, the tract by Archbishop > Liedrad of Lyons, Patrologia Latina 99:856D. So also Augustine (\\"The church exsufflates and exorcises [infants] that the power of darkness might be cast out from them\\"Contra Julianum (opus imperf.) 1.50, ed. Michaela Zelzer, CSEL 85/1 (Vienna, 1974), 43 (Patrologia Latina 45:1073) Cp. 3.182, CSEL 85/1, 482 (PL 45:1323); the Contra Julianum 1.4.14 (PL 44:649), 1.5.19 (PL 44:653), 3.3.8 (PL 44:705), 3.5.11 (PL 44:707-8), and 6.5.11 (PL 44:828-9); and the Ennarationes in Psalmos 76.4, ed. E. Dekkers and J. Fraipont, CCSL 39 (1956), 1055.), and Isidore (\\"The power of the devil is ... exsufflated in them, so that ... being delivered from the power of darkness, [they] might be translated unto the kingdom of their Lord\\"De ecclesiastics officiis, II.xxi.3, ed. C. M. Lawson, CCSL 113 (1989), 96/20-24 (PL 83:815A), and thence into various Carolingian texts, e.g. the Pseudo- Maxentius Collectanea (= Keefe text 37), PL 106:54C.). And as regards signation (the sign of the cross), in Western texts from as early as the Gelasian Sacramentary, the one gesture almost always precedes (or precedes and follows) the other,Mohlberg, Sacramentarium Gelasianum 93 (¬ß598) (\\"exsufflas in faciem eius et facis ei crucem in fronte\\"); the same doublet is applied to the baptismal water in the Gellone Sacramentary, ed. A. Dumas, Liber Sacramentorum Gellonensis, CCSL 159 (1981), 335 (¬ß2317-18) and 346 (¬ß2379), and in the North Italian rituals, ed. Lambot, 33. Signing precedes and follows in the Missale Gothicum, ed. Neale, 96-97. and their significance is often complementary if not identical. In Raban Maur's discussion of the baptismal liturgy, for example, the exsufflation is said to expel the devil, the signing to keep him from coming back.Alois Kn√∂pfler, ed., Rabani Mauri de institutione clericorum, Ver√∂ffentlichungen aus dem kirchen-historischen Seminar M√ºnchen 5 (Munich, 1900), I.xxvii, p. 48 (PL 107:311D-12A). The two signs are frequently combined, the blowing done in the form of a cross, e.g. in the Syriac Rite described by James of Edessa,Whitaker, Documents, 59. in the modern Coptic rite,Lodi, 1557 in the late 9th-century Ordo Romanus XXXI,Andrieu, 3:502, ¬ß80 (\\"Anhelet in modum cruce\\"). in Wulfstan's Anglo-Saxon homilies and their Continental sources,Wulfstan, Homilies (ed. Bethurum), Homily VIIIa, p. 16; Theodulf of Orleans, De ordine baptismi, PL 105:225B. in the 10th-century Ambrosian rites for catechumen and font,Whitaker, 143, 145 in the 11th-century North Italian catechumenal rites,Lambot, 5, 6, 11, 16. in the 12th- through 15th-century English pontificals,York Manual, 144* (11th century), 149* (12th century), 150* (13th century), and 153* (15th century). in the Sarum Missal,J. W. Legg, ed., Sarum Missal, 129. and in the 13th-century Roman pontifical.Michel Andrieu, Le Pontifical Romain au Moyen Age (Vatican City, 1940), 2:514. Extra-liturgical (hagiographic and magical) use =Patristic period= There are hints in some of the Church Fathers that Christians had a habit of breathing (or hissing) at evil spirits as a recognized act of revulsion or repulsion, even apart from the ceremonies of the church. Tertullian is perhaps the best witness. He seems to be talking about an extra- liturgical casting out of demons by means of exsufflation and signing when he declares that gods rejected by Christians are driven from the bodies of men \\"by our touch and by our breath,\\" and are thus \\"carried away by the thought and vision of the fire [of judgment].\\"Tertullian, Apologeticus, 23.15-16, ed. Henricus Hoppe, CSEL 69 (1939), 67; trans. by A. Souter, Apology (Cambridge, 1917), 82/83. Cp. De Anima, 1.5, ed. J. W. Ph. Borleffs, CCSL 2 (1954), 782. He is talking about an ordinary gesture of aversion when he asks a Christian incense-dealer (regarded as hypocritical because he sells incense for polytheistic altars), \\"with what mouth, I ask, will he spit and blow before the fuming altars for which he himself provided? with what constancy will he [thus] exorcise his foster children?\\"Tertullian, De idolatria XI.7, ed. and tr. J. H. Waszink and J. C. M. Van Winden, Vigiliae Christianae Supplements 1 (Leiden, 1987), 42-5 (commentary, 210); also ed. J. W. Ph. Borleffs, CCSL 2 (1954), 111; trans. S. Thelwall, Ante-Nicene Fathers, 3:68. And his remarks to his wife about the dangers of mixed marriage suggest that exsufflation was a distinctively Christian practice: \\"[If you marry again, to a non-Christian,] shall you escape notice when you sign your bed or your body? when you blow away some impurity? When even by night you rise to pray?\\"Tertullian, Ad uxorem suam II.v.3, ed. and trans. Claude Munier, Tertullien: \\"A son Epouse,\\" Sources Chr√©tiennes 273 (Paris, 1980), 138 (CCSL 1 (1954), 389; PL 1:1296); trans. Thelwall, Ante-Nicene Fathers 4:46. If such a custom did exist, it would clarify certain remarks by other Fathers, which might otherwise seem merely metaphorical. Eusebius, for example, says of the saints that they were men \\"who though they only breathed and spoke, were able to scatter the counsels of evil demons.\\"Historia Ecclesiastica VII.x.4, ed. Eduard Schwartz, Eusebius Werke 2.2, Griechischen Christlichen Schriftsteller der ersten drei Jahrhunderte, 9 (Leipzig, 1908), 650 (Patrologia Graeca 20:659/60); trans. Arthur C. McGiffert, Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd series, 1:298. Irenaeus describes the right response to Gnostic doctrine as \\"reviling\\" (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÜœÖœÉŒ∑œÉŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ; literally exsufflantes).Adversus haereses 1.16.3, ed. A. Rousseau and Louis Doutreleau, Contre les H√©r√©sies 1, Sources Chr√©tiennes 263 (Paris, 1978), 262-3. Cyril of Jerusalem, speaking of resisting temptation, not of baptism, says that \\"the mere breathing of the exorcist becomes as a fire to that unseen foe.\\"Catechesis 16.19, Patrologia Graeca 33:945/6A-B; trans. Gifford, Nicene Fathers, 2nd series, 7:120. And Augustine's remarks about blowing on images of the emperor suggest that the significance of the gesture was well enough established to be actionable: \\"Of the great crime of lese majesty ... is he held guilty, according to the laws of this world, who blows upon an image ... of the emperor.\\"Contra Julianum, opus imperf. 3.199, CSEL 85/1:498 (PL 45:1333). Even as late as Bede, we may suspect that \\"exsufflate\\" in the sense of \\"revile\\" or \\"cast off\\" may be a living metaphor.Historia ecclesiastica, in Charles Plummer, ed., Baedae opera historica (Oxford, 1896), 1:2231 and 1:7; cp. 2:226n. Hagiography The extremely influential Life of Saint Martin by Sulpicius Severus seems to have set in motion a hagiographic tradition in which saints cast out demons or repel tempting devils by blowing at them.Vita Sancti Martini, ed. Carl Halm, CSEL 1.206-7 (cp. the Old English version in √Ülfric, Lives of the Saints, ed. W. W. Skeat, EETS 76 (1890), 292-3 (II.xxxi.42)). Of Saint Pachomius, for example, it is said that \\"defending his brow with the sign of the cross, he blew upon [the demon] and immediately he fled ‚Ä¶ ; blowing upon him, he said, 'depart from me, devil.'\\"Quoted in a note to Benedict of Aniane's Concordia regularum, PL 103:1020C-D. And of Saint Goswin that \\"a demon stood before Saint Goswin saying 'surely you see that I am Christ ‚Ä¶' and ‚Ä¶ therefore Saint Goswin exsufflated vigorously, saying 'depart foe ‚Ä¶,' and immediately ‚Ä¶ the devil vanished.\\"Anecdota ex codicibus hagiographicis Iohannis Gielemans canonici regularis in rubea valle prope Bruxelles, ed. Hagiographi Bollandiani (Brussels, 1895), 23 (Sanctilogium 9.2). Saint Justina is reported to have similarly unmasked a series of increasingly subtle and powerful demons, finally melting the prince of demons himself: \\"blowing upon the devil, she immediately melted him like wax and ‚Ä¶ felt herself freed from all temptation.\\"Th. Graese, ed., Jacobi Voragine Legenda Aurea ‚Ä¶, 3rd ed. (Vratislaviae, 1890), cap. cxlii (p. 634; cp. 633). And Saint Felix is said to have destroyed idols and uprooted sacred trees by like means.Graesse, ed., Legenda Aurea, cap. cxxvi (p.575) and cap. xix (102-3). The breath of the saints was credited with healing, as well as exorcistic, powers from an early period. Gregory of Nyssa says of Gregory Thaumaturgus ('Gregory the magician') that he needed to resort to \\"no finicking and laborious\\" magic, but \\"there sufficed, for both the casting out of demons and the healing of bodily ailments, the breath of his mouth.\\"PG 46:943/4A. Similar powers are attributed to the Irish saints: kindling lamps, curing dumbness.Charles Plummer, ed., Vitae Sanctorum Hiberniae (Oxford, 1910), 1:clxxviii. This theme, too, persists in later hagiographic and quasi-hagiographic texts, appearing, for example in the Estoire del saint graal as the agency by which a madman is miraculously restored. Among English texts, Felix's Life of Saint Guthlac relates that in order to give relief to a boy afflicted by madness, he \\"washed him in the water of the sacred font and, breathing into his face the breath of healing [or 'spirit of salvation'], drove away from him all the power of the evil spirit,\\"Bertram Colgrave, ed. and trans., Felix's Life of Saint Guthlac (Cambridge, 1956), 130/31. illustrating the difficulty of distinguishing healing from exorcism in an era in which madness was attributed to demonic possession. The miracle that Bishop John performed, according to Bede, on behalf of Herebald, is another example, since it involved a sufflation that was seemingly exorcistic, catechetical, and curative simultaneously.Bede, Historia ecclesiastica 5.6 (Plummer, 291; see also B. Colgrave and R. A. B. Myonrs, Bede's Ecclesastical History (Oxford, 1969), 468 note. Magic and folk medicine Tertullian remarked to his wife about Christian practices: \\"will you not seem to be doing magic?\\" in the eyes of a non-believer.Ad uxorem II.v.3 (ed. Munier, 138). For additional references to blowing in ancient magic, see Waszink's and Van Winden's notes to Tertullian's De idolatria, 210. Celsus (according to Origen) reports the use of exsufflation by Egyptian magicians.Origen, Contra Celsum 1.68, ed. Marcel Borret, Orig√®ne: \\"Contre Celse,\\" 1, Sources Chr√©tiennes 132 (Paris, 1967), 266 (PG 11:787/788A). Plotinus seems to attack its use by Roman ones.Plotinus, Enneads, II.ix.14, ed. and trans. A. H. Armstrong, Loeb Classical Library, vol. 2 (Cambridge, Mass., 1966), pp. 278/9. One of Lucian's tall tales mentions a Chaldean pest- control sorcerer who causes toads and snakes to vanish by blowing on them.M. D. Macleod, ed., Luciani opera, vol. 2 (Oxford, 1974), 182; trans. in \\"The Liar,\\" The Works of Lucian of Samosata, trans. H. W. and F. G. Fowler, vol. 3 (Oxford, 1905), 236. It is possible to see Jesus himself as a supernatural healer (Christ Jesus the son of God), in many popular events of the holy Bible, in which he is constantly healing many blind, lame, crippled, lepers, maimed, and even causing his own resurrection, just to name a few. In one instance Jesus used his spit to heal the eyes of a blind man who was born blind, caused by his parents sins;Gospel of John, KJV text, John 9:1-9:11. . However, regarding magic, in Syria, where ceremonial breathing became formalized as part of the rite of visitation of the sick. Ephraem Syrus advises that \\"if medicine fails you when you are sick, the 'visitors' will help, will pray for health, and one of them will breathe in your mouth, the other will sign you [with the sign of the cross].\\"Quoted by D√∂ger, Exorzismus, 125n. If it was either originally Christian (citation needed), Catholic or from the pagan practices, almost similar methods of healing have been reported, continuing until modern times: in Westphalia, the healing of a wound by triple signing and triple cruciform sufflation, or by exsufflation accompanied by a rhyming charm; and in Holland the alleviation of toothache by similar means.D√∂lger, 125. According to Drechsler, \\"Illnesses were blown away by the breath. If a child had bumped himself, one would blow three times on the place and it would 'fly away.'\\"Paul Drechsler, Sitte, Brauch, und Volksglaube im Schlesien, vol. 2 (Leipzig, 1906), 280. Cp. 298 and chapter 14, passim. Burns, and conditions that in some fashion resemble burns, such as fevers, boils, sore throats and rashes, are naturally the most common objects of blowing among modern folk-remedies,See HddA, i, s.v. \\"Blasen,\\" cols. 1357-58.

F. Thiselton-Dyer, English Folklore, 2nd rev. ed. (London, 1880), 170. But everything from jaundice, convulsions, and colic to bad luck and evil spells can apparently be alleviated by a bit of blowing.HddA, loc. cit.; cp. also the Puckett collection, nos. 23714, 23956, 23957, 9215, 25571, 19545, 9563, etc. Wolters points out that exorcistic blowing was still (in 1935) found in the custom of blowing over bread that is about to be eaten.Wolters cites Drechsler 2:15, a passage that describes how to avert the bad luck of biting into a piece of bread already bitten. Moreover, > A Syrian blows over his child to avert the evil eye.

Wolters, Notes on Antique Folklore on the basis of > Pliny's \\"Natural History\\" Bk. XXVIII.22-29 (Amsterdam, 1935), 102. Finally, in one American example of superstition clearly derived from liturgical use, it is said that if at the baptism of a baby one turns at the door and blows three times, one can successfully prevent the devil from ever coming between the baby and the altar.Puckett Collection, no. 3294 (reported from Cleveland, Ohio, 1956).

(17 October 1623 ‚Äì 28 September 1687; also known as Francis Turretin) was a Genevan-Italian Reformed scholastic theologian. Turrettini is especially known as a zealous opponent of the theology of the Academy of Saumur (embodied by Moise Amyraut and called Amyraldianism), as an earnest defender of the Calvinistic orthodoxy represented by the Synod of Dort, and as one of the authors of the Helvetic Consensus, which defended the formulation of predestination from the Synod of Dort and the verbal inspiration of the Bible. Life He was the grandson of Francesco Turrettini, who left his native Lucca in 1574 and settled in Geneva in 1592. Francis was born to B√©n√©dict Turrettini at Geneva on 17 October 1623 and died there on 28 September 1687. He studied theology at Geneva (1640‚Äì1644), Leiden (1644), Utrecht, Paris (1645‚Äì1646), Saumur (1646‚Äì1648), Montauban, and N√Æmes. In Paris he also studied philosophy under Roman Catholic Pierre Gassendi. Returning to his native city, he was made pastor of the Italian church there from 1648 to 1687, of the French congregation from 1653-1687, and professor of theology at the University of Geneva in 1653. He is the father of Jean-Alphonse Turrettini, who would do much to dismantle the theology his father promoted. Works His Institutio Theologiae Elencticae (3 parts, Geneva, 1679‚Äì1685) was the culmination of Reformed scholasticism. The Institutes uses the scholastic method to dispute a number of controversial issues. In it he defended the view that the Bible is God's verbally inspired word. He also argued for infralapsarianism and federal theology. The Institutes was widely used as a textbook, up to its use at Princeton Theological Seminary by the Princeton theologians only to be replaced by Charles Hodge's Systematic Theology in the late 19th century. Of his other disputations, his most important are De Satisfactione Christi disputationes (1666) and De necessaria secessione nostra ab Ecclesia Romana et impossibili cum ea syncretismo (published in 1687). He wrote the Helvetic Consensus, a Reformed confession written against Amyraldianism, with J. H. Heidegger in 1675. Turrettini greatly influenced the Puritans, but until recently, he was a mostly forgotten Protestant scholastic from the annals of church history, though the English translation of his Institutes of Elenctic Theology is increasingly read by students of theology. John Gerstner called Turrettini \\"the most precise theologian in the Calvinistic tradition.\\" Free Choice Along the lines of Reformed theology, Turrettini argues that after the fall human beings did not lose the faculty of will itself. \\"The inability to do good is strongly asserted, but the essence of freedom is not destroyed\\" (Institutio theologiae elencticae, 10.2.9). They still have liberty which is not repugnant to certain kinds of necessity. For Turrettini, neither the entities of the will nor the intellect are either the sole faculty of free will, which is rather conceived of their plurality as a mixed faculty. \\"As it belongs to the intellect with regard to the decision of choice, so it belongs to the will with regard to freedom\\" (Institutio theologiae elencticae, 10.1.4). Turrettini distinguishes six kinds of necessity (Institutio, 10.2.4-9): physical necessity, necessity of coercion, necessity of dependence on God, rational necessity, moral necessity, and necessity of event. The first two among these six necessities are incompatible with freedom, whereas the latter four are not only compatible with freedom but perfect it. For example, treating upon the compatibility of moral necessity, Turrettini asserts, despite the fact that a will can be rendered \\"slavish\\" if determined by habit to a manner of action, that \\"this servitude by no means overthrows the true and essential nature of liberty\\" (Institutio theologiae elencticae, 10.2.8). For Turrettini, freedom does not arise from an indifference of the will. No rational beings are indifferent to good and evil. The will of an individual human being is never indifferent in the sense of possessing an equilibrium, either before or after the fall. Turrettini defines freedom with the notion of rational spontaneity (Institutio, 10.2.10‚Äì11). Turrettini's doctrine of freedom appears to be similar to that of Scotus in that both of them endorse Aristotelian logic: the distinction between the necessity of the consequent (necessitas consequentis) and the necessity of the consequence (necessitas consequentiae); the distinction between in sensu composito and in sensu diviso. It is not Scotus's notion of synchronic contingency but Aristotle's modal logic which is incorporated into Turrettini's doctrine of freedom. Moreover, the Scotistic ideas about necessity and indifference differ greatly from those of Turrettini. Turrettini develops the discussion on necessity and relates it to his argument about human freedom of choice. His careful rejection of the notion of indifference in the doctrine of freedom creates a big gap between his doctrine and that of Scotus. Turrettini's teaching of contingency emphasizes the sovereign act of God in the process of conversion, whereas Scotus's contingency theory blurs it. Turrettini is not a Scotist, but a Reformed theologian standing in a more ‚Äúgeneric Aristotelian tradition.‚Äù  English translations * Institutes of Elenctic Theology.

The Syriac Bible of Paris (Paris, Biblioth√®que Nationale, MS syr. 341) is an illuminated Bible written in Syriac. It dates to 6th or 7th century. It is believed to have been made in northern Mesopotamia. The manuscript has 246 extant folios. Large sections of text and the accompanying illustrations are missing. The folios are 312 by 230 mm. For reasons of economy, the text is written in three columns. The illumination consists of miniatures introducing each of the books of the Bible and set into one or two of the text columns. The miniature for the Book of Genesis which may have been the most sumptuous miniature is missing. Although most of the miniatures are full length author portraits, some depict scenes from the following book. For example, the miniature before the Book of Job depicts Job on the dung heap. This miniature combine several scenes from the Book of Job. Job is pictured lying naked on the dung heap, covered with sores. Below him his wife is talking to him. To the left are his three friends. One of them is seen rending his garments, while the other two are seated, and talking to him. The Book of Exodus also has a narrative miniature before it. It depicts Moses and Aaron requesting permission to depart from Pharaoh. It is hard to understand why this scene, rather than one of the many more popular scenes was chosen to be the sole illustration for Exodus. Other miniatures are allegorical groups. The miniature before the Book of Proverbs shows the Virgin and Child, flanked by Solomon, representing the wisdom of the Old Testament, and Ecclesia, a personification of the Christian Church. Only one New Testament miniature survives, that of James the Apostle. The miniatures show mixture of Hellenistic heritage and a native Syriac tradition. Some of the miniatures, especially the miniature before Exodus, show stylistic similarities to the miniatures in the Rabula Gospels. Based on this it is unlikely that this manuscript was made much later than were the Rabula Gospels of 586. The manuscript is assumed to have come from the Episcopal library of Siirt near Lake Van, where it may have been produced. It has been in the Biblioth√®que Nationale since 1909.

On 9 March 1995, Canadian officials from the Canadian Fisheries Patrol vessel Cape Roger boarded the Spanish fishing trawler Estai from Galicia in international waters off Canada's east coast baseline after firing three 50-caliber machine-gun bursts over its bow. They arrested the trawler's crew then forced the Estai to a Canadian harbour. Canada claimed that European Union factory ships were illegally overfishing Greenland halibut (also known as Greenland turbot) in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) regulated area on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, just outside Canada's declared exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Prelude Territorial seas have changed over time, having begun with a \\"cannon shot\\" territorial sea, followed by the long-standing extension to a standard. The economic control of the waters surrounding nations to a exclusive economic zones (EEZ) was agreed at the conference on the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982, and became recognised internationally on 14 November 1994. As a self-governing colony and dominion, Newfoundland's foreign policy, just as Canada's, was established by the British government until the Statute of Westminster 1931. However, in 1934, Newfoundland's government voted to be put under the administration of a commission appointed by London; this situation remained until 1949 when the dominion entered Canadian Confederation. Following Confederation, Canada recognized many of the foreign policy agreements Newfoundland had entered into under this commission. During the 1950s to the 1970s, domestic and foreign fishing fleets became increasingly industrialized, with massive factory freezer trawlers fishing out of Newfoundland ports. Foreign fleets were based in Newfoundland and could fish offshore, while domestic fleets could fish in both the territorial sea and the offshore. Many nations worldwide declared 200-nautical-mile EEZs, including the United States; Canada did so too in 1977. The EEZ boundaries became a foreign policy issue where overlapping claims existed, as was the case between Canada and the United States in the Gulf of Maine, Dixon Entrance, Strait of Juan de Fuca and Beaufort Sea, as well as between Canada and France in the case of St. Pierre and Miquelon. Between 1973 and 1982 the United Nations and its member states negotiated the Third Convention of the Law of the Sea‚Äîone component of which was the concept of nations being allowed to declare an EEZ. Although not adopted into international law until 1982, the possibility of declaring an EEZ became a de facto reality in 1977 with the conclusion of those sections of the Third Conference negotiations relating to maritime boundary and economic control. By the 1970s the overfishing by industrial vessels in the waters of the other provinces of eastern Canada was evident, although each subsequent federal government continued to ignore this problem and even contributed to it by using the issuance of fishing licenses for more inshore and offshore domestic vessels. After the Canadian declaration of its 200 nautical mile EEZ in 1977, on the whole, fishermen in eastern Canada could fish unhindered out to the limit without fear of competing with foreign fleets. The Canadian government provided subsidies to increase the domestic fishing fleet and the local industry. At the same time the annual Total Allowable Catch (TAC) was set so high that fishing mortality was double that of the stock's Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Canada's domestic offshore fleet grew as fishermen and fish processing companies rushed to take advantage. It was also during this time when it was noticed that the foreign fleets now pushed out to offshore and excluded from the rich Canadian waters, were increasing their harvest in the small areas of the Grand Banks that were outside the area of the EEZ. Canada's own fishery scientists assumed that only 5% of the Northern cod stocks was living in international waters regulated by NAFO. 95% of the cod stock was living inside the Canadian EEZ, where only Canadian vessels were allowed to fish. By the late 1980s, smaller catches of Northern Cod were being reported along the Atlantic coast of Canada as the federal government and citizens of coastal regions in the area began to face the reality that domestic and foreign overfishing had taken its toll. In the end, stocks of cod in and around Canada's EEZ were severely depleted. Reluctant to act at a time of declining political popularity, the federal government was finally forced to take drastic action in 1992 and a total moratorium was declared indefinitely for the Northern Cod. The TAC for both the Canadian EEZ and NAFO regulated area was based on Canadian scientific advice. This turned out to be wrong and the Northern cod stock collapsed in 1992, and has never recovered. The immediate impact was felt most in Newfoundland, followed by the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia. The nascent Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, organised after the 1977 EEZ declarations to coordinate conservation efforts in Canada, the United States, and member nations in Europe (both western and eastern bloc countries), also declared a ban, however it was implemented too late to be effective. Cod which five to ten years before was being caught in record numbers, had vanished almost overnight to the point where it was considered for endangered species protection. The economic impact in coastal Newfoundland was unprecedented. To lessen the impact that its policies of permitting overfishing had exacted upon rural Newfoundlanders, the federal government swiftly created a relief program called \\"The Atlantic Groundfish Strategy\\" (TAGS) to provide short- to medium- term financial support, and employment retraining for the longer term. Despite TAGS, Newfoundland and coastal Nova Scotian communities began to experience an out-migration on a scale not seen in Canada since the prairie dust bowls of the 1930s. The anger at federal political figures was palpable. With the wholesale rejection of short-term Prime Minister Kim Campbell, incoming Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien's Liberals were going to face the ongoing wrath of voters whose entire livelihoods had been decimated as a result of decades of federal neglect and mismanagement, and whose communities, property values, net worth, and way of life were declining rapidly. Brian Tobin was the Canadian politician who was largely responsible for managing the conflict. This earned him the nicknames \\"Captain Canada\\" and \\"The Turbotonator\\". In the years since the cod moratorium, federal fisheries policy makers and scientists attempted to find a replacement species that could at least reinject economic stimulus into the affected regions. The ground fishery, while a fraction of what it had been during the cod years, did have some bright spots‚Äîone of which was the Greenland halibut commonly known in Canada as turbot. Demand for the turbot had decreased because of a common dislike for the taste in the European Union. Canada was not alone in recognising the growing value of the turbot, and foreign fishing fleets operating off the 200-nautical-mile EEZ were also beginning to pursue the species in increasing numbers, as a response to the Northern cod moratorium. But the Turbot was not a fish under quota regulation in NAFO until the autumn of 1994 when it established a catch limit. Prior to the catch limit, Spanish vessels had explored turbot fishery on the Nose and Tail of the Grand Banks. The Canadians claimed that the Turbot had relocated outside their EEZ to deeper waters, and they should have quotas based on their historical fisheries inside its EEZ. On the other hand, the Spanish and Portuguese (EU) claimed that this was an unexplored stock. Since they were the ones to explore the stocks initially, Spain and Portugal should have historic rights to the turbot fishery on the Grand Banks nose and tail, based on their historical catches, the total reported annual catches grew steadily from 27,000 t in 1990 to 62,000 t in 1994, when the Spanish and Portuguese vessels started to explore this fishery after other stocks were closed. Based on this catch history, the two countries claimed they should have 75% of the total turbot quota. The turbot issue came before NAFO's annual meeting in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, on 19‚Äì23 September 1994. After questioning the scientists' advice, the EU proposed a TAC of 40,000 t; Canada argued for 15,000 t. The meeting ultimately settled on 27,000 t. Since agreement was not reached until the final day, a special meeting was scheduled for Brussels on 30 January ‚Äì 1 February 1995, to establish a distribution key for allocating quotas among the contracting parties. The EU approved the overall catch limit at the December meeting of the Fisheries Council over the objections of Spain and Portugal, who argued that the EU should set an autonomous quota of 30,000 t on the basis that scientific evidence allowed for a 40,000 t TAC, even though NAFO's Scientific Council had pointedly refrained from recommending a figure.North Atlantic Fisheries Organization, Report of the Fisheries Commission, 16th Annual Meeting, 19‚Äì23 September 1994, Dartmouth, NS, Canada, NAFO/Fc Doc 94/13; Canada and NAFO had tracked about 50 violations of boats crossing the 200-nautical-mile EEZ limit to fish illegally within Canadian waters, as well as recording use of illegal gear and overfishing outside Canadian waters. There was a growing concern in Canada that the turbot stock, like the Northern cod in 1992, was also threatened by a collapse. In October 1994, Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Brian Tobin, contacted the Spanish and Portuguese ambassadors and asked them to honour the NAFO regulation requiring countries to inspect their flag vessels to insure that they were following the NAFO technical regulations. No improvement occurred. In 1993, the NAFO council had already decided to introduce and test new inspection measures, such as on- board observers, on 10% of the vessels fishing in NAFO-regulated waters outside the Canadian EEZ and Vessel Monitoring System (VMS). The European Commission had tried to extend its jurisdiction and the power of its inspectors in 1993, but had been turned down by the EU council. However the EU council could only try to persuade national governments to follow the internationally agreed rules as well as the rules within EU waters. Brian Tobin, directed the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), along with the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) to begin a very aggressive dialogue with the European Union over the presence of its fishing fleet and its practices, particularly the use of illegal trawl nets just outside the Canadian EEZ while fishing for turbot. Tobin's critics in Canada noted that he was likely using his department as a political prop to shore up support during a time of increased social unrest in Maritime Canada, yet in the winter of 1995, Tobin directed DFO to establish a legal argument which could be made for the seizure of a foreign vessel in international waters using the premise of conservation. At the December 1994, NAFO conference, in Brussels, both the EU and Canada claimed 75% of the agreed 27,000 tonnes TAC for turbot in the NAFO-regulated area. Both parties cited their historical catches‚Äî Canada before 1992 and the EU its catches after 1992. The Canadian position was that it objected to the use of historic catches. Instead it argued the special interest of the coastal state in UNCLOS should be used for setting the national quotas. On 1 March 1995, the EU Council ignored a last- minute plea from Canada and unanimously agreed to invoke the objection procedure under the NAFO agreement and to set a unilateral quota of 18,630t (69% of the TAC). Tobin tried to put the Law of the Seas principles on coastal states' special interest to the test, as a first mover. Initially Tobin had tried to persuade his Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make a unilateral extension of the Canadian EEZ to the entire Grand Banks. This was rejected by the Canadian prime minister. Instead Tobin declared that on 3 March 1995, the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act regulations had been broadened to make it an offence for Spanish and Portuguese vessels to fish for turbot on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks. On 6 March 1995, Tobin managed to have the Canadian cabinet authorise this extension of the law. The same day, an EU reply came in a strongly worded message from the Foreign Affairs Council which defended the EU's right to use the NAFO objection procedure, restated its commitment to conservation, and condemned the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act as a violation of international law. Sections of the Canadian government agreed with the EU opinion on the unlawfullnes of Canada arresting EU vessels outside the Canadian EEZ. There were strong opponents in the Canadian cabinet, from the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence and within the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), who had different concerns over confronting the European Union, an allied NATO member. Tobin managed to frame the issue and gain the support of the prime minister. This settled the issue in the cabinet; it was persuaded to arrest a Spanish vessel if diplomacy failed. The Estai incident Minister Tobin and the federal cabinet then told the DFO to demonstrate Canadian resolve on the issue by \\"making an example\\" of a European Union fishing vessel. On 9 March 1995, an offshore patrol aircraft detected the Spanish stern trawler Estai in international waters outside Canada's 200-nautical-mile EEZ. Armed DFO patrol vessels, Cape Roger, Leonard J. Cowley and Canadian Coast Guard ship , intercepted and pursued Estai, which cut its weighted trawl net and fled after an initial boarding attempt. A chase that lasted several hours ended after the Canadian Fisheries Patrol vessel Cape Roger fired a .50 calibre machine gun across the Estais bow. The Sir Wilfred Grenfell used high-pressure fire-fighting water cannon to deter other Spanish fishing vessels from disrupting the operation. Finally, armed DFO Fishery Officers and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers boarded Estai in international waters on the Grand Banks. Estai was escorted to St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, arriving with great fanfare across the province and region‚Äîand the country. Canada's federal court processed the case and the charges against the crew while Spain and the European Union protested vehemently, threatening boycotts against Canada and wishing to have the case heard at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands. On 11 March 1995, The Spanish Navy deployed the Atalaya to protect its country's fishing vessels. The Spanish Navy also prepared a surface task group with frigates and tankers, but Spain eventually decided against sending it. Tobin and his department ignored the controversy and instead had the oversized trawl net which Estai had cut free salvaged. The DFO contracted a Fishery Products International ground fish trawler to drag for Estais trawl. On the first attempt it retrieved the Estais net which had been cut. It was found that Estai was using a liner with a mesh size smaller than permitted by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO). The net was shipped to New York City where Tobin called an international press conference on board a rented barge in the East River outside the United Nations headquarters. There, the net from Estai was displayed, hanging from an enormous crane, and Tobin used the occasion to shame the Spanish and EU governments, pointing out the small size of the holes in the net which are illegal in Canada. Spain never denied that the net was from Estai but continued to protest Canada's use of \\"extra-territorial force\\". The Spanish government asked the International Court of Justice for leave to hear a case claiming that Canada had no right to detain Estai. However, the court later refused to hear the case. Later, Canada released the crew of Estai. On the same day that Tobin was in New York, the United Kingdom blocked an EU proposal to impose sanctions on Canada. Tobin claimed that Canada would not enter into negotiations as long as illegal fishing continued, and demanded the withdrawal of all fishing vessels in the area as a precondition. On 15 March, the owners of Estai posted a bond for the vessel, and it was returned to Spain. Subsequently, the rest of the fishing fleet also left the area, and preliminary talks were scheduled for the upcoming G7 conference. These talks failed, as the Spanish refused to change their position, and Spanish fishing vessels subsequently returned to Grand Banks. Spain also implemented a visa mandate for all Canadians visiting, or planning to visit the country. This resulted in several Canadians being deported from Spain who had been there legally until the moment the visa mandate was adopted. The visa mandate was later overturned by the EU in 1996. Negotiations ceased on 25 March, and the following day, Canadian ships cut the nets of the Portuguese trawler Pescamero Uno. The Spanish Navy responded by deploying a second patrol boat. Canadian warships and patrol planes in the vicinity were authorized by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien to fire on Spanish vessels that exposed their guns. On 27 March 1995, Emma Bonino, the EU Fisheries Commissioner, called the seizure \\"an act of organised piracy\\". The Spanish demanded that the Canadian government return the ship to its captain and crew along with its catch of Greenland halibut, or turbot. They said Estai was fishing in international waters. Direct negotiations between the EU and Canada eventually restarted, and a deal was reached on 5 April. Spain, however, rejected it, demanding better terms. After Canada threatened to forcibly remove Spanish fishing vessels, the EU pressured Spain into finally reaching a settlement on 15 April. Canada reimbursed the $500,000 that had been paid for Estais release, repealed the CFPR provision that allowed the arrest of Spanish vessels, and a reduction of Canada's own turbot allocation. A new international regime to observe EU and Canadian fishing vessels was also created. making a number trial measures permanent, as on board observers and VMS. The dispute raised Brian Tobin's political profile, helping to preserve his political career in Newfoundland at a time when federal politicians were being increasingly vilified. It also led to his decision in 1996 to pursue to the leadership of the Liberal Party of Newfoundland following the resignation of Premier Clyde Wells, as well as a widely discussed future possibility for leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada.  The international impact  At the New York conference the Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement, which implemented the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks was signed in December 1995. Tobin framed it as a result of the Canadian stand off with Europe, which found domestic support. The conference in fact repeatedly rejected proposals that would have conflicted with the Law of the Sea convention, such as provisions that would have given coastal states fishery jurisdiction beyond 200 miles. In the years to come Canada underwent more hardship. On the other hand, Canadian fishing workers on Canada's east coast applauded the conviction that Canada was acting as an environmental safeguard against over exploitation, but the jobs in the fishing industry had disappeared. The distant water fleets felt that Canada had destroyed the cod stocks and wanted everyone else to pay part of the cost. The 2001 Helsinor meeting in Denmark was a turning point for NAFO and Canada. It marked the beginning of the end of Canada's coastal state dominance of NAFO, the decline of Canada's influence in protecting the fish stocks of the Northwest Atlantic, and the start of the EU's ascendance into the leadership position that Canada had filled for some 25 years. It began when Canada pushed a decision on depth limits for turbot fisheries to a vote, and for the first time lost. This caused a lot of domestic concern in Canada, and Canada basically required that the NAFO treaty should be changed. In September 2005, the contracting parties agreed to begin the task of reforming NAFO with an EU-Canadian ad-hoc working group chaired by the EU. This came as a result of growing pressure from Canada to reform NAFO. In 2006 the working group came out with its first draft proposals based on The North East Atlantic Fishery Commission (NEAFC) treaty. It gave much more power to the distant water fleet states than the old 1979 NAFO treaty. Some of the first drafts also gave NAFO the right to regulate fisheries within Canada's EEZ. The Draft proposals also changed the voting procedures so a two-thirds majority vote had to be present. But it also changed the objection procedure, that had made it possible for the EU to claim that Canada broke international law, when the EU objected to the turbot quota allocated to the EU in 1995, and Canada seized Estai. The new treaty amendments were presented in September 2007 and went into force in May 2017, after two-thirds of the contracting parties had ratified the agreement. The Newlyn incident Although Spain was getting political support from the EU (including naval support from Germany among others), the United Kingdom and Ireland supported Canada. The then prime- minister John Major risked his status within the EU community by speaking out against Spain. Because of this, some British fishing boats took to flying Canadian flags to show their support. This brought the conflict to European waters when a Cornish fishing boat, Newlyn, then flying the Canadian flag, was arrested by a French ship that believed it to be Canadian. This dragged Britain from its position of passive backing into full support of the Canadians. Overnight, Canadian flags began to fly from all manner of British and Irish vessels. The rest of the EU rallied behind France and Spain, but hesitated to make any mobilizations against the British, Irish, or Canadians. Upon hearing the news of the conflict, Iceland spoke up and took the side of the EU against Britain in light of their similar conflict with the British, back in the 1970s, known as the Cod Wars. No military mobilization took place. Iceland tried to put political pressure on the United Kingdom and Ireland. The British and the Irish pointedly ignored these actions and continued their unquestioned support of Brian Tobin and the Canadians. In the end Newlyn was returned to the British without further incident.

They are thought to be the people who developed the port of Dor in Canaan during the 12th century BCE from a small Bronze Age town to a large city. Origin As with other Sea Peoples, the origins of the Tjeker are uncertain. Their name is an Egyptian exonym, usually romanized as tkr, and expanded as Tjekru or Djekker.

They have sometimes been identified with the Sicels of Sicily, who are also linked to Shekelesh: another exonym attributed to a different group amongst the Sea Peoples. Another theory, put forward by Flinders Petrie, links the ethnonym to Zakros, in eastern Crete.James Baikie mentioned it on pp. 166, 187 of his book The Sea-Kings of Crete, 2nd edition (Adam and Charles Black, London, 1913).

The city was violently destroyed in the mid-11th century BCE, with the conflagration turning the mud bricks red and depositing a huge layer of ash and debris.

The Tjeker are perhaps one of the few Sea Peoples for whom a ruler's name is recorded ‚Äî in the 11th-century papyrus account of Wenamun, an Egyptian priest, the ruler of Dor is given as \\"Beder\\".

It is the closest town with rail and bus connections to Poloniny National Park. History The oldest written records mentioning Snina date back to 1317. Snina as an oppidum (small town) is mentioned in port records (\\"porta\\" means the gate into a courtyard) beginning in 1585. In 1598 the first census of houses was made and there were 75 houses in the town at that time. Between 1570 and 1630, it is evident from port records that Snina was the seat of the regional kraj≈àa, or administrative district for the surrounding villages. In 1646 Snina was called \\"Szinna Varossa\\" and later \\"Civitas Szinna\\" in the archives. In 1785 Snina had 195 houses and 1,430 inhabitants. The town's rulers from 1321 to 1684 were from the Drugeth family, who came from Salerno near Naples. Later, the owner of the lordship of Snina was Ter√©zia van Dern√°thov√°, who was the granddaughter of ≈Ωigmung Drugeth. After her death in 1799, her five sons sold all the property to a businessman from Gemer named Jozef Rholl. His children developed the region until 1857. They built an iron and steel works in the Jozef valley in 1809. Starting in 1839 a traditional market took place in Snina four times a year, which aided the development of business and trade. An iron foundry was built in the Jozef valley in 1841. A well-known moulded statue of Hercules was placed next to the Snina manor-house and is the emblem of Snina to this day. During a decline in business in 1873, the iron and steel works completely vanished, so life for the citizens of Snina and its vicinity worsened rapidly and large-scale migration began. They left their homes and went to the United States, Canada and western Europe. In 1876 Snina was a residence of the 10th region of the Zempl√≠n area. The Roman Catholic classicist church from 1751 was modified at the beginning of the 19th century. A classicist Calvary in the cemetery dates from 1847, and features the Chapel of Virgin Mary. There is a manor-house from 1800 in the town set in a planned historical park, which is from the 19th century. In the courtyard of the manor-house is a public fountain with a well-known statue of Hercules from 1841. In the church's park there are monuments from World War II. There are also two military cemeteries from World War I near the town (Giglov has 130 graves of soldiers and Brehy has 153). On May 1, 1949, construction of the Vihorlat Enterprise began, and production started on July 15, 1951. The construction and extension of the enterprise, which was aimed at medium heavy engineering production, created further employment opportunities in construction organisations, services and trade. Along with the development of industry and services, housing developed. Housing estates and new family houses were constructed. The largest number of flats and family houses were built here between 1975 and 1990 for families displaced by the construction of the Starina reservoir, when the inhabitants of seven villages had to be moved out. Demographics According to the 2001 census, the town had 21,235 inhabitants. 86.78% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 5.84% Rusyns, 2.51% Ukrainian, 1.86% Roma and 0.58% Czechs. The religious make-up was 56.03% Roman Catholics, 19.21% Greek Catholics, 13.59% Orthodox, 5.90% people with no religious affiliation and 0.30% Lutherans.

It was built in 1979 specifically as a tourist center, around a large artificial harbour that provides mooring with 340 berths for luxury yachts, hosting sporting activities from water skiing to paragliding, and several golf courses. The 36-hole PGA approved championship course makes Port El Kantaoui a popular destination for golfing. The architecture, although modern and dazzlingly white, has been modeled on the more traditional buildings in Tunisia, complete with narrow streets and arches.

In style, the port area Port El Kantaoui is designed as a white and blue Tunisian style village with reproduced medina quarter and cobblestone streets. It is popular with package holiday visitors, families, and first-time visitors, however, its extensive landscaping and detachment from the true Tunisia bring critics; most notably the Rough Guide has described Port El Kantaoui as \\"Tunisia without tears ... artificial, soulless, even anemic\\".

Simultaneously, the covered mortgage bondsHousing finance in the global financial market, CGFS Publications No 26, January 2006; Box 3 transfer market risk from the issuing mortgage bank to bond investors. Lastly, strict property appraisal rules, credit risk management by the mortgage banks, and tight regulations including the so-called 'balance principle', have also historically shielded mortgage bonds from default risk.International Monetary Fund: The Danish Mortgage Market ‚Äî A Comparative Analysis, IMF Country Report No. 07/123, March 2007 High industry concentration and automatic stabilizers also play a role in maintaining stability.Michael Simkovic, Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization In Denmark, the mortgage banks are the only financial institutions allowed to grant loans against mortgage on real property by issuing covered mortgage bonds (). The scope of activities allowed to mortgage banks is limited to the origination and servicing of mortgage loans, their funding, exclusively through the issuance of mortgage bonds, and activities deemed accessory. As of 2007, there are eight mortgage banks active in the Danish mortgage market, some affiliated with commercial banks.  General  = The \\"balance principle\\"= The Danish Mortgage Credit Act imposes strict matching rules between the assets (e.g., mortgage loans) and the liabilities (e.g., mortgage bonds) of mortgage credit institutions. Each new loan is in principle funded by the issuance of new mortgage bonds of equal size and identical cash flow and maturity characteristics, dubbed the balance principle or, in,Housing Finance Systems for countries in Transition - Principles and Examples. United Nations, New York and Geneva, 2005 the balanced book principle (p. 29). The proceeds from the sale of the bonds are passed to the borrower and similarly, interest and principal payments are passed directly to investors holding mortgage bonds. Moreover, the Mortgage Credit Act establishes strict lending rules which differ depending on the type of property financed. Maximum loan to value (LTV) ratios and lending periods are set up for each category of property. While for all categories of properties, the maximum lending period can be up to 30 years, maximum lending limits differ significantly according to the nature of the mortgaged property. For owner-occupied homes, rental properties, cooperative homes and housing projects, mortgage loans can represent up to 80 percent of the value of the property. In contrast, maximum LTV ratios are limited to 70 percent for agricultural properties, 60 percent for commercial real estate and secondary residences, and 40 percent for un-built sites. The first Danish Mortgage Act was passed in 1850, establishing new mortgage credit institutions which were cast as (non-profit) associations. Loans against mortgages on real property are financed by issuing bonds in series. Initially, borrowers were jointly liable for the liabilities of the corresponding pool of mortgages. The system kept evolving thereafter, in particular in the early 1970s, when mortgage financing was simplified and standardized. The last major round of reform took place in 1989, among others authorizing commercial banks to own mortgage credit institutions. After 2001, the majority of mortgage bonds were issued without the joint liability of borrowers. = Property registration and the granting of a loan = A mortgage system depends on the effective registration of property units and rights in land. The cadastre, maintained by the National Survey and Cadastre, identifies each land parcel and property unit. The identification is used by other national information systems.http://www.domstol.dk/om/otherlanguages/english/thedanishjudicialsystem/landregistrationcourt/Pages/default.aspx The Land Registration Court handles registration of titles to land, mortgages and other charges. The mortgage banks grant a loan only on condition that the mortgage deed is registered, but without any other type of security. Also, a very detailed credit check isn't done on the borrower; the collateral of the loan is the property, rather than the borrower. The details of the process of setting up a mortgage loan are described in English.Property formation in the Nordic countries - Denmark. National Survey and Cadastre (2008) 111-114. The Municipalities of Denmark maintain information systems, recording among others zoning, building construction details and taxable value, and the tax authorities maintain a mass appraisal system. Both latter systems are updated through compulsory abstracting of title deeds, collected through the municipalities.Ejendomsregistrering i de nordiske lande (Property Registration in the Nordic Countries). Kort og Matrikelstyrelsen. 2006 =Foreclosure= In the event of non-payment of its mortgage-related obligations by the mortgagor, the mortgage bank may put the property up for a forced sale. Forced sales are carried through by enforcement courts (Fogedretten), which are part of the ordinary system of courts. Mortgagees will be covered in order of priority and while uncovered mortgage loans will be deleted from the Land Register, the mortgagees will keep their (uncovered) claim against the borrower as a personal claim. It typically takes no more than six months from the time when the borrower defaults on the loan until a forced sale can be carried through. This is in contrast with France, say, where it can take several years to foreclose. The human costs of turning a family into the street are mitigated through social housing. Denmark has a total housing stock of 2.5 million housing units, of which 19 per cent belong to social housing associations. The associations are subsidised by the government and municipalities in terms of reduced interest and mortgage repayments and loan guarantees. Also the residents - as in other rented housing - receive individual rent subsidies related to income, size of household and size of apartment. People in acute need of housing can turn to the municipality for help if they are without possibilities to solve their own housing problem. Foreclosure is mentioned as a cause among other causes, e.g. divorce, cf. page 59 in Socialministeriet (2006) Den almene boligsektors fremtid. 98% of Danish mortgages are securitized to mortgage-backed securities and sold by the mortgage originators. Business =Process walk-through= * Mortgage banks which obtain application data and review documentation and appraisals of originators who propose mortgages. * Each mortgage bank, every day, issues new bonds valued at one cent each into an existing bond pool in an amount equivalent to the new loans it makes that day. The money manager of the mortgage institute decides when to sell the new bonds into the secondary market since they are identical to other bonds in the same series. * In event of a rise or drop in interest rates, a new bond pool may be started at a rate ¬Ω percent different than its predecessor, but the yields are equivalent. * The bond prices trade and are quoted at day end and there is inter day pricing. The amount of cash transferred by the mortgage institute to the originator (borrower) is based on the number of bonds issued and their previous day‚Äôs quote. * Every time a loan balance is reduced, an equivalent number of bonds are identified by lottery and converted into a different bond also with a one cent par value (that will convert at par into cash at the next payment date). This and the fact that originally bonds issued equal the full amount of the loan, enforce the Balance Principle. * Loan prepayments can be made by using cash with some advance notice requirements so the bond market can anticipate what is coming. In effect a contract is made in advance that the cash presented will be used for prepayment at the next payment date. * Loans can also be prepaid using bonds. These bonds can be purchased at a discount if that‚Äôs where they are trading, and receive prepayment credit at par. Loan prepayments in bonds require presentation of bonds from the series that funded the loan. Bond investors do not see loan prepayments with bonds to be a prepayment at all since the bonds eliminated due to the prepayment do not include any bonds being held by the investor. =Costs= A study issued by the UN Economic Commission for Europe compared German, US, and Danish mortgage systems. The German Bausparkassen have reported nominal interest rates of approximately 6 per cent per annum in the last 40 years (as of 2004). In addition, they charge administration and service fees (about 1.5 per cent of the loan amount). In the United States, the average interest rates for fixed- rate mortgages in the housing market started in high double figures in the 1980s and have (as of 2004) reached about 6 per cent per annum. However, gross borrowing costs are substantially higher than the nominal interest rate and amounted for the last 30 years to 10.46 per cent. In Denmark, similar to the United States capital market, interest rates have fallen to 6 per cent per annum. A risk and administration fee amounts to 0.5 per cent of the outstanding debt. In addition, an acquisition fee is charged which amounts to one per cent of the principal, p. 46 in.

At his peak in the 1920s he was worth around ¬£12 million in the currency of the time, making him the third richest person in the world at the time. The basis of his wealth was that he invested in electric power and artificial silk businesses when those industries were in their infancy. Early life and business career Loewenstein was born to Bernard Loewenstein, a German-Jewish banker in Brussels, Belgium. Loewenstein established his own banking concern, and was a wealthy man by 1914. He offered his government in exile 50 million dollars, interest free, to stabilize the currency in return for the right to print Belgian francs. The offer was refused.Murray Teigh Bloom ‚Äì The Man Who Stole Portugal, London: Secker & Warburg (1966), p. 25. At war's end, he maintained a residence in England where he ran an investment business that made him one of Europe's most powerful financiers. He partnered with the investment house of Canadian-born Sir James Dunn in several business ventures, the duo emerging with more than ¬£1,000,000 profit from their 1920s investment in British Celanese alone. Loewenstein was an owner of a successful stable of Thoroughbred steeplechase race horses. His horses won the 1926 and 1928 runnings of the Grand Steeple- Chase de Paris. Business successes Loewenstein also made an enormous fortune providing electric power facilities for developing countries worldwide through his Belgian-based company, \\"Soci√©t√© Internationale d'√ânergie Hydro- √âlectrique\\" (SIDRO). By the mid-1920s, Loewenstein's reputation was such that he was consulted by heads of state from around the globe. The British government made him a Companion of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath. In 1926, he established \\"International Holdings and Investments Limited\\" that raised huge amounts of capital from wealthy investors wishing to get aboard his bandwagon of success. However, Loewenstein was rebuffed in his attempt to take over a Canadian company called Barcelona Traction, Light, and Power, a huge operation building infrastructure in Brazil. Alleged drug deal with Arnold Rothstein It is said that shortly before his death, Lowenstein made a deal with the gangster Arnold Rothstein to increase the supply of heroin into the United States by an amazing amount and create an international drug ring in Europe and the United States. Disappearance On the evening of 4 July 1928, Loewenstein left from Croydon Airport to fly to Brussels on his private aircraft, a Fokker F.VIIa/3m trimotor (G-EBYI), along with six other people. While the aircraft was crossing the English Channel at an altitude of , Loewenstein went to the rear of the aircraft to use the lavatory. In Loewenstein's aircraft, a door at the rear of the main passenger cabin opened on to a short passage with two doors: the one on the right led to the lavatory, while the one on the left was the aircraft's entrance door. When he had not reappeared after some time, Loewenstein's secretary went in search of him, and discovered that the lavatory was empty, and the aircraft's entrance door was open and flapping in the slipstream. The employee (along with the others on the aircraft) asserted his belief that Loewenstein had fallen through the aircraft's rear door, and plunged several thousand feet to his death in the English Channel. The aircraft landed first on the beach, before transferring to the airfield at Saint-Inglevert, Pas-de-Calais, France. =News and investigation= News of Loewenstein's demise caused panic selling in his corporations' publicly traded shares that immediately plummeted in value by more than fifty percent. On 12 July 1928, it was reported that tests had been conducted by the Accidents Branch of the British Air Ministry using Loewenstein's aircraft. It was stated that at an altitude of one of the Ministry men had thrown himself against the aircraft's entry door, which had opened about . However, he was immediately thrown back into the aircraft when the slipstream violently slammed shut the door. It was concluded that it would have been impossible for someone to accidentally open the door and fall out. Loewenstein's body was discovered near Boulogne on 19 July 1928, and was taken by fishing boat to Calais, where his identity was confirmed by means of his wristwatch; an autopsy was performed (at the request of his family), his brother-in-law stating that they did not suspect anyone of foul play, but that they did not want anyone to suggest after the burial that Loewenstein might have been poisoned, or had died in the aircraft and then been thrown out. The autopsy revealed a partial fracture of his skull and several broken bones, and it was concluded that he had been alive when he struck the water. Loewenstein was laid to rest in a cemetery outside Evere, in a tomb belonging to his wife's family, the Misonnes. However, his name was never carved on the slab covering his casket, so he was in effect buried in an unmarked grave. =Theories= Many theories have been put forward as to exactly what had happened to Loewenstein in the back of his aircraft; some suspected a criminal conspiracy in which his employees murdered him. The New York Times hypothesised that a growing absent-mindedness, noted by many of Loewenstein's acquaintances, may have caused him to walk out the wrong door of the aircraft. Because he had left behind a tangled web of business ventures, many of which were highly leveraged, others theorized that his business empire was on the verge of collapse. Some even asserted that corrupt business practices were about to be exposed and that Loewenstein, therefore, committed suicide. None of these theories was ever proved. In 1987, William Norris wrote Loewenstein's story in a book titled The Man Who Fell From the Sky (New York: Viking, 1987). Norris presents evidence in support of his case that, if his death was not a conspiracy by business rivals and associates, a certain opportunism existed regarding the death of the tycoon and his insurance. He also shows that later events are frequently ignored, such as the fact that Loewenstein's son Robert shot one of the family servants under murky circumstances within a decade or so after the tragedy. The son was himself killed in an aviation accident in 1941 while serving with the Air Transport Auxiliary. Norris concluded that Loewenstein had been thrown from the aircraft by Donald Drew, the pilot, at the behest of Madeleine Loewenstein, the motive being to gain control of Loewenstein's fortune. He suggested that the aircraft's rear door was completely removed while in the air, and a replacement later fitted on the beach at St. Pol. Crime writers Robert and Carol Bridgestock have speculated that Loewenstein faked his own death, and disappeared because of the financial irregularities in his businesses. This theory is supported by the facts that the body was buried in an unmarked grave, and that his wife did not attend the funeral.BBC Radio 4, 12 July 2014, Steve Punt Punt PI The Mysterious Death of Flying Millionaire Alfred Loewenstein Assessment Mira Wilkins characterises Loewenstein as an \\"[Ivar] Kreuger-type character\\".

Morford gained publicity for his column \\"Is Obama an Enlightened Being?\\", published in June 2008 about then-presidential candidate Barack Obama, in which he wrote, \\"Many spiritually advanced people I know (not coweringly religious, mind you, but deeply spiritual) identify Obama as a Lightworker, that rare kind of attuned being who has the ability to lead us not merely to new foreign policies or health care plans or whatnot, but who can actually help usher in a new way of being on the planet, of relating and connecting and engaging with this bizarre earthly experiment.\\" The column, and specifically the term \\"Lightworker\\", were mocked in publications including National Review, The American Spectator and SF Weekly. Morford's writing has appeared in other publications, including Mother Jones, Sun Magazine, Bark and Yoga Journal. He also blogs for the Huffington Post.  Books  Morford's first book, The Daring Spectacle: Adventures in Deviant Journalism, a compendium of his SFGATE columns, as well as various banned works and samples of hate mail from conservative detractors, was published in early 2010 by Rapture Machine, Inc.  Awards and honors  Morford has twice won first place in the online segment of the National Society of Newspaper Columnists' annual contest. He has been nominated multiple times for GLAAD Media Awards for his columns in support of gay rights.17th Annual GLAAD Media Awards19th Annual GLAAD Media Awards  Yoga and teaching  Since 2000, along with his writing career, Morford has taught Vinyasa yoga classes in San Francisco, most recently at the Yoga Tree network of schools, as well as private instruction.

Mark (2008) Iran Lonely Planet, Footscray, Victoria, Australia, page 159, (), ‚Ä≥Ghal‚Äôeh-e Baz‚Ä≥ is a large citadel on the top of a mountain in the Arasbaran forests, 50 km from Ahar, one parasang from Ardabil, 6 km southwest of Kalibar City in northwestern Iran. According to Ibn al- Nadim, it was the stronghold of Javidhan and Babak Khorramdin, the leaders of the Khurramites in Iranian Azerbaijan who fought the Islamic caliphate of Abbassids. The fort was conquered and ruined by Afshin‚Ä≤s army on 837.  Access  The castle, built on 2300‚Äì2600 meter heights, surrounded by 400 to 600 meter gorges, is accessed via a long series of broken steps that lead to the top of a hill. Thereafter, the easiest route is a long dirt track. No signs lead to the Castle. At the end of the dirt track, the route turns left. The first sign of the ruins appears on the left, leaving two peaks to cross. The first peak has views of the Castle. After ascending a second peak, with additional ruins, the trail passes sheer cliffs on the right with no railings. From the castle, the surrounding Arasbaran oak forest, jagged cliffs, mountains in the distance, and Iranian history combine inform the visitor's perspective. The last stretch is a narrow passageway and a 200-meter corridor-shaped temple. Being located in the mountains with complex passages, as well as, in the winter, heavy rains and snow made it impossible to capture the Bazz fortress.  History  The castle is believed to belong to the Parthian dynasty, as modified under the Sasanid dynasty. = Khorramites in the fort = The movement of Khurramites in Azerbaijan was associated with Javidhan who was a landlord leader of one of the two Khurramite movements in Azerbaijan (from 807-808 to 816-817), with his headquarters being in Badd located close to the river Aras. The leader of the other Khurramite movement was Abu Imran, who often clashed with Javidhans forces. During one of the clashes, in probably 816, Abu Imran was defeated and killed, whilst Javidhan was mortally wounded, dying three days later. Javidhan was succeeded by his apprentice Babak Khorramdin, who also married Javidhan's widow. Tabari records that Babak started his revolt in 816‚Äì817. At first, Al- Ma'mun paid little attention to Babak‚Ä≤s uprising because of the difficulty of intervening from distant Khorasan, the appointment of his successor, and the actions of al-Fadl ibn Sahl. Such conditions paved the way for Babak and his supporters. Caliph Al-Ma'mun sent general Yahya ibn Mu'adh fought against Babak in 819‚Äì820, but could not defeat him several times. Two years later Babak overcame the forces of Isa ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Khalid. In 824‚Äì825 the Caliphate generals Ahmad ibn al Junayd and Zorayq b. ‚Ä≤Alƒ´ b. ·π¢adaqa were sent for subdue Babak's revolt. Babak defeated them and captured Jonayd. In 827‚Äì828 Mo·∏•ammad b. ·∏§omayd was sent to overcome Babak. Despite several victories, in the last battle at Hashtadsar in 829, his troops were defeated by Babak. Caliph Al-Ma‚Ä≤mun's moves against Babak had failed when he died in 833. Babak's victories over Arab generals were associated with his possession of Badd fort and inaccessible mountain stronghold according to the Arab historians who mentioned that his influence also extended to the territories of today‚Äôs Azerbaijan Republic- \\"southward to near Ardabƒ´l and Marand, eastward to the Caspian Sea and the Shamakhi district and Shervan, northward to the Mughan (Mo·∏°ƒÅn) steppe and the Aras river bank, westward to the districts of Julfa, Nakhchivan, and Marand\\". The last battle between the Arab caliphate and the Khurramites took place in the fortress of Badd on 837. The Khurramites were defeated and Afshin reached the Badd. Afshin had additional forces from the Caliphate under the Arab magnate Ab≈´ Dolaf and settled in a camp six miles away from Badd fortress. He used this camp as a base for mountain attacks against Badd. After using up siege machinery and naphtha-throwers, he was able to invade Badd. The Khurramites were defeated and after capturing the Badd fortress, Babak escaped, but was then captured and executed. = Present day = The remaining parts of the fortress is currently known as Qa·∏∑ øa-ye Jomh≈´r. It is situated 50 km from Ahar on the left branch of Qaras≈´ river. A castle and a palace on the top of a mountain have remained from the Badd fort. The castle was included in the list of national, historical and cultural places in 1966. It was then renovated by the Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran and is used as a hiking place. There were found coin and pottery samples belong to the 13th century. There were also carved and glazed potteries uncovered date to the beginning of the 7th century.

Background The Russian word suka (\\"—Å—É–∫–∞\\", literally \\"bitch\\") has a different negative connotation than its English equivalent. In Russian criminal argot, it specifically refers to a person from the criminal world who had \\"made one's self a bitch\\" () by cooperating in any way with law enforcement or with the government. Within the Soviet prison-system a historical social structure had existed since the Russian Tsarist era. One of the important tenets of the system decreed that members would not serve or collaborate with the Tsarist (or later with the Soviet) government. This rule encompassed any kind of collaboration, not only \\"snitching\\" or \\"ratting\\".Varlam Shalamov, Essays on Criminal World, \\"Bitch War\\" (Shalamov's essay online ) in: Varlam Shalamov (1998) \\"Complete Works\\" (–í–∞—Ä–ª–∞–º –®–∞–ª–∞–º–æ–≤. –°–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Å–æ—á–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π –≤ —á–µ—Ç—ã—Ä–µ—Ö —Ç–æ–º–∞—Ö), vol. 2, printed by publishers Vagrius and Khudozhestvennaya Literatura, , A.

After the war ended, many of those that had taken up this offer returned to prisons and labor camps, but were declared suki and placed on the lower end of the prisoner hierarchy. As a result, they sought to survive through collaboration with prison officials, and in return got some of the better jobs within the prison.

Fluid flow in an external gear pump Water flows from left to right in this internal gear pump. Oil pump from a scooter engine A gear pump uses the meshing of gears to pump fluid by displacement. They are one of the most common types of pumps for hydraulic fluid power applications. The gear pump was invented around 1600 by Johannes Kepler.Frank Prager, Kepler as inventor, Vistas in Astronomy, Volume 18, 1975, Pages 887-889, https://doi.org/10.1016/0083-6656(75)90184-1. Gear pumps are also widely used in chemical installations to pump high viscosity fluids. There are two main variations: external gear pumps which use two external spur gears, and internal gear pumps which use an external and an internal spur gears (internal spur gear teeth face inwards, see below). Gear pumps are positive displacement (or fixed displacement), meaning they pump a constant amount of fluid for each revolution. Some gear pumps are designed to function as either a motor or a pump. Theory of operation As the gears rotate they separate on the intake side of the pump, creating a void and suction which is filled by fluid. The fluid is carried by the gears to the discharge side of the pump, where the meshing of the gears displaces the fluid. The mechanical clearances are small-- in the order of 10 Œºm. The tight clearances, along with the speed of rotation, effectively prevent the fluid from leaking backwards. The rigid design of the gears and houses allow for very high pressures and the ability to pump highly viscous fluids. Many variations exist, including helical and herringbone gear sets (instead of spur gears), lobe shaped rotors similar to Roots blowers (commonly used as superchargers), and mechanical designs that allow the stacking of pumps. The most common variations are shown below (the drive gear is shown blue and the idler is shown purple). File:Gear pump.pngExternal gear pump design for hydraulic power applications. File:Gear pump 2.pngInternal gear (Gerotor) pump design for automotive oil pumps. File:Gear pump 3.pngInternal gear (Crescent Internal Gear) pump design for high viscosity fluids. An external precision gear pump is usually limited to a maximum working pressure of and a maximum speed of 3,000 rpm. Some manufacturers produce gear pumps with higher working pressures and speeds but these types of pumps tend to be noisy and special precautions may have to be made.Pinches, M J (2000). Kempe's Engineers Year-Book, p. 2070. Miller Freeman, Kent. . Suction and pressure ports need to interface where the gears mesh (shown as dim gray lines in the internal pump images). Some internal gear pumps have an additional, crescent-shaped seal (shown above, right). This crescent functions to keep the gears separated and also reduces eddy currents.
