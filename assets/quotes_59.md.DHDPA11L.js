It is a remake of the 1919 film of the same name, which was also directed by Gance. Plot The Douaumont Cemetery features in the final part of the film. The married Edith Laurin has a love affair with her husband's best friend, Jean . When both men serve together at the Verdun front her spouse realises he's cuckolded. Because his old friend is also his comrade who fights at his side again the mutual enemy, Laurin doesn't take action against him. On 10 November 1918, everybody longs for an end to the war. The brass has randomly chosen a patrol to be sent to an almost certain death. Jean Diaz argues that the patrol is not necessary at least for that day. Captain Henri Chimay, however, does not dare to take the responsibility of canceling the mission. Diaz, who was the only survivor on a previous sortie, volunteers instead of a father of four. The Armistice of 11 November 1918 is proclaimed after the patrol has been wiped away. Fran√ßois Laurin dies while Diaz is wounded. Diaz works successfully for the Pierrefonds glassworks. He looks after widow Edith and her daughter Helene, but keeps his distance because of his promise to Fran√ßois. Struggling with his feelings, he moves to the former front. There he finds again Flo, a chanteuse and cabaret owner, who did a lot for soldiers' morale during the war. Both remember the fallen. Diaz devotes himself to his promise to the patrol to stop war forever. He researches a \\"steel glass\\" breastplate. Chimay, who has inherited the glassworks, appropriates the invention and provides it to the French government as part of the preparations for a future war. Jean's love for Edith has transferred to young Helene. The love triangle makes all suffer. Jean's wounds affect his sanity. While Jean is taken care by Edith's family, Chimay also develops feelings for Helene and marries her. Actual gueules cass√©es (\\"broken faces\\", veterans with facial mutilations) were used for the scenes when the dead soldiers get up from their graves. Jean recovers sanity and despairs because Europe is heading to another war. He flees to Verdun and dramatically invokes the fallen of all nations. During a supernatural storm, the dead soldiers arise and march to their places of origin. Shocked, Chimay and the world governments abolish war. A late added text remembers that the success of the film in 1938 is a proof of how the French people supported peace even in the latest days before World War II.

Nearby villages: Topi, Kota, Kalabat, Marghuz, Garh. Dhok. Yousafi, Batakara (Swabi) Garai, Sheenkay, Chhachh (Attock) Qazipur, Hassan Pur, Ghazi (Hari Pur). Zarobai is the remnant of village Munara eroded by a dreadful flood in the past in June 1841 AD. The inhabitants of Munara were used to face horrible accidents and incidents with great tolerance and dare caused by the unruly River Indus. History Zarobai is the continuation of the historical village Munara which was once existed at the coast of Indus (Abaseen river) and then destroyed two times in Indus floods. After that crucial incident the people of that destroyed village were brought together at Zarobai derai and later it was named just Zarobai. When the partition of the whole territory belonging to the Pashtoons was taking place among-st their tribes by Shiekh Milli's partition rule, our ancestors were given their part/portion at Munara but it was a small village and their share was much greater which was impossible to be given here so they got their remaining portion at Trapakai (now included in Tarbela Dam) and Pajman. Munara (which was already a built up village at the north bank river Indus) was a very famous and historical place; its name has been mentioned in the battles fought between Yousafzai and Dalazak tribes time by time and other historic references, which describes its importance. The battle between Gaju Khan (yousafzai) and Malik Bhai Khan (Dalazak) which lasted for depreciation of Dalazaks was fought somewhere near Munara. The defeatist Dalazak tribe escaped to the opposite side(south bank of river Indus i.e. Church Valley) across water. The old village was actually a little to the west of present village at a distance of about a kilometer whose archives are still present. In 1841 a record snow fell, which blocked the whole way of water in river Indus, and by melting the huge rocks of ice, there might be a fierce flood which would definitely cause destruction. Therefore, the people living to the both sides of Indus were made aware of the situation. The government servants went to every village for appropriate preparation, but the time was short. At last that happened of which every one was afraid. The biggest stormy flood in the history of Indus valley, made a big loss of lives and great destruction to the property. The majority were made safe due to pre-storm actions and instructions. All the dynasties of the village shifted to the place where the now called Zarobai and the then called Derai exist. There are also some information about some families who shifted to Ghur Ghishto (Church Valley, District Attock) before possible flood and some children and younger ones flee to the nearby villages in that tumult. Some baby girls were later discovered in village Marghuz, but one may not agree with it, because there is no authentic proof of it. The place where Zarobai existed was a big knoll/hillock which was much safer from flood, and therefore the people felt no hesitation to be settled there. Those people were very prudent and farsighted, hence they gave the village a model shape, also made possible arrangements and prepared plans for future, which is why it doesn't seem like a village but a model town. However, later some mischievous and opportunist people destroyed its beauty for their small profits. Name Some research scholars belonging to this village have researched up to some how but more work is going on, regarding this matter. Some believe that this Zarobai, Zarobay or Zarobi is in accordance with Sarobai, Sarobay or Sarobi in Afghanistan, but later a letter Z or S changed in both either in Zarobai or Sarobai. Maybe the people living here and there have some conformity of tribes. There are many villages in East Pukhtonkhwa which are similar in names to the towns and cities either in West Pukhtonkhwa or in Hindustan. All these haven't happened in hurry/accident, it may have a background but unfortunately underground. What may however the fact, but Afghanistan is the mother land of all Pashtoon tribes living in every corner of the globe. In the beginning the people of Munara were very weak, they were very short in strength but soon they realize their weakness and loneliness, therefore requested the head of Yousafzai tribe in Swat, he sent some fight master families for their help with whom they (people of Munara) shared their properties. That's why Chamliwal who came from Chamla, Swat have greater properties then other. Also some others families migrated from other places and settled here. That's why its population graph is so much higher. With the passage of time Yousafzai and Mandan were intermixed and it is impossible now to distinguish between them. There is a little quantity of other people known as Raghalya, but they are countless. The whole people count themselves as Yousafzai even Mandan because all have been intermixed and promiscuous. But they have authentic proofs of genealogical table and hence write Yousafzai with their names. Islami School (The Historical School of Zarobai) History of Azad schools in Pakhtunkhwa Abdul Ghaffar Khan dearly known as Baacha Khan, who back in 1920 used education as a means for social transformation and established a chain of more than seventy schools in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) making the local community an integral part of his educational program. This effort was initiated at a time when there was a dire need of purposeful and quality educational system that was both easily accessible and catered to the social, cultural and developmental needs of the Pakhtoons. It was a challenging effort; however, Baacha Khan made it possible by involving the local community, stirring up in them a sense of responsibility for collective effort and self-reliance. This endeavor proved fruitful in as far as it remained unobstructed by the oppressive British colonial forces. Azad Islami School Zarobai Bacha Khan the founder of the educational movement in Pakhtoonkhwa formed 100 Azad Islamic schools during his educational movement. He came to the village Zarobai (Swabi) in a series of his tours to different villages and towns and he formed this school here as well named Azad islami school, later the name changed to Islami School Zarobi. Mulana Abdul Ghafoor sb faregh Deoband was the 1st in charge/Headmaster of the Azad school Zarobai. This Islamic school contains 1200 students which is having co education until 5th class. This school is running in two shifts. The morning shift is for general education and the evening shift is for Islamic teaching i.e. Nazira Quran, translation, Islamic books etc. This school is run by the Jirga of zarobi village.the school income comes from different sources like charity, Qurbanai sarmane, Jirga Nagha amount (penalty amount) this amount is being paid by those who violate the rules of Bela (forest of Abaseen).

That is, a database query can be formulated in one language if and only if it can be expressed in the other. The theorem is named after Edgar F. Codd, the father of the relational model for database management. The domain independent relational calculus queries are precisely those relational calculus queries that are invariant under choosing domains of values beyond those appearing in the database itself. That is, queries that may return different results for different domains are excluded. An example of such a forbidden query is the query \\"select all tuples other than those occurring in relation R\\", where R is a relation in the database. Assuming different domains, i.e., sets of atomic data items from which tuples can be constructed, this query returns different results and thus is clearly not domain independent. Codd's Theorem is notable since it establishes the equivalence of two syntactically quite dissimilar languages: relational algebra is a variable-free language, while relational calculus is a logical language with variables and quantification. Relational calculus is essentially equivalent to first-order logic, and indeed, Codd's Theorem had been known to logicians since the late 1940s. Query languages that are equivalent in expressive power to relational algebra were called relationally complete by Codd. By Codd's Theorem, this includes relational calculus. Relational completeness clearly does not imply that any interesting database query can be expressed in relationally complete languages. Well-known examples of inexpressible queries include simple aggregations (counting tuples, or summing up values occurring in tuples, which are operations expressible in SQL but not in relational algebra) and computing the transitive closure of a graph given by its binary edge relation (see also expressive power). Codd's theorem also doesn't consider SQL nulls and the three-valued logic they entail; the logical treatment of nulls remains mired in controversy.For recent work extending Codd's theorem in this direction see Additionally, SQL allows duplicate rows (has multiset semantics.) Nevertheless, relational completeness constitutes an important yardstick by which the expressive power of query languages can be compared.

Torah-based group) refers to a group of idealistic, religious Zionists, individuals and families, who settle in underdeveloped communities to help build up and strengthen the community through social and religious programming.  History  The Garin Torani model was established to aid development towns in Israel. The first group settled in Kiryat Shmona in 1968. Later, groups were sent to Ma'alot-Tarshiha, Eilat, Yerucham and Tzfat. While differing models exist, the main mission is to effect social change in a neglected community through role models, enthusiasm and Jewish values. The goal is to increase stability and social integration, as well as productivity and connection to Torah. Shaalei Torah initiated a program in 2007 to develop the role of a communal rabbi in the garin communities. Some garinim are focused around a central yeshiva or kollel. Often, they establish religious Zionist schools and youth groups in the community. They reach out to families in need and children at risk through the establishment of a Bayit Cham, or Warm Home which offers after-school and summer programs for children at risk. Some groups distribute food packages before the holidays, delivered personally by neighbors or garin members, reaching out both financially and socially. In addition to social development and integration, they try to infuse an understanding of Torah and Jewish values and create a positive religious experience through Torah classes, holiday events and educational programs.  Organizations  Shaalei Torah was the first organization to realize the need for a unified body to connect garinim. The organization began as a small garin in Beit Shemesh in the 1980s. After establishing the Beit Shemesh Garin and effecting significant social improvements, it expanded its scope to provide support for the establishment of new Garinim. It provides a venue in which established garinim can share their experience with newer ones. Shaalei Torah has helped to establish a network of Garinim and offers guidance and funding.

The Kittatinny Limestones are located primarily in the Kittatinny Valley where it lies above the Ordovician Martinsburg Formation within the long valley running from Picatinny Arsenal in Rockaway Township, southwest toward Chester Township. It overlies the Cambrian Hardyston Quartzite. The Kittatinny is now usually considered a Supergroup, rather than a Formation, as it includes several other Groups and Formations.

The Kittatinny Limestone in New Jersey locally contains hydrocarbons and numerous accessory minerals including fluorite, sphalerite, arsenopyrite, galena, quartz, albite, and others. The Kittatiny is an exception to the general rule that Paleozoic rocks in this area are generally poor aquifers, since wells drilled into it produce relatively large flows of water. The Kittatinny Formation is named for the Kittatinny Valley in which it is located. The formation is not connected to or associated with the geology of Kittatinny Mountain, the easternmost ridge of the Appalachians in New Jersey, which is composed of Shawangunk Formation, a silica-cemented combination of quartz arenite and quartz-pebble conglomerate; and the Bloomsburg Formation (known as the \\"Bloomsburg Red Beds\\"), consisting of red shale, siltstone, and sandstone.Ron W.

In 2013 he won the UCI BMX World Championships, his first. Having been cycling from the age of 5, he took up competitive BMX whilst a junior and won ten consecutive British titles. He won his first European title in 1999, and represented Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics, at the 2012 Summer Olympics (despite having broken his collarbone shortly before) and at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Early life Born at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton, he was raised in Burnham-on-Sea and attended The King Alfred School. He began cycling at the age of five years, and often raced his sister. Both of his parents were involved in BMX with his father being a former national coach, and helped to found the local BMX club in Burnham. Cycling career Between the ages of five and fourteen, he was the winner of ten consecutive British BMX titles. In 1999 he won the European BMX Championship for the first time, and joined the Olympic Academy Programme in 2005. In 2008 he was selected for the British team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China as a competitor in the men's BMX. It was the first time the sport had been featured in an Olympic Games as an official sport; Phillips placed seventh in the second heat and was eliminated from the competition. He was injured at the 2010 UCI BMX World Championships in South Africa, damaging his shoulder during the second moto. In early 2011 he began training with the British track cycling team, eventually being considered as one of the members of the squad's men's sprint team. He decided to make the switch from BMX due to the reduced chance of injury in track racing. During this period he was a member of the sprint team that placed third at the British National Team Sprint Championships in September 2011. However, it was announced in October 2011 that he had decided to return to BMX, which resulted in the media considering him to be one of the best prospects to represent Great Britain in the men's BMX at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Having taken the silver medal in the time trial at the 2012 UCI BMX World Championships held at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, the following day Philips broke his collarbone during the morning's Moto 1 race. This resulted in him requiring surgery to insert a metal plate, and put his selection for the 2012 Games in doubt. However, he was chosen for the British team despite the injury and was still aiming for a win at the Olympics, saying \\"The goal is gold, without a doubt. I'm training not to be a medal winner but to be Olympic champion.\\" In 2014 Phillips became the first British male rider to win the UCI BMX Supercross World Cup, becoming the first rider to win two back-to-back BMX World Cup titles when he took a second series win in 2015. Personal life He lives in Manchester, close to the National Indoor BMX Arena. He likes to play golf in his spare time.

He is a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing Pittwater for the Liberal Party since 2007. Stokes has previously served as the Minister for Education from January 2017 until March 2019 in the First Berejiklian ministry; the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Heritage, the Assistant Minister for Planning, and the Minister for the Central Coast during 2014 and 2015 in the first Baird government; and the Minister for Planning from April 2015 until January 2017 in the second Baird government. Background and early career Stokes grew up in Mona Vale. He attended Sydney Church of England Grammar School (Shore) and obtained his Higher School Certificate in 1991. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts, a Bachelor of Laws, a Master of Laws and a PhD at Macquarie University; a Diploma of Biblical Studies, and a Graduate Diploma in Legal Practice. Stokes was an associate with the law firm David Begg & Associates in Martin Place, Sydney. He also worked in a number of other legal firms including one at Mona Vale. He subsequently became a lecturer in the Division of Law at Macquarie University. He became a member of the Young Lawyers Association of New South Wales and was a member of both the Environmental Law and CLE Committees. He became a presidential nominee in 2004 and was elected to Executive Council at the 2004 Annual Assembly. Political career Stokes was a policy adviser to Liberal Opposition Leader John Brogden, the Member for Pittwater. When Brogden resigned in controversial circumstances, the 2005 by- election was won by independent candidate Alex McTaggart in what many described as a shock result. Pittwater had long been reckoned as a classic \\"blue ribbon\\" Liberal seat. Less than two years later, Stokes regained the seat for the Liberals at the 2007 general election. He won the seat with 50.3 per cent of the primary vote, just over the 50 per cent threshold required to win the seat outright, and 59.4 per cent of the vote on a two-party preferred basis. After the election, Stokes established his electorate office in Mona Vale. Stokes paid tribute to John Brogden in his inaugural speech to the NSW Parliament on 31 May 2007. At the 2011 general election, Stokes was re-elected with a swing of 21.7 points, gaining 84.5 per cent of the two-party vote. Stokes' main competitor was the Greens Jonathan King. Following the election, Stokes was appointed as NSW Parliamentary Secretary for Renewable Energy in the O'Farrell government. Owing to the resignation of Barry O'Farrell as Premier, and the subsequent ministerial reshuffle by Mike Baird, the new Liberal Leader, Stokes was appointed as Minister for the Environment, Minister for Heritage, and Assistant Minister for Planning and appointed as a member of cabinet. Two weeks later, following the resignation of Mike Gallacher, Stokes was appointed as Minister for the Central Coast. Following the 2015 state election, Stokes was sworn in as the Minister for Planning on 2 April 2015 in the second Baird government. Following the resignation of Mike Baird as Premier, Gladys Berejiklian was elected as Liberal leader and sworn in as Premier. The first Berejiklian ministry was subsequently formed with Stokes sworn in as the Minister for Education with effect from 30 January 2017. Following the 2019 state election Stokes was appointed as the Minister for Planning and Public Spaces in the second Berejiklian ministry, with effect from 2 April 2019.  Climate Change  Stokes introduced a controversial bill in October 2019, following a concerted lobbying campaign by the NSW Minerals Council to stop planning authorities from considering the climate pollution of exported Australian coal when determining new mining projects. The introduction and consideration of the bill to roll back existing environmental protections was during a period of ‚Äòcatastrophic‚Äô bushfire danger throughout New South Wales. Paul Stein QC, a former Supreme Court judge and environmental law expert has warned NSW's push to stop greenhouse gas emissions being considered in mining decisions is a \\"dangerous retrograde step\\".

It is based on the 1931 Hungarian play √âkszerrabl√°s a V√°ci-utc√°ban by Ladislas Fodor and its subsequent English adaptation, Jewel Robbery by Bertram Bloch. Plot In Vienna, Baroness Teri von Horhenfels (Kay Francis) relieves the boredom of her marriage to her rich but dull husband (Henry Kolker) with love affairs. One day, at an exclusive jewel shop to purchase a diamond ring, her tedium is lifted by a suave, charming thief (William Powell) and his gang. In turn, he is entranced by her beauty. He locks her husband and her latest lover, Paul (Hardie Albright) (of whom she has already tired), in the vault, and forces shop owner Hollander (Lee Kohlmar) to smoke a marijuana-laced cigarette that soon makes him forget his troubles. She however persuades him into leaving her free. However, he is not so carried away as to neglect his duties; he takes her ring, all of it. Teri returns home, to be envied her adventure by her friend Marianne (Helen Vinson). They are frightened to discover that an intruder has broken in and opened her safe. However, they become puzzled and relieved when they find that not only is nothing missing, but the ring has been returned. Marianne departs hastily, anxious to avoid becoming entangled in a scandal. The thief then appears; Teri tries to return the ring, since keeping it would raise uncomfortable questions. When he refuses to take it back, she accuses him of using her to hide out from the police. Then, Detective Fritz (Alan Mowbray) arrives, flushes out the robber, and takes the two into custody. However, all is not as it seems. It turns out that Fritz is a member of the gang. The thief had used the fake arrest to transport Teri to his house without protest for a night of romance. She is intrigued. Vienna has become too dangerous for him, so he asks her to meet him in Nice, but she hesitates. Just then, the real police surround the place. He and his gang escape, leaving Teri tied up so as to divert suspicion. After she is \\"rescued\\", she decides she needs a vacation away from Vienna to recover from the excitement... in Nice.

History White Roding Windmill was built in 1877, replacing a post mill which had stood on the site since 1609. The post mill was destroyed on 1 January 1877 when the main post broke in a gale as the miller had too much cloth spread on the Common sails. A new tower mill was built by Whitmore's the Wickham Market, Suffolk millwrights to replace the post mill. The mill worked by wind until 1926, and then by engine until 1931. The lease on the mill expired that year and was not renewed. In 1937, the mill was purchased by the actor Michael Redgrave, passing to a company in Barrow- in-Furness in 1946. During the 1950s, the mill was derelict and threatened with demolition on more than one occasion. In the 1970s, millwrights Philip Barrett-Lennard and Vincent Pargeter built a new cap for the mill. Description White Roding windmill is a five-storey brick tower mill which had an ogee cap winded by a six bladed Fantail. It had four Patent sails carried on a cast iron windshaft. The only remaining piece of machinery is the Brake Wheel, which is diameter with 115 cogs. All other machinery was removed shortly after the Second World War. The tower is high, diameter at the base and diameter at the curb. The walls are thick at the base. The mill is to the top of the cap. The mill drove two pairs of underdrift millstones.

The work is a close copy of the first edition of the French Symbolist poet St√©phane Mallarm√©'s poem of the same name, published in 1914, but with all the words removed, replaced by black stripes that correspond directly to the typographic layout used by Mallarm√© to articulate the text. > Broodthaers reduces Un Coup de D√©s to its structure - or to put it another > way he elevates the structure of the work to a concept worthy of study in > its own right, thus acknowledging Mallarm√©'s own fetishistic attention to > this aspect of his work. Rendering the structure concrete, visible, almost > tactile, Broodthaers offers a conceptual analysis of Mallarm√©'s poem across > the distance of a nearly a century...It would be hard to imagine a more > subtle treatment of Mallarm√©'s work, or one more capable of demonstrating > its essential properties, than this reworked book by Broodthaers. ‚Äî Johanna > DruckerThe Century of Artists' Books, Drucker, Granary, 1995, p115-116 Often included in exhibitions tracing the history of the artist's book,Miami Miami Art Museum the work is seen as a seminal example of the European post- avant-garde.Generali Foundation It is often referred to simply as Un Coup de D√©s.  Concrete Poetry   Mallarm√© and Magritte  Broodthaers had lived in poverty as a poet in Brussels for twenty years before becoming an artist in 1964.Oxford Art Online; Broodthaers essay by Michael Compton His first exhibition, at the Galere Saint-Laurent, included two unsold parcels of his fourth book of poetry, Pense-B√™te, encased in plaster. This was the first of many works that 'employed techniques associated with poetry but applied by him not only to words but to images and symbols.'Oxford Art Online; Broodthaers essay by Michael Compton Un Coup de D√©s would become the most famous instance of Broodthaers' interest in setting up a contradiction between the written word and a visual image 'to the profit of the subject.'Broodthaers quoted in Marcel Broodthaers, Tate Gallery, 1980, p15 Broodthaers had been given a copy of Mallarm√©'s Un Coup de D√©s in 1945 by the Belgian surrealist painter R√©n√© Magritte as 'a way of explaining his art to a young admirer without explaining it literally.'Marcel Broodthaers, Tate Gallery, 1980, p15 > As for the idea of establishing a direct relationship between literature and > the plastic arts, I'm afraid I have done so by taking as a subject A Throw > Of The Dice, by Mallarm√© !!! ‚Äî Broodthaers\\"Quant √† l'id√©e d'√©tablir un > rapport direct entre litt√©rature et arts plastique j'ai peur l'avoir fait en > prenant comme sujet Le Coup de D√®s, de Mallarm√© !!!\\" letter quoted in Marcel > Broodthaers, Catalogue des Livres, 1957-75, Galerie Michael Werner, K√∂ln > 1982, p27 Mallarm√© had written the poem in 1897 and left copious notes as to how it should be typeset, instructions that were finally carried out 16 years after his death, in 1914. The poem was famous for its extraordinary typography, which anticipated the 20th century interest in graphic design and concrete poetry. Mallarm√© was known to have organised the layout of the poem using rectangles of card, and to leave written pleas to publish the work exactly as he'd intended. As such, Broodthaers' work can be seen as a direct quote of Mallarm√©'s working methods and of his obsession with the visual layout of the text. > Mallarm√© is the source of all contemporary art... it unconsciously invents > modern space. ‚Äî Broodthaers, 1970  The Literary Exhibition  Un Coup de D√©s Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard, an inner spread Broodthaers' exhibition 'Exposition Litt√©raire autour de Mallarm√©' at the Wide White Space Gallery, Antwerp, December 1969 consisted of a copy of Mallarm√©'s book 'opened so that, (as nearly always when a book is put in an exhibition) only two pages were visible. The meaning is there but cannot be entirely reached.'Marcel Broodthaers, Tate Gallery, 1980, p12 A series of metal plates, made of anodised aluminium, engraved with black impressions standing in for the text, were hung on the wall whilst a recording of Broodthaers reciting the poem was played continuously for the duration of the exhibition. > The word was \\"there\\", more \\"real\\", because three dimensional, than the > original pages but, of course, negative and illegible. Meanwhile, the tape- > recorded voice of the artist read out the poem repeatedly, it was \\"there\\" > but not simultaneously and continuously present like the words of the > poem.Marcel Broodthaers, Tate Gallery, 1980, p12  The book  After a brief introduction citing the original edition published in 1914 by Librairie Gallimard, the book starts with the entire poem written as a block of text which is rectangular if the type of Mallarme's poem is 'regular' and oblique if the type from Mallarme is italic. 12 double spreads follow, with immaculately laid out black shapes standing in for the text. The work is soft bound and feels quite insubstantial. The cover is a near-perfect facsimile of the original cover, but with the word 'image' replacing 'poem' in the centre of the design. The edition was published in Antwerp to coincide with the exhibition on 25 November 1969. 10 copies of the work - unbound, numbered I-X, printed onto 12 aluminium sheets - were made available, along with 90 copies printed on translucent paper and 300 copies on normal paper. The translucent edition came with two sheets of white card cut to the size of the book so that individual pages could be isolated by the reader if they so wished.  Reception of the book  The book, like Broodthaers' work in general, has gradually grown in stature since his death in 1976,Oxford Art Online; Broodthaers and has found its way into a number of important collections, including MOMA, V&A;, and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp. It also has inspired other reworks, like this one by Michalis Pichler: \\"In Michalis Pichlers‚Äô 2008 rework the blocks are cut out, creating a negative space and geometric pattern of cuts and absence. (...) The idea of remake and of version, using another existing work as point of departure, relieves the artist of the onus of originality while allowing the new gesture to stand as a novel gesture.

The village is situated north of Coffs Harbour and south of Grafton. The original village of Corindi is slightly north along the Pacific Highway at Post Office Lane and Casson Close.

Corindi and surrounds has become a major blueberry producer, with many locals and tourists working during the peak seasons picking fruit.

The 30th parallel is also the northern extent of the Tasman Sea and the Southern extent of the Coral Sea. The town has streets named after each of the adjacent sea as well as the Pacific Ocean. * Corindi has the largest blueberry farm in Australia. Corindi has a long farming history since being settled by Europeans mainly for cattle and dairy but more recently blueberries. * Corindi has a strong Aboriginal culture, celebrated through the Aboriginal local community and the Aboriginal cultural centre. * The headland is the site of a massacre of the Gumbaynngir indigenous people in the mid 19th century. A memorial has been erected at the base of the headland to commemorate this. The massacre began at Blackadders Creek when mounted police entered the camp.

To support The Camerawalls' releases and go as far as establishing full creative control and marketing his own music, Clementine also founded Lilystars Records, an independent record label determined to house the sensibility and aesthetics of indie pop music in the Philippines.Nerisa Almo \\"Philippine Entertainment Portal\\" July 8, 2008 On March 2008, The Camerawalls released a sample of their music with an unofficial single \\"Markers Of Beautiful Memories\\" over the internet, which slowly gained attention and a following and was then eventually picked up by radio.

According to local legend, during the Ming and Qing dynasties, Liulichang was a favourite haunt for scholars, painters, and calligraphers who gathered there to write, compile, and purchase books, as well as to paint and compose poetry. By the Kangxi era (1661‚Äì1722) of the Qing dynasty, Liulichang had become one of the most flourishing cultural centres in all of Beijing. Renovations Large-scale renovations in modern times have transformed Liulichang into an antique market that resembles a Chinese village. Shops located on the street have a variety of Chinese folk arts such as paintings, calligraphy, pottery, carpets, vases, books, scrolls, and chops. Today the street is a mixture of state-run and privately owned shops, and customers are recommended to bargain before making purchases. There are also traditional teahouses and wineshops, as well as many restaurants.

KKS bought twenty motorized trams from Schuckert & Co. and twelve trailers, designated as Class S. It built two depots, Sagene and Rodel√∏kka. The company was created after a political shift whereby the municipal council decided to start operating trams. The company operated a mix of line services, most of the lines operating every ten minutes. KKS failed to make a profit. After the 1904 elections the majority in the municipal council shifted. The company was privatized in May 1905 and sold to KSS after the municipal council had rejected purchasing the very same company. History Laying of tracks of Sagene Ring in Akersgata Establishment By the late 1890s Oslo had three private tram companies, of which two, Kristiania Sporveisselskab and Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei, operated each their network of street trams.Aspenberg: 6‚Äì7 This led to a debate of whether tram operation should be a private or a municipal affair. The two dominant parties too each their stand: the Conservative Party wished to retain the private operations, while the Liberal Party supported a municipalization of the operations.Fasting: 52 The issue was split: Oslo Municipality taking over the existing two companies and establishing a new company to operate new lines. The municipality had in 1896 been offered to purchase KSS for its nominal share value plus interest in a move initiated by the tram company itself. Its main concern was its concession would expire in 1905 and that the municipality would then have the right expropriate it. Meanwhile, the company was in need of new capital and offered to issue new shares to the municipality.Fasting: 50 Oslo Municipality rejected the offer and the new shares were instead sold to Gesellschaft f√ºr elektrische Unternehmungen of Berlin. KKS tram running through Karl Johans gate By 1897 the Liberal Party had received a majority in the municipal council. That year there was a political debate regarding an expansion of the KSS' tramway towards St. Hanshaugen and Sagene, two areas which were being developed. KSS applied to build a tramway there, but on 23 September 1897 the municipal council voted to establish its own tram company and build a line to St. Hanshaugen Sagene itself. Two city engineers were sent on a study tour of Germany and the Netherlands to gain experience from tram operations there. Upon their return a second debate started, this time concerning the construction of a line to Rodel√∏kka. As before, KSS had applied to build a line from the city center to Rodel√∏kka. Initially this had been accepted by the municipal council in 1898, on the condition that KSS pay a rent of 5,000 Norwegian krone (NOK) per year. This decision was overturned in January 1899 and the municipal council voted to grant KKS the permit. There were doubts as to the profitability of the line, but the city engineer was of the opinion that deficits could always be covered by the profits from the line to St. Hanshaugen. The Rodel√∏kka Line would allow the municipal tramway network to grow from . KKS tram passing by Oslo Cathedral at Stortorvet Operating history Construction of the Sagene Line commenced in early 1899. The final line, from Storgaten to Festningsbryggen, was approved by the city council in May 1899, at a cost of NOK 200,000. At about that time the construction of the Rodel√∏kka Line started. The Sagene Line line was somewhat delayed and operations started on 24 November. It initially received a ten-minute headway because the power company was not able to supply sufficient power to run additional trams. This was later increased to five minutes. The company had not had capacity to straight out all aspects of operations, including that of procuring uniforms. The lack of such attire was criticized by the press.Fasting: 56 At first the service ran from Sagene to Athen√¶um, with additional services from St. Hanshaugen to Athen√¶um. The Rodel√∏kka Line was completed by January 1900. However, there was not sufficient electricity available to power the tramway. Operations did not commence until March, when the power use for lighting was reduced. It also initially received a ten- minute headway, limited by the amount of available power.Fasting: 58 The route ran from Rodel√∏kka to Nybrua, when it connected to KSS's Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line and ran to the latter's main downtown terminal of Egertorget. From June an agreement was reached with KES, allow the Sagene services to run along their Sk√∏yen Line from Athen√¶um to Jernbanetorget, serving Oslo East Station. KKS tram crossing Nybrua on the Rodel√∏kka Line At the annual meeting in April 1900 the company was criticized for having less comfortable trams than the competitors, and that the announced progress in construction to F√¶stningebryggen on Vippetangen had not been carried through. The same month construction commenced on the Vippetangen Line and it was inaugurated in August. With the opening of the line, the extra trains on from St. Hanshaugen were extended to F√¶stningebryggen. In 1900 KKS presented plans for an expansion of the Sagene Line through Arendalsgaten, Bentse Bridge, Hegermannsgate and Vogts gate to Grefsen Station (then known as Sandaker Station). This was found by the municipal council to be too extensive and the instead supported that the line be built as an extension of the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line. Operation were slightly shifted in 1901. Work trams were introduced in the morning before 07 hours, whereby anyone could travel for 5 √∏re. At first the trams would stop at any location that passengers signaled. From 1901 the company introduced regular stations for boarding and disembarkment.Fasting: 63 Tram at the terminus at Sagene Church From early 1901 KSS terminated its track sharing agreement, hindering the trams from running to Jernbanetorget. The Vippetangen Line was extended northwards to Kirkeristen on the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line. In 1902 the tracks were rearranged so they could run through Stortorvet. This resulted in two services: from Sagene via Egertorget and Stortorvet to Rodel√∏kka, and from St. Hanshaugen via Egertorget and Stortorvet to F√¶stningebryggen.Fristad: 49 KKS lost NOK 150,000 through its operating history. In 1904, its final full financial year, it had a revenue of NOK 306,000.Fasting: 67 Privatization KSS was in a situation that they concession would expire in 1905. The issued an application for a new two years in advance and offered to take over KKS in the process. This raised a new debate concerning public or private operations, with many Conservative politicians calling for the privatization of KKS.Fasting: 64 In the 1904 municipal election the issue was raised, with the Liberal Party and the socialist parties running for municipalization of tram operations. Meanwhile, the municipal administration worked with estimates for taking over KSS. A take-over would cost the municipality about NOK 2 million, while a sale would bring in about NOK 1.6 million. However, as KSS was a profitable company, it was estimated that the municipality would make more money by taking over KSS than selling KKS, estimated at about NOK 3 million for the period in question.Fasting: 65 Two trams at Egertorget The decisive municipal council meeting was held on 14 April 1905, although the actual vote did not occur to 02 hours the following day, after a nine-hour debate. Among the issues raised was the impartiality of those councilor who owned shares in or were employed by KSS. The Ministry of Justice found neither a KSS conductor nor a councilor who owned shares in the private company as impartial.Fasting: 65 Arguments presented for privatization was the lack of profits in KKS, that the municipality would increase the number of employees, that the sale would reduce the municipal debt and that KSS had offered favorable conditions. Arguments presented for munisipalization was this would be profitable for the municipality, as it would be taking over a profitable company, that the shortfall in revenue was because of a temporary bust in the economy and that the majority of KSS was owned by foreign, German company.Fasting: 66 A compromise was proposed whereby KSS would receive a concession until 1909, but this was downcast with 47 against 37 votes. The council then approved the sale and extension of the concession with 48 against 36 votes. Because of the lack of a qualified majority, the county governor demanded a new vote. This was carried out on 23 May and received the same voting. The same day the board of KSS approved the purchase of KKS. They financed the purchase through a combination of loans and issuing new shares.Fasting: 68 The official date of the transaction was 6 October 1905. Tram passing through Egertorget The agreed upon conditions for the sale involved that KSS bought KKS for its listed value, in addition to the NOK 150,000 loss the company had incurred during production. In addition it would compensate with four percent dividend per year on the share capital. KKS employees retained their jobs, wage levels and seniority. KSS received a twenty-year extension of its concession under certain conditions. It would pay eight percent of future revenue to the municipality, and a minimum NOK 100,000 per year. The tram company simultaneously agreed to buy its electricity from Oslo Lysverker for 9 √∏re per kilowatt hour. Prices were regulated by the concession and the municipality received the right to appoint one board member. The take-over included of tramway, two depots and all 32 units of rolling stock. Legacy Both KSS and KES were taken over by the municipality in 1924, when their concessions expired. Oslo Municipality thereby established a new municipally-owned company, Oslo Sporveier, to operate all street trams in Oslo.Aspenberg: 19 KSS continued to use the Class S trams until 1918. However, many of the trams were rebuilt to other models and these remained in service until 1966. KSS had no need for Rodel√∏kka Depot and closed it down immediately after the take-over.Hartmann & Mangset: 68 The Rodel√∏kka Line was closed in 1949, although the southern part is still in operation as part of the Sinsen Line. Sagene Ring closed in 1961,Aspenberg: 26 and the Vippetangen Line followed suit six years later.Aspenberg: 28 Network A map of the tram network in 1939 which indicates lines built by KKS The tramway company owned three physical lines of the Oslo Tramway's street network: the Rodel√∏kka Line, the Sagene Ring and the Vippetangen Line. These did not intersect and were therefore connected via lines of KSS.Fristad: 45 The network had a total length of . Sagene Depot was the company's main depot.Aspenberg: 37 It also operated the smaller Rodel√∏kka Depot.Aspenberg: 38 KKS received its power from the municipal Oslo Lysverker. Sagene Ring started downtown at Athen√¶um in Akersgata, near the Parliament of Norway Building, where there was a track connection with KES's Sk√∏yen Line. It ran north, intersecting with KKS's line in Karl Johans gate. It continued along Colletts gate, Geitemyrsveien and Kierschouws gate through the neighborhoods of St. Hanshaugen and Sagene. It terminated at Sagene Depot, close to Sagene Church.Fristad: 42 Sagene Ring had a length of in 1905, of which about half was double track. The Rodel√∏kka Line branched from KSS's Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line at Nybrua and ran along Trondheimsveien to Helgesens gata. There it branched off and continued along Rathkes gate, Verksgata and K√∏benhavngata until it reached its terminus at the intersection with D√¶lenenggata. The line was long, of which about half was double track. The Vippetangen Line ran from the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line at Kirkeristen and ran south along Dronningens gate. It intersected with the Sk√∏yen Line at Tollbugata. From there it continued along Dronningens gate until it crossed Grev Wedels gate and terminated at F√¶stningebryggen. The line was long, most of which was double track. Rolling stock KKS Class S tram no. 208 in Karl Johans gate KKS employed a fleet of 20 trams and 12 trailers. These had an identical long and body with wooden exterior paneling. KKS ordered the trams from Schukert, who built the electrical and technical equipment, while the bodies were built by Busch. They features outdoor bays for the motorman and a cabin with wooden benches in the longitudinal direction. All units had seating for twenty passengers. The motorized vehicles had seating for fourteen, while the trailer had seating for twenty. The vehicles were twin-axled. The motorized versions were equipped with two AB71 motors, each providing for a total power output. The motor cars weighed , while the trailers weighed . They were equipped with only primary suspension, causing them to vibrate more than other trams in traffic at the time. While in service with KKS the motorized trams were numbered 201‚Äì220 and the trailers 250‚Äì261. KKS pained its trams red and they prominently featured the seal of Oslo. To distinguish KKS's trams from the other operators, a journalist started calling KKS the \\"Red Trams\\", to distinguish it from the green and blue trams of KSS and KES, respectively, and the name stuck.

History  The district was established by merging the former districts of D√∂beln, Freiberg and Mittweida as part of the district reform of August 2008.  Geography  The district stretches from the Erzgebirge (\\"Ore Mountains\\") on the Czech Republic‚ÄìGermany border to the plains between Leipzig and Dresden. The district borders (from the west and clockwise) the state Thuringia, the districts of Leipzig, Nordsachsen, Mei√üen, S√§chsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge, the Czech Republic, Erzgebirgskreis, the urban district Chemnitz, and the district of Zwickau. The geography of the district varies considerably, stretching from the northern part which almost reaches the North German Plain, to the southern part in the mountainous Erzgebirge region. The lowest point is at 140 metres above sea level, in the valley of the Freiberger Mulde near Leisnig. The highest point is 855 metres above sea level on the Czech border. The most important rivers in Mittelsachsen are the Zwickauer and Freiberger Mulde, and the Zschopau river. Other notable rivers include Bobritzsch, Striegis, Gimmlitz and Fl√∂ha. The district also contains the reservoirs Kriebstein, Lichtenberg and Ruaschenbach. Part of the Erzgebirge/Vogtland national park is located in the southern part of Mittelsachsen.  Politics   Coat of arms  In 2008, upon the creation of the Mittelsachsen district, the heraldic society \\"Schwarzer L√∂we\\" in Leipzig, in collaboration with graphics studio Eberhard Heinicker, put forward several proposals for a new coat of arms. Six proposals in total were put to the district council. The district council eventually chose the current design on 10 June 2009. The coat of arms shows the lion of Mei√üen, representing the Margravate of Meissen, and a hammer and pick representing the local mining heritage. The blue waves are derived from the coat of arms of Mittweida, and the three black lozenges from the former arms of D√∂beln.  District council  The elections for the Mittelsachsen district happened on 7 June 2015. The former mayor of Mittweida, Matthias Damm (CDU), won with an absolute majority (65.74% of votes).  Transport   Road  The district is crossed by three Autobahns: A4, A14, and A72. Several Bundesstra√üen (federal highways) also cross through Mittelsachsen, including the 101 (Berlin to Aue) and 7 (D√ºsseldorf to Chemnitz).  Rail  Several railways cross through the Mittelsachsen district, most notably the Dresden‚ÄìWerdau railway servicing Freiberg and Fl√∂ha, among others. There are no long distance railway connections in Mittelsachsen, but such connections are easily reachable by taking regional trains to Dresden, Chemnitz or Leipzig. Freiberg is included in the Dresden S-Bahn network. The entire district is served by the Verkehrsbund Mittelsachsen.  Flight  The closest airports for commercial travel are Leipzig‚ÄìAltenburg Airport (15km), Dresden Airport (28km), and Leipzig/Halle Airport (58km). However, there is an airfield at Langhennersdorf which is used for recreational flight.

This is a small plot of land (typically less than 0.5 hectares) attached to a rural residence. The household plot is primarily cultivated for subsistence and its traditional purpose since the Soviet times has been to provide the family with food. Surplus products from the household plot are sold to neighbors, relatives, and often also in farmer markets in nearby towns. The household plot was the only form of private or family farming allowed during the Soviet era, when household plots of rural people coexisted in a symbiotic relationship with large collective and state farms. Since 1990, the household plots are classified as one of the two components of the individual farm sector, the other being peasant farms ‚Äì independent family farms established for commercial production on much larger areas of agricultural land (typically 10-50 hectares). In terms of legal organization, household plots are natural (physical) persons, whereas peasant farms generally are legal (juridical) persons. Names Household plots are called in Russian subsidiary (or auxiliary) household plots ‚Äì –ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–µ –ø–æ–¥—Å–æ–±–Ω—ã–µ —Ö–æ–∑—è–π—Å—Ç–≤–∞, abbreviated in writing and in speech as –õ–ü–• (transliteration: LPKh). They are also often referred to (especially in official statistical publications) as —Ö–æ–∑—è–π—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è (), i.e., plots (or farms) of rural residents (where the term ‚Äúrural residents‚Äù is used to distinguish them from peasant farmers). This Russian terminology was universally accepted in all former Soviet countries until the early 1990s, but a certain terminological divergence has since emerged in the newly independent states. For instance, in Uzbekistan the traditional household plots are now called dehkan farms and in Ukraine the Russian abbreviation –õ–ü–• has been replaced with O–°–ì (from Ukrainian: osobysti selyanski hospodarstva). History In Czarist Russia, the plot (usad'ba) was usually adjacent to the peasant's house. Here the peasants traditionally grew vegetables, hemp (a source of oil and livestock feed) and a little fruit. Gardens varied in size; they could be as much as a hectare, but most were smaller.Stefan Hoch, Serfdom and Social Control in Russia: Petrovskoe, a Village in Tambov (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1986), pp.48-9. The plot was normally in the hereditary tenure of the household, and not subject to repartition (unlike the peasants' holdings in the open fields). In the later 19th century the growth of towns and cities in central Russia encouraged the development of market gardening and truck farming in this region. By the eve of the Revolution the garden economy was developing quickly. A further stimulus was provided in the first years of the Revolution by the Bolshevik policy of requisitioning peasant produce. Fruit and vegetables were exempt from this policy, and this resulted in a strong swing from grain farming to kitchen and market gardening. In the grain- producing regions (Black-Earth belt and North Caucasia) the garden economy increased its share of peasant commodity production from 3.3% in 1913 to 12.2% in 1920, while the field economy declined from 62.6% to 39.3% in the same period. Market gardening continued to develop during the 1920s.Christine D Worobec, Peasant Russia: Family and Community in the Post-Emancipation Period (Princeton University Press, 1991), p.34; Orlando Figes, Peasant Russia, Civil War: The Volga Countryside in Revolution (1917 - 1921)(Oxford, Clarendon Press, corrected paperback edn. 1991), p.283 note; V P Danilov, Rural Russia Under the New Regime (Hutchinson, 1988) (translation of Sovetskaya dokolkhoznaya derevnya: naselenie, zemlepol'zovanie, khozyaistvo [Moscow, 1977]), p.286. The mass collectivization decree of January 1930 made no mention of garden plots, and in many areas the local Communist authorities abolished them. But in March 1930, after the chaos and peasant resistance engendered by the all-out drive, the right of the peasant to have a personal plot was recognised. No maximum size was agreed at this stage, however, and the garden plot remained in a legislative limbo until the kolkhoz model charter of February 1935. This charter specified that plots could vary from one-quarter to one-half hectare, and up to 1 hectare in special districts. The legislation regarded individual peasants as the holders but in practice plots were still in household tenure. The private plots were responsible for a significant fraction of agricultural production, and provided the peasants with a large part of their food and income. In 1938 they accounted for 12.5% of agricultural produce. The average peasant household earned about twice as much from marketings from the private plot as from its work on collective land. By the late 1930s market gardening, with the private plot as its base, was perhaps becoming the dominant part of agriculture in the Black-Sea hinterland and the truck-gardening areas around big cities like Moscow and Leningrad. The government, alarmed by this \`resurgence of private capitalism', passed legislation to contain it in 1939, but it continued to play an important role in agriculture.Alec Nove, An Economic History of the USSR (Penguin, 1969), pp.*; Sheila Fitzpatrick, Stalin's Peasants: Resistance and Survival in the Russian Village After Collectivization (New York, Oxford University Press, 1994), pp.130, 131; Agricultural Workers in the USSR (Bodley Head, 1968), Soviet Studies series, ed.

Amateur career After becoming ABA Flyweight Champion Dower was selected for the team of Great Britain at the 1952 Summer Olympics in the boxing squad, recording victories over Abdelamid Boutefnouchet of France (3‚Äì0) and Leslie Donovan Perera Handunge of Ceylon (3‚Äì0) before finally losing to Soviet boxer Anatoli Bulakov, the holder of the Russian and European titles, 1‚Äì2. Professional career While continuing to work as a coal miner at Abercynon colliery, in 1953 Dower turned professional and he made his professional debut at Maindy Arena in Cardiff against Vernon John. Dower won by technical knockout. Dower then beat Ron Hughes in two rounds before he was taken the distance for the first time, opposing the vastly more experienced Preston fighter Colin Clitheroe. Clitheroe had lost three of twenty two fights, mostly at bantamweight, but lost to Dower by points in a six-round bout. With another four wins to his name, including two over Jimmy Roche, Dower faced Clitheroe again, this time stopping him in round five. On 23 March 1954, with 14 straight professional wins, Dower faced current British Flyweight Champion Terry Allen in a non-title fight at 8st 2lbs. Scheduled for a ten-round fight at Earls Court Arena in London, Dower stopped Allen in the second. With 20 successful bouts as a professional boxer under his belt Dower was given his first chance at a title fight. On 19 October 1954 he became British Empire Champion, taking the title away from South African Zulu boxer Jake Tuli. In November 1954, Dower was ranked 3 in the world by The Ring magazine. Dower was selected as the 'Best Young Boxer' of 1954 by the Boxing Writers' Club in February 1955. Dower married Evelyn Trapp on 6 January 1955. A second chance of a title came in 1955 in the shape of the British flyweight crown. Terry Allen, a previous Dower victim, had vacated the title allowing Dai Dower to contest the crown against Eric Marsden on 8 March at the Harringay Arena. Also at stake was Dower's Empire crown. Dower beat Marsden by points over the 15 round contest. Still unbeaten after 23 fights, the next title came just five months later when Dower took on Nazzareno Gianelli for the European Flyweight title at Earls Court Exhibition Centre, London. The fight went the distance, with Dower winning on points to add the European title. His first defeat came in his defence of the European title, his 27th fight. Young Martin, a Spaniard, began to get through to the champion with his forceful and hurtful body attacks. Dower was dropped in the ninth round for the first time in his career. Dower hit the canvas six times in the tenth. It ended in the twelfth round when Martin dropped Dower for the full count. In December 1955, he made a successful defence of his Empire title against Tuli. Five wins out of five followed in 1956. Later in the year Dower's plans were interrupted when he was called up to the army to do his two years National Service, having expected to continue working at the colliery. He joined the Welch Regiment in October 1956, relinquishing his titles at the same time. In December 1956 he was ranked 2nd in the world (behind Pascual Perez) by The Ring. On 30 March 1957 Dower fought World Flyweight Champion Perez at Club Atletico San Lorenzo de Almagro, in Perez's home town of Buenos Aires. Dower suffered a first-round defeat despite going into the fight with a weight advantage of more than five pounds. Dai Dower continued his National Service in the British Army. He beat Eric Brett in January 1958, and a few days before his army time ended, was due to face Terry Spinks, although the fight was cancelled. Dower only had one more fight, a points defeat against Canadian Pat Supple in October 1958. Later life and death Shortly before his final fight he took up the position of sports master at Ringwood Grammar School in Bournemouth.

The joint mission (composed of UNHCR-SCFUK personnel) reported that \\"refugee children in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been subjected to sexual abuse and exploitation, reportedly by employees of national and international NGOs, UNHCR and other UN bodies...\\" Humanitarian agencies responded almost immediately with measures designed to prevent further abuse, setting up an inter-agency task force with the objective of \\"strengthening and enhancing the protection and care of women and children in situations of humanitarian crisis and conflict...\\" In 2008 there were signs that sexual exploitation and abuse of beneficiaries not only continued, but was under-reported. In January 2010, the ECHA/ECPS task force developed a website devoted to protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) by personnel of the United Nations (UN), non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other international organizations. UNHCR/Save the Children 2002 report on 'sex for aid' in West Africa  A summary of the main findings of the report may be found in an article written by one of the original authors. The report was based on a field mission by the team, which conducted interviews and focus groups with approximately 1,500 individuals (children and adults) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone: > The researchers found that not only was sexual exploitation widespread, it > was also perpetrated by aid workers, peacekeepers, and community leaders. > Humanitarian workers traded food and relief items for sexual favors. > Teachers in schools in the camps exploited children in exchange for passing > grades. Medical care and medicines were given in return for sex. Some forty- > two agencies and sixty-seven individuals were implicated in this behavior. > Parents pressured their children to enter sexually exploitative > relationships in order to secure relief items for the family. The full report was published 16 years after it was written by the UK parliament as part of its inquiry into sexual exploitation and abuse in the aid sector on 31 July 2018. The report entitled 'Sexual violence and exploitation: the experience of refugee children in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone' cites the names of implicated aid agencies and peacekeeping battalions and can be found at the following link: https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/international- development/2002-Report-of-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse- Save%20the%20Children.pdf Response by humanitarian agencies Investigation and sanctions The allegations were investigated by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), which in October 2002 issued a report concluding that it found \\"no widespread abuse by aid workers\\". In an interview with CNN in May 2002, High Commissioner for Refugees Ruud Lubbers stated, \\"We hardly find concrete evidence. It's very scarce\\". Save the Children UK (a partner in the original study) responded, \\"Nothing that the UN has found makes us think that we were wrong\\".Quoted in Asmita Naik: \\"The West Africa sex scandal\\" HPN Prevention In July 2002, the UN's Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) adopted a plan of action which stated that sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers constitute acts of gross misconduct and are, therefore, grounds for termination of employment. The plan explicitly prohibited the ‚ÄúExchange of money, employment, goods, or services for sex, including sexual favours or other forms of humiliating, degrading or exploitative behaviour‚Äù. The major NGHAs and the UN agencies engaged in humanitarian response committed themselves to setting up internal structures to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse of beneficiaries. UN Secretary- General's bulletin A step towards protection from sexual exploitation was taken by the UN with its publication of the Secretary-General's Bulletin, Special measures for protection from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. The purpose of the bulletin was to draw up standards for protecting vulnerable populations (particularly women and children) from sexual exploitation and abuse. It defines sexual exploitation as: > Any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential > power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, > profiting monetarily, socially or politically from sexual exploitation of > another. It prohibits such behavior by all UN staff and by the staff of all organizations working in cooperative arrangements with the UN (i.e. NGHAs). In addition, the bulletin outlines sanctions and procedures to be followed for preventing sexual exploitation and abuse. Building Safer Organisations project In November 2004 a collaborative effort by a number of NGOs set up the Building Safer Organisations project (BSO), to develop the capacity of NGOs \\"to receive and investigate allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse brought by persons of concern‚Äîincluding refugees, displaced persons and local host populations\\". Hosted at the outset as a pilot project by the umbrella organization, the International Council of Voluntary Agencies (ICVA), the project initially developed training materials. Using these materials, the BSO project carried out participatory workshops for NGO and UN staff. As of June 2006, a total of 137 NGO staff took part in management or investigation workshops. In April 2007 BSO was moved to Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International, where it has been merged with HAP's complaints unit. By April 2008, BSO had held \\"16 Investigation workshops; seven Investigations Follow-up workshops; seven Management workshops as well as four Training of Trainers workshops and 1 Complaints Mechanisms workshop. 522 humanitarian agency staff has participated in the BSO Learning Programme workshops.\\" Since its inception, BSO has been helping organisations apply principles of good complaint-and-response systems to cases of sexual exploitation and abuse by staff. BSO helps NGOs achieve greater accountability by: * Training NGO staff through the BSO Investigations Learning Programme (LP) on conducting fair, thorough and confidential investigations into complaints of sexual exploitation and abuse of disaster survivors * Promoting implementation of common standards on preventing and responding to sexual exploitation and abuse by working with national and regional networks * Publishing guidelines on complaints mechanisms and investigation procedures, and a training handbook containing the Investigations Learning Programmes * Providing opportunities for peer-to-peer engagement * Supporting NGOs to develop better practices through research and advocacy An independent evaluation by the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children concluded that the \\"BSO learning program has proven a valuable tool for humanitarian agencies in strengthening their capacity to receive and investigate allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse of beneficiaries by staff....(and) BSO learning program materials are effective and well received\\". Reasons for few complaints Two 2008 studies have pointed out that disaster survivors who have been sexually exploited (or abused) by aid workers often do not complain. Save the Children explains the lack of complaints thus: * Children (and adults) are inadequately supported to speak out about abuse against them. * The international community does not exercise strong-enough leadership or managerial courage on this issue. * There is a lack of investment in child protection by governments and donors. On 25 June 2008 the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International (HAP) released a report on sexual exploitation and abuse, \\"To complain or not to complain: still the question.\\" This report includes details for three countries in which consultations were held. It concludes: > Sexual exploitation and abuse is a predictable result of a failure of > accountability to beneficiaries of humanitarian aid. The single most > important reason for this ‚Äòhumanitarian accountability deficit‚Äô is the > asymmetrical principal-agent relations that characterise most ‚Äòhumanitarian‚Äô > transactions, that puts the users of humanitarian assistance at a structural > disadvantage in their relationship with humanitarian aid providers.

It was written by series creator/executive producer Tim Kring and directed by Greg Beeman. The episode aired on September 22, 2008 immediately after \\"The Second Coming\\" as part of the three-hour premiere event. Plot Claire Bennet realizes that she no longer feels pain when injured. Claire films herself trying to be hit by a train, but Future Peter, masquerading as Present Peter, intervenes before the impact. After exchanging words with Claire, he then teleports away. Meanwhile, two Company agents, Bianca Karina and Gael Cruz, attempt to capture Sylar. He kills them both with a small hand gesture. Tracy enters Nathan's hospital room to offer him a seat on the Senate. Nathan believes that Tracy is Niki Sanders, but she insists that she is not. Tracy leaves, somewhat disturbed, and Linderman appears, confirming that Tracy is not Niki. At the Company, Elle Bishop finds her father, Bob's body with his brain removed. She then lets Noah out of his cell on Level 5, giving him a gun and telling him that Sylar is in the building. Elle is telekinetically thrown down the hall by Sylar, so Noah shoots him several times. However, Sylar regenerates and explains that he's already taken Claire's power. He attempts to take Elle's power by cutting her head open. Elle screams and releases a large electrical discharge that knocks Sylar out and allows the Level 5 prisoners to escape their cells. Future Peter explains to Nathan that he is actually from the future and came to the present to stop him from revealing their powers. Nathan proceeds to call Tracy and accept her offer as Future Peter leaves. Tracy, walking to her car in the parking garage, is confronted by a reporter, (cameo by \\"Hero\\" William Katt), who uses a video feed of Nathan and Jessica Sanders (from season 1) to try to blackmail her to get her to admit she is Niki, a stripper from Las Vegas. An angry Tracy grabs him, and her emotions trigger her ability of cryokinesis. She accidentally freezes him solid, and he shatters on the ground, dead. Tracy flees the scene. Later, Nathan is playing a game of chess with Linderman when a nurse comes in to tell him it is time for lights out, and she comments that he can end a game of chess he's playing by himself. Linderman then reveals that only Nathan can see him. Hiro and Ando travel to Daphne's apartment in Paris, looking for the formula that she stole. Hiro notices an award of Daphne's for a track meet from when she was young. When Daphne arrives, Hiro offers her the award, which he has now stolen from her, in exchange for the formula. Daphne attempts to take both items. Hiro stops time, but she holds a knife to Ando's throat, since Ando cannot move, and starts to make a cut. Hiro allows her to get away with both items, but when time resumes, he explains to Ando about the tracking device he had slipped into the award. Ando, however, notices his neck is bleeding, and is astonished that Hiro let him get hurt. Maya returns to Mohinder's lab, and witnesses him hanging from the ceiling by his legs. She watches as he jumps down, unharmed, and climbs back up the wall, in an insect type of fashion, and after he explains his new powers, Maya expresses her excitement with the results of his new transformation. They then kiss passionately after Mohinder makes an uncharacteristically rash pass at her. With Bob's death, Angela becomes the new head of the Company, and her first act is to implement some changes, starting with firing Elle. Noah Bennet, now released, returns to his home and finds Claire, alive. Though relieved to see her, he tells her that he can't stay at home because of the escaped villains and prepares to deal with them, shooting down Claire's offer to partner up. When Claire mentions the possibility of being attacked at home, Noah tells her that he had considered that; to make sure Claire stays safe at home, Noah and Sandra reveal their enlistment of the aid of none other than Meredith Gordon, Claire's biological mother, to protect the family in Noah's absence. Future Peter teleports to Level 5, where Angela angrily informs him that the villains have escaped. Future Peter wonders how this happened different from his time, and also exclaims that he had trapped the present Peter in the body of one of the escaped villains specifically because this didn't occur in his timeline. Angela berates him about the Butterfly Effect and blames him for the deviations he has caused from the future she has seen. Peter Petrelli, trapped in the body of Jesse Murphy, is forced to accompany the other villains in order not to compromise his true identity. As Flint burns a woman alive, and The German punches a man to death, Peter is forced to watch helplessly. Angela Petrelli ends the episode by going into the cell Sylar occupies and tells him that she can offer the comforts that a mother should provide for her child. When Sylar denies that Angela is his mother, Angela replies, ‚ÄúBut I am dear, I am‚Äù. Production Actor Stephen Tobolowsky had been thrown off of a horse in Iceland and broke his neck in five places between filming for seasons two and three of Heroes.

Betab made an important contribution to the Persian poetry and he commanded great respect among the poets of Kashmir of his time. Betab was an exceptional poet whose Persian poetry reached as far as Central Asia. Some critics have rated Betab's works at par with the Shahnama of Firdausi. Betab was also proficient with reading and writing Arabic. Mulla Mohammad Taufiq Kashmiri, another popular Persian poet of the era who lived near Jama Masjid area of Srinagar and wrote under takhalus Taufiq was a contemporary of Betab. Betab was a frequent visitor to the Court (Durbar) of Pandit Raja Kak Dhar, who was also a gifted poet and wrote under takhalus Farukh. Betab's comprehensive collection (Diwan) of poems was first published fourteen (14) years after his death in 1861 CE. * in Kashmiri language Taba is a short name for Aftab (meaning Sun in Persian)  Origin  Betab's ancestors originally hailed from village Turkipora in Rajwar Tehsil of Kupwara district. This village was named Vishnupora prior to 1305 CE, when the Tatar Zulkadar Khan  commonly named Zulzu invaded Kashmir, massacred huge population nearly depopulating the Valley, set fire to the city of Srinagar and took 50,000 slaves comprising men, women and children. Betab's ancestors challenged Zulzu's forces to fight in place of surrender. In the ensuing battle with the Tatars - Turkis for locals as they came from Turkmenistan, Betab's brave ancestors were killed after which local populace started calling the surviving clan Turki with the village itself getting renamed to Turkipora since. Betab's ancestors relocated to Srinagar during the reign of Budshah. In the next few hundred years, Betab's ancestors moved around to live at various localities of Srinagar before settling at Motiyar Rainawari.  Occupation  After completing his education Betab was appointed as an administrative official (Kardar) at village Breng in Anantnag area of the valley, where he spent most of his service life.  Compositions  Betab composed his writings in the form of masnawis which contain historical details of his times (a masnawi is a long epic poem describing the battles fought and past events and may also include philosophical or ethical themes). Betab was summoned to Kabul and honoured by the general and wazir of Afghanistan Prince Mohammad Akbar Khan. Betab praised his patron Mohammad Akbar Khan in the poem Akbar-nama. Akbar Khan was a great lover of fine Arts. Betab then witnessed the invasion of the Sikh army of Maharaja Ranjit Singh over his native land Kashmir and the defeat of the Afghan governor Muhammad Azim Khan in 1819 CE, which he versified under the title Jang-nama. After the change of rulers, Betab visited Lahore for a meeting with Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Betab was honoured by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in his Durbar, where he also met the powerful and influential Raja Dina Nath, who was Finance Minister of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Following his return from Lahore, Betab composed one more masnawi containing historical details like the other two named Ranjit-nama.  Style  On one occasion someone recited Taufiq's verse (sher) - shikasta rangiye man ba tabeeb dar jung ast /ilaje darde saram husne sandali rang ast (authentic English translation ????), which was applauded by all present in the gathering. Pandit Raja Kak Dhar who was present in the gathering threw a challenge - could anyone compose a better sher in the same style and manner? Betab accepted the challenge on the condition that he should be suitably rewarded and produced a master piece in the process - siyah bakhtam wa az bakhte khaesh khursandam /chara ki bakhte man wa zulfe yar hum rang ast (authentic English translation ????). Pandit Raja Kak Dhar immediately ordered his men to deliver one hundred Kharwars (legacy measure of weight in Kashmir; 1 Kharwar = 177 Pounds or about 80 kg) of paddy at Betab's residence.  Reviews  J.K. Banerji in the book Encyclopaedia of Kashmir mentions \\"Outstanding among the Hindu Pandits who made important contributions to Persian poetry may be mentioned the name of Pandit Taba Ram Turki \\"Betab\\" whose Jang Nama reached classic heights.\\" Further eminent historian and author Pandit Gwasha Lal Kaul in the same book Encyclopaedia of Kashmir mentions \\"Jangnama by Taba Ram Turki stands on the same footing as Shahnama of Firdausi\\". Betab's Masnawis are prescribed for Post Graduation studies in the University of Tehran (needs authentication).

It is the band's first double album, containing 11 songs of various lengths. It was released in 2008, three years after their debut album, A Doorway to Summer. It was released on the independent label Blomljud Records. Blomljud () is Swedish and means \\"flowersound\\", although the lyrics on the album are all in English. The flowers are a recurring theme throughout the whole album. Composition Unlike on A Doorway to Summer, where all words and music were credited to the band as a whole, the booklet to [Blomljud] gives credit to separate band members for each song, revealing Petter Sandstr√∂m and Simon √Ökesson as the main songwriters. Music Most of the music on the album is credited to Sandstr√∂m and √Ökesson, either by themselves or together. Johan Westerlund is credited as writing the music for \\"Bluebells\\", and former guitarist, Anthon Johansson, shares writing credits for \\"Yasgur's Farm\\". =Themes and motives= There are a few musical themes and lead motives that can be heard with different lyrics and some musical variations in different songs, making the album more of a single piece of music rather than eleven separate songs. =Choirs= One thing that typifies Moon Safari's music is the choir arrangements made by Simon √Ökesson. These arrangements often include four voices or more (note that all five members receive vocal credit). =Time signatures= Like many other progressive rock acts, Moon Safari's songs often use unusual changes and values of time signature. The following are some examples found on this album: *Most parts of \\"Bluebells\\" are in 5/8 *\\"Yasgur's Farm\\" includes segments of both 7/4 and 7/8 rounded with 4/4 *\\"Written in the Stars\\" ends with an instrumental section that switches between 5/4, 6/4 and 7/4 *At the end of \\"Child Inside the Man\\", there is another instrumental section in the very unusual 11/8 that may lead to comparisons to Apocalypse In 9/8 by Genesis *\\"After All\\" begins with a simple 4/4 but with one bar shortened to 7/8 which creates a section of 8 bars with a total of 30 and a half beats.

It built a network of four lines in Western Oslo, the Briskeby Line and the Frogner Line which ran to Majorstuen, and two other consecutive lines, the Sk√∏yen Line and the Lilleaker Line. These all connected to a common line through the city center which terminated at Jernbanetorget. KES was established as the second tram operator in Oslo (then known as Kristiania). When it commenced services it was the first electric tramway in Scandinavia. It originally opened the Briskeby Line and the Sk√∏yen Line to Skillebekk using a fleet of Class A trams. Later the company also ordered Class U and Class SS trams, for a total 78 motor cars and 66 trailers. Sk√∏yen was reached in 1903. The first part of the Frogner Line opened in 1902, and it was completed in 1914. The Lilleaker Line was built to Lilleaker in 1919. KES and its competitor, Kristiania Sporveisselskab (KSS) were both taken over by Oslo Municipality in May 1924 and became Oslo Sporveier. The take-over did not include the Lilleaker Line and this part of the operation continued as B√¶rumsbanen. History Establishment The Oslo Tramway was established as a horsecar network in 1875 by Kristiania Sporveisselskab. In 1887 it rejected a proposal for L. Samson, a real estate developer, to build a line to Majorstuen to serve his projects. He therefore contacted engineers H. E. Heyerdal and A. Fenger-Krog, the latter who had studied tramways abroad.Fasting: 41 They sent an application that year to the municipality, at a time when there were no other electric tramways in operation in Europe. However, the application did not explicitly state that the company would use electric traction.Fasting: 42 KSS retained it priority in laying new lines. Skabo and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri The group received permission for two lines, one from Jernbanetorget, the square outside Oslo East Station, to Majorstuen. It would receive a branch from Inkognitogaten and Drammensveien to Sk√∏yen,Fasting: 43 a total distance of .Fasting: 44 User of overhead wires had been discouraged by the city engineer, but he later changed his mind after a trip to Germany. The issue was decided upon by the municipal council on 19 May 1892. The concession had a duration of thirty years, of which the municipality retained the right to municipalize the company after fifteen years and at the end of the duration. Shares worth 800,000 Norwegian krone (NOK) issued in October 1892, which sold out in a month. A/S Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei was incorporated on 16 December 1892. Heyerdal was appointed chair of the board, a position he held until his death in 1917. Fenger-Krog was hired as managing director. Six companies bid to deliver trams and electrical equipment; Allgemeine Elektrizit√§ts Gesellschaft (AEG) won and delivered seven Class A motor trams and five trailers. In June 1893 the contract to lay the tracks was issued to H. W. Wessel. The company applied the municipality to buy power from its Oslo Lysverker, but was rejected. It therefore decided to build a power station at Majorstuen. On the same lot it built the first depot, a prefabricated corrugated galvanized iron structure from Germany.Fasting: 45 Investments totaled NOK 817,572.Fasting: 48 Early operations and expansion KES trams at Anthenum in the city center in 1904 Test runs started on 10 January 1894. The official opening of the first Nordic electric tramway took place on 2 March 1894 and ordinary operation commenced the following day. It was the seventh electric tramway to open in Europe. Amongst the concerns in the public debate was that horses, such as those from the competing KSS, would not be able to cope with seeing a tram running without being pulled by a horse. The competitor's labor union proposed that KES used stuffed horses in front of their trams, but the horses soon learned to cope with the autonomous vehicle.Fasting: 48 At first the trams ran every six minutes, but this proved difficult to operate and it was reduced to an eight- minute headway.Fristad: 27 Initially the motormen were to both drive and sell tickets, but this was found to be too much work for one person to do efficiently. Conductors were therefore introduced almost immediately.Fristad: 26 It turned out that operating a correspondence between the Sk√∏yen Line and the Briskeby Line at Parkveien did not work, as trams from Majorstuen were full and most passengers forced to walk into town. Thus from April KES introduced direct services from Skillebekk on the Sk√∏yen Line to Jernbanetorget. It quickly turned out the company had too few trams and four more were delivered by the end of the year. The Sk√∏yen Line was extended to Frognergaden on 31 December.Fristad: 25 The original network was entirely single track with passing loops. The direct trams led to increased traffic and in 1896 KES therefore applied for permission to lay double track from Parkveien to Jernbanetorget.Fasting: 51 As part of the permit, the municipality bought newly issued shares for NOK 200,000 to become shareholder of a fifth of the company.Fasting: 52 Work commenced in 1898, which also included moving the tracks from Parkveien to Inkognitogaten and from Bogstadveien to Valkyriegaten. The double track opened in 1898 to Majorstuen, and three years later on the Sk√∏yen Line. The latter was combined with an extension to Thune. Majorstuen in 1908 The company gradually expanded its fleet and by 1898 it had taken delivery of twenty-one Class A trams and twelve trailers. A year later a further six trailers were delivered.Fristad: 29 J√∏rgen Barth took over as managing director in 1898.Fasting: 55 The same year the Holmenkollen Line opened and at Majorstuen there was a transfer between the trams of KES and Holmenkolbanen.Fristad: 32 The company took delivery of its first nine larger Class U trams in 1899. This was followed by a further five in 1902 and another five in 1905 and 1906.Fristad: 29 From 1901 KES introduced regular stops instead of stopping on signal.Fasting: 63 The company's next task was extending the Sk√∏yen Line and building a route via Frogner plass to Majorstuen. KSS had originally been given a permit to extend its Vestbanen Line to Frogener, but they were required to start construction within 1901. When they failed to do this, the municipality instead offered the permit to KES. The company started construction and the first part of the Frogner Line, from Parkveien to Frogner plass, opened in October 1902. That years KES was paying eight percent dividend.Fasting: 59 The Sk√∏yen Line, which was at the time named the Bygd√∏y Line, was extended to Sk√∏yen on 21 June 1903.Aspenberg: 7 There was little investment the following years, although in 1907 and 1908 the company built double track to Frogner and to Thune.Fasting: 70 By 1907 the company had an annual revenue of NOK 700,000.Fasting: 69 Later operations Trams on the Sk√∏yen Line Leading up to the 1909 right of the municipality to buy the tramway, KES was evaluated at NOK 3 million in 1908. The issue was debated in light of the 1899 establishment of the municipal-owned Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie and the 1905 sale of it to KSS. There was no similar high-profile debate about munisipalization in 1908 as there had been in 1905. This was in part because there was by then a strong Conservative majority in the city council‚Äîa party who were opposed to municipal a tramway. Instead the municipality negotiated an agreement, whereby it secured itself four percent of the company's gross revenue, increasing to five percent from 1914. The power station was upgraded in 1909, cutting the coal usage from per kilowatt hour. The company decided, mostly of concern for its employee's wellbeing, to cover up the tram's open platform bays. This was in part sorted out through the purchase of new rolling stock. The final five Class U trains were delivered in 1909, bringing the total to twent- four.Aspenberg: 43 Trams were at the time limited by the belief that they could not have a wheelbase exceeding a tenth of the minimum curve radius. This was proven wrong, allowing the tramway to order new and larger trams.Fasting: 71 The first eight Class SS trams were delivered the same year. Deliveries resumed in 1912 and in the following two years a further twenty-six Class SS units were delivered.Aspenberg: 43 Majorstuen Depot's Hall 2, administration building and chimney for the power station. To the right are a tram each from KES and Holmenkolbanen Numbered services were introduced in 1909. KES was the first of the two tramways to introduce numbered lines and secured the lowest digits. The Briskeby Line was numbered 1, the Frogner Line 2 and the Sk√∏yen Line 3. The increased rolling stock allowed most services to run every five minutes from 1910.Fasting: 72 KES and KSS reached an agreement in 1912 to coordinate their services better. This first materialized in a connecting line in Hegdehaugsveien, which allowed trams to run from Stortorvet via the Ullev√•l Hageby Line to Majorstuen. At Skillebekk a connection was built through Munkedamsveien, allowing the Vestbanen Line access to the Sk√∏yen Line.Fristad: 52 In conjunction with the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition at Frogner, the Frogner Line was extended along Kirkeveien to Majorstuen on 15 May 1914. In September a new depot opened at Majorstuen, with place for 75 vehicles‚Äîthe largest in Scandinavia.Fristad: 82 The third connection opened in 1915, linking Jernbanetorget to the Kampen Line and the V√•lerenga Line through a connection along Vognmannsgata, Brugata and Vaterland Bridge. By 1915 the street tram network consisted of thirteen services, of which two were operated by KES and six were joint operations. All services via Homansbyen and Frogner to Majorstuen were joint services. The joint services were operated the relative number of trams in proportion of the ownership of trackage along the line and where each company simply kept the revenue it created on their services.Fristad: 54 The first women conductors were hired in 1916.Fasting: 83 Ten older Class A trams were rebuilt with larger wheelbase and bodies in 1918 and 1919, supplemented by 37 new motor trams and 56 new trailers.Fristad: 62 Staff and trams posing at Majorstuen in 1912 From the company's opening it had charged 10 √∏re for a ride, but this was raised to 15 √∏re in 1918, a price which would remain unaltered for the rest of its history.Fristad: 64 To ease management of such an odd amount, token coins were popular. They were sold with a quantity discount and were commonly used in Oslo as a conventional coin worth 15 √∏re.Fristad: 65 During this period the country was experiencing inflation. KES and the labor union could not reach an agreement for wage increases and the company was hit by a strike from 11 January to 22 March 1920. It was resolved through the municipality offering to reduce its charges.Fasting: 89 As part of the agreement, the 5 √∏re commuter prices in the morning and afternoon were abolished. The company started looking into a further extension of the Sk√∏yen Line in 1912, intending to reach Bestum and √òraker. They applied for a permit in 1913, which was issued in July 1915. KES immediately started construction of the Lilleaker Line. Trial runs were carried out on 8 May 1919 and the line officially opened to Lilleaker the following day.B√¶rumsbanen: 3 Unlike the rest of the network, the Lilleaker Line was built as a suburban light rail, running on an exclusive line rather than in the streets. KES started planning further extensions in 1917 and received permission in 1921 to extend the line to Avl√∏s. Municipalization KES and KSS both had concessions which expired on the same date, in March 1924. At this point the municipality was free to purchase the companies at par value. A municipal committee was appointed in 1922 to look into the matter. KES was valuated at NOK 9 million, while KSS was worth NOK 12.5 million. Oslo Municipality was not interested in taking over the Lilleaker Line, as it was situated in the neighboring municipality of Aker. The committees majority proposed a merger and that KSS received a prolonged concession, while the minority recommended that the tramways be bought by the city. A third option, a jointly public and privately owned company, was also proposed, where the municipality would own fifty-one percent.Fasting: 91 Tram in Stortingsgata in 1905 The issue was considered by the council's executive board, which supported the joint public‚Äìprivate proposal with eleven against nine votes. The argumentation was largely ideological: the left side accused the right for bringing economical advantages for private investors, while the right accused the left of insufficient financial investigations of municipal operations. The issue was voted on in the municipal council in December, with 43 against 41 councillors supporting the joint model. The latter were members of the Communist Party and the Labor Party, who both were in favor of a municipal take-over. The new company, Kristiania Sporveier, was incorporated in May 1924 and took over all street tram operations. The city changed its name to Oslo on 1 January 1925, as did the tram company.Fasting: 92 With the municipalization, most of the assets were transferred to Oslo Sporveier. The exception was the Lilleaker Line, which was kept by the private company. That part was changed into a new tram company, B√¶rumsbanen. The street trams were transferred to Oslo Sporveier, although a few were kept until 1 July, when the Lilleaker Line was extended to Bekkestua. One the same day it took into use twelve Class A suburban trams.Strandholt: 10 Network A map of the tram network in 1939. Dark blue lines were built by KES. KES operated a network consisting of a common line through the city center, three branches, a suburban line and three connections to KSS's network. The street tram network consisted of the Briskeby Line, the Sk√∏yen Line and the Frogner Line. The Sk√∏yen Line continued as the suburban Lilleaker Line. All of KES's lines remain in use. The company's common section of track originated at Jernbanetorget, the square outside Oslo East Station. The line started in Strandgata and continued along Tollbugata to Akersgata. From there it cut across Stortingsgata and continued along Drammensveien.Fristad: 25 The Briskeby Line branches from the common section to Parkveien, where it took off onto Riddervolds gate and continued along Briskebyveien, Holtegata and Bogstadveien before reaching Majorstuen. The Sk√∏yen Line runs along Drammensveien to Sk√∏yen. From Sk√∏yen the Lilleaker Line continued to Jar.Strandholt: 10 The Lilleaker Line is a suburban light rail and runs in its own right-of-way along St. Edmunds vei, Bestumveien and Jonas Dahls vei. The Frogner Line branched from the Sk√∏yen Line at the intersection of Drammensveien and Frognerveiien at Solli plass, just after the Sk√∏yen Line and the Briskeby Line split. The Frogner Line runs along Frognerveien to Frogner plass, the original terminus.Fristad: 28 Since 1914 the line has continued along Kirkeveien to Majorstuen. The company operated one depot‚ÄîMajorstuen Depot.Aspenberg: 37 It consisted of three buildings, the largest of which had room for 75 vehicles. It also featured the coal-fired thermal power station used to generate the electricity for the tramway. Majorstuen was the site of the company's administration, as well as the depot for Holmenkolbanen. Most of KES facilities have been demolished, but one hall remains and is used by the Oslo Tramway Museum. Rolling stock The company bought a total 78 motor cars and 66 trailers; 20 of the motorized vehicles were later converted to trailers. The deliveries were from various manufacturers, most of which were German. The sole Norwegian body manufacturer was Skabo. The trams were of three generations, each with their own class designation. Many of the trams were of the same class as those delivered to KSS.Aspenberg: 45 KES's trams were painted blue, hence giving rise to their nickname, the \\"Blue Tramway\\".Fasting: 50 Class SS (193, left) and Class U (164) at Athen√¶um in Akersgata in 1912 The first class of trams, Class A, were manufactured by Allgemeine Elektrizit√§ts Gesellschaft (AEG) and P. Herbrand & Cie., both of Germany. The undercarriages were built by Bergische Stahlindustri. They featured open platform bays and a cabin. Twenty units were built, with nearly the same specifications. The trams were long and wide. They weighed and were equipped with two NB80 motors with a combined effect of . The exception was three units, no. 118 through 120, which had more powerful VBN120 motors, with a combined . They had seating for sixteen and standing room for twelve. The company also had thirty-two similar trailer units built by Herbrand. One of the trams, no. 117, was a prototype built by Skabo with motors from Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri. Trailer 347 on display in the original Blue Tram colors at Oslo Tramway Museum Twenty-four Class U trams were delivered between 1899 and 1906. The electrical components were built by Union-Elektricit√§ts- Gesellschaft and the bodies by Falkenried and Skabo. The trams had two GE52 motors with a combined power output of and had a total weight of . They were long and were built with open platform bays. Each unit had capacity for twenty seated and fourteen standing passengers. Two units were in 1924 rebuilt to create an articulated tram. However, it proved prone to derailment in poorly banked S-curves and was never put into revenue service. KES took delivery of thirty-four Class SS motorized trams and twenty-two trailers between 1909 and 1914. They had electrical components from Siemens-Schukertwerke and were variously built by Herbrand, Falkenried and Skabo. Their main innovation was that the wheelbase was increased from , allowing for a lengthening of the body. The first eleven were long, while the rest were long. The first eight units had two D72v motors, giving a combined power output of . Later units had a power output of . The second delivered unit, no. 102, has been preserved by the Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology.Aspenberg: 44 Two SS motor units, no. 307 from 1913 and no. 322 from 1918, and one trailer, no. 347, have been preserved by the Oslo Tramway Museum.

William \\"Little Bill\\" Standifer (1853 - October 1, 1902) was an American gunman and lawman of the Old West. He is best remembered for having been killed by noted and better known gunman John Higgins in 1902. Early life and notoriety Standifer was born J. William \\"Bill\\" Standifer in Burnet County, Texas, and raised in Lampasas County, Texas, working cattle. By the age of 14, he was working regularly as a cowboy. That year, when he came across four men rustling cattle, he was pistol whipped by the men and badly hurt, but survived. Despite his youth, he tracked all four men, and killed them one by one. Although charges were pursued, he was acquitted. In April 1879, Standifer was working as a cowboy on the Ike Mullins Ranch, in Tom Green County, Texas, where he came into contact with another cowboy, John McMahon, sometimes called John Mahon. The two found themselves involved in an argument when Standifer refused to allow McMahon to drive cattle across a pasture where Standifer was holding several head of Mullin's cattle. McMahon produced a bullwhip, while a companion pointed a rifle at Standifer, then McMahon began whipping Standifer. Both men were mounted, and Standifer was able to ride away to escape. Days later, Standifer tracked McMahon to a cattle camp near Pony Creek, located in Coleman County. As Standifer rode up, McMahon was mounted talking with several other cowboys. Upon seeing Standifer, McMahon drew his pistol and fired, but missed. Standifer drew and fired also, hitting McMahon in the wrist, causing his pistol to fall from his grip. McMahon spun his horse and galloped away, with Standifer in pursuit. The two made it about 600 yards from where the shootout began, with Standifer shooting McMahon again in the back, knocking him from his saddle. McMahon scrambled to his feet and attempted to run, but was again shot in the back, killing him. Standifer fled, making it to Marfa, Texas, where he became involved in a saloon argument with three soldiers from Fort Davis, during which he shot and wounded two of them, before fleeing. Members of the Texas Rangers hunted Standifer down for the McMahon killing, and arrested him. However he was acquitted in a trial. Those shootings led to Standifer becoming known as a \\"gunman\\", and helped him in gaining employment as a Range Detective. Lawman career, feud with John Higgins By the early 1880s, Standifer was working as a Range Detective, tracking down rustlers, and is known to have shot and killed at least one rustler near Estacado, Texas. When the demand for his services dwindled, Standifer ran and was elected as County Sheriff for Crosby County, Texas from 1888 through 1894. While serving as Sheriff, in 1891, he and Deputy Charlie Quillen pursued a group of Post Office thieves into Lincoln County, New Mexico, where they captured them. On the return trip to Texas, while staying over at the VVN Ranch owned by George Neal, the outlaws attempted to overpower him and Deputy Quillen. The deputy was shot and wounded in the chest with his own rifle, but was able to wrestle the outlaw to the floor and overpower him. The shot had also wounded George Neal's wife. Standifer, who was outside tending the horses, heard the wife scream, and ran inside. Another of the outlaws had acquired Standifer's shotgun, but when Standifer entered, the shotgun misfired. Standifer beat the suspect into submission, then assisted Deputy Quillen. That same night he shackled all three outlaws, and rode with them and Quillen to the nearest doctor. Deputy Quillen survived, and the two were later able to take their prisoners on to Texas. In 1893 he began working again as a Range Detective for large and prosperous ranches in the Texas Panhandle, mainly the powerful Spur Ranch, located in Spur, Texas, where he first met John \\"Pink\\" Higgins, a notable gunman already known to Standifer, since they were both from Lampasas, Texas. Standifer quickly gained a reputation for being an excellent tracker, and for always locating his prey. In June 1898, while tracking rustlers, Standifer arrived in Clairemont, Texas, a rough town at the time, and the location in which Jeff Hardin, brother to gunman John Wesley Hardin, had been shot and killed. Standifer located a rustler named Bob Kiggins there, but Kiggins refused to surrender, and in the gunfight that followed Standifer shot and killed Kiggins. During this period, an animosity between Standifer and Higgins developed, one that has never truly been explained. It has been written that the Horrell Brothers, who were brought down mostly through the efforts of \\"Pink\\" Higgins, and who were distant kin to Standifer, was part of their problems. However, it is more likely that it was due to Higgins' son, Cullin, an attorney, who had only recently represented Standifer's wife in her divorce from Standifer. Fred Horsbrugh, manager of the Spur Ranch, fired both Higgins and Standifer due to the increasing hostilities between them. However, Horsbrugh allowed Higgins to stay on for a time after this, until he could find another job. This angered Standifer. In 1900, Standifer moved to Hartley County, Texas, where he was elected Sheriff. At one point, just prior to Higgins leaving the Spur Ranch, he was dispatched to investigate a possible cattle rustling on a remote section of the ranch. Making a circular approach, Higgins spotted Standifer waiting in a group of trees. Rather than approach him, and knowing he was there to ambush him, Higgins simply went home. However, the animosity continued. On the morning of October 4, 1903, after having made comments that he would kill Higgins, Standifer rode out to Higgins' ranch. Higgins, seeing him from his house, rode out to meet him. Higgins' brother-in-law and daughter were standing on a hillside nearby, and witnessed what happened next. Standifer fired first, hitting Higgins' horse, which then jerked, causing Higgins first shot to go wild. In the shooting exchange that followed, Standifer was shot and killed. Higgins' horse also died. Higgins then retrieved another horse, and contacted Sheriff B. F. Roy, in Clairemont. When Higgins told Sheriff Roy that he believed he had killed Standifer, Sheriff Roy, who disliked Standifer for reasons unknown, stated \\"Well if you're not sure, you'd better go and finish the job\\". The shooting was ruled justifiable homicide, and Higgins was never arrested or tried. He buried Standifer himself, on the Higgins property, naming the thicket where he is buried \\"Standifer's Thicket\\".

She later became a staunch anti-Stalinist activist and, according to secret information declassified in 2010, was a key agent of the American intelligence service known as \\"The Pond\\". Background Fischer was born Elfriede Eisler in Leipzig in 1895, the daughter of Marie Edith Fischer and Rudolf Eisler, a professor of philosophy at Leipzig but of Austrian nationality. Her father was Jewish and her mother was Lutheran.Profile of Ruth FischerGoogle Books references to Ruth FischerNew York Times abstract (incomplete) She was the elder sister to noted film and concert composer Hanns Eisler and fellow communist activist Gerhart Eisler. She studied philosophy, economics and politics at University of Vienna, where her father was working. At an undisclosed time, before March 1921, she adopted her mother's maiden name as part of her writer's name, \\"Ruth Fischer.\\" According to later records of the British Security Service (MI5), she spelled the name Fisher, and also used the names Maslow and Pleuchot. Communism Fischer moved to Berlin in 1919. In 1921, she became leader of the Berlin branch of the Communist Party of Germany. The German authorities tried to forcibly repatriate her to Austria. Thus she married the fellow communist Gustav Golke (1889‚Äì1937, executed in the Soviet Great Purge), in order to be naturalised as a German.Cf. \\"Biographische Datenbanken: Fischer, Ruth\\" (entry), on: Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur (i.e. Federal Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship), retrieved on 25 November 2016. Heinrich Brandler was the national leader of the Communist Party of Germany. In the early months of 1923, Ruth Fischer and Arkadi Maslow urged Brandler to organize an uprising on the model provided by the Bolsheviks in 1917.http://spartacus- educational.com/Ruth_Fischer.htm Together they developed the \\"theory of the offensive\\". Fischer denounced the leadership for \\"making concessions to social democracy\\", for \\"opportunism\\" and for \\"ideological liquidationism and theoretical revisionism\\". Chris Harman, author of The Lost Revolution (1982) has pointed out: \\"Articulate and energetic, they were able to gather around them many of the new workers who had joined the party.\\" Chris Harman, The Lost Revolution (1982) page 217 In 1923, Fischer appealed to a group of Nazi students, proclaiming that \\"Those who call for a struggle against Jewish capital are already, gentlemen, class strugglers, even if they don‚Äôt know it. You are against Jewish capital and want to fight the speculators. Very good. Throw down the Jewish capitalists, hang them from the lamp-post, stamp on them.\\" Ruth Fischer argued that the Communist Party of Germany leaders were saying: \\"In no circumstances must we proclaim the general strike. The bourgeoisie will discover our plans and destroy us before we have moved. On the contrary, we must calm the masses, hold back our people in the factories and the unemployed committees until the government thinks the moment of danger has passed.\\" Pierre Broue, The German Revolution, 1917‚Äì1923 (1971) page 735 In April 1924, the 9th party convention elected her and Maslow co-chairpersons of the Communist Party of Germany. Both criticised by Joseph Stalin, Fischer, intending to defend Maslow (meanwhile arrested for participation in preparing an uprising in Germany planned for 1923), travelled to Moscow arriving there in September 1925 and was held for the following ten months in the Hotel Lux. Meanwhile Ernst Th√§lmann replaced Fischer and Maslow. Joseph Stalin arranged for them to be expelled from the party in August 1926. Espousing left-wing positions, she was a member of the Reichstag from 1924 to 1928 under her then legal name Elfriede Golke. She was a member of the Prussian House of Representatives between 1924 and 1928 too. She fled to Paris in 1933, in August the same year the Nazi government annulled her naturalisation of 1923. Anti-Stalinism In 1941, Fischer left France for the United States. In 1947, she testified before HUAC against her brothers Gerhart and Hanns. Her testimony against Hanns resulted in his blacklisting and deportation. She testified that Gerhart was an important Comintern agent. Communist press denounced her as a \\"German Trotskyite\\". She propounded critical views of Stalinism and called for a rebirth of Communism after Stalin's death. Before this period of anti-Stalinism, she had supported the rise to power of the Triumvirs (Stalin, Grigory Zinoviev, and Lev Kamenev), denouncing Trotsky at the fifth congress of the Communist International. Isaac Deutscher, a biographer of Trotsky and Stalin, described her as a \\"young, trumpet-tongued woman, without any revolutionary experience or merit, yet idolized by the Communists of Berlin.\\"Deutscher, Isaac, \\"The Prophet Unarmed: Trotsky 1921‚Äì1929\\", Oxford University Press, 1980, In 1955, Fischer returned to Paris and published her books Stalin and German Communism and Die Umformung der Sowjetgesellschaft.

It purports to be a series of six dreams by \\"Lieutenant Backsight Forethought\\" about the defence of a river crossing in the Boer War. The infantry tactics in the early dreams are disastrous, but each time BF learns something until in the final defence he is successful. History The Defence of Duffer's Drift was published in 1904 when Swinton was a Captain. It appeared in the British United Service Magazine under the pseudonym, Lieutenant N. Backsight Forethought (\\"BF\\"), who is the narrator of the book. The book is an exploration of small unit tactics in a fictional encounter in the Boer War. Swinton served in South Africa during the Boer War, and the book \\"embodies some recollections of things actually done and undone in South Africa, 1899‚Äì1902.\\" Lieutenant Backsight Forethought and his command of fifty men are given the task to defend Duffer's Drift, a natural ford to a river. A large force of Boers, unknown to BF, is moving toward his position. This scenario is played out six separate times, in six \\"dreams.\\" In the early scenarios, BF and his British troops are ignominiously defeated. After each defeat, BF learns lessons and adapts his strategy for the later encounters. The later dreams end more inconclusively, and in the final dream, BF and his command successfully hold out long enough to be relieved. The book encourages critical thinking and careful use of position and terrain to mount a successful defence. The Defence of Duffer's Drift was reprinted in the April 1905 edition of the Journal of the United States Infantry Association. The book, especially intended for young lieutenants, has become a military staple on small unit tactics, read far afield in places such as the United States, Russia, and Canada.Godefroy, Andrew B., \\"Fictional Writing and the Canadian Army of the Future,\\" Canadian Army Journal, Vol. 8.1 Winter 2005 While some of the advice has become rather dated‚Äînotably, BF eventually decides to imprison all nearby locals, shoot any livestock that could be of aid to the enemy, and impress both Boer and black alike into building fortifications for his men, an \\"approach to the human terrain that would spell disaster\\" in modern times‚Äîthe book is still considered relevant and interesting.\\"B.F.'s approach to his human terrain would have spelled disaster [in the Iraq War]\\" ‚ÄîJohn T. Fishel, on The Defense of Jisr al-Doreaa, a book inspired by The Defence of Duffer's Drift. Storyline Lieutenant Backsight Forethought (BF to his friends) has been left in command of a 50-man reinforced platoon to hold Duffer's Drift, the only ford on the Silliassvogel River available to wheeled traffic. Here is his chance for fame and glory. He has passed his officer courses and special qualifications. \\"Now if they had given me a job, say like fighting the Battle of Waterloo, of Gettysburg, or Bull Run, I knew all about that, as I had crammed it up...\\" While BF's task appears simple enough the Boer enemy causes a multitude of problems, but the astute reader, with a sharp mind and quick intellect, will no doubt solve the problem before the first shot is fired.Combined Arms Research Library, book republication and brief review of Defense of Duffer's Drift, United States Command and General Staff College, U.S. Government Printing Office: 1991 - 554-001/42036. In his first two dreams, the British force is ambushed without much of a fight. Fortifications are not prepared and the sentries announce their locations, allowing the Boers to easily sneak up and defeat the sleepy British soldiers without resistance. In the third and fourth dreams, BF takes more paranoid preparations - digging trenches, impounding local blacks for forced labour, and arresting the local Boer civilians rather than attempting to trade or communicate with them. While able to slow the Boers down some, poor placement of trenches, lack of supplies, obvious fortifications that the enemy can easily detect and plan around, and other problems hamper the British resistance. The fifth and sixth dreams are the most successful; in them, BF creates a spread-out and concealed force that greatly hampers and slows the enemy, even so much as to turn them back and allow for reinforcement in the sixth dream. Lessons learned Title page, with pseudonymous byline \\"Backsight Forethought\\" The following are the lessons learned discussed in this book. #Do not put off taking measures of defence till the morrow, as these are more important than the comfort of the soldiers or the shipshape arrangement of the camp. Choose the position of the camp mainly with reference to defence. #Do not in war-time show stray men of the enemy's breed all over the camp, be they never so kind and full of butter, and do not be hypnotised, by numerous \\"passes,\\" at once to confide in them. #Do not let sentries advertise their position to the whole world, including the enemy, by standing in the full glare of a fire, and making much noise every half-hour. #Do not, if avoidable, be in tents when bullets are ripping through them; at such times a hole in the ground is worth many tents. #With modern rifles, to guard a drift or locality does not necessitate sitting on top of it (as if it could be picked up and carried away), unless the locality is suitable to hold for other and defensive reasons. It may even be much better to take up defensive position some way from the spot, and so away from concealed ground, which enables the enemy to crawl up to very close range, concealed and unperceived, and to fire from cover which hides them even when shooting. It would be better, if possible, to have the enemy in the open, or to have what is called a clear \\"field of fire.\\" A non-bullet-proof parapet or shelter which is visible serves merely to attract bullets instead of keeping them out‚Äîthe proof of thickness can be easily and practically tested. When fired at by an enemy at close range from nearly all round, a low parapet and shallow trench are not of much use, as what bullets do not hit the defenders on one side hit those on another. #It is not enough to keep strange men of the enemy's breed away from the actual defences, letting them go free to warn the enemy of their existence and whereabouts‚Äîeven though they should not be under temptation to impart any knowledge they may have obtained. \\"Another way,\\" as the cookery book says, more economical in lives, would be as follows: Gather and warmly greet a sufficiency of strangers. Stuff well with chestnuts as to the large force about to join you in a few hours; garnish with corroborative detail, and season according to taste with whiskey or tobacco. This will very likely be sufficient for the nearest commando. Probable cost‚Äîsome heavy and glib lying, but no lives will be expended. #It is not business to allow lazy black men (even though they be brothers and neutrals) to sit and pick their teeth outside their kraals whilst tired white men are breaking their hearts trying to do heavy labour in short time. It is more the duty of a Christian soldier to teach the dusky neutral the dignity of labour, and to keep him under guard, to prevent his going away to talk about it.The Defence of Duffer's Drift pg. 21, for the original version. (This lesson has often been edited in later revisions to be merely \\"lazy men\\" rather than \\"lazy black men\\" or \\"dusky neutral\\", and \\"soldiers\\" rather than \\"white men.\\") #When collecting the friendly stranger and his sons in order to prevent their taking information to the enemy, if you are wishful for a \\"surprise packet,\\" do not forget also to gather his wife and his daughter, his manservant and his maidservant (who also have tongues), and his ox and his ass (which may possibly serve the enemy). Of course, if they are very numerous or very far off, this is impossible; only do not then hope to surprise the enemy. #Do not forget that, if guns are going to be used against you, a shallow trench with a low parapet some way from it is worse than useless, even though the parapet be bulletproof ten times over. The trench gives the gunners an object to lay on, and gives no protection from shrapnel. Against well-aimed long-range artillery fire it would be better to scatter the defenders in the open hidden in grass and bushes, or behind stones or ant hills, than to keep them huddled in such a trench. With the defending soldiers scattered around, you can safely let the enemy fill the visible trench to the brim with shrapnel bullets. #Though to stop a shrapnel bullet much less actual thickness of earth is necessary than to stop a rifle bullet, yet this earth must be in the right place. For protection you must be able to get right close under the cover. As narrow a trench as possible, with the sides and inside of the parapet as steep as they will stand, will give you the best chance. To hollow out the bottom of the trench sides to give extra room be even better, because the open top of the trench can be kept the less wide. The more like a mere slit the open top of the trench is, the fewer shrapnel bullets will get in. #For a small isolated post and an active enemy, there are no flanks, no rear, or, to put it otherwise, it is front all round. #Beware of being taken in reverse; take care, when placing and making defences, that when you are engaged in shooting the enemy to the front of the trench, his pal cannot sneak up and shoot you in the back. #Beware of being enfiladed. It is nasty from one flank‚Äîfar worse from both flanks. #Do not position the trench near rising ground over which you cannot see, and which you cannot hold. #Do not huddle all the defending soldiers together in a small trench like sheep in a pen. Give them air. #As once before‚Äîcover from sight is of often worth more than cover from bullets. For close shooting from a non-concealed trench, head cover with loopholes is an advantage. This should be bulletproof and not be conspicuously on the top of the parapet, so as to draw fire, or it will be far more dangerous than having none. #To surprise the enemy is a great advantage. #If you wish to obtain this advantage, conceal the position. Though for promotion it may be sound to advertise the position, for defence it is not. #To test the concealment or otherwise of a position, look at it from the enemy's point of view. #Beware of convex hills and dead ground. Especially take care to have some place where the enemy must come under defensive fire. Choose the exact position of the firing trenches, with an eye at the level of the men who will eventually use them. #A hill may not, after all, though it has \\"command,\\" necessarily be the best place to hold. #A conspicuous \\"bluff\\" trench may cause the enemy to waste much ammunition, and draw fire away from the actual defences. Influence Start of the prologue. The book is attributed to a Lieutenant N. Backsight Forethought, otherwise known as Major General Sir Ernest Dunlop Swinton. The Defence of Duffer's Drift's style of literary fiction has been copied by several authors, making this author an influence upon the writings of others. Some examples are provided below, including: a primer on World War I battalion level combined arms tactics incorporating new types of warfare (tanks, machine guns, and aviation), a mechanized battalion level primer, a military combat service support example, one that is non-military related, and one adopting the parable to operations in Iraq. The first example is Battle of Booby's Bluffs, originally published in 1921 by an Army officer under the pseudonym Major Single List. It is important for its \\"lessons-learned\\" examination of the new weapons introduced in the Great War (most notably tanks, machine guns and aero planes) and how these innovations required learning new combined arms tactics. In the style of Duffer's Drift, a hapless battalion commander faces a battle scenario in a series of six dreams. In the first dream, he makes so many mistakes as to prove catastrophic for him and his men. But he learns a few more things about tactics and leadership through each dream, until at last he leads his men to victory through the treacherous terrain of Booby's Bluffs. Included with the dreams are notations to real life mistakes made by American commanders during the War. Defense of Hill 781, written by James R. McDonough in 1988, deals with a somewhat larger combat element than Duffer's Drift, and having a slightly different reason for the \\"dreams.\\" The Defense of Duffer's Drift Brigade Support Area was written by Staff Sergeants Reginald Scott and Steve Newman, along with Sergeants William Baucom, Rodney Weathers, and Louise Chee in the September 2001 edition of NCO Notes, number 01-2, from the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Institute of Land Warfare. Instead of trying to teach infantry tactics, the authors of this story focused upon a supply company of a forward support battalion in an effort to teach units inside of a Brigade Support Area to become more effective in defensive operations during combat.http://www.ausa.org/programs/nco/notes/NCO%20Notes/nn01-2.pdf Premonitions of the Palladion Project: A Modern Project Management Fable, was written by Dr. Scott S. Haraburda, PhD, PE, in 2008 for a non-military topic, even though it involved the Department of Defense. It contains information about what works and what does not work when managing a project, which can be used to assist anyone in managing a more successful project. This book provided a project management framework illustrating twenty-four project management rules. The general thesis in this book was that using just the best project management tools while forgetting everything else about running the project would doom the project to failure. The Defense of Jisr al-Doreaa was written by Albert J. Marckwardt and Michael Burgoyne. The book follows a young lieutenant through successive lessons while conducting stability and counterinsurgency operations in Iraq.http://www.defenseofjad.com/ The winter 2005 edition of the Canadian Army Journal contained the following praise: Paul Hoffman, in his sequel to The Left Hand of God, titled The Last Four Things, used the example of Duffer's Drift by name as an exercise for Thomas Cale to solve for a defensive position for The Redeemers against the more mobile Commandos of the Folk. The problem set for Cale is to discover how to defend such a position with a lightly armoured small group of \\"Redeemers\\" against attack from a larger force, that would not tie down many \\"Redeemer\\" troops un- necessarily. The Defense of Battle Position Duffer was a publication created by the Asymmetric Warfare Group and Johns Hopkins University in 2016 that covers how commanders may integrate the cyber domain with tactical operations at the brigade combat team level. It follows Colonel Backsight Forethought V, a student of the Army War College, in a similar series of dreams where his mission as a brigade commander in varying scenarios are hampered by more cyber-proficient enemy commanders. Eventually, after integrating a litany of lessons learned throughout previous dreams, he is able to finally defeat a determined enemy with minimal losses.https://innovatedefense.net/StorageFiles/GetFile/04435c3a-dbb7-4205-5034-08d6ee97a8d3 Notes References External links * Marines: Full text with biography, background, glossary, maps (PDF) * Gutenberg: Full text of The Defence of Duffer's Drift (HTML, TXT) Military strategy books 1904 books Works published under a pseudonym Works originally published in British magazines ","title":"The Defence of Duffer's Drift"},{"id":"18901512","text":"A/S B√¶rumsbanen was a tram company that operated the Lillaker-, Kols√•s and √òstensj√∏ Line of the Oslo Tramway, Norway, from 1924 to 1971 when the company became part of Oslo Sporveier.

The story follows on from the previous book, Manhunt, in which the young scribe Kel, aided by his wife Nitis and friend Bebon, try to clear his name of murders he did not commit.

The book was originally published in France in 2007, and translated and published in English in 2008. Plot summary Accused of murders he did not commit, a young scribe named Kel is continuously evading the forces of justice in a desperate attempt to prove his innocence. Aided by Nitis (a beautiful priestess and his wife) and Bebon (an actor and his closest friend), Kel manages to flee south and eventually take refuge in Thebes, safely out of the reach of the pharaoh Ahmose and his main pursuers, Judge Gem and Henat, head of the spies. Protected by the spiritual leader of Thebes, a venerable lady known as The Divine Worshipper, Kel manages to finally clear his name, but not in time to save Egypt, as the Persian forces swarm across the border and overrun the country.

After nearly 100 league appearances for Wednesday, Davies moved to Third Division North side Chester ahead of 1956‚Äì57, in a summer in which new manager John Harris also recruited Billy Foulkes, Ron Hansell and John Mulholland as a wave of enthusiasm gripped the club.Sumner (1997), p 68-69 Davies went on to score in a shock Welsh Cup victory over First Division side Cardiff City later in the campaignSumner (1997), p 69 and also scored four league goals.Sumner (1997), stats section But he managed just two league appearances early the following season and joined Wellington United, where he spent one season. After leaving football, Davies went on to work as a window cleaner in Chester. Although he had a reputation as tough tackling player, Davies was never booked or sent off throughout his career.

From the point of view of a bibliographic index the indexed papers are \\"source literature\\". For example, the Social Sciences Citation Index is a \\"source index\\" covering the journals being indexed. These journals are the source literature from the point of view of this index. But from the point of view of the indexed papers they are the bibliographical references contained in the single papers \\"source literature\\". In the humanities, the term \\"source literature\\" has a more precise meaning than \\"published sources\\": Many archives, for example, publish important sources to be used by historians and other scholars as reliable editions of formerly unpublished sources. The publishing of such sources requires knowledge of text philology and other fields. But this kind of expertise put into the publishing of source literature should be differentiated from the kind of expertise needed in order to use the sources in, for example, historical research. A historian may or may not use such \\"source literature\\" and on the basis of his research publish a paper, which in the UNISIST model is considered primary literature.

He was a pioneer in Norwegian theater history by founding the first public theater in Oslo in the year 1771. Life Early career The early life of Martin N√ºrenbach is sketchy. He was from Germany, but his year of birth is unknown. He likely came to Sweden in the travelling theater company of the German theater director Carl Seuerling, who arrived to Sweden in 1759, and are estimated to have been a child or a teenager at that time. Carl Seuerling married the Swedish actress Margareta Lindahl, and took over the travelling Swedish theater company of his father-in-law Peter Lindahl, thereby staying in Sweden. N√ºrenbach later stated (1769) that he was the \\"stepson\\" of Carl Seuerling, but this statement is unclear and is familial relation to Seuerling is unconfirmed.Birger Sch√∂ldstr√∂m, Seuerling och hans \\"com√¶dietroupp\\". Ett blad ur svenska landsortsteaterns historia, 1889 If the identification of stepson is to be taken literary, he could have been the son of Carl Seuerling's first wife Maria Heidensk√∂ld in her previous marriage, but this is unconfirmed. A woman by the name of Jacobina N√ºrembach is listed as a maid of the Seuerling theater company, and may have been a relative.Birger Sch√∂ldstr√∂m, Seuerling och hans \\"com√¶dietroupp\\". Ett blad ur svenska landsortsteaterns historia, 1889 Martin N√ºrenbach is listed as a member of the Stenborg Company in a passport to Uppsala in 1767, and as a member of the Seuerling troupe in 1767‚Äì68. As a member of the theatre company, he performed rope- and wire-dancing and acrobatics, and identified himself as an equilibrist. He also participated in plays as an actor, though he had only moderate success in this field. As a member of the Stenborg and Seuerling theatre companies, he toured both Sweden and Finland, which was at that time a Swedish Province. N√ºrenbach was active as a dance instructor and advertised extensively and offered dance lessons in the cities he passed on his tours, which was evidently an important side income. He was at one point active as the \\"city dancing master\\" in Gothenburg. At some point, he married his colleague, the dancer Anna Katarina Rancke. Norway In July 1770, Martin N√ºrenbach made his debut as a dance teacher and performer in Oslo in Norway. From October 1771, he performed in companionship with the professional dancer and musician Christina Doreothea Stuart. In the end of 1770, he had formed a small theatre company of Norwegian stage actors. In December 1771, N√ºrenbach was given royal permission upon application to perform theatre performances in Oslo, thus founding the first permanent theatre in a city where previously only travelling theatre companies or private amateur societies similar to Det Dramatiske Selskab had performed. Between December 1771 and February 1772, the theatre staged a number of theatrical pieces, pantomimes, dancing, and acrobatics by Norwegian artists, performing in Danish.Anne Margrete Fiskvik, Where highbrow taste met itinerant dance in eighteenth century Scandinavia: The dance entrepreneur Martin N√ºrenbach According to advertisements, comedies by Holberg were performed mixed with dance performances. Not much is known of the activity of the N√ºrembach theatre. Martin N√ºrenbach himself was evidently an appreciated and popular dancer, but not considered as good in the capacity of an actor, and it seems as if the dance performances were more appreciated than the theater plays, which is why dance performances were mixed with the plays.Anne Margrete Fiskvik, Where highbrow taste met itinerant dance in eighteenth century Scandinavia: The dance entrepreneur Martin N√ºrenbach Aside from N√ºrenbach himself, nothing is known about the members of his cast, other than that they were said to have been Norwegians performing in the Danish language.Anne Margrete Fiskvik, Where highbrow taste met itinerant dance in eighteenth century Scandinavia: The dance entrepreneur Martin N√ºrenbach N√ºrenbach's wife Anna Katarina Rancke is not mentioned at all during their stay in Norway (though it is known that she was present) and it is unknown if she performed. In February 1772, the theater of Martin N√ºrenbach was closed and he and his wife departed Norway for Sweden. Not long after, the Norwegian theater ban of 1738 was reintroduced in Norway, but he is noted to have closed his theater and left prior to this, of unknown causes. The theater of Martin N√ºrenbach was the first permanent theater in the history of Norway and was as such a pioneer institution for which N√ºrenbach is remembered, though it was not to last.Anne Margrete Fiskvik, Where highbrow taste met itinerant dance in eighteenth century Scandinavia: The dance entrepreneur Martin N√ºrenbach In 1780, it was succeeded by the private amateur theatre Det Dramatiske Selskap, but no new public professional theater was founded in Oslo until the Christiania Offentlige Theater was founded by Johan Peter Str√∂mberg in 1827. Late career In September 1773, Martin N√ºrenbach, again a member of the Stenborg Company, is known to have performed as an acrobat in the Humleg√•rdsteatern in Stockholm, where he made such a success that the theater company had to expand the seats of their stage building in order to give room for the large number of spectators.Johan Flodmark: Stenborgska sk√•debanorna: bidrag till Stockholms teaterhistoria, Norstedt, Stockholm, 1893 It was as a dancer he was famed, and performed as such after every play, but he is noted to have performed as an actor in the role of Harlequin on the 8 October. \\"N√ºrenbach with spouse\\" departed as members of the Stenborg theater company to Finland, where he bought the permit to stage theater in Finland from Petter Stenborg in companionship with the actor Beckman. From 1774 to 1780, N√ºrenbach-Beckman would have been the only travelling theater company active in Finland, but not much information is known of their activity. In 1781, N√ºrenbach's colleague Beckman returned to Stockholm where he sued N√ºrenbach for having broken their contract by abandoning him and taken all their actors with him: however, the court protocol simply stated that N√ºrenbach was \\"No longer present in the Kingdom.\\"Johan Flodmark: Stenborgska sk√•debanorna: bidrag till Stockholms teaterhistoria, Norstedt, Stockholm, 1893 Martin N√ºrenbach died in Tavastia in Finland in late 1780.Johan Flodmark: Stenborgska sk√•debanorna: bidrag till Stockholms teaterhistoria, Norstedt, Stockholm, 1893 References * Johan Flodmark: Stenborgska sk√•debanorna: bidrag till Stockholms teaterhistoria, Norstedt, Stockholm, 1893 Seuerling och hans \\"com√¶dietroupp\\".

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. History In 1913 the United States Congress created the Federal Reserve System, which established twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, including the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Detroit was included in the Chicago region. Regional banks had the authority to create branch offices, and in 1917 the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago authorized the establishment of a Detroit Branch. In March 1918, the Detroit Branch opened, operating out of three local institutions. However, Detroit operations soon outgrew this operation, and in 1921 a site was chosen for a new building. This site was within the Detroit Financial District, at a location that had once been part of Fort Shelby. After the fort was demolished, the land associated with it was divided into lots. Hiram Walker purchased several lots and constructed a house there. After Walker's death, the University Club purchased the house, and in 1916 the property was purchased by James Couzens. Couzens sold the land this building is located on to the Federal Reserve in 1921. In 1926, Congress authorized the construction of this building. The Federal Reserve hired the Chicago firm of Graham, Anderson, Probst & White to design it, and construction began in 1927. The building officially opened in December 1927. However, by the early 1940s, the branch office had outgrown the building's capacity. In 1945, the Federal Reserve purchased lots adjacent to the building, and hired the firm of Smith, Hinchman & Grylls to design an annex. The firm's head designer, Minoru Yamasaki, planned the building. Construction began in 1949, and by 1951, the eight-story glass-and-marble annex, was opened. The Modern annex is clearly designed not to mimic the original building, but to make a statement all its own. After completion of the annex, the original building was gutted and renovated, and the entire complex was opened in 1953. In 2004, the Federal Reserve Bank moved to a new building at 1600 East Warren Avenue, leaving the building on Fort empty. A developer purchased the building with the intention of creating loft space. However, Dan Gilbert purchased the building on January 30, 2012. In February 2014, the Detroit Media Partnership, parent of the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News, announced all three organizations would occupy six floors in both the old and new sections of the building. The partnership expected to place signs on the exterior similar to those on the former headquarters. The move took place October 24‚Äì27, 2014. Description The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Detroit Branch Building consists of a 1927 three-and-one-half-story marble-faced Classical Revival bank building and a 1951 eight-story International Style Annex. The Annex is set back 30 feet from the front of the original building, and a small raised plaza is sited in front of the Annex and beside the original building. The floor levels of the two buildings are aligned, and the original building was gutted with the Annex was constructed, providing a seamless transition between the structures. The fourth floor of the original building was demolished to provide space for a penthouse projecting from the Annex, and a terrace for outdoor seating. The original 1927 building measures 75 feet by 130 feet, and has a black marble base approximately four feet high, with the upper section sheathed in white marble. A heavy stringcourse above the second-story windows separates the lower floors from the third (attic) story. The first-floor windows are multi- paned six-over-six windows with a cast-iron spandrel between each pair. The second and third floors originally had one-over-one double-hung windows, but these have been replaced with a single pane. The original main entrance of the building was eliminated in the 1951 renovation. The 1951 Annex measures 115 feet by 100 feet. The curtain walls are constructed from a grid of stainless steel from which 1-1/2\\" marble slabs are suspended. The ground floor is divided into seven bays by marble piers. The curtain walls on the upper floors extend three feet beyond the recessed ground floor piers. The white marble used in this structure was carefully chosen to match the color of the original building, and the glass was tinted green to reduce glare.

Released on October 7, 2003 by Roadrunner Records, it was the only album that the band released before disbanding in 2006. The album was intended to be self-produced by Shawn Crahan and Brandon Darner, but after producer Rick Rubin was sent demos by Crahan, Rubin invited the band to Los Angeles where he assumed the role of executive producer. Following the release of the album, a music video was released for the song \\"In The Mood\\" on December 1. The album was generally well received by critics, who remarked on its diversity and significantly different musical style to that of drummer Crahan's other band Slipknot. They noted that it features music inspired by The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and Weezer, among others. However the album did not appear on any sales charts. History In June 2002, band members Shawn Crahan, Brandon Darner and Stevan Robinson began working on an album together. Drummer Crahan told MTV that working on this album \\"made [him] find [his] voice\\" and that with his other band Slipknot he had been \\"hurting for a long time for a musical voice\\". In an interview with Launch, he said that writing the track \\"The World's Too Small\\" was his \\"most magical musical experience\\" because \\"[he] was giving more than on just one or two simple ideas.\\" In 2003 Crahan sent producer Rick Rubin two songs that he and Darner had written, primarily to receive an opinion on the songs. However, Rubin invited the band to Cello Studios in Los Angeles to work on an album. It was there that the album featuring 11 tracks was self-produced by Crahan and Darner, with Rubin as executive producer. On October 7, 2003, To My Surprise was released through Roadrunner Records. An animated music video for the track \\"In The Mood\\" was produced by BoingBoing, which was premiered on MTV's Extreme show on December 1. Also, the track \\"Get It To Go\\" was featured on the soundtrack for the video game MVP Baseball 2004. To My Surprise did not tour in 2003 to promote the album because Crahan was working with Slipknot on their third album. However, they did perform a limited number shows in North America the following year. Musical style Prior to the release of the album, drummer Crahan touted To My Surprise as \\"a hybrid of folk, '70s rock fuzz and schizophrenic grooves\\". Neil Strauss of The New York Times stated that each song has a unique sound, concluding that they sound like \\"pop songs that have been pushed off balance\\". In another article Strauss includes They Might Be Giants, Weezer and Faith No More as bands with similar-sounding \\"elements\\". Rowan Shaeffer of Counterculture, commented on the album's diversity, saying \\"to say that the [album] is eclectic would be a gross understatement,\\" citing Pink Floyd and Mr. Bungle as evident influences. The Calgary Suns Mike Bell cited \\"glam, new wave, Beatles pop and country rock\\" as the sounds the album presents. In his review for Allmusic Robert L. Doerschuk noted that the track \\"Sunday\\" makes musical references to the single \\"Pleasant Valley Sunday\\" by The Monkees, giving the \\"happy, strumming guitars and skippy rhythms\\" as similarities. He also said that they quote \\"one of the darker verses in the Jim Morrison songbook\\". Reception To My Surprise was met with generally favorable critical reviews, but did not appear on any sales charts. One point which was generally drawn upon was the significant difference between their musical style to that of Crahan's other band Slipknot. Reviewer Neil Strauss opens his review with a reference to the title of the album, saying, \\"And, truly, it is a surprise\\", and then going on to say that the album \\"is commendable not just because [it is] different but because [it is] good\\". Robert L. Doerschuk of Allmusic declares that the album‚Äîaside from the track \\"Say Goodbye\\"‚Äî\\"maintains a buoyant and unsubtle approach\\". He also noted Crahan's \\"muscular style\\" as a notable element to the album saying that \\"[it] transplants well into this setting, which probably should not have been a surprise after all\\". The vocals on the album were praised by the reviewers at babysue, saying \\"the vocals [are] masculine yet right on key\\". When reviewing for Calgary Sun, Mike Bell highlighted their eclectic nature and in conclusion said the album is \\"fittingly, fun and surprising\\". However Rowan Shaeffer of Counterculture said that their diversity was ultimately their strength and weakness; he suggested that they relied too heavily on their influences by creating songs of other bands, saying that \\"the only [song] left out was the To My Surprise song\\".

He is remembered for having founded the first theatre house in Finland. Life Bonuvier was the son of Peter Bonnevier, a servant of the queen of Sweden, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia, and Anna Elisabet Klisnick. Karl Gustav Bonuvier married the actress Ulrica Sofia Bj√∂rling (1778‚Äì1809) and after her death to the actress Maria Christina Widbom (1791‚Äì1825), and had four daughters. Career He was active at the Stenborg Theatre in Stockholm in 1796‚Äì99, where he played the lover in Den dubbla intrigen ('Double intrigue') by Dumaniant. When the Stenborg theater was closed in 1799, he was engaged in the travelling theater of his wife's brother-in-law Johan Peter Lewenhagen as well as in the Djurg√•rdsteatern. Finally, he formed his own travelling theater company, where he toured by the privilege of the Russian Czar in 1813‚Äì27. In 1813, he was allowed to found a permanent theatre house in Turku, the Bonuviers Teater; the building was completed in 1817. This was the first theatre house in Finland, which made Bonuvier a pioneer. Previously, theatre in Finland had been conducted by travelling theatre troupes from Sweden, such as the Stenborg Troupe and the troupe of Martin N√ºrenbach and in 1795, the touring Seuerling theatre company became the first theater company permanently situated in Finland under the leadership of Margareta Seuerling. It was, however, Bonuvier who pioneered the first theater company in Finland staffing a permanent theater building rather than touring. His theater house was the predecessor of the √Öbo Svenska Teater (1837). The Bonuvier theater burned down in 1827, which also dissolved the theater company of Bonuvier. He was engaged as an actor in other theater companies, notably that of Carl Wilhelm Westerlund, and reportedly still active as an actor in other theater companies as late as 1838, but his last years are less known. He died in the home of his daughter, who was married to an official in Fredrikshamn.

The film's title is after Pirandello's explanation of the local name C√†vusu of the woods near his birthplace in the neighborhood of Girgenti (Agrigento), on the southern coast of Sicily, as deriving from the ancient Greek word kaos. Plot The film depicts four short stories from Pirandello's 15-volume series Novelle per un anno, which play around his birthplace in the 19th century. A raven, which in the introduction is shown to get a bell around his neck from locals, leads one from one story to the next. Each of the stories is approximately 40 minutes in length. * L‚Äôaltro figlio (\\"The Other Son\\") is about a mother whose two sons have emigrated to the United States. She hasn't heard from them since (14 years ago), but she still favors them over a third son who has stayed behind and tries to help and please his mother. The reason for her completely shunning him are explained in flashbacks to events in 1860, after the arrival of Garibaldi in Sicily. * Mal di luna (\\"Moonsickness\\") Three weeks after their honeymoon, Sidora discovers that, during the full moon, her husband Bat√† spends the night howling outside like a werewolf and scratching to get back in. Bat√† tries to save his marriage by allowing her to have the handsome Saro spend the full-moon nights at their place to protect Sidora. * La giara (\\"The Jar\\") In this comedic section, a feudal landlord (Don Loll√≤) orders a very large jar for his olive oil, but the new jar breaks almost immediately under mysterious circumstances. The great \\"jar-fixer\\" Zi' Dima, famous for his secret-recipe glue, is called to repair the jar, but Zi' Dima manages to fix the jar with himself in it and Don Loll√≤ refuses to break the jar again to let him out. * Requiem Motivated by the imminent death of their founding father, farmers in a remote hamlet on grounds owned by a baron try to obtain the rights to bury their dead locally rather than in the town, which is over a day's hike away. The baron refuses and carabinieri escort the peasants back to their hamlet to break down the beginnings of a graveyard the peasants are building. A 20-minute epilogue, Colloquio con la madre (\\"Conversing with Mother\\"), describes Pirandello's fictional visit home many years after his mother has died. He asks his mother to retell the story of a trip to Malta she took as a child to visit her exiled father.

Believing that his privileged position would be restored after the war, Ovazza stayed on after the Germans marched into Italy. Together with his wife and children, he was killed near the Swiss border by SS troops in 1943, shortly after the collapse of Mussolini's government during World War II. Early life and family He was born, one of three brothers, to the Ovazza family, a wealthy and influential Jewish banking family based in Turin. They were one of the leading banking families in Italy. His father and his three brothers voluntarily enlisted to fight in the First World War. Though following Jewish traditions such as celebrating Passover, the family was well integrated into Italian high society. His father served as the leader of the Turinese Jewish community. World War I Ettore Ovazza studied law at university and then travelled to Germany with a view to a diplomatic career. At the outbreak of World War I he had volunteered and trained as an officer, only to suffer the humiliating defeat at Caporetto. His patriotic letters from the front were published in 1928 and received general praise. After the war, the city of Turin was badly affected by the turmoil of the Biennio Rosso (Two Red Years) with repeated strikes, lockouts and violent demonstrations. The Ovazza family were alarmed by these developments. Between war years Ettore Ovazza was a committed Fascist from the start. He took part in the March on Rome in October 1922; in 1929 he was invited to meet Mussolini as a part of a delegation of Jewish war veterans. He later described the encounter: In the 1920s and 1930s Fascist attitudes to the Jewish population began to change. Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany and, although Benito Mussolini rejected his racist views, they influenced some leading Fascists in Italy. In 1934 several Jews were arrested in Turin for smuggling in anti-Fascist literature. Ettore Ovazza reacted by doubling his efforts to support the Fascist regime. He founded the newspaper La nostra bandiera (Our Flag), reminding Italians of the Jewish sacrifice for Italy in the Great War. Taking a leading role in the Jewish community in Turin, Ovazza ensured that all the key positions were held by Fascist supporters. When Mussolini invaded Abyssinia, he immediately volunteered for service, an offer that was turned down probably due to his age (43). Despite the beginnings of anti-semitism, Ovazza was still being rewarded for his patriotism. In 1935 he was honoured for his contribution to the colony of Libya and in the following year was invited at the honour guard at the tomb of the royal family in Superga (Turin). World War II In 1938, when a series of anti-semitic laws were passed, the Ovazza family were hit hard. Jews were no longer allowed to marry \\"Aryan\\" Italians, to send their children to state schools, to employ Italian servants or be in the army. Much more damaging were the rules that stated they could not employ over 100 people, or own valuable land or buildings. In 1939 Jews were banned from all skilled jobs; shops and caf√©s displayed signs saying that Jews were no longer welcome. Jewish organisations were disbanded and many Jews converted to Catholicism or emigrated abroad. This put an end to the Ovazza business and banking operations. Ettore Ovazza was expelled from the Fascist party and his brother from the military. Ettore's two brothers left the country and advised him to do the same, but he was reluctant to leave the country, hoping that the Duce would alter his views. He wrote an anguished letter to Mussolini, expressing his pain: Death After Italy‚Äôs surrender in 1943, Ovazza and his family were intercepted and shot by the SS, close to the Swiss border.Murders on Lake Maggiore Legacy His nephew, Alain Elkann, wrote a fictionalized version of his life.

Family and education Hiteswar Saikia was born on 5 October 1936 at Bogabagh Tea Estate to Haladhar Saikia. From his childhood, Saikia was drawn to the non-cooperative movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi. To join the movement he gave up going to school. At that time, he was studying in Class IX only. His father influenced his career at almost all the turning points of his early life. It was his father who made him go to Lucknow for postgraduate studies where he earned an M.A. in History. As a result of his father's matchmaking, Saikia married Hemoprabha. His eldest son Debabrata Saikia came into the politics in 2011. Early political career Although Hiteswar Saikia was not in the front rank of the leadership when Assam had been swept by the tides of two big political movements, namely The Oil Refinery movement of 1958 and The State Language movement, by dint of his organising capacity he caught the attention of discerning eyes. Saikia joined the ‚ÄòAll India Congress Committee‚Äô on 15 August 1964. At that time, the responsibility of leading its youth wing was foisted upon him. He became a very popular figure and contested the Assembly election from his home constituency at Nazira, a small township situated near the ancient capital of the Ahom kings at Gargaon in the district of Sivasagar, Assam. When he was elected, he was included in the newly formed Sarat Chandra Sinha Ministry. He was given a junior rank as a minister of state and was given the three portfolios of Home, Education and Public relations in 1972. In 1974 the Chief Minister, Mr. Sarat Chandra Sinha upgraded him to a full scale minister of Cabinet rank with the all-important Home portfolio entrusted to him. This was a turning point in his career. While he was still the Vice Principal of the college where he had taught History, he thrice was to hold the education portfolio: under the chief minister of Sarat Chandra Sinha, it was from May 1972 to March 1974; under a stop-gap Chief Minister, Syeda Anwara Taimur from December 1980 to June 1981 and under yet another stop-gap Chief Minister, Keshab Gogoi, between January and March 1982. Just a few months before the withdrawal of the President's rule in Assam, Saikia parted ways with Sarat Chandra Sinha and he joined Congress (I) in 1980. Saikia was sounded out as to his taking the leadership of the party on several occasions and declined. Saikia's political maturity and organising ability eventually caught the eye of Indira Gandhi. When the expiry date of President's rule was approaching, a constitutional crisis appeared on Assam's political horizon. Indira Gandhi came to Assam to study the whole situation occurring.The Swooping Sparrow by Dr. Mahendra Bora Projects During the Ministry of Keshab Chandra Gogoi, Saikia was in charge of the Education portfolio. He introduced far reaching changes in Assam's field of education. First he created a separate 'Directorate for Elementary Education'. Secondly, he introduced the idea of what is termed ‚Äòprovincialization of high schools‚Äô. In the wake of provincialisation, about 2,500 privately run government-aided high schools came under the direct administration of the government, benefitting both students and teachers financially. He made liberal grants available towards the appointment of many teachers in language subjects. He also made far- reaching changes towards raising the status of police officers and of ordinary constables. He revamped the department, ridding it of the hangovers of the British regime, transforming it into a battalion of uniformed persons who are sentinels of law. He established the Forensic Laboratory at Guwahati, the capital of Assam and set up the ‚Äòsingle digit fingerprint bureau‚Äô. He turned his attention toward bifurcating the Criminal Intelligence Department and creating a Special Branch of it to be run independently. He then improved the functioning of the ‚ÄòAssam Police Radio Organization‚Äô by modernising its equipment. Finally, he established a separate training centre for the armed police. But soon some cracks developed in the alliance. The Assam movement that demanded the expulsion of all foreigners‚Äîwhose number had been estimated to be several lakhs‚Äîgained momentum and the AASU was on the forefront of the movement. When Saikia came back from Mizoram to play his role in Assam politics, he was picked up as the President of the APCC (I) by Rajiv Gandhi. He meant sending the opposite team of Asom Gana Parishad, which entered into the phase of tail enders‚Äô game. The 1991 general election was the greatest challenge for Saikia's life. He did everything with concentration on details in respect of every single constituency. From the very first Saikia was sure of annexing the biggest chunk by dint of his holding the winning tricks in his hand. When he got scent of the fact that the main contending party of Congress (I), that is, the AGP would be receiving neither covert nor overt support it expected of the ULFA. Saikia was doubly sure of the victory of Congress (I). He waited to disclose the anticipation of a resounding victory till the arrival of Rajiv Gandhi who was to visit Assam for releasing the Congress(I) election manifesto. Rajiv Gandhi was fully convinced with the strategies of Saikia and gave him all the responsibility of electioneering in the entire State. Saikia undertook extensive tour of the villages rather than towns and near cities. He knew that Indian villages represent all important vote banks. After the Assam election and the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the election result came out in Assam in favour of Congress. It was all due to the Saikia's ability to retrieve the people's confidence and trust in Congress. He was elected from his home constituency for the fifth consecutive term. When the ULFA kidnapped fourteen top ranking officials serving directly under the Government of Assam and they were taken as hostages by the militant organization (ULFA) which promised to released them in exchanged of the advanced release of a certain number of their comrades-at-arms who had been arrested under Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act rules during the earlier Army operation known as ‚ÄòOperation Bajrang.‚Äô In such a situation, Chief Minister Saikia made an offer of general amnesty and by way of touching wood, he went to the extent of releasing a good number of ULFA detenus against whom there were no specific charges. Meanwhile, Saikia managed to find out some go-between persons who enjoyed the confidence of the ULFA leaders. As behind the scene negotiation went dragging on only to end in hard bargaining. Chief Minister Saikia took an off the track decision to declare giving effect to the idea of granting general amnesty unilaterally expecting the same to be reciprocated by the ULFA with immediate release of the hostages. He also went on air on 8 July 1991, offering the proposal of holding a meaningful talk with the militant organisation towards a permanent solution of the problem within the framework of the Indian constitution. However, Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao threw his weight behind Saikia, and he fully endorsed the policy of Saikia, though it differed basically with that of the Govt of Punjab in dealing with a problem similar in nature. The ULFA reciprocated the liberal gesture of the government by releasing most of the hostages but by no means all. The backdrop of the ULFA going increasingly rebellious and people's faith on legally constituted government was getting diminished. CM Saikia had been compelled to look for measures in both nature and approach. He called for assistance of the Army for the restoration of peace and order in the State. Operation Rhino as this was the second Army operation had been named in contrast with the Operation Bajrang. It succeeded exactly where the earlier operation had failed. It destroyed many training camps, captured still more militant soldiers and also unearthed great many warehouse of arms and ammunitions. By the middle of January, 1992, there had been a change of climate in the civic life of Assam. The ULFA came forward with its expressed desired of sitting for discussion towards finding a permanent solution of its grievances within the framework of the Indian constitution. Chief Minister Saikia welcomed the change of mood and responded to it richly. At the same time he assured giving appropriate living avenues to those militants who would be coming forward to surrender themselves. The arms and ammunitions in their possession. Everyone felt to the bones that peace and security have returned to the State. Everyone acknowledge the spirit of tolerance and forgiveness displayed by Chief Minister Saikia in bringing round most of the ULFA militants to the path of sanity. However, certain other parts of Assam began to feel the impact of violence by some other group of terrorists. The leadership was jointly shared by the ABSU and BPAC groups. But, all of a sudden, BSF came to the forefront whose aim was to achieve an independent Bodoland. BSF believing in armed struggle than anything else. He solved the problem which may be identified as the problem of mini-India everywhere in the country. The Bodo's celebrated the occasion with great jubilation. Turning his attention to the need of streamlining his liaison wing with persons of proven ability and incorruptible integrity, before whom he can unbag his hunches and premonitions. Drafting the service of Robin Choudhury, who was his Press and Publicity Adviser. Within three months of the Saikia Government's coming to power, a consistently descending curve in the State's crime rate with reference to political murder became visible. To Saikia, repentance is everything. Assam's economy is dependent on keeping the three resource oriented industries on the even keel. These three industries are always referred to in terms of gold, that is green gold (tea), liquid gold (petroleum) and black gold (coal). Saikia took steps towards getting the business in the form of auction market opened at Guwahati. The fourth Oil Refinery in Assam that was in Numaligarh which was taken up by Saikia. He invited the Prime Minister to lay the foundation stone of the Numaligarh refinery on 3 July 1992. Chief Minister Saikia offering the argument of the necessity of opening up of two Universities simultaneously at Tezpur and Silchar. He went to Delhi and returned with the approval and necessary sanction for starting both the two universities. He is every inch of practical politician to the last tip of his fingers.The Swooping Sparrow by Dr. Mahendra Bora Chief Ministership of Assam The Congress Legislature Party elected Hiteswar Saikia as the leader of the party. The Governor of Assam asked him to form his government. After the swearing-in ceremony, Saikia refrained from performing the normally seen activity of going for allotting the chambers to his ministers. He made them meet together and apportioned duties to all the ministers for going to various troubled areas towards personally supervising relief operations assessing the situations thereat. Assam was having a political climate which appeared to be different from that of the heart land of India. Then Indira Gandhi observed that only hope lay in bringing the AASU leadership to the negotiating table. She felt that Saikia was the man who could fulfill the task at any cost. Saikia drew up a blue print of his own guidance and for his ministerial colleagues to take the necessary cue. The meaning of such a blue print: to control the law and order situation which had been on the fringe of anarchy, to contain the communal and ethnic violence, to provide immediate relief and succour to the victims of senseless violence, to manoeuvre the AASU leaders back to the negotiating table, and also to inspire confidence among the sections of people keeping themselves at a distance of the agitationists. The measure of Saikia's success in the matter may be obtained from the spontaneous words of appreciation in the speech of Prime Minister herself. Then, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi came forward to fulfill the half-finished work of his mother. Turning his attention to the problems relating to the Assam movement, he tried bringing the AASU leaders to the negotiating table. To make everything fruitful, Saikia tried at his best. Hence his steps and attitudes enabled Rajiv Gandhi to get the Assam Accord signed by the AASU at midnight on the eve of 15 August 1985. It drew the final curtain over the last scene of the long six years Assam movement. At that time it was detected in a medical check-up that, both his kidneys were damaged and he was advised to obtain a kidney transplantation. Finally, in the Brigham Women Hospital in the US, he got it done by the best expert in the field at that time on 25 June 1981. It was his youngest brother who donated one of his kidneys for the purpose. He returned home in October, 1981. After that he joined the Kesab Chandra Gogoi ministry in the early part of 1982. As the Kesab Chandra Gogoi ministry collapsed no sooner than had it been formed and he made all his promises to be done.The Swooping Sparrow by Dr. Mahendra Bora He allegedly orchestrated a number of \\"surrenders\\" of ULFA operatives.Surrenders seen as body blow to ULFA Indian Express - 15 August 1998 Governorship of Mizoram Attaining success in Assam by getting the Assam Accord signed, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi turned his attention to Mizoram which had similar problems to that of Assam both in dimension and in nature. Government of India had been tired of facing violence in that Union Territory as unleashed by Laldenga, the leader of the Mizo National Front (MNF) for quite a number of years. Encouraged by the signing of the Assam Accord, Rajiv Gandhi aimed to sign a similar Mizo Accord. Saikia was appointed the Lt. Governor of Mizoram. In the Indian setting, to ask an ex-Chief Minister becoming a Governor means going on retirement. But they were yet to know that Saikia took it to go on hibernation. He was to work in unison with two definite targets fixed by the Mizo Accord. First, he must bring peace to that troubled region. Second, he had to fulfill the dream of Mizo people to gain for their territory status of a full scale statehood. He did achieve both in no time. He renewed confidence on himself. Mizoram had a new leaf, no longer it was to remain with a frightening description for itself as the exotic land of mountain and militants. Saikia was the man who discovered the actual grievances of the Mizo's. Once the proper wavelength was found out the communication became easy and the solution too. When the Prime Minister himself came to Aizawl on 19 February and declared Statehood being granted to Mizoram, as token of which the Lt. Governor was elevated to the rank of the Governor. The whole of the Mizoram went in a great merriment. When a popular government was installed in Mizoram, Governor Saikia found sometime to move in both inside and outside of the state. At the meanwhile he received an invitation from the Principal of St. Edmund's College at Shillong on the occasion of Golden Jubilee celebration of the college. During the visit to the Don Bosco School at Shillong on 5 July 1987 Saikia took keen interest in vocational training classes. After the long stay at Mizoram, Saikia acquired a new virtue of his character. When his resigning letter was accepted, people of Mizoram bid him a hearty farewell.The Swooping Sparrow by Dr. Mahendra Bora Award and Recognition Saikia went on facing all the problems for the solution of which he had to depend on his own resources of intelligence during his Chief Ministership. All his labour brought forth certain recognition on the national level. In an editorial of the Times of India (15.7.83), Saikia was highly appreciated. There were many others who echoed the feeling about his achievements.The Swooping Sparrow by Dr. Mahendra Borathe Times of India dated 15.7.1983 Controversy regarding Manmohan Singh's residence in Saikia House Hiteswar was a close friend and associate of Dr Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister of India. In fact, Manmohan Singh became a Rajya Sabha MP from Assam quota by claiming that he was a resident of Assam by producing a house rent receipt from Saikia's wife Smt. Hemoprabha Saikia. According to an affidavit submitted by Manmohan Singh, the prime minister stays in Saikia's rented house at Sarumotoria by paying a monthly rent of Rupees 700. Manmohan Singh could become a Rajya Sabha member, and thereby a prime minister, chiefly by falsely claiming that he was a resident of Hiteswar Saikia's house in Guwahati. Death As his transplanted kidney is failing fast, his recurrent fever refused to go and he was finding more difficulty in breathing. Doctors insisted to take rest but Saikia refused and continuing on his post-political career until his untimely demise on 22 April 1996, at the age of 60 years.The Swooping Sparrow by Dr. Mahendra Bora On the day of his funeral, a Phuraluong Lue Dam worship rite of the Ahom religion was performed by Nagen Hazarika with other Mo'-Luongs or religious priests.

It is predominant where indigenous groups and among the black-Native American mestizo population, and in the Northeast coast, nearly all interior regions including Amazon regions, savannahs, rainforest, foothills, and Pantanal. According to Dr. Romulo R. N.

Among the plants include edible foods like the cashew, peppers, mangosteen and coconut, but often include inedible parts like the fruits, leaves, husk, bark. Neighboring nations like the Patamona of Guyana also use the cashew. There is growing interest in Brazilian medicine as the Amazon rainforest is the largest tropical forest in the world, and is home to immense biodiversity, including cures or treatments for many ailments.

In one study in 1997 published in The American Journal of Chinese Medicine, only 122 species existing in Brazil could be related to the Chinese species (or 14.35% of the samples)., which means the vast majority of species are not known to Chinese traditional medicine.

Early life Nethercott was born in Newmarket, England. Having attended Mark Hall Comprehensive School, Harlow, and The Broxbourne School in Hertfordshire, Acer was admitted to University College, Oxford to study Physics and Philosophy as an undergraduate. He subsequently earned a BPhil and then a DPhil degree in philosophy. The Boat Race Nethercott took up rowing at Oxford University as a first year student but quickly switched to coxing when it became evident that his body type was more suited to that than pulling an oar. He became a member of both Oxford University Boat Club and Oxford University Women's Boat Club. He earned his first Blue when he steered the Oxford women's heavyweight blue boat to victory against Cambridge in 2000. The Oxford crew won by 2 lengths, and completed the Henley Boat Race course in a time of 6 minutes and 18 seconds. Nethercott steered Isis to victory in 2002. A year later, he stepped up to the Blue Boat, steering Oxford in the closest Boat Race in recent memory. In a thrilling finish Oxford won the 4 mile race by just a foot in a time of 18 minutes and 6 seconds. The race was also notable for it being the first time in history two sets of brothers competed against each other. David Livingston (Oxford) raced against his older brother James, and a last minute call up for Ben Smith (who joined the Cambridge Blue Boat from Goldie hours before the race after the original crew member was injured) meant that he competed against his brother Matthew, the Oxford president. In 2004, Nethercott won his seat in the Blue Boat after a tense internal competition with Peter Hackworth, the 2002 winning Blue Boat cox who had taken a year out to study in Italy. In a controversial race, in which the two boats clashed blades and the Oxford bowman came off his seat, Oxford lost by 6 lengths in a time of 18 minutes and 17 seconds. Nethercott's final Boat Race was in 2005. Both universities had extremely strong intakes that year, with Cambridge boasting several world champions and the Oxford crew including Olympic silver medallist Barney Williams. Oxford won the epic contest by 2 lengths in a time of 16 minutes 42 seconds.

It was introduced in Europe in 1971, with A40 and A60 series subsequently appearing soon after their introductions in Japan. In 1984, the A60 series Carina was replaced in the European market by the \\"Carina II\\" - essentially a rebranding of the T150 series Toyota Corona launched the previous year in Japan, with some minor alterations to suit the European markets. This trend of Coronas rebadged as Carinas produced for the European market continued for two more generations, with the second Carina II in 1988 and the Carina E in 1992. First generation (T150) The T150 series was originally launched in January 1983 in Japan as the Toyota Corona, which brought front wheel drive to the model and also began the alignment of Corona, Carina and Celica platforms. The Carina II was introduced in the UK in April 1984 and other European markets in the same year. This generation was made available in sedan or liftback body styles only. It was essentially the same as the Japanese market Corona T150 with some minor cosmetic changes, namely the rear light clusters which were shortened in width to accommodate for larger European number plates. The T150 Carina introduced in Japan in May 1984, while on the same chassis, used completely different body panels featuring squarer, more aggressive styling. To further complicate matters there were also RWD models of both Carina and Corona available in the Japanese market. Two carburetted petrol engines (1.6 or 1.8) and one diesel option were available, although the 1.8 was only sold in certain markets. Equipment levels were DX and GL, although following a facelift in December 1985 these changed to XL and SX in some markets. The 1.6 was later offered with the option of a catalytic converter (4A-LC), dropping power to .Automobil Revue 1987, p. 544 In August 1985 the 2-litre 2S-E engine was added for select markets.

Compared to the Corona, front and rear light clusters, front grille and some trim are different, and the rear number plate recess was moved up from the bumper up to the boot lid. In the generation, beside sedan and liftback body styles, the wagon body style was also available. The car had three engine variants, the 4A and 3S-FE petrol engines, and a 2C diesel engine. Petrol versions were all twin-cam, sixteen-valve inline-four cylinders. It was well received in the United Kingdom as well as in Nordic countries. In Europe's largest national auto-market, the T170 sustained the Toyota's reputation for reliability. In 1995 it topped the family car class in a reliability survey of 4-6 year old cars undertaken by the German Automobile Association (ADAC), with 5.6 recorded breakdowns per 1,000 vehicles for four-year-old Carinas and 12.9 for six-year-old cars: this compared with 12.8 breakdowns per 1,000 cars for four-year-old Opel Vectras and 25.6 for six-year-old Vectras.

Plot An employee of a savings and loan company successfully robs a bank as an inside job. At first, bank employee Leon Poole (Wendell Corey) is considered a hero during the bank robbery, but the police quickly figure out he's involved in the crime. The cops catch up with Poole and his young wife at their apartment. Poole's wife is accidentally shot to death during a gunfight. Poole is arrested, convicted and sent to prison for the robbery. While behind bars, Poole plans his escape and revenge on the policeman who killed his wife, Lt. Sam Wagner (Joseph Cotten). Poole figures the best way to exact revenge is to kill Wagner's wife, Lila (Rhonda Fleming). Poole escapes while working on a prison honor farm, murdering a guard. He kills again to gain access to a truck. Managing to avoid a highway roadblock set up by the police, Poole heads for the home of his former army sergeant, Otto Flanders, holding his wife captive and then killing Flanders in cold blood. Wagner's wife is unaware that she is Poole's target. Wagner manages to get Lila safely out of town, but because she resents her husband's unwillingness to quit law enforcement, she decides to leave him for good. Lila then learns he was merely trying to protect her, so she heads back for their home, where Poole is waiting. Cast * Joseph Cotten as Det.

They had made The Magnificent Matador and \\"when we got through with that, all the producers said, \\"don't let these two guys make a picture together ever again; they're tough as Hell; they don't care about the money; they're going to break the studio.\\" I discovered that there was an eighteen-day picture called The Killer is Loose at Warner Brothers, so Lucien and I went there and we made it in fifteen days. And that put that rumor to rest. Joseph Cotten was the star a complete professional, always knew his lines.\\"Budd Boetticher: The Last Interview Wheeler, Winston Dixon. Film Criticism; Meadville Vol. 26, Iss. 3, (Spring 2002): 52-0_3. Critical reaction The New York Times film critic, Bosley Crowther, found nothing original about the film, calling the lead actors (Cotten and Corey) \\"first rate\\" and the crime film \\"third rate.\\"Crowther, Bosley. New York Times, film review March 3, 1956. Critic Bruce Eder gave a more favorable review and wrote, \\"Budd Boetticher was a filmmaker of consummate skill and many surprises, as anyone who's seen his best Western dramas can attest. The Killer Is Loose (1956) only enhances his reputation in a totally unrelated genre, and in a stylistic mode that's about as far as he could get from his most familiar work. Using a cast of conventional‚Äîalbeit top-flight‚ÄîHollywood professionals, Boetticher takes them out of the studio and puts them into an almost totally location-shot drama, and turns them loose in that naturalistic setting. The result is an array of performances that are as arresting as the script is filled with improbabilities; indeed, the narrative momentum of Boetticher's direction, coupled with a handful of excellent performances, overcomes a script that is just a little too heavy on coincidences to otherwise play true.\\". Critic Dennis Schwartz wrote, \\"A typical 1950s noir, distinguished by its rapid pace and taut script, that delves mainly into the character of the villain‚Äîmaking him out to be someone who went over-the-edge when he couldn't take being ridiculed as a failure, anymore...The suburban atmosphere and the no-nonsense style of telling the story add to the blandness of the story and the failure to elicit anything out of the ordinary to the build-up of the suspense that comes with the climax. The result is a watchable film which could be seen for the sense of nostalgia of the 1950s it evokes, a time when it was more receptive for noir to work as well as it does.\\"Schwartz, Dennis.

She was built during World War II as U.S. Army U.S. Army FS-278, and was acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1960 as miscellaneous auxiliary and was converted into a missile tracking ship. She continued her missile tracking until being placed out of service in 1972, at which time she was reclassified range tender YFRT-524, and eventually sold for scrap in 1974. However, she avoided the scrapyards and served as a fishing vessel until at least 2016. U.S. Army FS-278 was built for the Army in 1944 by the Wheeler Shipbuilding Corp., Whitestone, New York. FS-278 was a Coast Guard-crewed Army vessel commissioned at New York on 25 November 1944 departing New York on 17 December 1944, for the Southwest Pacific where she operated at Peleliu, Palawan, etc. during the war. Command transferred to LT A. W. Engle, USCGR on 25 June 1945. From 28 August until 20 September FS-278 transported General Douglas MacArthur's defense planning staff for the Philippine Islands. She was decommissioned 3 October 1945. U.S. Navy The ship was acquired by the Navy in April 1960; converted by Pacific Ship Repair, San Francisco, California; and placed in service with the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) as T-AG-161 on 22 June 1960, Capt. John Strom in command. Missile tracking activities Named Range Recoverer on 12 July, she reported to the Navy's Pacific Missile Range in August 1960. At the time Navy had command and control authority over nearly all Vandenberg Air Force Base launches and the range.From May 1958 until transfer of range facilities ordered 16 November 1963 and effective 1 July 1964 the Pacific Missile Range was under Navy. Range Recoverer transferred to the Atlantic before the range was transferred to Air Force and was never an Air Force Western Test Range ship. On 27 November she was reclassified a missile range instrumentation ship and designated T-AGM-2. She is equipped with telemetry, data processing and radio instruments as well as recovery facilities to retrieve nose cones. Manned by a Civil Service crew of the Military Sea Transportation Service, Range Recoverer served first as a telemetry and recovery ship on the Pacific Missile Range where she launched, tested, and evaluated the Regulus missile. In July 1962 Range Recoverer shifted to Little Creek, Virginia, to support the NASA facility at Wallops Island, Virginia. NASA technical party operators used on board equipment, including helix antennas, data recording systems and a communications suite with direction finders to locate and recover payloads. There she replaced two T-1 tankers, Dumont and Whitlock, damaged during a storm. Since that time, into 1970, Range Recoverer operated out of Little Creek primarily between Wallops Island and the splash down area near Bermuda.  Other services provided During the mid-sixties the ship traveled to Greece for coordinated research on a solar eclipse and was visited by the Greek royal family. NASA, assisting other government agencies, has also loaned Range Recoverer to the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, to conduct oceanographic surveys off the coast of Virginia. Final disposition Range Recoverer was placed out-of-service in 1972 and reclassified as range tender YFRT-524. She was struck from the Navy List (unknown date) and sold for scrap 1 November 1974. Despite being sold for scrap, Range Recoverer remained extant until at least 2016 as the Virginia- based fishing vessel Reedville.

It is the developer of the Stuart (Yarwun) and McFarlane oil shale projects. History Queensland Energy Resources Limited was formed in February 2004, when it acquired the assets of the Stuart Oil Shale Project from receivers of the project's former developer, Southern Pacific Petroleum N.L. On 21 July 2004, QER announced that the plant would be shut down for economic and environmental reasons. From 2005 to 2007, oil shale from its deposits were tested in a pilot plant facility in Rifle, Colorado owned by Shale Technologies. On 14 August 2008, Queensland Energy Resources announced that it had shunned the Alberta Taciuk Processor (ATP) oil shale processing technology in favor of the Paraho II technology and that the ATP technology-based plant was being dismantled, and obsolete components were being sold. On 24 August 2008, the Queensland Government announced an oil-shale mining moratorium over the company-owned McFarlane deposit for 20 years. On 10 May 2010, the company announced a plan for construction of a small-scale shale-oil demonstration plant at Yarwun (the site of the Stuart Oil Shale Project). The new plant produced its first oil on 6 October 2011, and began producing high quality ultra-low sulphur diesel and aviation fuel in September 2012. In February 2013, following a four-year industry review including a full environmental audit of QER's operations, the Queensland Government announced that it would allow the development of a commercial oil shale industry in Queensland under strict environmental conditions. The Government's oil shale policy sets vigorous environmental controls on the industry and allows existing oil shale operator, QER Ltd, to progress the demonstration plant at Gladstone to commercial stage. QER has now successfully completed the demonstration plant program, and is seeking investment in the next stage of its industry development, a commercial facility producing around 8,000 barrels per day of finished fuels. Operations Queensland Energy Resources holds mining tenement rights to several oil shale deposits in Queensland, Australia. Two major resources are Stuart, located at Yarwun, Queensland, and McFarlane, located near Proserpine. The McFarlane oil shale resource, one of Australia's largest, remains under a 20-year mining moratorium. QER operates a visitor's center at the Yarwun site and has completed a successful technology demonstration plant project based on the Paraho II Technology.

Founded in 1981 under the auspices of the Dalai Lama, The Tibet Fund is the primary funding organization for the health, education, refugee rehabilitation, cultural preservation and economic development programs that enable Tibetans in exile and in their homeland to sustain their language, culture and national identity. The work of The Tibet Fund is guided by the following priorities: * To support health care, education, refugee rehabilitation, religious and cultural preservation, community and economic development programs that enable Tibetans to thrive in today's world; * To help the Central Tibetan Administration to revitalize the Tibetan settlements in India, Nepal and Bhutan; * To ensure that Tibetan culture and identity remain a vibrant part of our global heritage; * To enable donors to connect with individual Tibetan children, monks, nuns and the elderly; * To raise awareness about the Tibetan people's achievements over the past 50 years. The story of The Tibet Fund is the story of the Tibetan people's perseverance and resourcefulness through decades of upheaval and exile. It is the story of survival and the preservation of culture and national identity. The organization works closely with the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) departments of Finance, Health, Education, Home, and Religion and Culture in Dharamsala, India to implement programs for the more than 120,000 refugees living in settlements and scattered communities in India, Nepal, and Bhutan. As Tibetans continue to escape from Tibet and join the exile community, the resources of the already overcrowded settlement system are being stretched to the limit. Employment opportunities in the settlements are scarce, forcing families to leave their homes for months at a time to seek alternative sources of income. Out of concern for the long-term sustainability of the exile community, The Tibet Fund is working to support programs that will strengthen the refugees‚Äô economic prospects and promote community cohesiveness. The Tibet Fund has administered a major annual grant from the US Department of State Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration for humanitarian aid since 1991 and a State Department-funded Tibetan Scholarship Program (TSP) since 1989. The TSP has enabled 380 Tibetan students to study in some of the best American universities and colleges and return to serve the exile community as officials in the CTA, and as educators, health workers, business leaders and heads of local community-based organizations. Both of these grant programs are having a significant impact on the refugees‚Äô ability to thrive and create a resettlement model that is heralded as an outstanding example for other populations facing long-term displacement from their homelands. In addition, with the support of many individuals and foundations, The Tibet Fund has funded numerous infrastructure and training projects ‚Äî housing, computer labs, solar energy, agriculture and irrigation, and sanitation ‚Äî over the years that have improved conditions and upgraded the technological resources and professional skills in the settlements and schools. In 1994, The Tibet Fund initiated the Tibet Assistance Program to address the unmet health, educational and economic development needs of Tibetans in Tibet. Working with international and Tibetan grassroots organizations, it supports orphanages, eye clinics and remote eye camps, provide emergency relief for natural disasters and promote cultural and educational programs that are greatly improving the quality of life of thousands of marginalized Tibetans. The Tibet Fund offers scholarships for college-bound Tibetan youth who lack the resources to pursue higher education in Tibet and it has administered an English language and professional training program in Tibet and the US with support from the US Department of State.

He was one of Larry Parnes' stable of pop music stars, who did not enjoy as successful a career as most of his contemporaries. Life and career Pride was born at 74 Parchmore Road, Thornton Heath, Surrey, now in Croydon. He attended John Newnham Secondary School in Addington before visiting the School of Church Music in Croydon, where a career as an opera singer was suggested. Later on Pride was a member of a skiffle group, the Semi-Tones. He had several poorly paid jobs. Russ Conway heard him performing at the Castle public house in Tooting, south London. Conway recommended him to Larry Parnes, who immediately signed him. Parnes gave him the stage name 'Dickie Pride'. At 16, he gave his first concert as Dickie Pride at the Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn, which was then the biggest cinema in the United Kingdom. The music magazine Record Mirror stated that \\"he ripped it up from the start\\" and that the theatre shook so much during his performance that he should be known \\"The sheik of shake\\". This was followed by tours, television and, in March 1959, his debut single, \\"Slippin' and Slidin'\\" (a cover of a song made famous by Little Richard). He also performed in 'The Big Beat Show' at Southend with Marty Wilde, Billy Fury, Terry Dene, Johnny Gentle, Duffy Power and Sally Kelly. However, the commercial performance of most of Pride's recordings was far below expectations. The only Pride single that ever made it into the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart, \\"Primrose Lane\\", appeared in October 1959 for only one week at No. 28. Television producer Jack Good had seen Pride sing in Southend. The first edition of Good's rock and roll TV show Wham!, shown on ABC-TV in April 1960, included Pride. Guitarist Albert Lee made his first professional stage appearance as an accompanist for Pride. Pride was very successful during live performances, but had difficulty transferring this success to his recordings. In 1961, Parnes attempted to reposition him as a mainstream singer, and he made an album of 'Tin Pan Alley' standards with Eric Jupp and his Orchestra, called Pride Without Prejudice. However, the record sold very poorly and Pride was subsequently dropped by Parnes. He later formed several other groups, including the Guvnors and the Sidewinders. In addition to mental health problems, Pride was under the influence of drugs, including heroin. In 1962 he married, and in 1965, his son was born. His musical career however started to decline. In 1967, he was submitted to a psychiatric clinic, where a lobotomy was performed. Pride was found dead in his bed on 26 March 1969. He died at the age of 27 by an overdose of sleeping pills. Fellow Parnes artists such as Billy Fury and Joe Brown stated that Pride had been the most talented singer on Parnes' roster. In 1999, Charles Langley wrote the stage play, Pride With Prejudice, about Pride's tragic life.

It connected the Mersey and Irwell Navigation to the River Mersey at Runcorn. History The canal was built to bypass the shallow stretches of the Mersey at Fiddlers Ferry. It extended for , ending to the east of Runcorn Gap close to the centre of the township of Runcorn, and cost ¬£48,000. At Latchford, it joined the Mersey at a lock which was located above Howley Weir. At its terminus a dock was built which became part of the Port of Runcorn. The canal was built under powers embodied in the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Act (1720) which permitted new cuts to be made without the necessity of further recourse to Parliament. It opened in July 1804. The canal and the Mersey and Irwell Navigation were bought out by the Bridgewater Canal Company in 1844. The new owners invested little in the canal and its condition gradually grew worse. They in turn were bought out by the Manchester Ship Canal Company in the 1890s, who particularly wanted ownership of the Runcorn to Latchford Canal, as the ship canal would use the same course for part of its route. Much of the western end of the canal, including the docks at Runcorn, disappeared when the much larger ship canal was built. The eastern end fared rather better, as the section between Twenty Steps Bridge and Latchford Lock was retained. A new lock, called Twenty Steps Lock, was built where the old canal left the course of the ship canal, and it was used to supply tanneries at Howley with hides which were imported from Argentina, and this trade continued until the 1960s. This section was called the Black Bear Canal, and it ceased to be used after the tanneries closed. The canal as built had a locks at both ends, both of which dropped into the river. As it had no natural water supply, and water was lost every time a boat passed through a lock, a feeder was built from just above Paddington Lock on the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. The water was then carried across the Mersey in an aqueduct, which also acted as a footbridge, and followed the banks of the Mersey to arrive at Latchford Lock. It emptied into the canal just to the south of the lock. When the Black Bear Canal section was created, Twenty Steps Lock also rose from the ship canal, and so the feature was retained. Latchford Lock was usually known as Manor Lock after the construction of the ship canal, as the locks immediately above its junction with the Black Bear Canal were called Latchford Locks.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 maps, 1893 and 1937 In 2015 the Runcorn Locks Restoration Society launched its Unlock Runcorn campaign, which is dedicated to reopening the flight of locks in Runcorn's Old Town. The society believes that the increase in passing boat trade that would come from reopening the locks has the potential to bring economical, recreational and social benefits to people within the region. Route The route diagram shows the canal as it was in the 1880s, with some later additions, including the points at which the route of the Manchester Ship Canal destroyed the canal, and features such as Twenty Steps Lock, which was built to connect a section of the original canal to the ship canal.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 maps, 1881, 1907 and modern A section of the canal in Wigg Island Park is still in water. Traces of the canal still exist in Wigg Island and in Moore Nature Reserve. The route of the canal forms the basis of the designated \\"Linear Park\\" that runs parallel to the river Mersey at Lower Walton and is clearly visible looking west from Chester Road (A5060) whilst standing on the road bridge over the River Mersey. In the distance is the \\"Twelve Arches Bridge\\" where arch number 3 (counted south to north) passes over where the canal would have passed. The largely dried out canal basin can be traced westwards after the bridge towards Moore Nature Reserve and then Runcorn. The canal passes east under the A5060 where it joins the Manchester Ship Canal at Latchford Locks (site of the proposed Port of Warrington). Thereafter it re-emerges in Stockton Heath just past the London Road Swing Bridge (A49) where it runs north-easterly passing under Loushers Lane Bridge until eventually passing under Knutsford Road at the site of the former Black Bear Public House. The course of the canal runs a short distance then to terminate and re-join the River Mersey close to Kingsway North Bridge. The Wigg Island nature reserve covers and was opened in April 2002. It is named after the Wigg Chemical Works, set up in the 1860s to extract copper from ore. The works were used to produce mustard gas in the Second World War, and closed in the 1960s. While the canal was operational, a regular problem was the leaching of highly acidic effluent into the canal. Remediation work to reclaim the brownfield site has included the construction of a filter system which passes the water through a limestone-filled channel. This ensures that the water in the length of canal which crosses the site is safe and suitable for wildlife.

They were years of growing political and social unrest during which Dutch rule became increasingly oppressive. Early life He was one of eight siblings, five girls and three boys. His father was a school inspector in the Dutch administration. Among friends and colleagues, he was known as Buyung, thus his Dutch colleagues referred to him as Mijnheer Bij,-Mr.B. Bij was Indonesianised to Bey, and adopted as the family name of his children. Arifin was highly intelligent, and qualified for entry into the Dutch educational stream. It was said of him that he was never without a book. He kept up with world events, and assembled files of newspaper clippings. He was politically engaged, and a member of the Young Sumatra Association. At the age of 16, his public speaking activities had him investigated by the police, his father interrogated, their home searched, and his newspaper clippings confiscated. The headmaster of the Dutch school he attended recognised his ability saved him from any further escalation of punishment, and arranged for him to continue teacher-training studies in Bandung. The Japanese Occupation in 1942 interrupted his formal education. But he studied privately, despite the chaos, and began the study of Japanese that was to become the foundation of his future career. He was selected by the Japanese to study in Japan as a potential leader in Indonesia when the war was won. Ironically, Tokyo was thought to be too dangerous for his cohort of Indonesian and other students from Southeast Asia, and they were sent to study at the Hiroshima University of Arts and Sciences. Hiroshima up to that time had not been heavily bombed. He went to Japan as a scholarship student during the Pacific War, when Indonesia was under Japanese occupation, and found himself in Hiroshima in 1945, when the city was hit by an atomic bomb. Of the five hundred students in the university lecture theatre when the bomb exploded, only he and a Thai student survived. Physically he was not severely injured, but later developed radiation sickness. He remained in Japan for some time, and by chance at a railway station, saw a Japanese woman hassled by some American soldiers. He extricated her from the melee, to her great relief. His Japanese by then was so fluent that at first she thought he was Japanese. Discovering he was an Indonesian, she took him home to meet her parents and siblings. Two of her brothers were doctors, and recognising he was suffering from radiation sickness, arranged hospital treatment for him. The family virtually adopted him, and shared in caring for him, this twenty-year- old, far from home. Later he was to marry the Japanese woman he had helped. It was a long and happy marriage, until she died of cancer. His knowledge of English, gained at the Dutch school, his mastery of Japanese, and his outstanding general ability and social skills led him to the Department of Foreign Affairs when he returned to Indonesia. He was sent to America, and in 1954 was the first Indonesia to serve in a staff appointment at the United Nations in New York City. He continued to study, gaining a Bachelor‚Äôs and then a master's degree at a New York University. He returned to Indonesia, and after serving for two years as assistant to the Director of the Indonesian Institute of the Sciences, was sponsored by the Ford Foundation for a Ph.D at Georgetown University. In 1961, he completed his studies at Georgetown University, earning a Ph.D. in international political science through a dissertation on dialogue in search of consensus in the Indonesian political process. Activities On returning to Indonesia he was appointed editor of the semi-official English language daily, Indonesian Herald.P.C. Boer, The Loss of Java: The Final Battles for the Possession of Java Fought by Allied Air, Naval and Land Forces in the Period of 18 February - 7 March 1942, NUS Press, Singapore He was the editor from 1961 to 1967. During the years of Guided Democracy amid the increasing tensions leading to the attempted coup in 1965, it was an exposed position. Skilful ideological navigation was necessary to avoid disaster. He survived, though later it was rumoured he had compromised his integrity. He was assigned as a councillor to the Indonesian Embassy in Tokyo in 1967. This presented a new challenge. He had then been away from Japan for 17 years, but it was a position for which he was uniquely qualified by his knowledge of Japanese, his personal experience of a cataclysmic event in Japanese history, his work in the United Nations, his academic achievements, and his work in journalism. It was the gateway to a field that he would make his own. He realised that the only way into the world of Japanese thinking and acting was through the Japanese language, and he devoted himself to deepening his knowledge of it. None of the other members of the Indonesian Embassy staff at that time knew Japanese well, and so for knowledge of Japanese affairs were dependent on information filtered through English language press. This was inadequate, so he prepared every morning a digest of Japanese news from the Japanese media for distribution to his colleagues. He founded an Association of Japanese speaking diplomats. It met for lunch monthly, invited Japanese guests to give lectures in Japanese, and for the length of the meeting, only Japanese was spoken. The speakers included opinion leaders, but not all was high seriousness. One was a clairvoyant was responsibility was to advise business executives on what business deals to enter and what to avoid, and what names to give to products, even cars, so that they would sell. A highlight in this period was acting as interpreter for President Suharto on his state visit to Japan in 1968 when he addressed the Foreign Correspondents Club. This experience, the knowledge, competence and confidence he gained in speaking and writing Japanese, and his people skills, were to wean him from the world of diplomacy into that of academe. He was invited to give radio talks and appear on television programs, thanks to which he became widely known as Bey San. He received invitations to give seminars, and to teach at the Area Studies Program at Tsukuba University, where he was required to lecture in both Japanese and English. In doing so, he had a key role in developing Southeast Asian Studies in Japan as a Southeast Asian fluent in Japanese. He returned to Jakarta in 1970. But despite the quality of his work in Japan, rumours that he had sailed too close to the wind in his editorship of the Indonesian Herald persisted. Gestapu-ism at that time hung in the air much as Macarthy-ism in America a decade earlier. Thus it was felt expedient to loan him to the think tank Research Documentation and Analysis (REDA) an Indonesian military-supported research organization, to report from Tokyo. The Director, Zulkifli Lubis, who had in fact been imprisoned by Sukarno, decided to appoint a resident correspondent in Tokyo, and chose Arifin. The then Foreign Minister Adam Malik granted him ‚Äòextended leave without pay‚Äô, and he left again for Japan. A new stage in his life had begun. He was on the road to a new career. And it was now that the key words in the title of his Ph.D. thesis for Georgetown, Dialogue and Consensus, concepts which had had so central a place in his mind and thinking, began to bear fruit. In addition to his work as ‚ÄòForeign Correspondent‚Äô he was in demand at Japanese Universities. Between 1972 ‚Äì 74, he served as a Visiting Lecturer at Sophia University and the International Christian University, teaching courses on Western Political Thought and Intercultural Communication respectively. In 1976 he was appointed as Visiting Professor at Tsukuba University, a position which he held until 1984. The Iranian Islamic revolution in 1979, transformed his position and his role. The Japanese were flabbergasted, but did not take too seriously the statement attributed to Kissinger, that the evolution would only last six weeks. Arifin was at the time one of the very few scholars of Islamic faith in Japan who could lecture on Islam as a religion and culture in Japanese. And he was inundated with invitations to write articles or give talks on Islam. Alongside his courses on Modern Japanese Politics Domestic and International, he developed introductory courses on Islam, and on the Religions and Cultures of Southeast Asia. In 1984 he received a commendation from the Japanese Ministry for Foreign Affairs for ‚ÄòMeritorious Services in Culture and Information‚Äô. In the same year he resigned from Tsukuba University in 1984, planning to use his unique knowledge and experience of Japan to develop Japanese Studies at tertiary institutions in Indonesia. First he spent a year the Bung Hatta University in Padang. While there, the Japanese Ambassador came to Padang to confer on him the Japanese Foreign Ministry‚Äôs award ‚Äòfor distinguished service in the field of public information and cultural understanding‚Äô. In 1985 he moved to the Universitas Nasional Jakarta, to found The Japan Research Centre, which he directed until 1987. But somehow things do not work out as hoped. Japan called again, and he was appointed Visiting Professor at Kanda University of International Studies in Chiba, where he taught until 1995. In 1991, he was presented the Japanese Imperial Medal of The Order of Sacred Treasure, Gold Rays and Neck Ribbon. This was an award from the Emperor, rarely awarded to foreigners. Part of the citation is as follows: ‚Ä¶ during your more than twenty years‚Äô stay in Japan, you have shown a deep understanding of this country and its people ‚Ä¶As an international political scientist who understands our culture and our way of thinking, you are uniquely positioned among Indonesian intellectuals. ‚Ä¶You have served as a kind of moral compass for Japanese diplomacy towards Asia, and for Japanese comprehension of fellow Asian peoples. You have contributed to the promotion of mutual understanding between Japan and Indonesia and to the spread of international political studies in Japan. At the age of 70, in 1995, he decided to return home, to Indonesia. But by way of a detour was appointed for a three-year term to a position as Visiting Professor at the University of Malaya, teaching the History of Japanese Thought and the Making of Modern Japan. Only in 1998 did he make his home again in Jakarta. There he devoted his energies to a different level of the educational spectrum. With his daughter Mulyati Bey, he established an Islamic kindergarten, Taman Kanak- Kanak Islam Arif Mulya in the Jakarta suburb of Bukit Modern. It is an institution that is highly regarded, and continues to thrive. In the year 2000, on his 75th birthday, he added the final touch to his career by performing the Hajj with his daughter. He wrote widely and copiously, although most of his publications are in Japanese. He did however in 2002 publish a book of collected essays, Beyond Civilizational Dialogue, in part autobiographical, part reflective on global issues of politics and culture, in part on the role of Islam in society. The late Professor Nurcholish Madjid wrote a preface. It has many vivid anecdotes. One is of the pains of studying Japanese; another is of Hatta being offered pork at New York state luncheon; yet another is of the American Visiting American Professor in 1955 who urged him to write a Ph.D thesis on the side Indonesia should take in the Cold War. He replied that the ideologies of Democracy and Communism were not his concern. He was more concerned with issues of personal and national identity. The Professor replied, ‚ÄòThe whole American mission is to implant democracy in the four corners of the world. Even if you do not want it, we will push it down your throat for your own good‚Äô. But Arifin, in his father‚Äôs foot-steps stood by his convictions. He wrote on Dialogue and Consensus. Back in Indonesia, he remained active, administering the Kindergarten, lecturing, writing, reading widely, and above all fulfilling with love and care all his responsibilities as head of his large extended family, whether in Jakarta or Padang. He was the very model of a Minangkabau Mamak. He did not forget his family in Australia, nor they him, and they were represented at his eightieth birthday five years ago. He was a person of total dedication: to his Islamic Faith, to his ideals as an educationalist in the widest sense of the word, and to the family that was always a central part of his life.

Mutants are genetically-flawed, physically deformed people who are the subject of prejudice and apartheid in the 22nd century. Although they have appeared in Judge Dredd since the strip's earliest stories in 1977,2000 AD #4: \\"The Brotherhood Of Darkness\\" and #22: \\"Mr Buzzz\\" a major story arc beginning with \\"Mutants in Mega-City One\\" in June 2007 and ending with \\"Tour of Duty\\" in July 2010 dealt specifically with their struggle against apartheid in Dredd's city, Mega-City One. Background Mutants are de novo mutations created by radiation or radioactive contamination following the Atomic Wars in 2070. Their genetic mutations (which are inherited by their children) cause them to exhibit bizarre physical deformities. They first appeared in 2000 AD #4 (1977), described as raiders from outside the city, in the \\"wilderness from the Atomic Wars.\\" Another early issue revealed that mutants have been banned from the city, on grounds that \\"[they] hate ordinary people because they themselves are warped\\".2000 AD #22 However \\"The Cursed Earth\\" (1978)2000 AD #61‚Äì85 explained that mutants were actually the victims of irrational prejudice by those fortunate enough to be unaffected by the disaster ‚Äî normal people, or \\"norms.\\" As a result, all mutants were deprived of citizenship and expelled from Mega-City One, Judge Dredd's city on the east coast of America, and forced to live in the radioactive wasteland outside the city, the inhospitable and lawless Cursed Earth. There they remained for sixty years. Due to the ban on citizenship, mutants were prohibited from entering the city, and those who attempted to enter by scaling the city walls would be arrested and expelled, or killed resisting arrest. They would usually feature in stories simply as hostile criminals for Dredd to fight, but some stories set in the Cursed Earth would also show them in a more sympathetic light, as victims of unjust oppression by future society (or sometimes more directly as victims of crime). Initially mutants were mainly used in fight sequences in action stories, but as the years went by, and the tone of Judge Dredd stories matured to appeal to a wider audience, stories featuring mutants increasingly emphasized the injustice of their plight, and the harsh, uncompromising enforcement of the anti-mutant laws by Judge Dredd and the Mega-City Justice Department (for example \\"The Gipper's Big Night,\\" (1991)).Megazine vol. 1 #10 As time went on, the Mutant Segregation Act (named in prog 603) was shown to cover people who had contracted a gene-altering virus,2000 AD #603: \\"Curse of the Spider-Woman\\" part 1 dwarfs,Judge Dredd Annual 1987: \\"Judge Dredd and the Seven Dwarves\\" and people who had even the slightest genetic abnormality, if they were screened by someone in a bad mood.2000 AD #1542‚Äì1545: \\"Mutants in Mega-City One\\" Psychics were exempt as they were forcibly drafted in Justice Department's Psi-Division. Under Mega-City law, any norm who harboured a mutant was himself guilty of a crime and liable to strict penalties. Since a normal woman could still give birth to a mutant child, the parents of mutated offspring would sometimes go to great lengths to conceal the birth (or, at least, its abnormality) and raise their child in secret.2000 AD #485‚Äì488; Megazine vol. 3 #70: \\"Atlantis\\" and \\"Ten Years\\" Detection of a mutant foetus in a routine pregnancy scan would result in mandatory abortion;Megazine vol. 1 #5: \\"America\\" detection of a mutant birth would result in the parents being forced to choose between exile to the Cursed Earth, the \\"euthanasia\\" of the child, or the mutant being deported to Cursed Earth farming camps.2000 AD #1542-3: \\"Mutants in Mega-City One\\" The other mega-cities of Earth are assumed to treat mutants in the same way, though they are rarely mentioned. In the first appearance of Texas City, however, the city was shown enacting \\"mutant clearances,\\" indicating that mutants had been allowed to be citizens until 2102. A Texan judge said the reason for this was simply \\"Texas City will walk tall again without them uglies!\\" Unlike Mega-City One, they were specifically sent at gunpoint to \\"new homelands across Lake Louisiana\\". However, mutants could have permits to work in legal \\"danger parks\\" where they were exploited for the purposes of entertainment.2000 AD #160-161: \\"The Judge Child\\" Judge Dredd himself was prepared to treat mutants decently when he met them in the Cursed Earth, so long as they behaved themselves. In early issues Dredd believed mutants were inherently hostile to norms 2000 AD #22 but would rather avoid conflict in the Cursed Earth, feeling that \\"those crazy devils\\" \\"deserve pity... not vengeance\\".2000 AD #65, first and last pages He came to realise mutants weren't all \\"crazy and evil\\" early into The Cursed Earth.2000 AD #66 If able, Dredd would provide aid to any Cursed Earth mutant that called on the law for aid. However, any who entered his city were automatically criminals, and had to be dealt with accordingly and without compassion. In 2006, early episodes of the story \\"Origins\\" (2006‚Äì07) introduced Randy Fargo and his family, mutants who are distant cousins of Judge Dredd.2000 AD #1505‚Äì1519 and 1529‚Äì1535 (2006-07) Dredd was unaware of their existence until he met them in the Cursed Earth in 2129. After the Fargos helped Dredd in his mission, they parted on amicable terms. However they would soon return to the Judge Dredd strip in 2007. \\"Origins\\" heralded a turning-point in the treatment of mutants by writer John Wagner, and indeed by the character Dredd as well. Instead of making brief appearances in the strip to emphasize the science fictional setting, mutants became the focus of a new storyline which explored Dredd's shifting attitude towards the issue of mutant rights, which began in 2007 with \\"Mutants in Mega-City One.\\" \\"Mutants in Mega-City One\\" In \\"Mutants in Mega-City One\\" (2007),2000 AD #1542‚Äì45 Judge Dredd concludes that the anti- mutant laws are unjust and should be repealed, having given serious thought to the issue for the first time in his life as a result of meeting his mutant relatives. He persuades Chief Judge Hershey to put his motion to a vote before Mega-City One's ruling body, the Council of Five. While the vote is pending, however, Dredd is still obliged to enforce the very laws he seeks to repeal. When a normal couple discover that their newborn baby is a mutant, they abscond rather than face the Mutant Catchers, who will force them into exile in the Cursed Earth desert. They find refuge with other mutants in a safehouse run by sympathisers, where they hope to live in secret. However Dredd is searching for them, as absconding with a mutant child carries a mandatory sentence of three years. In the course of his investigation, Dredd (and through Dredd, the reader) learns from another citizen about some of the terrible consequences of the city's prejudice against mutants. When the citizen's family was discovered to have been hiding his mutant younger brother for twelve years, the whole family was incarcerated for their crime, while the child was deported from the city to a mutant internment camp in the Cursed Earth. Unable to cope, the child died, and his body was fed to the pigs, mutants not being considered worthy of a decent burial. This is the first mention in Judge Dredd of mutant camps for city-born mutants, which would later be stated to be compulsory until the mutant became 16 ‚Äì after that, they are supposedly free to leave if they choose.2000 AD #1546 Dredd eventually discovers the safehouse where the couple he seeks is hiding, and arrests everyone present. The normal citizens are imprisoned, and all of the mutants are deported to a mutant camp in the Cursed Earth. Meanwhile, the Council of Five unanimously votes against reforming the law. As a result, when Randy Fargo and some of Dredd's other mutant relations arrive at the city gate to visit him, Dredd is compelled to deny them entry to the city, and they are forced to turn back. \\"Mutants in Mega-City One\\" was immediately followed by \\"The Facility\\" and \\"The Secret of Mutant Camp 5,\\"2000 AD #1546 and 1547‚Äì48 in which Dredd tours Mega-City One's mutant camps in the Cursed Earth, and discovers that standards of care in the camps have sunk to a shockingly low level. His investigations uncover criminal neglect and appalling abuses, including starvation, torture and outright murder. Alarmed by Dredd's discoveries, Chief Judge Hershey becomes slightly more sympathetic to Dredd's new views, and orders an improvement in standards at the camps. Nevertheless, no change of general policy is forthcoming. The above stories contained obvious references to Guantanamo Bay detention camp and to the Nazi extermination camps. (They were also the first stories after the end of the \\"America\\" trilogy to feature Cadet America Beeny.) In \\"The Spirit of Christmas,\\"2000 AD #2008 Dredd again confronts the Chief Judge and demands a second vote on repealing the mutant laws, threatening to resign if she does not support him. As Dredd is the city's most famous and feared judge, Hershey bows to this threat and agrees to schedule another vote, hoping that enough senior judges can be persuaded to change their minds. Although \\"Emphatically Evil\\" (2008)2000 AD #1569‚Äì75 was primarily a story about serial killer PJ Maybe (and Beeny's first case following her promotion to full judge), the mutants story continued as a subplot. Public opinion is radically against Dredd's proposed reforms, with polls showing that 96 percent of the city opposes relaxing strict controls on mutants. While anti-reform protests erupt into riots on the streets, the Council convenes to debate Dredd's motion. Although Dredd is absent from the meeting, not being a member of the Council, he has earlier met with the members to try to change their minds, saying \\"I believe in justice, and an injustice has to be righted, no matter how inconvenient.\\"2000 AD #1572 However it is not Dredd's logic but his threat to resign which ultimately carries the vote in his favour. Following the vote, the story \\"...Regrets\\"2000 AD #1577‚Äì81 depicts Randy Fargo's return to Mega- City One with his family, this time invited by the Judges as guests of honour. As relatives of Chief Judge Fargo (the founder of the Judge System and Dredd's clone father), their tour of the city attracts much media attention, and controversy. Although the Mayor of Mega-City One gives them all honorary citizenship, feelings are still running high amongst the population, and talk shows are full of heated debate about the merits of Dredd's law. Public opinion becomes slightly more favourable after Jubal Fargo gives his life to rescue a four-year-old child from kidnappers, and the Fargos return to their home in the Cursed Earth. However mutants' rights still continue to arouse strong passions. \\"Mutie Block\\"2000 AD #1600‚Äì03 reveals that mutants are being admitted to the city following strict selection processes, and being given segregated accommodation in Norma Jean Baker Block. Anti-mutant protests are still continuing, and mutants are targeted for violent hate crimes, the murder rate for mutants being 3,600 percent above average. Official government policy is to actively discourage mutants from entering the city by giving them demotivational speeches on their arrival and offering cash bribes in exchange for relinquishing their claims to citizenship. In \\"Backlash\\" (2009)2000 AD #1628‚Äì33 senior, hardline judges begin a campaign to elect a new chief judge who will repeal the new pro-mutant laws. Their chosen candidate, Judge Dan Francisco, survives an assassination attempt by mutants. In spite of Dredd's discovery that the assassination was secretly orchestrated by anti-mutant activists in order to increase support for their cause, Francisco still defeats Hershey by a landslide. \\"Under New Management\\"2000 AD #1649 shows Francisco's first day in office as the new chief judge. He replaces the entire Council of Five, prohibits mutant immigration, and institutes a policy of exiling the mutants already in the city to new townships in the Cursed Earth, unless they agree to compulsory sterilisation. The new deputy chief judge, Judge Sinfield, assigns Dredd to oversee the operation, with Beeny as his assistant. This story acts as a prologue to \\"Tour of Duty,\\" which started in the next issue. \\"Tour of Duty\\" \\"Tour of Duty\\" (2009‚Äì10)2000 AD #1650‚Äì1693 and #2010 was the longest Judge Dredd story ever published up to that point, running for 46 episodes and 285 pages. It tells of Dredd and Beeny's mission in the Cursed Earth, overseeing the resettlement of mutants exiled from the city. Dredd's assignment effectively amounts to exile from the city, to keep him out of the way while Francisco and Sinfield implement their policy of mutant segregation. Similarly, Hershey has been posted to a position on another planet. Although Chief Judge Francisco favours exiling the mutants to the Cursed Earth, he nevertheless insists on doing so with some concern for their welfare, authorising increased expenditure on building the Cursed Earth townships, which initially were expected to be cheap shanty-towns. In this respect he is opposed by his Council, who are dismayed at what they see as his wasteful spending of the city's limited budget. Eventually, Deputy Chief Judge Sinfield resorts to illegally drugging Francisco with a mind control drug and persuading him to resign, thereby becoming acting chief judge.2000 AD #1666‚Äì67, 1674 and 1677 Sinfield immediately begins a crackdown on mutants, introducing automatic loss of citizenship and exile from the city for all mutants convicted of any crime, however trivial.2000 AD #1674 The mutant population diminishes from two million to 170,000.2000 AD #1691 Under Sinfield's rule, criminal organisations exploit the newly vulnerable mutants: they are used for slave labour in exchange for having faked citizenship papers, but whenever they work their debts off, the judges are tipped off about them. A new line in \\"vi-zines\\" (magazines featuring real torture) is created for mutants, helped by Justice Department being uninterested in crimes against mutants. Back in the Cursed Earth, suicide rates go up among the mutants who had to return home. However, for a brief time it is legal for mutants to work in pornography ‚Äì helped by a mutant performer winning Mega- City One the gold medal at the World Sex Championships. Sinfield bans mutant pornography, solely due to his own distaste for it.Judge Dredd Megazine #292 and 294 Exasperated with Sinfield, Dredd eventually decides to run against him in another election. However, in order to attract enough support to mount a serious challenge, Dredd is forced to compromise his mutant rights stance. Instead of promising a return to Chief Judge Hershey's policies, Dredd has to settle for returning to Francisco's.2000 AD #1690 However, before the election can take place, Sinfield's crime is uncovered and he is arrested. Francisco returns to office and appoints Dredd to the Council of Five.2000 AD #1693 Mutant townships Due to the events in \\"Tour of Duty\\", many mutants now live in one of four townships in the Cursed Earth. These are policed by only a few judges: the bulk of policing is done by mutant deputies, who have limited police powers. Thanks to Francisco's actions, the townships ended up being better places to live in than Mega-City One. They were less crowded, less crime-ridden, and having a few more civil rights, such as jury trials unless a judge passes an instant sentence. (Initially, the juries were meant as a short-term measure to reduce pressure on the scant judge numbers.) This has caused anger in some parts of the city, disgruntled that the mutants are getting a better life than 'normal' people; some elements in Justice Department also feel that the townships are allowed to be too liberal.Megazine #312-313 After the near-destruction of the city in Day of Chaos, the townships voted to send aid: forty thousand mutant volunteers, commanded by Judge Rico.2000 AD 1789 Bibliography This is a list of the stories which make up the 2007‚Äì2010 storyline following \\"Origins\\".

Its inhabitants were known as Camerini.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, vol. I, p. 489 (\\"Cameria or Camerium\\"). History Cameria was one of the most ancient cities of Latium, having been established as a colony of Alba Longa, long before the founding of Rome. Diodorus Siculus attributes its foundation to Latinus Silvius, one of the Alban kings.Diodorus, vii. ap. Euseb. Arm., p. 185.Aurelius Victor, De Origo Gentis Romanae, 17. It was numbered among the Prisci Latini, the old Latin towns whose inhabitants were regarded as aborigines; that is, those who had lived there ab origine, \\"from the beginning\\".Dionysius, ii. 50.Livy, i. 38. It is uncertain whether its name is connected with that of Camers, the name of two mythological personages alluded to by Virgil.Virgil, Aeneid, x. 562, xii. 224 ff. The location of Cameria is no longer known with certainty, but the most likely candidate for its modern location is the town of Palombara Sabina, built on a hill near the foot of Monte Gennaro. Conquest by Romulus Dionysius of Halicarnassus relates that in the early years of the Roman Kingdom, the Camerini came into conflict with the Romans led by Romulus, the legendary founder and first King of Rome, and Titus Tatius, the leader of the Sabine population at Rome, who ruled alongside Romulus for five years. According to Dionysius, the expedition against the Camerini was the only military venture undertaken by the two kings during what was otherwise a peaceful period in Rome's early history. Roman territory was regularly raided by parties from Cameria, and the city ignored repeated Roman demands to stop the \\"robbers\\", or otherwise redress the injury done to Roman property. Romulus and Tatius marched on Cameria, defeating the Camerini in a pitched battle, and then laying siege to the town, which they took by storm. The Camerini were disarmed, and a third of their territory was seized by Rome and allocated to its people, who began to settle in the former Camerian territory. The Camerini then began harassing the Roman settlers, hoping to drive them from the captured land. Romulus and Tatius marched against the Camerini a second time, quickly scattering their men, and seizing the town's remaining territory. A Roman colony was sent to Cameria, but about four thousand Camerini were invited to settle at Rome, where they were divided among the thirty curiae. Dionysius does not indicate whether or how many of the Camerini were permitted to remain in their ancestral home. Later history According to Livy, Cameria was one of the Prisci Latini taken by Tarquin the Elder, the fifth King of Rome, during his final campaign, along with Corniculum, Ficulea, Crustumerium, Ameriola, Medullia, and Nomentum. Dionysius relates that Cameria submitted to Tarquin after receiving favourable terms, indicating that the city had regained its independence since its earlier conquest.Dionysius, iii. 51. Following the expulsion of Tarquin the Proud, the seventh and last Roman King, in 509 BC, Cameria was one of the towns which rallied to the banners of Octavius Mamilius, the dictator of Tusculum, and Tarquin's son-in-law. Mamilius led a coalition of Latin cities in an attempt to restore Tarquin to the throne, in concert with the Etruscan king Lars Porsena of Clusium. Mamilius marched to Porsena's aid at the head of an army composed of Tusculans, Camerini, and Antemnates, but his forces were prevented from entering the city following the destruction of the Sublician Bridge, and instead ravaged the Roman countryside.Dionysius, v. 21‚Äì26. In 504 BC, Cameria was one of two Latin cities, together with Fidenae, which joined the Sabines in making war upon Rome. The Sabines and their allies were defeated, and Fidenae taken by storm, but the Sabines and Camerini resumed hostilities the following year.Dionysius, v. 40‚Äì44. In 502, the consul Opiter Verginius Tricostus undertook the war with Cameria, marching his forces to the city under cover of darkness, and mounting a surprise attack at dawn. Thrown into confusion, the Camerini could not resolve upon resistance or capitulation, and the city was swiftly taken. Verginius allowed the plunder of the city, executed the leaders responsible for undertaking war against Rome, razed the city, and sold the survivors into slavery.Dionysius, v. 49. The last mention of Cameria in Roman history occurs in 501, when a group of Camerian exiles, together with exiles from Fidenae, joined Octavius Mamilius in urging the Latin League to make war upon Rome.Dionysius, v. 51. Dionysius does not mention Cameria among the cities of the Latin League that joined with Mamilius and Tarquin in 498.Dionysius, v. 61. Pliny the Elder includes Cameria in a list of Latin cities that no longer existed by the first century.Pliny the Elder, iii. 5. s. 9. Legacy The surname Camerinus was borne by the oldest family of the Sulpicia gens, one of the most illustrious patrician families of ancient Rome, and probably indicated that the Sulpicii originated at Cameria. Members of this family frequently held the highest offices of the Roman state from the earliest years of the Republic until the second century AD, and the name occurs to the end of Roman history.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 590 (\\"Camerinus\\"), vol. III, p. 945 (\\"Sulpicia Gens\\"). Tacitus reports that the Coruncanii were also from Cameria.Tacitus, Annales, xi. 24.

It stars Steven Eckholdt as Danny, a fourteen-year-old boy who is infatuated with his teacher Peggy Noble (Daphne Ashbrook). Danny uses a \\"growth accelerator\\" to make himself appear older than his actual age in an attempt to seduce her. A similar age swap and nearly identical title appears in the 2004 film 13 Going on 30, and the earlier film may have influenced the latter. The TV film was directed by Paul Schneider. Plot 14-year-old Danny O'Neil (Gabey Olds) is madly in love with his teacher, Miss Peggy Noble (Daphne Ashbrook). Given the fact that she is engaged to the cold-tempered and vicious gym teacher, Roy Kelton (Rick Rossovich), who is nicknamed Jackjaw for his constant threat of breaking his pupils' jaws, Danny goes through his school days somewhat uninspired and suffers in silence. One day, he oversees his geeky friend Lloyd Duffy (Adam Carl), an orphan who happens to live next door with his uncaring uncle Herb (Harry Morgan) and ditsy aunt May (Irene Tedrow), growing fruits with an experimental growth accelerator. Danny becomes obsessed with the idea of turning himself into a grown man with the same machine, in order to break up Miss Noble's engagement, as well as convincing her to give him a chance. Lloyd is reluctant to help him out, aware of everything that could go wrong; so Danny secretly breaks into his lab and uses his machine that very night, seeing that the timing was perfect, considering that his parents will be leaving the house for a week. Not caring about the potential consequences, he turns himself into a 30-year-old man (Steve Eckholdt). The next day, Lloyd immediately starts working on a machine with the opposite effect so he can return Danny to his 14-year-old self. Meanwhile, Danny visits the high school to pursue Miss Noble. When he arrives, he is promptly mistaken for the school's new principal, Harold Forndexter, who should have arrived to take up his position that morning (the real Forndexter (Alan Thicke) has been delayed, but due to a miscommunication the school was not informed.) Playing along with their misconception, Danny not only impresses his assistant Louisa Horton (Loretta Swit) with the introduction of his new rules - which include having as much fun as possible - but also Peggy, who admires his youthful approach of life. Lloyd, however, is having no luck with his attempts to turn Danny back to his younger age; as all of his prototype machines killed the tomatoes he used as test subjects. Lloyd is also becoming slightly jealous of Danny who now seems to have total freedom unlike Lloyd who's stuck with an adoptive family that never wanted him, and he begins to openly wonder what it would be like to become a man too. Unconcerned with all this, Danny continues to pursue a relationship with Peggy. Much to the dismay of Kelton, she agrees to go on a date with Danny Even though Kelton follows their every step, Peggy has a splendid evening with the new principal, and they almost kiss at the end of the night. During a school dance, Danny finally convinces Peggy that Kelton is not right for her, and she breaks off the engagement. By this time, Lloyd has finally completed a working machine. But when he goes to inform Danny, he discovers that the 'Harold' persona has completely taken Danny over and he refuses to change back, telling Lloyd that he likes his new body and life, and that he's never becoming Danny again. Immediately after, Danny and Peggy become a couple. Kelton, refusing to accept this, tries to find out more on Forndexter, and discovers that 'Harold' is an impostor. He immediately informs the police, who arrive quickly to arrest him; giving Danny no choice but to transform back into a kid. While Danny tries to escape, Lloyd prepares the machine for him. After getting rid of the cops, 'Harold' tells Peggy that he has to leave town for good and then, after returning to Lloyd's lab, becomes Danny again. However, Peggy followed him and witnesses his transformation, now realising that 'Harold' was actually Danny, one of her favourite students. Because she has fallen in love with him, she convinces Lloyd to use the same machine to turn herself into a 14-year-old (Amy Hathaway), which enables her to be with Danny. Meanwhile, in order to escape his abusive family, Lloyd finally gives in to temptation and uses the machine to turn himself into a professor, called Mr. Lloyd (Sal Viscuso), and starts working at the same high school as a teacher.

Three ages of the SALMA classification are defined in the basin; the Early Miocene Santacrucian from the Santa Cruz Formation and Friasian from the R√≠o Fr√≠as Formation and the Pleistocene Ensenadan from the La Ensenada Formation. The Magallanes Basin contains most of Chile's coal reserves dwarfing those found in the Arauco Basin or around Valdivia (e.g. Catamut√∫n, Mulp√∫n). Its coals are lignitic to sub-bituminous.

Biography Reuben Wells Leonard was born in Brantford, Ontario on 21 February 1860. He obtained a degree in civil engineering from the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario and began working for the Canadian Pacific Railway. He joined the Corps of Guides in 1904. In 1905 he obtained mining rights to a productive claim in Cobalt, Ontario. He founded Coniagas Mines Limited to mine the ore and Coniagas Reduction Company Limited to process it. In 1911, he was named chairman of the National Transcontinental Railway Concern, the forerunner of the Canadian National Railways. He oversaw construction of the railway from Moncton, New Brunswick, to Winnipeg, Manitoba. Leonard was the namesake of the train ferry S.S. Leonard, built in 1914 by Cammell Laird to provide service pending completion of the Quebec Bridge. During World War I, he served in Europe with the Corps of Guides. He was promoted Lieutenant-Colonel in September 1915. He was president of the Engineering Institute of Canada in 1919-20. He served on the Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission and on the boards of several colleges and universities, including Khaki University, the University of Toronto, Wycliffe College, Toronto, and Ridley College. Philanthropy In 1916, he established an educational trust. Under its provisions, bursaries could only be granted to white British protestant students, and only a quarter of each year's grant money could be awarded to women. These terms were challenged in court in 1986, and in 1990 were adjudged by the Court of Appeal for Ontario to be illegal. Leonard also made donations to Queen's University, the University of Toronto, scouting organizations, and many others. After World War I he donated Chatham House, Number 10 St. James's Square, a Grade I Listed 18th-century house to the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Honours Queen‚Äôs University conferred an honorary doctorate in October 1930. Leonard Reef, St. Joseph Channel, Algoma District was named in his honour. In 1923, he donated land to Queen‚Äôs University, on which Leonard Hall and Leonard Field were named in his honour. There is also a Leonard Township in the Timiskaming District, Ontario. Reuben Wells Leonard died in St. Catharines on 17 December 1930.

There are serious doubts as to whether Fischer will even turn up. His resolve remains in question throughout the early part of the match, amidst a barrage of disputes and demands. He plays badly in the first game and loses. The prospects look bleak when he fails to appear for the second game and is defaulted. From the third game onwards however, he quickly settles to his best form and outplays the defending champion, scoring seven wins, one loss and eleven draws. Officiated by Lothar Schmid, the match is pronounced a victory for the challenger, by a score of 12¬Ω-8¬Ω. Headline writers across the world follow the unfolding drama with great interest, sensationally describing the confrontation as \\"The Match of the Century\\", \\"East against West\\", \\"The introvert versus the extrovert\\". At the very least, the encounter ends twenty-five years of Soviet supremacy. Predictably, Fischer has his own, more extravagant claim‚Äî\\"It will probably be the greatest sports event in history. Bigger even than the Frazier-Ali fight\\".Fischer v Spassky, The Chess Match of the Century (1972, Gligoric, Fontana) - p 16 After the match, Fischer gains instant celebrity status and even appears on the Bob Hope Show. Subsequently, the popularity of chess reaches new heights in the western world and sales of chess sets rise to record levels. *The Chess Olympiad at Skopje ends in victory for the USSR, scoring 42/60, with Hungary (40¬Ω/60) taking silver and Yugoslavia (38/60), the bronze team medals. Outstanding performances on board one come from Robert H√ºbner (gold), Vlastimil Hort (silver) and Walter Browne (bronze). A total of 444 players take part, representing 63 countries, although Albania withdraw after 10 rounds. For the first time, the Olympiad stages both Men's and Women's events concurrently at the same venue, although there is considerable disparity between the size of the two events‚Äîthe Men's comprises teams of four bolstered by two reserves while the Women's can only support teams of two, with one reserve. The outcome of the Women's event once again favours the USSR (11¬Ω/14), ahead of Romania and Hungary (both 8/14). *San Antonio hosts the Church's fried chicken tournament (named after its sponsor) at the Hotel Hilton Palacio del Rio. Newly crowned world champion Fischer and deposed champion Spassky are invited, but decline entry. Fischer confirms that the playing conditions meet with his approval, but he is less complimentary about the prize fund. The list of entrants is nevertheless world-class and proceedings result in a three-way tie between Tigran Petrosian, Lajos Portisch and Anatoly Karpov.(all 10¬Ω/15). *Mikhail Tal recovers well from his poor health to dominate the Soviet Chess Championship with 15/21, ahead of Vladimir Tukmakov (13/21). He is also a winner at Sukhumi (11/15), ahead of Vladimir Savon (10¬Ω/15) and Mark Taimanov (10/15), but narrowly loses out (10¬Ω/13) to promising newcomer Mark Dvoretsky (11/13) at Viljandi. *The IBM international chess tournament, held in Amsterdam is won by Lev Polugaevsky on 12/15, ahead of Viktor Korchnoi (11/15) and Wolfgang Uhlmann (9¬Ω/15).

From 1981 until his death, he served as administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes. Life A native of Thomaston, Connecticut, Christopher served in the United States Army during World War II in an intelligence capacity in the Pacific Theater of Operations (including the Occupation of Japan) from 1943 to 1946. Thereafter, he was graduated from Yale University with a B.A. in Oriental Studies (conferred Phi Beta Kappa with exceptional distinction in the major) as a member of Elihu in 1948. After brief stints with Investment Dealers Digest (1949‚Äì50) and Time (1950), he completed a second Army tour as an intelligence officer during the Korean War. Following the conflict, he returned to Time, where he was promoted to associate editor (1956-1961) and thence senior editor of the United States and world business sections (1961-1963). Thereafter, Christopher held a variety of positions at Newsweek over the next sixteen years, including foreign editor (1963-1969), executive editor (1969-1972), founding editor of the periodical's international edition (1972-1977) and contributing editor (1977-1979).

Construction Haiti Victory (T-AK 238) was laid down under U.S. Maritime Commission contract by Permanente Metals Corporation, Richmond, California, 24 April 1944, under the Emergency Shipbuilding program. She was launched on 20 July. She was sponsored by Mrs. Lucius Booner; and delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on 18 September. World War II commercial operation The ship's United States Maritime Commission designation was VC2- S- AP3. During World War II she operated as a merchantman and was chartered to Waterman Steamship Company. Acquired by the Navy as a cargo carrier Acquired by the Navy 1 March 1950, Haiti Victory was assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS), for cargo operations in the Atlantic Ocean. From 1950 to 1957, sailing from New York City, she made cargo runs to Northern Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Caribbean. On 6 May 1953, she collided with the British ferry Duke of York, shearing off the ferry's bow, and resulting in the deaths of six passengers.The Times 7 May 1953 On 15 June 1957, Haiti Victory sailed on her first MSTS cruise to the Pacific Ocean. Steaming via the U.S. West Coast, the veteran cargo ship arrived Pusan, Korea, 1 August. Following several Far East cruises, she resumed operations in the Atlantic in July 1958. Departing New York 11 July she steamed for the Eastern Mediterranean to support United States peacekeeping efforts in Lebanon. Units of the U.S. 6th Fleet had landed U.S. Marines at request of Lebanese President Chamoun who wished to prevent a coup against his regime by communist oriented insurgents. While operating in the Mideast, she twice steamed through the Suez Canal, for cargo runs to Karachi, Pakistan. Returning to New York 3 January 1959, Haiti Victory made another Mediterranean cruise prior to assignment in the Pacific.

On 11 August 1960, her helicopter retrieved a 300-pound capsule that was launched into orbit the previous day by a Thor- Agena rocket as part of the Central Intelligence Agency's Corona spy satellite project. Haiti Victory was renamed Longview and re-classified T-AGM-3 on 27 November 1960. She continued operations in the Pacific Missile Range supporting the United States space program, performing a variety of scientific duties for the U.S. Air Force Western Test Range.

His family left Germany in 1937 when he was six and travelled via Paris and Lisbon, eventually settling in New York City in January 1941. At age 12, Krisher published his own magazine and edited his high school and Queens College newspapers. Later he worked for the New York Herald Tribune and the New York World-Telegram & Sun. After graduating from college, Krisher was drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean War but due to his German language skills was stationed in Heidelberg at the US Army's press and information division. In 1958 he visited Japan for the first time. From 1959 to 1960 Krisher spent a year doing Japanese area and language studies at Columbia University as a Ford Foundation Advanced International Reporting Fellow. He joined Newsweek 's Tokyo bureau first as a stringer and eventually became bureau chief until 1980. In 1975 he was the first and only journalist ever do a to a one-on-one interview for publication with the Japanese Emperor Hirohito (Tenno Showa). He was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. After retiring from Newsweek, Krisher joined Fortune Magazine as its Tokyo correspondent and at the same time joined Shinchosha, a large Japanese publishing company, as its chief editorial advisor. There he worked on the groundbreaking and wildly successful weekly FOCUS magazine in 1981. Focus magazine reached peak editions of up to 2 million per week in its heyday. Krisher was the Far East representative of the MIT Media Lab. As such, he collaborated with Nicholas Negroponte, who was also one of the first to sponsor a school in Cambodia in Krisher's signature school building project. On 5 March 2019, Krisher died at a hospital in Tokyo at the age of 87.  Philanthropy  In 1993, Krisher founded and became chairman of American Assistance for Cambodia, a non-profit organization aimed at giving hope to the Cambodian people following the extermination of 2 million Cambodians during the Khmer Rouge regime. 300px Krisher launched the charity Sihanouk Hospital Center of HOPE which treats the poor for free. By 2013 he'd built over 550 schools, many of them with matching funds from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. He also founded and published The Cambodia Daily, a newspaper dedicated to setting up a sound foundation for a free press and training journalists. The Cambodia Daily was shut down by the Cambodian government in 2017, but continues to publish online. In 2008, Krisher also founded The Burma Daily which aimed to replicate the ideals and success of The Cambodia Daily.

It is named after Morton L. Curtis, Gustav A. Hedlund, and Roger Lyndon; in his 1969 paper stating the theorem, Hedlund credited Curtis and Lyndon as co-discoverers.. It has been called \\"one of the fundamental results in symbolic dynamics\\".. The theorem states that a function from a shift space to itself represents the transition function of a one-dimensional cellular automaton if and only if it is continuous (with respect to the Cantor topology) and equivariant (with respect to the shift map). More generally, it asserts that the morphisms between any two shift spaces (i.e., continuous mappings that commute with the shift) are exactly those mappings which can be defined uniformly by a local rule. The version of the theorem in Hedlund's paper applied only to one- dimensional finite automata, but a generalization to higher dimensional integer lattices was soon afterwards published by ,. and it can be even further generalized from lattices to discrete groups. One important consequence of the theorem is that, for reversible cellular automata, the reverse dynamics of the automaton can also be described by a cellular automaton. Definitions An alphabet is any finite set of symbols, which may be thought of as the states of the cells in a cellular automaton. A configuration is a bi-infinite sequence of symbols from the alphabet: :. A position in a configuration is an integer, the index of one of the symbols in the sequence; the positions may be thought of as the cells of a cellular automaton. A pattern is a finite set of positions and an assignment of symbols to each of these positions. The shift space is the set of all possible configurations over a given alphabet. It may be given the structure of a topological space according to the Cantor topology, in which the fundamental open sets are the sets of configurations that match any single pattern and the open sets are arbitrary unions of fundamental open sets. In this topology, a function from configurations to configurations is continuous if, for any fixed pattern defining a fundamental open set , the set of configurations mapped by into can itself be described by a (possibly infinite) set of patterns, with the property that a configuration belongs to if and only if it matches a pattern in . The shift map is a particular continuous function on the shift space that transforms a configuration into a new configuration in which each symbol is shifted one position over from its previous position: that is, for every integer , . A function is equivariant under the shift map if the transformation on configurations described by commutes with the shift map; that is, for every configuration , it must be the case that . Intuitively, this means that every position of the configuration is updated by using the same rule as every other position. A cellular automaton is defined by a rule for computing the new value of each position in a configuration based only on the values of cells in a prior-fixed finite neighborhood surrounding the position, with all positions of the configuration being updated simultaneously based on the same update rule. That is, the new value of a position is a function only of the values of the cells in its neighborhood rather than depending more generally on an unbounded number of cells of the previous configuration. The function that uses this rule to map a configuration of the cellular automaton into its successor configuration is necessarily equivariant with respect to the shift map, by the assumption that all positions use the same update rule. It is also necessarily continuous in the Cantor topology: if is a fixed pattern, defining a fundamental open set , then is defined by a finite set of patterns, the assignments to cells in the neighborhood of that cause to produce . The Curtis‚ÄìHedlund‚ÄìLyndon theorem states that these two properties are sufficient to define cellular automata: every continuous equivariant function is the update rule of a cellular automaton. Proof Ceccherini-Silberstein and Coornaert provide the following proof of the Curtis‚ÄìHedlund‚ÄìLyndon theorem.. Suppose is a continuous shift-equivariant function on the shift space. For each configuration , let be the pattern consisting of the single symbol that appears at position zero of . By continuity of , there must exist a finite pattern in such that, if the positions outside are changed arbitrarily but the positions within are fixed to their values in , then the result of applying remains the same at position zero. Equivalently, there must exist a fundamental open set such that belongs to and such that for every configuration in , and have the same value at position zero. These fundamental open sets (for all possible configurations ) form an open cover of the shift space. However, the shift space is a compact space: it is a product of finite topological spaces with the alphabet as their points, so compactness follows from Tychonoff's theorem. By compactness, every open cover has a finite subcover. The finite set of positions appearing in this finite subcover may be used as the neighborhood of position zero in a description of as a cellular automaton rule. The same proof applies more generally when the set of integer positions is replaced by any discrete group , the space of configurations is replaced by the set of functions from to a finite alphabet, and shift-equivariance is replaced by equivariance under the action of on itself. In particular, it applies to cellular automata defined on an integer grid of any dimension. Counterexample for infinite alphabets Consider the space of bi-infinite sequences of integers, and define a function from this space to itself according to the rule that, if , then for every position , . This rule is the same for each position, so it is shift- equivariant. And it can be shown to be continuous according to the Cantor topology: for each finite pattern in , there is a pattern in with at most twice as many positions that forces to generate , consisting of the cells in together with the cells whose values are copied into . However, despite being continuous and equivariant, is not a cellular automaton rule, because the value of any cell can potentially depend on the value of any other cell rather than only depending on the cells in any prior-fixed finite neighborhood. Application to reversible cellular automata A cellular automaton is said to be reversible when every configuration of the automaton has exactly one predecessor. It follows by a compactness argument that the function mapping each configuration to its predecessor is itself continuous in the shift space, and it is clearly also shift-invariant. Therefore, by the Curtis‚ÄìHedlund‚ÄìLyndon theorem, the time-reversed dynamics of the cellular automaton may itself be generated using a different cellular automaton rule. However, the neighborhood of a cell in the reverse automaton may be significantly larger than the neighborhood of the same cell in the forward automaton... Generalization One can generalize the definition of cellular automaton to those maps that are defined by rules for computing the new value of each position in a configuration based on the values of cells in a finite but variable neighborhood surrounding the position. In this case, as in the classical definition, the local rule is the same for all cells, but the neighborhood is also a function of the configuration around the position. The counterexample given above for a continuous and shift-equivariant map which is not a classical cellular automaton, is an example of a generalized cellular automaton. When the alphabet is finite, the definition of generalized cellular automata coincides with the classical definition of cellular automata due to the compactness of the shift space. Generalized cellular automata were proposed by . where it was proved they correspond to continuous shift- equivariant maps.

The core philosophy driving the establishment of this township was to provide a model, master-planned community for Karachi's populace in a suburban setting. The township was planned from scratch, with a focus on building into the master plan amenities and services that were not available elsewhere in the city. Generous allocation were made for parks, mosques, clubs, health and education facilities, etc. to allow residents to feel self-contained within the bounds of the township. In essence, Gulshan-e-Maymar represented a microcosm of Maymar's management's utopian world. Having gone through 13 phases of extensions and development, Gulshan-e-Maymar currently stands at 1023 acres. Its population today is at 45% of its optimal capacity of 100,000, which is the number around which all the amenities and services have been planned. The township has witnessed significant growth in recent years due to its quaint setting, plethora of amenities, relatively low air and noise pollution, and access to one of the major freeways of the country. At its current growth rate, the township will get close to its capacity figure by 2012. The significant growth of this township has resulted in exponential appreciation of real estate prices within it ‚Äì this trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future as evidenced by the growth projections and the lack of alternative townships with similar facilities and amenities. Gulshan-e-Maymar township is situated just off the Super Highway (main highway between Karachi and Hyderabad) in MDA Scheme 45 (and partly in MDA scheme 33) in Karachi.

It is a body under the Ministry of the Interior, which aims to collect, order and keep the documentation that the law entrusts to it, to spread knowledge of the sources of Argentine history. Overview The archives were established on August 28, 1821, by Governor Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez as the Buenos Aires Province Archive. The institution (AGN) absorbed numerous historical archives, libraries, and other collections over the subsequent decades, and in 1957 acquired the National Print Archive, a bureau established in 1939. Its collections occupy around 14 km (9 mi) of shelf stacks, and the AGN is a member of the Memory of the World Programme, a UNESCO initiative. Operated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the AGN is organized into five departments: *Written Documents. This section curates parchments and manuscripts originating in the colonial Viceroyalty of Peru and Viceroyalty of R√≠o de la Plata, as well as those dating from the May Revolution of 1810, and of the series of fledgling governments assembled during the Argentine War of Independence. *Photographic Documents. Photographs dating from 1853 to 1983, totalling over 800,000, as well as the Witcomb Collection (images taken in the renowned former art gallery of its many exhibitions). *Library and Dissemination. Oversees partnerships with archives and kindred institutions from around the world, serves as liaison to journalists and researchers, publishes all archive newsletters and periodicals, and maintains the sum of the institute's bibliography (over 100,000 books). This department, in turn, includes: **Bibliography Fund. 80,000 volumes, and a periodicals library of over 1,500 titles. **Ernesto Celesia Collection.13,000 volumes dating from the 19th century, and from several countries in South America. **Jos√© Juan Biedma Collection. 717 period publications regarding the Paraguayan War and boundary disputes with Chile. **Jos√© A. Pillado Collection. 1,044 tomes on Argentine and Western Hemisphere history. **Juan Domingo Per√≥n Collection. 4,000 volumes donated by the populist leader from his personal library. **Periodicals Library. Magazine and newspaper issues from the 19th and 20th centuries. *Cinema and Media. Over 3,000 films, newsreels, Ampex tapes, and more recent multimedia items. *Intermediate Archive. Established in 1979, the library science arm of the AGN assists archives and libraries nationwide and elsewhere with the classification and curation of items. This office also maintains the bulk of documentation produced by the array of State enterprises, and was entrusted with these during President Carlos Menem's privatizations drive. Headquarters Housed within the former Congress building in 1906, the AGN was relocated to its present address at 246 Leandro Alem Avenue (a former National Mortgage Bank office designed by Arturo Prins, and completed in 1920), upon the inaugural of the new Mortgage Bank building in 1950. The headquarters cannot house the entirety of its vast collections, which include over of shelves of documentation; the Intermediate Archive, for instance, was opened in another, nearby building. Plans were announced for the archives' transfer to the former ALEA Building, a Rationalist structure located behind the Alas Building that was ultimately sold to developer IRSA in 1998. Clar√≠n (August 31, 1998) Construction was approved in 2012 for a new main building for the AGN, designed by Fabio Estremera, Luciana Deschamps and Javier Gavernet, and to be located on the site of the former Caseros Prison in the Parque Patricios district.

The Archives were renamed in 1911, and are located in Rio de Janeiro. The National Archives of Brazil is the Brazilian institution responsible for the management, preservation and dissemination of federal government documents. Since 2011 it is subordinated to the Ministry of Justice and Public Security. The AN has the following competence, accordind to the Decree No. 9,360 of May 7, 2018, which grants it as the main body of Archival Documents Management System (in Portuguese: Sistema de Gest√£o de Documentos de Arquivo ‚Äì SIGA) of the federal government: \\"to guide the main organizations and entities of the federal Executive Power in the implementation of document management programs; oversee the application of procedures and technical operations related to the production, registration, classification, control of the processing, use and evaluation of documents, to modernize government archival services; promote the collection of permanent guard documents for technical treatment, preservation and dissemination, to guarantee full access to information, in support of governmental decisions of a political‚Äìadministrative nature and to the citizen in the defense of their rights, aiming to encourage the production of scientific and cultural knowledge; and supervise and apply the national policy archives, established by the National Council of Archives (Conselho Nacional de Arquivo ‚Äì CONARQ)\\". The National Archives of Brazil thus fulfills a double and essential function for the Brazilian State and society ‚Äì both in the management of archival documents that are produced in all federal institutions and in safeguarding and giving access to fundamental fonds for history.  Mission  The National Archives of Brazil (AN) fulfills part of its institutional mission by offering guidance, technical assistance and training to the servants of other federal public administration bodies throughout Brazil in the area of management, preservation, technical processing, access and dissemination of documents under the Archival Documents Management System (in Portuguese: Sistema de Gest√£o de Documentos de Arquivo ‚Äì SIGA). Through its conservation area, the National Archives of Brazil guarantees the protection of the fundamental documentary heritage for the country. These actions are complemented by the technical treatment of its fonds, to make it available to the public through search systems and research instruments. Thus, the National Archives offers thousands of documents in its custody accessible anywhere in the world through the Internet; On the other hand, it is possible to consult the documents in person at your two units (in Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia) or the distance or by email. The National Archives currently has 10 electronic sites, 7 databases and 42 research tools that allow its users access to information on the document, as well as information about its activities and events. The Information System of the National Archives ‚Äì SIAN is its main system. The access to information and documents of the National Archives of Brazil is enhanced by various dissemination actions, such as electronic research sites, exhibitions and publications. Among them, the Arquivo em Cartaz ‚Äì International Archives Film Festival, Revista Acervo, National Archives Week; Mem√≥rias Reveladas; besides having a great presence in social medias, joining in 2017 the GLAM project of the Wikicommons. The Archives also holds pre-1959 diplomatic records between Brazil and the United States of America. It may be necessary to contact Brazil's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to access some of the records.  History   The Public Archives of the Brazilian Empire  The regulation No. 2, of January 2, 1838, created the Public Archives of the Brazilian Empire, as provided for in the Constitution of 1824, provisionally established in the Secretariat of State for the Business of the Empire. The creation of the National Archives, together with the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute, which added to the Imperial Academy of the Arts, joined the regency effort of Pedro de Ara√∫jo Lima, future Viscount and Marqu√©s de Olinda, for the construction of an imperial State. The Public Archives of the Empire was intended to safeguard public documents and was organized into three sections: Administrative, responsible for the documents of the Executive and Moderator powers; Legislative, in charge of the custody of the documents produced by the Legislative Power and the Historical Section, responsible for the most important documents for the history of Brazil. Its first headquarters was located in the building of the Ministry of the Empire, in the street of the Guarda Velha Street, current Treze de Maio Avenue. In 1844, the Public Archives of the Empire came to stay in Pra√ßa do Com√©rcio, on Direita Street, today Primeiro de Mar√ßo Avenue, Rio de Janeiro. Initially the organ functioned as a distribution attached to the Secretariat of State for the Business of the Empire, becoming autonomous in 1840. However, it occupied the secretarial building until 1854, when it was transferred to the upper floor of the Convent of Santo Ant√¥nio. In 1860, decree n. 2,541 reformed the institution, maintaining the same division of the sections, however, detailing a little more the attributions of each one. From the decade of 1870, a greater structuring of the organ is observed. In the year 1870, the archive came to occupy the old building of the Recolhimento do Parto dos Terceiros da Ordem do Carmo. In 1873, Joaquim Pires Machado Portella became director of the institution, and in the following year the archive was opened for public consultation. A new regulation was adopted, approved by Decree n. 6.164, of March 24, 1876, determining various transformations and establishing more detailed work procedures. With the Republic, in 1911, the organ had its name altered for National Public Archives, like many other institutions that possessed the term \\"Imperial\\" in their names. Jos√© Hon√≥rio Rodrigues, director (1958‚Äì1964).  The Reformation of Jos√© Hon√≥rio Rodrigues  For Jos√© Hon√≥rio Rodrigues, director from 1958 to 1964, the National Archives \\"was stagnant, impervious to initiative, as a model of archaic institution, a ghost of other times\\". In order to change that situation, as director of the National Archives, Jos√© Hon√≥rio Rodrigues himself achieved the approval of a new Regulation by Decree No. 44,862, of November 21, 1958, which defines the Archive as a national distribution, establishes the archives policy, its attributions and objectives, defends and extends the collection selected throughout the national territory and in all sources of federal documentation; it extends to the defense by the preservation of documents in films, discs, photographs; it creates research and historical information services, relating them to equal services in the Armed Forces and in other public and private institutions\\". Thus, \\"with this proposal of a centralizing body for the regulation of archival procedures, it is reaffirmed the idea of Archives as a space of Power\\". During Jos√© Hon√≥rio Rodrigues' period, one can also observe the development of various courses related to the training of professionals able to work in archives. Such courses, in 1977, gave rise to the first course of graduation in Archival science, at the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro.  The institutional modernization of the 1980s  With the approval in 1975 of a new regulation an important step was taken, when the idea of document management was incorporated, through the Pre-Archive Division, which was installed itself in Brasilia the following year, demonstrating the Archives concern with its actions before the public administration in the capital. The preservation of documents of the public power as a purpose of the National Archives System (SINAR) was one of the conquests of the late 1970s. With the National Archives as the central organ, the system was composed of the bodies of the direct and indirect federal administration that had intermediate and permanent archiving activities. Following the suggestion of UNESCO, at the request of the general director of the National Archives, Celina Vargas do Amaral Peixoto, of a \\"pilot project of modernization of traditional type within an archives institution\\" and to guarantee a radical change, it was necessary to translation to a new headquarters; the identification of all the documents kept in the National Archives; the census of the fonds not collected and the training of the workers of the institution. These were the conditions required for the preparation of federal legislation and a new structure for the National Archives. The result of an agreement between the Ministry of Justice and the Get√∫lio Vargas Foundation (FGV), the Administrative Institutional Modernization Project of the National Archive was signed in 1981, as the subsequent passage of the Archives to the autonomous body of the direct administration in the structure of the Ministry and the transfer to the building attached to the old Casa da Moeda, in January 1985, the interest of international organizations in that decade was awakened. Thus, on January 3, 1985 the National Archives os Brazil moved to its current headquarters, which occupies one of the buildings of the old Casa da Moeda (1868‚Äì1983), one of the most beautiful buildings built in the nineteenth century style in the Pra√ßa da Rep√∫blica. After an award-winning restoration process, in 2004, it occupies the historical part of that architectural ensemble. In Brasilia, while it does not havea specific building, the AN uses since 1988 part of the facilities of the National Press (Imprensa Nacional), having 18 thousand meters of shelves for guard of documents in its regional coordination ‚Äì at the moment, the only one outside Rio de Janeiro.

The textual documentation from the federal Executive, Moderator, Judicial and Legislative powers also includes private collections. Correspondence and legislation originated around the Portuguese ultramarine empire, the archives brought with the court of Jo√£o VI in 1808, among others, describe the beginning of Brazilian society. With the rupture of the colonial past, the formation of the imperial state can be known through the documents generated by the ministries and the judiciary, such as the Casa da Suplica√ß√£o, the General Audit of Marinha, in addition to the original Constitution of 1824 and the Golden Law. Among the documents produced by the republican regime, stand out the entry records of immigrants, patents of inventions, books of civil registry, civis and criminal proceedings, sightings of UFOs, urbanization and sanitation projects related to the first years of the 20th century. The constitutions from the year 1891, the processes of the National Security Court, the Supreme Military Court and the Supreme Federal Court, the censorship bodies, the documents of entities such as the National Information Service, which compose the repressive apparatus to the Political struggles of the Military Dictatorship (1964‚Äì1985) and several other governmental institutions reflect the formation of contemporary Brazil and relevant aspects of the country's recent history. In addition to the documents of the information and counter-information body of the military regime, personal archives and private entities are important, including Eus√©bio de Queir√≥s, Duque de Caxias, Bertha Lutz, Luis Carlos Prestes, Salgado Filho, San Tiago Dantas, Goes Monteiro, Apol√¥nio de Carvalho, M√°rio Lago, Zelia Pedreira Abreu Magalh√£es, Maria Beatriz Nascimento, the presidents of Republic Floriano Peixoto, Prudente de Moraes, Afonso Pena, Jo√£o Goulart, the Brazilian Academy of Letters, the Brazilian Federation for Female Progress, the Institute of Pesquisa e Estudos Sociais (IPES) and the Association of Brazilian Archivists. Composed of maps and architectural plans, the cartographic documentation has more than 44,000 titles on the geography of different regions of the world and Brazil from the 17th to the 20th century. In reference to Brazil, the planning and urban infrastructure projects stand out, such as the buildings of the Central Avenue, current Rio Branco Avenue, in Rio de Janeiro, as well as railroads, telegraphs, ports, rivers and canalization of the systems of water supply. The iconographic documentation has its starting point in the 1860s, coinciding with the expansion of photography. Of the universe of images produced by important national and foreign photographers who worked in Brazil and abroad, the archives of the National Agency (1930‚Äì1979), the newspaper Correio da Manh√£ (1901‚Äì1974) and the Ferrez family stand out (1839‚Äì2000), as well as private records of the Collection of Single Photographs. The collection of sound documents covers the period from 1902 to the year 1990 and consists of more than 11 thousand articles, including records and audio tapes of National Agency fond, Presidency of the Republic, Radio Mayrink Veiga, Humberto Franceschi, Radio Jornal do Brasil, Casa Edison and Public Amusement Censorship Service, as well as collections of classical and popular music. The set of moving images has impressive records of Brazilian history and culture. There are 33 thousand titles, in a total of 124 thousand rolls of film and 4 thousand videomagnetic tapes. They are part of the collection newsreels, documentaries, fiction films and advertising, family and film clippings that were censored, derived from the National Agency, the Division of Public Diversity Censorship, TV Tupi and the National Energy Commission Nuclear, among other fonds and collections.

Attended by nearly two million people, it was the largest demonstration against the president Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner. Antecedents The 18A (a term that stands for the date \\"April 18\\") was initially called by groups in social networks as Facebook. Those groups had organized previous cacerolazos, the 8N and the 13S, and sought to repeat their success. The Argentine branch of the Anonymous group was among the organizers as well. Opposition parties in Argentina had not been formally involved in the previous demonstrations, which had no political leaning; in this case the organizers asked for political support from them. The government proposed a number of bills to amend the judiciary. Three bills were controversial: the first proposes to limit the injunctions against the state, the second to include people selected in national elections at the body that appoints or accuses judges, and the third to create a new court that would limit the number of cases treated by the Supreme Court. The opposition considered that those bills attempt to control the judiciary. As the bills were going to be discussed on April 18, the Radical Civic Union, the Republican Proposal and the internal factions of Peronism that oppose Kirchner formally supported the demonstration. Still, the government announced that they would not decline the bills, even if the demonstration was massive. The demonstration Many groups met at 19:00 at several points of Buenos Aires, marching to the Obelisk and Plaza de Mayo at 20:00. The demonstration included no speeches or orators, and the political parties that joined it did not use political flags or banners. The people marched then to the Argentine National Congress, which was still discussing the bill. A group of people managed to trespass the crowd control barriers and get to the entry of the Congress, by the time the bill was being approved. The demonstration took place at other cities of Argentina as well. The people in C√≥rdoba filled all the space at the intersection of the avenues V√©lez Sarsfield and Hip√≥lito Irigoyen. There were demonstrations at many other cities of the C√≥rdoba Province, such as Villa Carlos Paz, R√≠o Cuarto, Villa Mar√≠a, Villa Dolores and Alta Gracia; governor Jos√© Manuel de la Sota gave his support. The demonstration in Rosario met at the National Flag Memorial, which was attended by Miguel del Sel of the PRO party. La Plata, which was highly damaged by the 2013 Argentina floods, had a demonstration at Plaza Moreno, with people opposing the mayor Pablo Bruera and the perceived corruption in the national government. There were demonstrations at Mar del Plata, Salta, Bariloche, San Juan, Santiago del Estero, Bah√≠a Blanca and Misones, among other cities. There were small protests at the Argentine embassies in 15 foreign cities, such as Sydney, Tokio, Washington, Barcelona, Madrid, Rome, Milan, Santiago de Chile and Rio de Janeiro. President Cristina Kirchner ignored the protest, and wrote several messages in Twitter during it, none of them related to the demonstration. She was not at the country at the moment, as she was visiting Venezuela for the inauguration of president Nicol√°s Maduro. Still, there was a demonstration outside the Quinta de Olivos, the official presidential residence.

Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Tartus Governorate. The inhabitants al-Qadmus are predominantly Isma'ilis and Alawites, with each community constituting about 50% of the population. The villages in the surrounding countryside are mostly inhabited by Alawites.Shora, 2008, pp. 226-230. Article written by Joshua Landis and was published on 2005-07-28. Al-Qadmus is home to an important medieval castle that served as the headquarters of the Isma'ili community in Syria, known as the Assassins during the Crusader era. Today, the castle is largely in ruins and, along with some scattered Ottoman-era houses throughout the town, serves as a tourist site. Al-Qadmus also contains a large mosque with an octagonal minaret. The town is also a center for tobacco production in Syria. Etymology The city is named after Cadmus, who was a Phoenician prince known for introducing the original Alphabet or Phoenician alphabet‚ÄîŒ¶ŒøŒπŒΩŒØŒ∫œâŒΩ Œ≥œÅŒ¨ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒ± Phoinik≈çn grammata, \\"Phoenician letters\\"‚Äî to the Greeks. Climate In Al Qadmus, the climate is warm and temperate. In winter there is much more rainfall in Al Qadmus than in summer. The K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification is Csa. The average annual temperature in Al Qadmus is . About of precipitation falls annually. History Medieval period The fortress of al-Qadmus was captured by Bohemond I of Antioch in 1129.Stevenson, 1907, p. 128. In 1130-1131 it was recaptured by local Muslim forces. The fortress was later sold to the Isma'ili (known then as the Assassins) sect in 1132 by the Muslim emir of al-Kahf, Sayf al-Mulk ibn Amrun.Bosworth, 1989, p. 789. By 1167 the scholar Benjamin of Tudela wrote that al-Qadmus served as the principal seat of the Assassins.Daftary, 1992, p. 5. Although details are few, al-Qadmus changed hands between the Assassins and the Crusaders a few more times, before being firmly under the control of the former.Lee, p. 179. Al- Qadmus was captured and annexed to the Mamluk Sultanate by Baibars in 1273.Raphael, p. 106.Holt, p. 263. It was still controlled by the Ismailis, albeit as loyal subjects to the sultanate, during the intermittent reign of Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad (1294-1340).Daftary, 2007, p. 402. When North African scholar Ibn Battuta visited al-Qadmus in 1355, during Mamluk rule, noting that it was part of the niyabah (\\"governorship\\") of Masyaf, a dependency of Tripoli. Later this governorship was detached from Tripoli and transferred to Damascus province when it was visited by al-Qalqashandi in 1412.Bosworth, 1989, p. 291. Taxes on cotton cloth and silk were abolished in the district of al-Qadmus by various Mamluk sultans in the late 15th century.Jidejian, 1980, pp. 79-80. Ottoman era In 1683, during the Ottoman period, Muslim scholar Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi visited al-Qadmus and noted the emir of the fortress belonged to the Tanukhi clan, an Arab tribe that originally settled in the Batanea area of southern Syria during Byzantine rule and migrated northwards.Lyde, 1860, p. 46. In the 1830s Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt destroyed the fortress of al-Qadmus during the Khedivate Egyptian invasion of the Levant. Al-Qadmus was the seat of Ismaili power at the time.Ainsworth, 1852, p. 88. It was also the center of a district which contained 177 villages. The leading families of the town, and the ones where the emirs hailed from, were the Hejawiyah and the Suwaydaniya.Bibliotheca Sacra and Theological Review. 5. (1848). Allen, Morrill, and Wardwell. In the 1840s the Ismaili chief of al- Qadmus successfully lobbied the Ottoman authorities to allow Ismaili resettlement of the abandoned town of Salamiyah, east of Hama.Daftary, 1998, p. 202. Pressure from the surrounding Alawite heartland caused many to emigrate for Salamiyah, although the town maintained its political and economic significance in the region and served a commanding role in the central Coastal Mountain Range, similar to that played by Safita. Al-Qadmus's inhabitants specialized in commerce and artisan crafts. The town was a destination for farmers from al-Annazah, Talin and al-Shaykh Badr and exported the agricultural products of the area to major cities like Hama, Tripoli and Beirut. While most of the Ismailis in Syria transferred their allegiance to the Qasim Shahi line of Aga Khan III in 1887, the Ismailis of Qadmus and Masyaf remained affiliated with the Muhammad Shahi line. They are known as the \\"Ja'afariya\\" sect and by the 1990s they numbered around 15,000.Daftary, 1998, p. 203. The quarter in Salamiyah where many of al-Qadmus' inhabitants had settled was named \\"al-Qadamisa,\\" after the town of their origin.Sluglett, 2010, p. 493. Modern era In December 1918, during the Syrian Coastal Revolt led by Saleh al-Ali against the occupying French authorities, French forces stationed at al-Qadmus attempted to launch an attack against al-Ali's stronghold in nearby al-Shaykh Badr. Al-Ali and his forces engaged and defeated the French near the village of Wadi al-Oyun. Because the Ismaili leadership in al-Qadmus had allied themselves with the French, al-Ali assaulted the town soon afterward. French forces came to aid their allies, but were defeated a second time on 21 February 1919.Moosa, 1987, p. 282. By July 1919 the French and al-Ali concluded a peace agreement, but it was violated by the former when, from their base in al-Qadmus, they burned down the village of Kaff al-Jaz. Subsequently, al-Ali launched a counterattack against al- Qadmus.Moosa, 1987, p. 283. Prior to the ascent of the Baathist government in 1963, the built-up areas of al-Qadmus was largely concentrated just south and east of the citadel, where most houses were built closely together. This area contained the old souk (\\"market\\") and the Ismaili mosque. In the 1970s and 1980s, during the presidency of Hafez al-Assad, the town expanded northward towards the east-west road connecting Masyaf and Baniyas. The intersection of this highway has become the commercial center of the town. Tourism-centered development spearheaded by private contractors began in the late 1980s, mostly concentrated north of the fortress, east of the town's main thoroughfare and south of the east-west highway. The area attracts vacationers mostly from other parts of Syria, including a high proportion of Ismailis from other cities. Al-Qadmus's political and socio-economic position in the central coastal mountains region significantly decreased after 1970. This was in part due to the promotion of nearby al-Shaykh Badr to a district center that year, which shifted the focus away from al-Qadmus, with villagers in the area going to al-Shaykh Badr for services. Moreover, the gradual development and improvement of transportation infrastructure between Baniyas and its hinterland made it easier for the people of Hammam Wasel, al-Annazah and Talin to travel to Baniyas instead of al-Qadmus. In early July 2005 confessional violence broke out between some of the Ismaili and Alawite residents of al- Qadmus. The clashes were apparently started after a few young Alawite men began speaking to Ismaili women to the consternation of the latter's male relatives. When the relatives complained to the town's Alawite police commander, he refrained from becoming involved in the dispute. Many in the Alawite community subsequently boycotted Ismaili-owned businesses in al- Qadmus, particularly the furniture stores and sweet shops, and instead opted to purchase from the surrounding markets. The local Ismaili merchants were angered at the severe decrease in their business's profits as a result of the boycott and began hurling stones at Alawite-owned storefronts. Later that evening some Alawite residents retaliated by ransacking and burning down 27 Ismaili-owned businesses, causing damage worth an estimated 10 million Syrian pounds. A 75-year-old man from the town was killed in the violence and 13 others were wounded.Syrian Authorities Ban Human Rights Activist from Leaving Country. Kuwait News Agency. 2005-07-14. The clashes ended when two Syrian Army battalions from nearby military bases closed the roads leading to al- Qadmus and detained and questioned about 500 suspects. A civilian delegation from al-Qadmus met with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in an attempt to relieve tensions in the town. The Alawite nahiyah (\\"sub-district\\") chief of al-Qadmus was replaced by a Christian who was seen as neutral.

Additionally, the cantons have official archives of their own. The building and its collections are a Swiss heritage site of national significance. In 2018 the archives held over 66,000 linear meters of printed documents and 20.7 terabytes of digital documents. The archives have a permanent staff of 57.8 full-time equivalent and a budget of 19.2 million CHF. The archives are governed by the Federal Act on Archiving.Federal Act on Archiving, original version 1998-06-26. The Federal Archives were created in 1798 following the creation of the Helvetic Republic. Under the republic, the archives moved whenever the seat of government moved. With the creation of the Federal State in 1848 the archives became part of the Federal Chancellery and found a home in Bern in the town hall. The first federal archivist was Johann Jakob Meyer, who was appointed in 1849. In the second half of the 19th century, the archives moved to the western wing of the Parliament building. In 1868 the second chief archivist, Jakob Kaiser, was appointed. Over the following years he persuaded Parliament to purchase land across the Aare river in the Kirchenfeld district and build the current archive building. The building was built in 1896-99 by Theodor Gohl in the Renaissance Revival style. In 1914 the archives are officially designated as the Bundesarchiv or Federal Archives. In the same year its first typewriter was installed. On 9 May 1944 the Federal Council approves the first regulations making all records in the archive which are at least 50 years old available to the public without restriction. In 1963 the first microfilm reader was installed, followed by a copier in 1965. On 15 July 1966 new regulations regarding the archives retained the 50 year limit, but made exceptions for academic research. In 1973 the 50 year limit was shortened to 35 years and in 1998 it was again reduced to 30 years.

Their presence has been documented in Uruguay since 1905, in Argentina since 1906 and in Brazil since the early 20th century. History and distribution The Bulgarian diaspora in South America is strongest in Argentina, where 40,000 people of Bulgarian descent are thought to live, the diaspora itself assessing its size to be at least 80,000. However, according to official data, only around 3,000 people have declared Bulgarian nationality in Argentina. Bulgarians mainly live in Buenos Aires, Berisso, Mar del Plata, Presidencia Roque S√°enz Pe√±a, Las Bre√±as and Comodoro Rivadavia. The most significant wave of emigration was in the 1920s, following World War I, when over 20,000 Bulgarians (mostly from northern Bulgaria: around Veliko Tarnovo, Lovech, Pleven, Vratsa and Targovishte) settled in Argentina. Some of them formed a compact community in the agricultural Chaco Province, introducing the first tractor to Chaco. According to estimates, 1,800‚Äì5,000 Bulgarians live in Brazil, chiefly in Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo, Porto Alegre and Belo Horizonte, including many Bessarabian Bulgarians and some Bulgarian Jews and Bulgarian Armenians. The most famous Brazilian of Bulgarian origin is President Dilma Rousseff from the Workers' Party. Her father P√©tar was born in Gabrovo and, as an active member of the Bulgarian Communist Party in the 1920s, had to flee from Bulgaria in 1929 due to political persecution. Rousseff's wide margin over her rivals sparked a \\"Dilma fever\\" in Bulgaria.Elei√ß√£o no Brasil provoca 'febre Dilma' na Bulg√°ria Folha de S.Paulo. Retrieved on 2010-10-02. . Although she does not speak Bulgarian she said in an interview that she does feel like a Bulgarian to a certain extent.Dilma Rousseff: I Feel Like I Am Partly Bulgarian Sofia News Agency. Retrieved on 2010-10-02. During her state visit to Bulgaria, on October 5, 2011, Rousseff was awarded Bulgaria‚Äôs highest state honour, the Order of Stara Planina. A notable Bulgarian diaspora also exists in Uruguay, numbering around 2,000. Most Bulgarians in this country live in Montevideo, with some in Fray Bentos, Punta del Este, Maldonado, Durazno and Rocha. In the late 1920s, there were around 4,000 Bulgarians in Uruguay. A smaller number of Bulgarians have also settled in Chile (today around 150, mostly in Santiago), Venezuela (today around 130), Peru, Paraguay and Colombia. Among Bulgarians are Banat Bulgarians from Romania, Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians who became adjusted to South American, and Latin American, society because of the linguistic similarities between Romanian, Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, Spanish, and Portuguese, as well as Latin identity of Aromanians and Megleno- Romanians, and Banat Bulgarians are predominantly Roman Catholic.

It was owned by Genie Energy and Total S.A.. In May 2016, Genie Energy announced that the AMSO project was closing. History EGL Oil Shale was established as a subsidiary of EGL Resources, a privately owned independent oil and gas company with operations in the southwestern United States. In 2006, it was awarded a lease by the United States Bureau of Land Management to develop and demonstrate its in-situ oil shale extraction technology in Western Colorado. On 22 January 2008, IDT Corporation and EGL Resources signed an agreement, according to which IDT acquired 75% of EGL Oil Shale and renamed it AMSO, LLC. AMSO was formed on 15 February 2008. Shortly thereafter, IDT bought an additional 15% of AMSO, LLC. Subsequently, on 3 March 2009, French oil major Total bought 50% of AMSO, LLC's shares for $3.2 million, with EGL Resources selling their remainder and IDT retaining 50%. IDT's share was subsequently transferred to Genie Energy, which was split off from IDT on October 31, 2011. They were owned by American Shale Oil Corporation, which major shareholder was Genie Energy's oil and gas arm Genie Oil and Gas with 98.3%. In 2007, the company was awarded the Bureau of Land Management oil shale research, development and demonstration lease in Rio Blanco County, Colorado. AMSO started its pilot well in January 2012, but the operations were interrupted shortly afterwards due to technical problems with a 600 kilowatt electric heater. By March 31, 2016 the ownership of Total in AMSO, LLC was increased to 58.7%. On February 23, 2016, Total announced its intention to discontinue funding AMSO, LLC and on March 23, 2016 it announced its withdrawal from the project, effective April 30, 2016. Total agreed to pay US$3 million for decommissioning, winding up and dissolution of AMSO, LLC. Genie Energy estimated that the total amount of such cost would be about $5 million, of which Genie's share would be under $2 million. Technology AMSO developed a process called \\"Conduction, Convection, Reflux\\" (CCR) oil shale conversion. The process combines horizontal wells, which are heated by a downhole burner or other means, and other horizontal or vertical wells, which provide both heat transfer through refluxing of generated oil and a means to collect and produce the oil. At the start of the heating process, oil is injected to improve heat transfer. AMSO has proposed that permeability of the formation sufficient for convection will be achieved by thermomechanical fracturing. The original technology proposed by EGL was based on hydraulic fracturing.) AMSO believes that by heating the rock more quickly than in the Shell in situ conversion process - 3 to 12 months as opposed to several years - the CCR process will consume less energy and require fewer wells. Researchers at Petrochina who reviewed AMSOs proposed technology in 2008 noted that the output of oil and gas could be faster, but felt that the technical complexity and costs of the proposed technology were shortcomings, and also noted that the fluid flow would be difficult to control and easy to \\"short- circuit.\\" Operations AMSO's operating office was located in Rifle, Colorado. AMSO was also supported by AMSO and Genie staff at the Genie office in Newark, New Jersey. According to an SEC filing by IDT in October 2011, AMSO had four full-time employees and fixed assets of US$15,000. The company leased a test tract in the Piceance Basin from the Bureau of Land Management. Management The company's chairman and chief executive officer was Howard Jonas, the founder and chairman of IDT Corporation. The president was Claude Pupkin.

Ham, 113 U.S. 585 (1885), was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Illinois regarding a bill filed by Charles I. Ham, the appellee, against Isaac N. Pearce and Andrew J. Kuykendall, the appellants. Originally, one Joseph K. Frick contracted with the County Court of Johnson County in the State of Illinois, where he agreed to build, according to certain plans and specifications, a courthouse for said county at Vienna, the county seat, furnishing the material and completing it by the first Monday of September 1870, in consideration whereof the county court agreed to pay him $38,357 in the bonds of Johnson county, bearing ten percent interest, and due in six years. Frick never did any work on the building, and, owing to some misunderstanding with the county court, abandoned the contract and told Kuykendall that he might go on and build the courthouse if he chose to do so. On September 9, 1869, Kuykendall, as the agent and attorney in fact of Frick, assigned the contract of the latter to Ham and Pearce, Ham being the appellee, and Pearce one of the appellants, who had formed a partnership for the purpose of building the courthouse under said contract.. Frick contracted with a county to construct a public building, and gave bond with Kuykendall as surety for the performance of the contract. Frick abandoned the contract. After procuring some modifications in it at request of Ham, Kuykendall assigned the contract to Pearce and Ham as partners with equal interests. Pearce and Ham agreed with Wickwire to construct the building. Ham then left the vicinity and engaged in other work elsewhere. Wickwire constructed the building. Kuykendall received the compensation under the original contract, paid Wickwire in full for the work done by him, and divided the profits with Pearce, claiming to be partner. Held that Ham could recover one-half of the profits from Pearce and from Kuykendall. The object of the suit was to obtain an account of what was due to Ham by virtue of his said partnership and partnership enterprise, and that Pearce and Kuykendall might be decreed to pay him what might be found due on such accounting either in cash or Johnson county bonds. Upon final hearing upon the pleadings and evidence, the circuit court rendered a decree in favor of Ham against Kuykendall and Pearce for $5,001.

Plot  Miguel is a young and very ambitious Colombian politician with a brilliant career ahead of him. Born from a wealthy family, he sees the world from a position of privilege and is blind to the reality of those around him. Miguel has let the wheels in motion to run for office, but fate, it seems has other plans. After falling victim to a violent attack; a naked, unidentified and unconscious Miguel is laid out before a doctor as a John Doe. He unexpectedly revives in the autopsy room leaving those standing before him in shock, but no more shocked than Miguel himself, empty of memories, a name, a destination. He eventually escapes but discovers that he has no memories; he does not know who he is. He searches for himself in an unknown city among people he does not know, living through fragmentary images of his past and dreams he cannot understand. In a dream state, this utter unawareness of himself, Miguel is thrown into the harsh reality of the streets, a world inhabited by the very people he once refused to acknowledge.

History and significance  Clear block of Monroe at Woodward, 2008, where the commercial buildings once stood The early buildings on the block were constructed in Victorian commercial style, designed by architects such as Sheldon and Mortimer Smith during the mid-to-late 19th century. The Johnson block, in particular, constituted what was at the time one of the last remaining blocks of pre-Civil War buildings in Detroit. In the nearby Randolph Street Commercial Buildings Historic District, the building at 1244 Randolph St. is a rare survivor from the 1840s.Randolph Street Commercial Buildings Historic District from the state of Michigan, retrieved 01/27/11 The Victorian styled Odd Fellows Building (1874) is located at the corner of Randolph and Monroe. The Monroe buildings were occupied by numerous short-term tenants through the years, including grocers, confectioners, and saloons. In the early 20th century, a wave of European immigration brought jewelry shops, pawn shops, and tailors to the area. At around the same time, the Campus Martius area was developing into the entertainment center of Detroit. The Detroit Opera House, then located on the north side of the Campus across Monroe Avenue from the buildings in this district, anchored the area, and, in 1901, the Wonderland vaudeville theatre moved next door. The early 20th century was the dawn of the movie age, and in Detroit it began on Monroe Avenue. The first movie theater in Detroit, the Casino, was opened on Monroe Avenue in 1906 by John H. Kunsky. It was reputedly the second movie theatre in the world, and it propelled Kunsky to a 20-theatre empire worth $7 million in 1929. Later in 1906, Detroit's second movie theatre, the Bijou, opened literally two doors down from the Casino. These were the first of a string of theaters along this section of Monroe; three new movie theatre buildings were constructed in the area in the next five years: the Star (1907), designed by Frank G. Baxter and Henry A. O'Dell; the Columbia (1911), designed by the noted theatre architect C. Howard Crane; and the National Theater (1911), the only theatre designed by Albert Kahn.Detroit Historic Districts from Cityscape Detroit In addition, the Family Theater opened in 1914 in an older building in the district.

Hyde, Historic American Buildings Survey, HABS MI-321, 1989 Architect Mortimer L. Smith designed the building. The building originally served as an office building, with storefronts on the ground floor. In 1880, the upper floors of the building were converted into the Kirkwood Hotel, which survived for a decade under various management. The lower floors remained commercial space. The building reverted to office space in the 1890s, then reopened as the Hotel Campus (later the Hotel Fowler) in 1901. In 1909, most of the building was completely gutted and converted into the 934-seat Family Theater; the Family was converted to show movies in 1914. The Family stayed open through much of the century, and was renamed the Follies in 1967. Six years later, in 1973, the Follies burned to the ground. The Follies section of the building (including four of the seven bay Williams Block) was demolished soon thereafter, leaving only the three western-most commercial and retail spaces. In the late 1970s the city vacated the property, and the remainder was demolished in early 1990. The second Williams Block was five stories tall, divided into bays containing three windows per floor; each floor had slightly different window shapes. The building was constructed of brick, sheathed on the front with sandstone. A cast iron cornice and flat roof topped the structure. Belt courses were located above and below windows, and additional decoration consisted of bas relief carvings and cast iron entablatures.

The first Williams block was built by John Constantine Williams in 1859, and was designed by architect Sheldon Smith.32-42 Monroe Avenue (Commercial Building), Charles K. Hyde, Historic American Buildings Survey, HABS MI-322, 1989 The building was originally used as an office building with commercial space on the first floor. In the late 1880s, the building was converted into a 52-room hotel, known first as the Stanwix, then as Gies' European hotel, with a restaurant on the first floor. In 1909, the hotel and restaurant was renamed the Berghoff, then the Tuxedo, and, in 1919, the Frontenac. The Hotel Berghoff was owned by Wm. D. C. Moebs & Co. who were also the proprietors of the adjoining Berghoff Cafe. In December 1913 Wm. D.C. Moebs opened the Cafe Frontenac next to the Hotel Berghoff. In 1918 the name of the hotel was changed to the Tuxedo Hotel and Grill still under the same owners. The name change was short lived because in 1919 the businesses were called the Frontenac Restaurant and the Frontenac Hotel Company still under the ownership of Wm. D.C. Moebs, President. The Frontenac Hotel remained in business through 1960. Wm. D.C. Moebs died November 16, 1921 and the once grand Frontenac Restaurant was sold to pay back taxes in 1923. By 1940, the restaurant had been replaced again with retail space, which remained in the building until the city of Detroit vacated the property in 1978. The building was demolished in early 1990. The first Williams block was five stories tall, constructed of red brick with a flat roof, and measured 60 feet by 100 feet.

The first four (52-54, 58, 62, 66-68 Monroe) measured 20 feet wide and 100 feet deep, with three windows per story on the upper levels. The last building (70-72 Monroe) measured 30 feet wide and 100 feet deep, and was divided into two bays with two windows per bay on each story. Windows in all buildings were rectangular in shape with cast iron lintels featuring a scroll and urn motif. The buildings originally had a cornice at the top; these were removed in the 20th century, most in 1958. The buildings were demolished in early 1990.

Later tenants included a tailor, cigar store, and shoe stores. A barber shop operated continuously in the building from 1915 until the late 1970s, and a second-floor dentist's office existed from the 1920s through the late 1970s. The building was demolished in early 1990. The building was originally virtually identical to the structure next door at 70-72 Monroe, including the cast iron lintels featuring an urn and scroll. The building was, however, set back four additional feet from Monroe Avenue. The building was four stories tall and constructed of red brick. Both the Monroe Avenue and Farmer Street facades had tall narrow windows with a combination of segmental and fully arched window tops, decorated with projecting brick.

The Royal closed in 1922. Afterward, a variety of retail establishments were housed in the building, including a cigar store, jewelers, shoe store, tailor, and barber. The building was demolished in early 1990. The Star was a four-story building, measuring 20 feet wide and 100 feet deep, constructed of red brick, with yellow brick veneer. A large arched window on the Monroe facade fills the third and fourth stories. This facade originally had a thick cornice supported by scrolled brackets, and a decorative arch above the entrance. Seven rectangular windows per story are on the Farmer elevation. The theater space originally took up both the first and most of the second stories, and thus there was only a single window on the second floor at the rear. However, in 1922 after the closure of the Royal, the second story was extended all the way forward to the Monroe facade, adding windows along the Farmer elevation. 104-106 Monroe Avenue 104-106 Monroe, 1989.

National Theatre (118 Monroe Avenue) National Theatre at 118 Monroe, 2008 The 800-seat National Theater, built in 1911, is the only known theatre designed by Albert Kahn and the oldest surviving theatre from the city's original theatre district of the 19th century. It operated as a movie theater until the 1920s, when competition from larger movie houses forced a change to a vaudeville venue. The National survived as a burlesque and adult entertainment theater until it closed in the 1970s. The front facade of the National is dominated by an enormous arch flanked with twin towers and covered with white and blue terra cotta tiles.David Kohrman, National Theater history, Forgotten Detroit, 1999-2004, retrieved 9/30/09 The fa√ßade has hundreds of lightbulbs built in, which accentuate the architectural features when lit. The National Theater is an outstanding example of Modernistic design, boasting a pair of terra cotta latticework towers, arched art glass windows, and colored Pewabic tiles on the facade.
