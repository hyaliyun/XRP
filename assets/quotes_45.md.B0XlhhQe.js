Early life Wah was born and raised in the country's capital city of Port-au-Prince. Wah was of mixed ancestry: his mother was Haitian and his father was a Chinese immigrant. At the age of seven, while attending one of the best parochial schools of the capital, he received his first formal instruction in perspective and anatomy. To further enhance his natural abilities, his father had him tutored by one of Haiti's premier art teachers during that era. A few years later, Wah began utilizing mediums that he did not have much practice with before, notably oil on canvas and masonite. Early in his career, he deviated from his original \\"naif\\" style characteristic of Haitian art to experiment with classical era painting. After experimenting and subsequently mastering these styles, he ultimately settled for the modern eclectic style which he then identified himself with, despite the fact that it was introduced to him in the latter part of his artistic career. Years in Port-au-Prince In 1952, Wah and his younger brother Bernard studied at Foyer des Arts Plastiques school in Port-au-Prince, picking up new techniques with such Haitian experts as Petion Savain, Dieudonne Cedor, Wilson Jolicoeur, Luckner Lazard and many others. Aside from painting, Wah's other interests included acting, which he took up as a side job to his artistic career. In 1963, Wah decided to found a cultural center \\"Calfou\\", also in Port-au-Prince, as a means of allowing people to experience Haitian culture, notably the arts and music. During that same year, he and his brother were commissioned by the Haitian government to restore the murals in the bicentennial section of the city, which encompassed certain other cultural centers and public buildings in the capital. Legacy In 1971, during the peak of the Duvalier regime, Wah emigrated to the United States, relocating to Philadelphia where he would reside for the next thirteen years. On one of many visits to his homeland, Edouard King Fong Wah died on September 27, 2003 in his beloved country of Haiti. He is survived by two daughters and two sons.

Life Lleweni hall, the family seat Salusbury was born in March 1612, the eldest son of Sir Henry Salusbury of Lleweni, the first of the Salusbury Baronets. After spending some time at Jesus College, Oxford without taking a degree, he entered the Inner Temple in November 1631 but left in July 1632 on the death of his father to take control of the family estate at Lleweni Hall, Denbighshire. He was a member of the commission of the peace for Flintshire and Denbighshire, Wales and was elected to the common council of the Denbigh corporation in 1632. He was MP for Denbighshire in the Short Parliament of 1640, but said little; his relative Sir Thomas Myddleton succeeded him in the Long Parliament. During the English Civil War he was on the side of Charles I, becoming colonel of a royalist regiment from north Wales. His efforts on behalf of the King led to the House of Commons calling him a traitor. He fought at the Battle of Edgehill and was awarded an honorary DCL Oxford degree by the King a few days later. He fell ill at Worcester and died, being buried in the family vault at Whitchurch on 13 July 1643. Poetry Salusbury was regarded as a noted poet, but only The History of Joseph was published when he was alive (in 1636), although there are manuscripts of other poems and dramatic works. Anthony Wood (1632‚Äì1695) wrote that \\"having a natural geny to poetry and romance\\", he became \\"a most noted poet of his time\\"; cites Wood's Athen√¶ Oxon. iii. 55‚Äì9 but his only known production is The History of Joseph (London, 1636, 4to), \\"a very rare poem\\" and a \\"scarce volume\\", dedicated to Lady Myddelton or Middleton, fourth wife and widow of the author's grandfather, Sir Thomas Myddelton, as an acknowledgment of her care for him in his youth. Among the commendatory verses printed at the beginning are some by two kinsmen of the author (John Salusbury senior and junior respectively), the latter most probably being of Bachegraig, Flintshire, and an ancestor of Mrs. Piozzi. Family He was survived by wife, Hester (daughter of Sir Edward Tyrrell of Thornton, Buckinghamshire), by his sons, the 3rd Baronet Thomas, the 4th and last Baronet John and a daughter, Hester, who married Sir Robert Cotton.

It was first presented in at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, on 19 August 1938, a few months before Yeats' death. Story It tells a family saga of decline and fall through its two remaining members: an Old Man (the father) and a Boy (his sixteen-year-old son). It is set outside the former family home, which the Old Man's father had drunkenly burned down, leading him to kill his father as the building perished. The Boy is skeptical about tales of his family's former grandeur, and is repelled by the Old Man's story of losing his own mother as she gave birth to him, and the decline subsequent events wrought on the family. Tonight, the Old Man tells the Boy, is the anniversary of his mother's wedding night. This was the night on which he was conceived after a bout of drunken carousing by his father, and thus when his mother's fate was sealed. At this point a ghostly figure appears illuminated in a window of the wrecked house. In an attempt to wrest his mother's soul from purgatory, he suddenly stabs and kills the Boy. However it appears to be in vain: approaching hoof beats of his ghostly father returning to the bridal bed signal that no spirits have left the place, and the grim cycle begins again... Background Yeats had been strongly influenced by Japanese Noh theatre in the later years of his life (via Ezra Pound), and Yeats' use of the spirits of the Old Man's parents as a metaphor for the family's decline and of death and rebirth is Noh's clearest influence on the drama. Similarly, the sparseness of the setting, the use of only two characters and the play's relative brevity (conventionally lasting well under an hour) are more immediate influences. However the story itself affected Yeats even more profoundly. As he wrote Purgatory he admitted in a letter that the scenario troubled him: > I have a one-act play in my head, a scene of tragic intensity... I am so > afraid of that dream. My recent work has greater strangeness and I think > greater intensity than anything I have done. I never remember the dream so > deep.Quoted in liner notes for Lyrita recording of the one-act opera, > SRCD.313 Critical reception Always seen as a grim tale, Purgatory received (and continues to receive) mixed responses. Several criticshttp://www.ibiblio.org/sally/Purgatory_notes.html ignore the Noh influence and see in the Old Man's murder of the Boy an exercise in eugenics and as such perceive the conclusion as somewhat tendentious. T. S. Eliot took a similar line, attacking the play's title from a Christian perspective, arguing that murder does not sit with any notion of purgation. Operas Gordon Crosse The English composer Gordon Crosse set Yeats' drama as a one-act opera. Premi√®red at the 1966 Cheltenham International Festival, it includes virtually all of Yeats' original text. It also retains the minimalism of the play, and the spiritual element, but Crosse avoids using Japanese musical motifs associated with Noh, unlike Benjamin Britten, whose contemporaneous parables beginning with Curlew River are more obviously musically inspired by Noh. Two additional operatic settings include one by Hugo Weisgall written in 1958, and Mark Lanz Weiser's setting (1990) premi√®ring at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore in 1991.http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-16/features/1991259173_1_purgatory- weiser-buddhttp://peabodyopera.org/newop/nonetudes/ Ed Di Lello Ed Di Lello composed, orchestrated, conducted and staged Purgatory as an opera on a double bill with Yeats' The Cat and the Moon produced by Philip Meister and Maurice Edwards at The Cubiculo in New York City in March 1974.

It was the second of \\"three dog-revues\\" (so called because they all have \\"dog\\" in their name). The first one being Gr√∂na Hund (Green Dog) and the third and last one was Svea hund.  Overview  The show also starred Monica Zetterlund, Birgitta Andersson, Lissi Alandh, Sonya Hedenbratt, G√∂sta Ekman, Mille Schmidt, Stefan B√∂hm, Arild Eriksen, Gals and Pals and Gunnar Svenssons kvartett. The show was built up by sketches and songs, often with satirical humour. Among the more famous sketches are Flykten fr√•n √Ölderdomshemmet (The escape from the Old Folks Home) in which Hans Alfredsson played a senile old man, the \\"Pitt\\" number, where Birgitta Andersson took her husband, played by G√∂sta Ekman, to the doctor because he couldn't stop saying the word pitt (Swedish slang for penis) and the Mahatma Ekman number, in which G√∂sta Ekman portrayed a kind of guru who claimed that we \\"have to be friends with the things\\" only to have every object on stage work against him in a slapstick number. The show also contained a number between Tage Danielsson and Lissi Alandh called I Friska Naturn (In The Healthy Nature) also known as Nature Morte. Dressed in 18th-century style clothing they sing a song about a picnic they have in the nature who has been destroyed by toxic and different kinds of pollution, among them a Nuclear Powerplant. Later in his life, Tage would become a spokesperson against pollution in general and Nuclear Power in particular.

He was married 7 November 1641 in Norrk√∂ping to Maria Hansdotter (buried 2 March 1684 in Norrk√∂ping). Their son was the tradesman in Norrk√∂ping, Lorents Hultman (ca 1660-1702), who first was married 6 December 1685 in Norrk√∂ping to Johanna Br√∂ms (born 15 January 1668, dead 19 March 1696), and then married ca 1698 to Margareta Karlsdotter (born 18 January 1680 in Norrk√∂ping, dead 2 January 1753 in Stockholm. In his first marriage, he had the son Johan Hultman (born 8 November 1690 in Norrk√∂ping, dead 26 July 1729 at Forsmark in Forsmark), who was a rittmeister and was ennobled 20 December 1719 in Stockholm by Queen Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden, together with his so-called \\"brother-in-law\\" (actually his cousin by marriage) Leonhard Keijser (see below). They were introduced at Riddarhuset 1720 as noble family number 1707. Johan Hultman, ennobled Adelsw√§rd's wife Altea Silfverstr√∂m (1700-1765), was daughter of Johan Silfverstr√∂m (1660-1710) and Altea de Besche (born 1670), who in turn was daughter of Georg de Besche, ennobled de Besche (1641-1711) and Althea Bothler (1646-1704) (see below). Johan Hultman's (ennobled Adelsw√§rd) son with Altea Silfverstr√∂m, the titular governor Johan Adelsw√§rd (1718-1785) was created a Swedish Baron 1770, and is the first member of the Baronial family Adelsw√§rd. Leonard Hultman's son in his second marriage, Karl Hultman, was ennobled Carlsk√∂ld. The second line, called the Keijser line, is descended from the rittmeister Leonhard Keijser (born 1687 in Karlstad, dead 24 January 1756 at L√§ns√∂, B√∂rstil, Uppland), who was ennobled, as mentioned above, with Johan Hultman 20 December 1719.

The system comprises an eclipsing B-type subdwarf star and red dwarf star. The two stars orbit each other every 0.116795 days.  Eclipse timing variations  Based on variations in the timing of the system's eclipses, in 2008 it was claimed that two giant planets were in orbit around the binary: one with a masses of 8.47 and 19.2 times the mass of Jupiter orbiting with periods of 9.1 and 15.8 years respectively. The proposed system was later shown to be extremely unstable, with mean lifetimes less than 1000 years in the parameter space allowed by the uncertainties in the data. An alternate, dynamically-stable orbital solution was proposed with a 14.3 Jupiter mass object on a 12-year orbit and an outer companion of 65 Jupiter masses on a 55-year orbit, however it has been noted that the outer companion's orbital parameters are highly unconstrained, again casting doubt on the reality of this model. The problems with modelling this system and the proposed planets orbiting several other post-common envelope binaries has led to the suggestion that the eclipse timing variations used to infer the existence of planets has a non-planetary origin.

(Original description) The shell has a flesh-white color. The acuminate spire has a dark brown apex. The shell contains 10 whorls. The first two are polished, vitreous and convex. The others are rather convex, keeled above and flattened sloping downwards. The large body whorl is somewhat inflated and contracted towards the base. It contains about 12 strong furrows, longitudinally striated. The dark aperture is ample. The oblique columella is brownish, curved in the middle. The short siphonal canal is slightly curved. This species is remarkable for the tabulated whorls, the tabulations being very strongly radiately striated, and sometimes furnished with a spiral liration, and the conspicuous sulcations encircling the body whorl. The slit in the lip is situated just below the broad furrow which grooves the upper part of the whorls.

In September 2010, the project was scrapped. In 2015, Under the Administration of the new Prime Minister, Dr. Rowley, the project was reinitiated. However, in 2016, the project was scrapped again due to falling oil prices affecting the economy of Trinidad and Tobago.

He is sometimes associated with the Indianist movement in American music. Life Kelley was of New England stock, his ancestors having come to America from England before 1650. He himself was born in Sparta, Wisconsin. His mother was from a musical family, and herself was skilled in music; she became his first teacher. Kelley's own college career was interrupted by bouts of poor health. He was a talented artist and writer, but he decided to devote his life to music after a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's music for A Midsummer Night's Dream. Consequently, he traveled to Chicago at 17, there to study with Clarence Eddy and Napoleon Ledochowski. Two years later he went to Stuttgart, where he studied organ, piano, and composition. His teachers there were Frederich Finck, Wilhelm Kr√ºger, Wilhelm Speidel, and Max Seifriz. His friendship with Edward MacDowell began in Stuttgart, and later Kelley worked at the MacDowell Colony. Kelley graduated from the conservatory in Stuttgart in 1880, and performed around Europe for a time with a number of orchestras. Upon his return to the United States, he came west to San Francisco, where he worked as a church organist and was a music critic for the Examiner. He also became active as a composer, writing incidental music for a production of Macbeth that garnered him much attention. An interest in theater drew him to New York City in 1886, and there he married Jessie Gregg on July 23, 1891; the two then returned to California for four more years, during which time Kelley composed, conducted, lectured, and taught. In 1896 the couple returned to New York, where Edgar was hired to conduct an operetta company. He also taught, at the New York College of Music and New York University, and in 1901 replaced Horatio Parker for a year at Yale when the latter went on sabbatical. The following year saw the Kelleys move to Berlin, and for eight years they lived and worked in Europe, lecturing, teaching, conducting, and performing in an attempt to expand European interest in American music. Kelley, though, wished to spend more time composing, and in 1910 took a post at the Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio, where he remained until his death. While at Western, Kelley became a faculty-level member in Miami University's chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia. Kelley and his wife divided their time between the Western College and the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music; Kelley taught composition there, and later served as dean of the Department of Composition and Orchestration. Among his pupils was C. Hugo Grimm, who would himself later lead the department. His wife lectured there as well. The couple retired in 1934 but continued to travel while maintaining a house in Oxford. Kelley died in Oxford in 1944, and was buried in the Oxford Cemetery.Edgar Stillman Kelley, FindAGrave The Kelley's grave in Oxford Cemetery. Music Kelley was a Romanticist in the vein of Horatio Parker, George Whitefield Chadwick, and Arthur Foote, and brought much of his German training to bear in his compositions. Even so, he was always interested in bringing non-Western influences into his work. For his orchestral suite Aladdin, one of his early successes, he studied the music he heard in San Francisco's Chinatown, and used oboes, muted trumpets, and mandolins to imitate Chinese instruments. His New England Symphony is based on themes found in bird songs (the andante portion), as well as American Indian and Puritan music. For incidental music to a New York production of Ben-Hur in 1899, he based his composition on Greek modes. This music was to go on to become his most popular work; it is said to have been performed some five thousand times in English-speaking countries by 1930. Kelley's best-known composition was an oratorio, The Pilgrim's Progress, composed on a text by Elizabeth Hodgkinson and based on the eponymous text by John Bunyan. It was first performed in Cincinnati in 1918, and was frequently revived thereafter, both in the United States and in England. He also wrote program music, including orchestral suites after both \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\" and Alice in Wonderland; his first symphony was based on Gulliver's Travels, and depicted Lemuel Gulliver's adventures in Lilliput. His output also included numerous pieces of chamber music. Kelley had very definite ideas about American music and its creation, and was not shy about sharing them. Expressing his views, he once wrote that > the American composer should apply the universal principles of his art to > the local and special elements of the subject-matter as they appeal to him, > and then, consciously or unconsciously, manifest his individuality, which > will involve the expression of mental traits and moral tendencies peculiar > to his European ancestry, as we find them modified by the new American > environment.Source unknown, quoted in Howard, p. 467 A good deal of Kelley's music was published by Arthur Farwell's Wa-Wan Press in the early years of the twentieth century. Other work In addition to his work as a composer, Kelley was active as a writer on music, continuing after his early experience with the Examiner in San Francisco. Included in his output were a number of books, including Chopin the Composer and a work on Beethoven. His important article \\"The Bach-Schumann Suites for Cello\\" appears in Music: A Monthly Magazine for November 1892, 612-19; he owned a unique copy of the six suites (now lost?). The most notable of his composition pupils was Wallingford Riegger; among his other students were Frederick Ayres, Joseph W. Clokey, James G. Heller, Rupert Hughes, W. Otto Miessner and Alexander Russell. Miami University maintains an archive devoted to Kelley and his wife; it contains correspondence, music manuscripts, books, and other material related to the composer's life and career. In addition, his house and studio, built in 1916, remains on the Miami University campus, and is made available for the use of incoming faculty and administration. Recordings Little of Kelley's music has been committed to disc. The Aladdin fantasy for orchestra has been recorded as part of an anthology of American orchestral music, and pianist Brian Kovach has recorded his complete output of piano music; both recordings were released by Albany Records. Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra recorded The Red Queen's Banquet from Kelley's 'Alice in Wonderland' Suite on an acoustic 78rpm disc in 1924. It was unissued at the time but has finally been released on a CD along with other Stokowski acoustic 78s by 'Pristine Audio' (PASC 471).  Legacy  Plaque in the lobby of current day Presser Hall marking Kelley's namesake of the former auditorium. The former auditorium in Presser Hall at Western College for Women was named in honor of Kelley and his wife.

Its products include the Sebenza, Inkosi, Umnumzaan, TiLock, Mnandi folding knives, Impinda slip joint, and the Green Beret, Pacific, Professional Soldier, Nyala, and Sikayo fixed blade knives. Chris Reeve Knives' industry contributions include the Integral Lock, contributions to the blade steel CPM S35VN, and has won Blade Magazine's Blade Show Manufacturing Quality Award 15 times. Their motto is Think Twice, Cut Once. History Chris Reeve Knives was founded as a sole proprietorship in January 1984, with Chris Reeve making custom knives in the single garage attached to the house in which Reeve was living in Durban, South Africa. In March 1989, Reeve and his partner Anne Reeve immigrated to the United States, and CRK commenced manufacturing in Boise, ID. In July 1993, Chris Reeve Knives, sole proprietorship, became Reeve Incorporated, doing business as Chris Reeve Knives. Reeve collaborated with Dick Barber of Crucible Materials Corporation to develop CPM S30V steel as a knifemaking steel in 2003. Chris Reeve Knives has collaborated with William Harsey Jr. on several fixed blade knife projects, and serves as the manufacturer of these knives. Products CRK Model Mark IV, the 1st production knife of the One Piece range of knives, circa 1983 An example of a small Classic Sebenza with Mammoth Ivory inlays. Knife is resting on a CRK leather slip case. Three Sebenzas: Large Regular with ATS-34 Steel blade and a Large and Small Regulars featuring Damascus steel blades with manually engraved and anodized handles *One Piece Range: production 1983‚Äì2009. Fixed blade family of knives, featuring a hollow handle and blade manufactured from one continuous piece of A2 tool steel. Model families include the Sable (sabre style blade), Shadow (spear point blade), Mountaineer (single guard clip point blade), Ubejane (Skinner), and Mark (double guard clip point blade). Models possess blade lengths ranging from 10.2 to 22.9 cm (4\\" to 9\\"). After nearly three decades of production, the One Piece Range was retired due to both the expense of manufacture, and to make room in the CRK portfolio for new designs. *Sebenza: production 1991‚Äìpresent. Folding knife, introducing a stronger variation of the Walker linerlock called the Sebenza Integral Lock, also commonly known as the framelock. The Sebenza is a utility knife with titanium handles and was originally introduced with an ATS-34 stainless steel blade, followed by BG-42 and CPM S30V, and as of this writing, CPM S35VN steel. The Sebenza comes in two sizes, Large (blade length 3.625\\"/92mm) and Small (blade length of 2.94\\" or 75mm). There have been multiple iterations of the Sebenza over the years. H (for Handmade) was the first, followed by P (for Production), followed by Original (P plus pocket clip). After the Original the Regular was introduced with scalloping on the handle and a different blade profile. The Classic/MM (engraved Classic MM on the reverse) was introduced in 2000 to run in parallel with the Regular. In 2008 the Classic and Regular models were discontinued to make way for the Sebenza 21. This had the Classic's blade shape with some minor handle changes. *Sebenza 25: Released in 2012, the Sebenza 25. The Sebenza 25 is named for the 25th year of the Sebenza and has technological improvements of a ceramic ball lockbar interface, larger pivot and what they call the 'large hollow grind'. Additionally the Sebenza 25 has a thicker blade stock of 0.14\\" compared to 0.125\\" of the Large Sebenza 21. *Umfaan: production 1997‚Äì2002. Folding knife similar in design to that of the Sebenza, but with a blade length of 58.42 mm (2.3\\"). *Mnandi: production 2001 ‚Äì present. Folding knife utilizing an Integral Lock, partially covered by a cosmetic inlay, focused at the businessperson. The Mnandi blade length is 69.5 mm (2.75\\") and like the sebenza can also be had in Damascus Steel. *Green Beret: production 2002 ‚Äì present. Fixed blade knife designed in collaboration with William Harsey Jr., featuring single row serrations and a CPM S30V stainless steel spearpoint blade, offered in 139 mm and 177 mm (5.5\\" and 7\\") blade lengths. A version of this knife with special engraving and serialization on the blade, known as the Yarborough (named for Lieutenant General William P. Yarborough), is presented to every graduate of the United States Army Special Forces Q Course. *Neil Roberts Warrior: production 2004 ‚Äì present. Fixed blade knife designed in collaboration with William Harsey, with 152.4 mm (6\\"), CPM S30V stainless steel recurve spearpoint blade. This knife is dedicated to Mr. Roberts, the first U.S. Navy SEAL killed in Afghanistan. *Inyoni: production 2005 ‚Äì 2015. Fixed blade bird and fish knife with 88.9 mm (3.5\\"), CPM S30V stainless steel double row (Kubuli) serrated blade. *Pacific : production 2007 ‚Äì present. Fixed blade knife designed in collaboration with William Harsey, with double row (Kubuli) serrations and 152.4 mm (6\\") CPM S30V stainless steel clip point blade. The Pacific is the civilian version of the \\"1st Group Knife\\", denoted by special engraving on the knife blade. The 1st Group Knife was designed and is manufactured at the request of the U.S. Army Special Forces 1st Group to commemorate their 50th anniversary of operations. The 1st Group Knife may only be purchased by active or retired 1st Group soldiers. *Professional Soldier: production 2008 ‚Äì 2017. Fixed blade knife designed in collaboration with William Harsey, with 86 mm (3.375\\") CPM S30V stainless steel with choice of spearpoint, insingo, or tanto blade, and cut- out in handle for use as a shackle wrench. *Umnumzaan: production 2008 ‚Äì present. Folding knife, with 2nd generation Integral Lock. The Umnumzaan is a utility knife with titanium handle slabs and 93.4 mm (3.675\\") CPM S30V stainless steel blade.\\" It also features a glass breaker that is exposed when the knife is closed. *Sikayo Range: production 2009 - present. A range of chef's knives, the Sikayo is available in both 6.5\\" and 9.0\\" blade lengths. Sikayo blades are made with CPM S35V stainless steel, and are ground on one side only. The name Sikayo is the Zulu word for \\"sharp\\". * Nyala: Production 2010‚Äì2020. The Nyala is a modern version of the classic skinning knife. The integral handle and blade of CPM S35VN is possesses spiral and lineal grooves in the micarta handle providing incremental positive grip, and serrations on the spine are provided for enhanced control. The Nyala blade length is 3.75\\". * Ti-Lock: Production 2010‚Äì2017. The Ti-Lock is a folding knife featuring a new locking mechanism by the same name. The Ti-Lock mechanism was conceived as a means to isolate the lock from the body of the knife, in order to allow more design freedom for handle and frame. It is completely ambidextrous, allowing equal left and right hand use. The Ti-Lock was a collaborative development by Grant and Gavin Hawk, and Chris Reeve. * Inkosi: Production 2015‚Äìpresent. Known as the \\"Chief\\" in Zulu, the Inkosi features a large hollow grind, twin oversized washers, a strengthened pivot and sturdy lock up. While challenging the standards of the Integral Lock¬Æ, the Inkosi uses a ceramic ball as an interface for the lock bar to the blade tang for a consistent lock-up. The washer diameter is wider than the blade securing zero sideways play. With larger lubrication holes there is even less surface area of friction. Finally, the large hollow grind provides a shallow radius, for improved strength, making it halfway between a flat grind and our standard hollow grind. *Impinda: Production 2018‚Äìpresent. Known as ‚ÄúFold, Repeat‚Äù in Zulu, the Impinda is a non-locking slipjoint style knife designed by William Harsey Jr. and manufactured by Chris Reeve Knives. There is a unique cam-action to the backspring which means the knife is harder to close than it is to open, making it fundamentally more safe than traditional slipjoints. It has titanium scales and CPM S35VN blade and backspring. This is the first time S35VN has been used for a spring. This model was announced at BLADE Show 2018.

Biography Family life Eenens was the son of a wealthy merchant in textiles, Louis Eenens, and Anne- Marie Carlier. He was born in Brussels when Belgium was annexed to the French Empire, and the French Republican Calendar was still in force, and his birthday is therefore properly 10 messidor An XIII. He married Ad√©la√Øde Barbe Joseph Gilain in Tienen on 8 August 1869. They had one daughter, Th√©r√®se Marie Euphrasie Jos√®phe, who married a future procureur-g√©n√©ral at the Belgian Supreme Court, Georges-Marie Viscount Terlinden. and Military and political career He was admitted to the Artillerie- en Genieschool (Artillery and Engineering School) of the army of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in Delft on 15 July 1825 as a cadet. On 20 November 1828, he was promoted to sergeant-major and allowed to study at the Royal Military Academy in Breda. He was promoted to the second lieutenant in the artillery and assigned to the 5th battalion Militia Artillery at Namur on 5 January 1830, on the eve of the Belgian Revolution. Eenens joined the revolutionaries by taking part in a mutiny of the Namur garrison in September 1830. As a reward, he was breveted lieutenant by the Belgian Provisional Government and soon after promoted to captain. Stationed in Antwerp, he refused to defect to the Dutch with General Van der Smissen on 25 March 1831. He then joined the Belgian troops at Leuven and helped to defend that city in August. In 1834 he killed another Belgian captain in a duel on the battlefield of Waterloo. He was acquitted by the court martial because Belgium at that time did not have a law against duelling. (1835) Histoire des duels anciens et modernes, p. 59 That same year he tried to resign his commission but was not allowed to, because he had promised to serve ten years after his admission to the Royal military academy. In 1839, at the suggestion of King Leopold I of Belgium, he took a leave of absence to act as an observer in Egypt. He explored commercial possibilities for Belgium and visited Ethiopia (then known as \\"Abyssinia\\") together with the Belgian consul in Alexandria to try to establish a Belgian colonial outpost on the west coast of the Red Sea. However, illness forced him to return to Belgium in December 1840. He was promoted to major in 1842 and to lieutenant- colonel in 1845. Then in 1846, he tried to go into politics as a Liberal Party representative. As this was an oppositional party, the king put him on non- active status. He was elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives on 8 June 1847, but a new law prohibiting military officers to sit in parliament forced him to give up his seat in May 1848. He then re-entered active duty. Eenens was promoted to colonel on 24 June 1853 and put in charge of an artillery regiment in Tournai. On 8 May 1859, he was promoted to major-general and given the command of the First Artillery Brigade. He also became a member of the Munitions Committee and other advisory commissions. On 24 June 1866, he was promoted to lieutenant-general and Inspector-general of the Belgian Artillery. On 15 July 1870, he was put in charge of the army at Antwerp where he became military governor (and at the same time aide de camp of King Leopold II of Belgium) on 6 October 1870. In view of the dangerous international situation (the Franco-Prussian War had just started), Eenens now pleaded for strengthening the Belgian defenses, but the Cabinet of prime minister Jules Malou opposed this, supported by the Catholic party of Charles Woeste. Disgusted, Eenens retired from active service on 18 May 1873. He remained aide de camp of the king, who conferred the Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold on him. Scholarly work Besides his military career, Eenens also pursued a more scholarly career. In the 1840s he promoted the involvement of the Belgian army in the agricultural development of the poorer parts of Belgium. In 1844 he published Notes sur le d√©frichement de la Campine par l'arm√©e, a pamphlet containing his proposals, but his ideas were rejected by the agricultural establishment. He also became a prolific writer on military history, specializing in the history of the Belgian Revolution. In 1875, he published Documents historiques sur l'origine du royaume de Belgique. Les conspirations militaires de 1831 (Bruxelles, 1875, 2 vols.), which caused quite a furore because he accused a number of prominent people of treasonous behavior during the revolution, in favor of the Orangist cause. This caused a fervent polemic, both with Belgian politicians and historians and with Dutch military historians, because he also accused the future King William II of the Netherlands (then commander-in-chief of the Dutch forces that attempted to suppress the revolution of 1830) of violating an armistice. Because of the scandal this polemic caused, the king asked him to relent, and when he demurred, relieved him of his function as aide de camp. Eenens also became involved in the controversy about the accusations of cowardice the British military historian William Siborne had leveled at the Dutch-Belgian troops at the Battle of Waterloo in his 1844 book History of the War in France and Belgium in 1815. The Belgian general Renard had in 1855 already attempted a refutation (1855) Reponse aux Allegations Anglaises sur la Conduite des Troupes Belges en 1815 (Bruxelles, 1855) as had the Dutch general Willem Jan Knoop in 1846. Eenens published his own \\"Dissertation sur la participation des troupes des Pays-Bas √† la campagne de 1815 en Belgique\\" in: Societ√© royale des beaux arts et de lit√©rature de Gand, Messager des Sciences Historiques, (1879), pp. 159-161 in 1879. This critical assessment of Siborne's work is still relevant. Eenens died in Schaarbeek on 9 January 1883.

History  Aerial view of the headland, with Ponui Island, Pakihi Island, and Karamuramu Island visible off the coast The park was created in 1995 after the sale of the land by the Duder family to the Auckland Regional Council.Duder - Auckland Regional Council Duder's Beach / Umupuia - Pohutukawa Coast Prior to the sale the land had been farmed by descendants of Thomas Duder for about 130 years. The land was purchased in 1866 from the original Maori owners Ngai Tai. NgƒÅi Tai association with the Whakakaiwhara Peninsula begins with the visit of the Tainui canoe in the 1300s. The Tainui moored in the shelter of the Peninsula from a storm while it was travelling up east coast of Aotearoa, having arrived from Hawaiiki. The crew went ashore and ate fruit from the forest on the Peninsula. This is the origin of the name Whakakaiwhara, which means to eat (kai) the edible bracts (whara) of the kiekie vine. The place where the canoe moored is known as ‚ÄòTe Tauranga ≈ç Tainui‚Äô or ‚ÄòThe Anchorage of Tainui‚Äô. While the Tainui canoe was moored there, a crew member called TƒÅne Whakatia planted a karaka berry on the point of the Peninsula. It grew into a tree known as ‚ÄòHuna ƒÅ TƒÅne‚Äô or the ‚ÄòTree of TƒÅne‚Äô. Though this tree no longer exists, its descendants today are the impressive karaka trees on the Peninsula.  Early occupation  After leaving the Whakakaiwhara Peninsula, the Tainui canoe travelled west to the Tamaki River. It was then carried across the portage from the Waitemata to the Manukau Harbour and eventually continued down to Kawhia. Several crew members left the canoe in the Tamaki area and settled there. Later, some of their descendants built kƒÅinga (villages) and pƒÅ (fortifications) beside the Wairoa River and on the Whakakaiwhara Peninsula. These people became known as NgƒÅti Tai, taking their name from the ancestor Taihaua and the Tainui canoe. NgƒÅti Tai was part of a wider tribal grouping known as NgƒÅoho, which unified all the people of Tainui descent in the region. An extra 13.7 ha was added in 2010 to prevent coast development obstructing views from the park. A view from Duder Regional Park  Description  The park is a working farm bounded to the west by Duders Beach. It is situated on a headland and offers commanding views of the Hauraki Gulf. There is limited native bush as most of the land is grassed. There are no designated picnic areas and facilities are limited.

The reservation has a number of rare animal species that depend on the conditions of these habitats; in 2004 The Boston Globe said that the Wasque Reservation is \\"a great place for fishing and birdwatching\\". Observers can spot blue herons, egrets, ducks, and migrating shorebirds that can be found in the marshes. Ospreys can be seen swooping down to pluck fish from the Atlantic Ocean. Butterfly watchers can see monarchs, sulphur butterflies, and red admirals that stop here to drink nectar from wildflowers before continuing their southward migration. History Algonquian people camped at this site in warm weather; the name is said to come from wannasque, an Algonquian word meaning \\"the ending\\". European settlement came to this part of Chappaquiddick Island in 1750 or later. Several 19th century land speculation proposals never came to fruition. \\"Chappaquiddick-by-the-Sea,\\" one failed concept for land development, would have included a grid of 750 quarter-acre parcels, broad avenues, public parks, and yacht facilities.

A ferry from Edgartown on the Vineyard allows one to get to Chappaquiddick. The property is open 24 hours a day all year. Due to severe beach erosion at Wasque Point, one is no longer allowed to take vehicles over the sand to Wasque from adjacent Cape Poge Wildlife Refuge. Formerly this was allowed except for occasional summer closures to protect the nest sites of rare shorebirds. Wasque is a great place for recreational fishing.

During World War I she was requisitioned by the United States Navy and commissioned as USS Pennsylvanian (ID-3511) in September 1918, and renamed two months later to USS Scranton. After her naval service, her original name of Pennsylvanian was restored. Pennsylvanian was built by the Maryland Steel Company as one of eight sister ships for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, and was employed in inter-coastal service via the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Panama Canal after it opened. Pennsylvanian was one of the first two steamships to travel eastbound through the canal when it opened in August 1914. During World War I, as both SS Pennsylvanian and USS Scranton, the ship carried cargo and animals to France, and returned American troops after the Armistice in 1918. After her naval service ended in 1919, she was returned to her original owners and resumed relatively uneventful cargo service over the next twenty years. Early in World War II, the ship was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration, and shipped cargo on New York ‚Äì Caribbean routes and transatlantic routes. In mid- July 1944, Pennsylvanian was scuttled as part of the breakwater for one of the Mulberry artificial harbors built to support the Normandy Invasion.  Design and construction  In September 1911, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for four new cargo ships‚Äî, , , and Pennsylvanian.Maryland Steel had built three ships‚Äî, Georgian, and Honolulan‚Äîfor American-Hawaiian in 1909 in what proved to be a satisfactory arrangement for both companies. The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, with a maximum cost of $640,000 each. The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan that called for a 5% down payment in cash with nine monthly installments for the balance. Provisions of the deal allowed that some of the nine installments could be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of Pennsylvanian, including financing costs, was $70.35 per deadweight ton, which came out to just under $716,000. Pennsylvanian (Maryland Steel yard no. 127) was the final ship built under the original contract.Further contracts on similar terms were signed in November 1911 and May 1912 to build four additional ships: , , , . See: Cochran and Ginger, p. 358, and Colton. She was launched on 29 March 1913, and delivered to American-Hawaiian in June. Pennsylvanian was , and was in length and abeam. She had a deadweight tonnage of and a storage capacity of . Pennsylvanian had a single quadruple expansion steam engine powered by oil-fired boilers that drove a single screw propeller. It could propel the ship at a speed of . The engine had cylinders of 25¬Ω inches (65 cm), , 53¬Ω inches (136 cm) and diameter by stroke. It was built by the Maryland Steel Company, Sparrows Point, Maryland.  Early career  When Pennsylvanian began sailing for American- Hawaiian, the company shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports‚ÄîSalina Cruz, Oaxaca, for eastbound cargo, and Coatzacoalcos for westbound cargo‚Äîand would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway.Hovey, p. 78. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature.Cochran and Ginger, p. 355‚Äì56. Pennsylvanian sailed in this service on the west side of North America. After the United States occupation of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, coupled with the fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return in late April to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan.Cochran and Ginger, p. 360. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route. Pennsylvanian, on the west side of the canal when it opened, was one of the first two eastbound steamers to traverse the canal during her trip to New York.Though the canal transit was part of an eastbound journey, the actual compass heading of the passage through the canal is actually closer to north.The Luckenbach Line ship Pleiades was the other steamship to make the eastbound transit of the canal at the same time. Contemporary sources refer to the pair as the first two, making no distinction between which was first. See: Also see: In late August, American-Hawaiian announced that Pennsylvanian would sail on a San Francisco ‚Äì Panama Canal ‚Äì Boston route, sailing opposite of , Honolulan, and sister ship Washingtonian. When landslides closed the canal in October 1915, all American-Hawaiian ships, including Pennsylvanian, returned to the Straits of Magellan route again.Cochran and Ginger, p. 361. Pennsylvanians exact movements during 1916 and 1917 are unclear. She may have been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service. She may also have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, cocoa, rubber, and manganese ore.Cochran and Ginger, p. 362. However, when the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the entire American-Hawaiian fleet, including Pennsylvanian, was requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board (USSB), which then returned the ships for operation by American- Hawaiian.Cochran and Ginger, p. 363.  U.S. Navy service  On 13 September 1918, Pennsylvanian was transferred to the U.S. Navy at New York and commissioned USS Pennsylvanian (ID-3511) the same day. Assigned to the Navy's Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS), Pennsylvanian loaded a general cargo and sailed for Brest, France, on 30 September. She arrived there on 15 October and sailed for La Pallice the next day, where she unloaded her cargo before departing for New York on 5 November. launch from Scranton. Three of Scrantons men in the launch died when it capsized after this photograph was taken. Arriving at New York on 15 November, four days after the Armistice, Pennsylvanian was refitted as an animal transport ship, which, among other things, required the building of ramps and stalls for the animals. Sometime in November, probably during her refit, she was renamed USS Scranton, becoming the first U.S. Navy ship named in honor of the Pennsylvania city. Scranton sailed for France on 12 December, arriving at Saint-Nazaire on 29 December, and returning to New York on 29 January 1919. On 5 February, Scranton was transferred from the NOTS to the Navy's Cruiser and Transport Force, and began conversion to a troop transport to carry American personnel home from France. While sailing to France to begin her first troop-carrying duties in late March, Scranton suffered damage to her rudder and was disabled east of New York. Navy transport responded to Scrantons distress call, and attempted to take Scranton under tow. During the day on 28 March, Scranton attempted to run a towline to El Sol by sending a launch in the rolling seas, but it capsized, drowning three men. El Sol stood by Scranton for over 40 hours until minesweeper arrived and took Scranton under tow. Penguin and Scranton arrived in New York on 3 April, where Scranton entered drydock to undergo repairs. Pennsylvanian delivered 325 tons of steel parts for the Hale Telescope then under construction at Palomar Observatory outside of San Diego. After repairs, Scranton made three roundtrips to France and carried some 6,000 troops and passengers home to the United States before she was decommissioned on 19 July. The ship was handed over to the USSB for return to American-Hawaiian, who restored her original name.  Interwar years  Pennsylvanian resumed cargo service with American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Though the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time, Pennsylvanian continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal in a relatively uneventful career. One incident of note occurred on 28 November 1930, when Pennsylvanian hit a Southern Pacific ferry near Goat Island (present-day Yerba Buena Island) in a dense fog in San Francisco Bay. Pennsylvanian hit the stern of the ferry and caused damage to the ferry's superstructure and destroyed about of the ferry's railing. No one on either ship was injured. Other hints of Pennsylvanians activities throughout the rest of her career can be found from contemporary newspaper reports. In October 1929, the Los Angeles Times reported on a shipment that included 2,500 to 3,000 radio sets among Pennsylvanians of cargo. In March 1938, The Christian Science Monitor reported that Pennsylvanians captain, C. M. Bamforth, had temporarily turned the deck of the cargo ship into a boatyard to build a catboat for his son in Swampscott, Massachusetts. Bamforth laid the keel while in San Francisco, bought copper rivets for the hull planking in Portland, Oregon, and began painting the boat after Pennsylvanian had traversed the Panama Canal. He expected to have the boat finished when Pennsylvanian arrived in Boston on 22 April. Damage to the Omaha Beach Mulberry harbor from the 19‚Äì22 June 1944 storm. SS Pennsylvanian was one of several ships scuttled about a month later to help form a breakwater to shelter the harbor. In October the same year, Pennsylvanian delivered of steel parts for the Hale Telescope then under construction at the Palomar Observatory outside San Diego. The ship had picked up the $375,000 cargo in Philadelphia before sailing for San Diego.  World War II  At some point after the United States entered World War II, Pennsylvanian was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration (WSA), and, as with her pre-U.S. Navy service in World War I, she continued to be operated by American-Hawaiian. From July to September 1942, Pennsylvanian sailed between New York and Caribbean ports, calling at Trinidad, Key West, Hampton Roads, Guant√°namo Bay, and Crist√≥bal. In January 1943, Pennsylvanian called at Bandar Abbas, Iran, on the Persian Gulf, and returned to Caribbean sailings again by March 1943. Between May and September 1943, Pennsylvanian made four transatlantic crossings between New York and Liverpool, making intermediate stops in Loch Ewe and Methil while in the United Kingdom. The cargo ship made two New York ‚Äì Guant√°namo Bay roundtrips between September and December before resuming transatlantic sailings. After two New York ‚Äì Liverpool roundtrips between late December 1943 and April 1944, Pennsylvanian left the United States for the final time on 19 May 1944, arriving in Liverpool on 2 June. She called at the British ports of Methil, Loch Ewe, Clyde, and Milford Haven in late June and early July, and, sailing from Barry in mid July, Pennsylvanian arrived at Saint-Laurent-sur- Mer, France. There she was scuttled as part of the breakwater for the Mulberry artificial harbor built to support the Normandy Invasion.The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (DANFS) and Radigan both give the scuttling date as 16 July. Arnold Hague's Ports Database has Pennsylvanian sailing from Clyde on that date, and lists Pennsylvanians arrival at Seine Bay on 20 July. In March 1945, the WSA offered a payment of $565,910 to American-Hawaiian for Pennsylvanian as part of a $7.2 million settlement for eleven requisitioned American-Hawaiian ships that had either been sunk, scuttled, or were to be retained by the government.

The reservation is close to the Quabbin Reservoir and is owned by the Trustees of Reservations. New England Forestry Foundation: North Quabbin Woods Trustees of Reservations: Bear's Den Name The property takes its name from a large black bear once shot here \\"though more romantic ‚Äì yet unsubstantiated ‚Äì stories exist\\" according to the Trustees of Reservations. Description The Middle Branch of the Swift River passes through the steep granite cliffs of Bear's Den reservation on its way to the Quabbin Reservoir. The gorge is 75' deep and rimmed with hemlock. This source says that the gorge is 100' feet deep but may be less reliable as it also misidentifies King's Phillip's War as an event of the 1700s rather than the 1600s At one point, a change in elevation creates a waterfall. According to one description: > So as you walk the 150 yard path from the road and bear left through the > jagged opening in the ridge, you have a limited sense of the waterfall being > there until you step through and into this amphitheater of Mother Nature. > Once inside, you sense an isolation from the rest of the world. It's a great > experience and unique for a location so close to the road. A short path leads from Neilson Road into the reservation and immediately splits into a leftward path towards the gorge and a rightward path leading to a small cave (the eponymous \\"Bear's Den\\") and a stream. These trail is less than one quarter mile of easy hiking.New England Waterfalls page on Bear's Den Falls The reservation is \\"a tranquil spot for hiking and picnicking.\\" Valley Viewpoint Seasonal hunting is allowed on the property subject to all state and local laws. Camping, fires, and unleashed dogs are prohibited. Swimming is discouraged. Bear's Den reservation is open from dusk until dawn. The property abuts watershed land and wetlands to the west connecting to the Quabbin Reservoir and owned by the Metropolitan District Commission. History Metacomet, sachem of the Wampanoag Indians and their war chief during King Philip's War, is believed to have met here with neighboring other Nipmuck chieftains in 1675 to plan attacks the nearby English towns of Deerfield, Hadley and Northampton (The official site of the Trustees of Reservations state this meeting as a fact, but other sources mentioned in the footnotes use less definitive language such as \\"Stories surround this location, such as Indian chieftains meeting and plotting attacks\\" () or that this place \\"is said to have been a meeting place for the local Native American tribes\\" implying that Metacomet's meeting here with fellow sachem might be more legendary than historical. see note). Much later, the falls provided waterpower for grist mills in the area as water was carried by a sluice box, through a channel cut in the eastern cliff, and onto an overshot water wheel. Trustees of Reservations first acquired the property through the 1968 bequest of Mrs. Grais Poole Burrage. In 1988, Mrs. Dorothy Fittz donated additional land.

Today, a number of these preserved specimens are kept in the Natural History Museum in London. In 1762 he published the second edition of his father's Flora Virginica exhibens Plantas. In 1763 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

The season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between April and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean‚Äîthe Bay of Bengal to the east of the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Sea to the west of India. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) releases unofficial advisories. An average of five tropical cyclones form in the North Indian Ocean every season with peaks in May and November. Cyclones occurring between the meridians 45¬∞E and 100¬∞E are included in the season by the IMD. Throughout the season, the IMD monitored ten depressions, three of which became cyclonic storms. The strongest storm of the year was Super Cyclonic Storm Gay. Crossing the Malay Peninsula into the Bay of Bengal on November 4, Gay became one of the most powerful systems on record in the basin, attaining an estimated pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46 inHg). Collectively, the storms were responsible for at least 1,785 fatalities, 1,445 of which were due to the disastrous flooding triggered by the July Cyclonic Storm, and more than $25 million in damage. __TOC__ Systems ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:50 left:20 Legend = columns:4 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/05/1989 till:01/12/1989 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/05/1989 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Depression/Deep_Depression id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Cyclonic_Storm id:ST value:rgb(0.80,1,1) legend:Severe_Cyclonic_Storm id:VS value:rgb(1,1,0.8) legend:Very_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm id:ES value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Extremely_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm id:SU value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Super_Cyclonic_Storm Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:23/05/1989 till:27/05/1989 color:ST text:BOB 01 (SCS) from:07/06/1989 till:13/06/1989 color:TD text:ARB 01 (D) from:12/06/1989 till:14/06/1989 color:TD text:BOB 02 (D) from:20/06/1989 till:21/06/1989 color:TD text:BOB 03 (D) from:22/07/1989 till:25/07/1989 color:TS text:BOB 04 (CS) barset:break from:16/08/1989 till:17/08/1989 color:TD text:BOB 05 (D) from:17/10/1989 till:18/10/1989 color:TD text:BOB 06 (D) from:04/11/1989 till:10/11/1989 color:SU text:Gay (SU) from:11/11/1989 till:11/11/1989 color:TD text:BOB 08 (D) from:17/11/1989 till:20/11/1989 color:TD text:BOB 09 (D) bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/05/1989 till:31/05/1989 text:May from:01/06/1989 till:01/07/1989 text:June from:01/07/1989 till:01/08/1989 text:July from:01/08/1989 till:01/09/1989 text:August from:01/09/1989 till:01/10/1989 text:September from:01/10/1989 till:01/11/1989 text:October from:01/11/1989 till:01/12/1989 text:November Severe Cyclonic Storm BOB 01/01B In mid-May, a monsoon trough situated over the Bay of Bengal began showing signs of cyclonic development. By May 20, synoptic data indicated the presence of a weak circulation; however, the system remained disorganized. Following a dramatic increase in convection and organization, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on May 23 and subsequently began monitoring the system as a tropical depression hours later. Initially, the depression tracked slowly towards the north-northwest before abruptly turning westward and slowing due to weak mid-level steering currents. During this time, the storm gradually intensified and was limited by northwesterly wind shear. By May 26, the storm turned northward and accelerated. Later that day, 01B attained its peak intensity with winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) shortly before making landfall in eastern India. The system quickly weakened once inland and was last noted on May 27 as a dissipating low. Striking India on May 26, the storm brought wind gusts up to 130 km/h (80 mph) and torrential rains, amounting to , which caused widespread damage. (Accessed through LexisNexis) The hardest hit area was Midnapore where more than 10,000 homes were destroyed. At least 17 people were killed in the district alone and more than 50,000 were left homeless. Communications across Orissa were severely disrupted as broadcast stations, government buildings, and hundreds of telephone poles were destroyed. Further inland, heavy rains from the storm triggered several landslides that killed at least two people in Darjeeling Hills. (Accessed through LexisNexis) Throughout eastern India, 61 people were killed and more than 500,000 were left homeless by the storm. In nearby Bangladesh, strong winds produced by the storm destroyed 500 homes across 11 villages. (Accessed through LexisNexis) Areas devastated by a tornado a month prior were severely affected by the cyclone. In Tangail, a powerful tornado spawned by the storm destroyed 2,000 homes and killed 10 people. At least 60 people perished and 2,000 others were injured across the country. (Accessed through LexisNexis) (Accessed through LexisNexis) Offshore, 150 fishermen went missing during the storm and were feared dead. (Accessed through LexisNexis) In the wake of the storm, widespread search and rescue missions took place in cities flattened by the cyclone. (Accessed through LexisNexis) Depression ARB 01/02A On June 7, small area of low pressure developed off the west coast of India. Over the following two days, convection associated with the low gradually organized and by June 9, satellite intensity estimates from the JTWC reached 55 km/h (30 mph). A TCFA was subsequently issued for the system before it made landfall in Gujarat early on June 10\\\\. Although overland, the low maintained significant convection as it turned westward and through its re-emergence into the Arabian Sea on June 11\\\\. Once back over water, convection rapidly spread westward in response to an anticyclone over the Arabian Peninsula and Afghanistan. Early on June 12, the cyclone was estimated to have attained tropical storm status based on a ship report near the center of 65 km/h (40 mph) sustained winds and a surface pressure of 998 mbar (hPa; 29.47 inHg). Later that day, strong wind shear stemming from the anticyclone displaced convection from the tropical storm by more than 110 km (70 mi), prompting the final advisory from the JTWC. The remnants of the system were last noted on June 13, dissipating over the Arabian Sea. Cyclonic Storm BOB 04 On July 22, the IMD began monitoring a depression over the Bay of Bengal. Tracking west-northwest, the system intensified into a cyclonic storm later that day before making landfall in Andhra Pradesh, just north of Vishakhapatnam. Once onshore the storm accelerated towards the northwest and weakened. By July 24, the remnants of the cyclone were located over the state of Maharashtra. The system was last noted the following day over Gujarat and moving into Pakistan. Across Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and Uttar Pradesh heavy rains produced by the storm triggered flash flooding and mudslides that killed at least 414 people. (Accessed through LexisNexis) According to Chief Minister Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao, approximately 70,000 homes were destroyed in Andhra Pradesh. While over Maharashtra, the storm produced torrential rainfall, reaching in 24 hours in Bombay, which caused deadly flash flooding and mudslides. Most of the railway tracks in metropolitan Bombay were left underwater, paralyzing the city and forcing businesses to close for several days. The city's stock exchange remained open, though only sparse trading was observed. (Accessed through LexisNexis) Flood waters isolated 46 villages in the region, prompting the deployment of the Indian Army for rescue missions. (Accessed through LexisNexis) At least 500 people were killed throughout Maharashtra, more than 200 of which took place in the Raigad district. (Accessed through LexisNexis) An unknown number of people were killed after a bridge collapsed with two train carriages on it. Additionally, 75 others were reported missing in the district according to local police. (Accessed through LexisNexis) Offshore, 500 fishermen went missing in connection to the storm and are believed to have died. (Accessed through LexisNexis) Flooding rains extended into Pakistan by July 26. (Accessed through LexisNexis) Flash floods in the slums outside Karachi killed at least 16 people and washed away 500 huts. An estimated 20,000 people were left homeless in the city. Communication and transportation throughout Karachi was reportedly paralyzed as well due to widespread power outages. Further north in Hyderabad, six others were killed by the storm. (Accessed through LexisNexis) Throughout the country, at least 31 people were killed. (Accessed through LexisNexis) Super Cyclonic Storm Gay On November 2, a tropical depression, later named Gay, developed in the Gulf of Thailand and favorable atmospheric conditions allowed the system to undergo rapid intensification. By November 3, Gay had intensified to a Category 3-equivalent typhoon before striking Thailand. Crossing the Kra Isthmus in approximately six hours, the system emerged into the Bay of Bengal as a Category 1-equivalent cyclone and assumed a west-northwesterly track towards India. For the next four days, the storm gradually reorganized before reaching a small area favorable for more significant intensification late on November 6\\\\. Hours before making landfall in India, Gay attained its peak intensity as a Category 5-equivalent cyclone with winds estimated at 260 km/h (160 mph). Additionally, the IMD estimated that the storm had three-minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (145 mph), classifying Gay as a modern-day Super Cyclonic Storm. The powerful storm soon made landfall near Kavali, India, in Andhra Pradesh before rapidly weakening onshore. The system eventually dissipated over Maharashtra on November 10. In Thailand, the storm caused extensive damage both onshore and off, killing 833 people and inflicting approximately () in damage. Striking India as a powerful cyclone, Gay damaged or destroyed about 20,000 homes in Andhra Pradesh, leaving 100,000 people homeless. In that country, 69 deaths and () in damage were attributed to Gay. Other systems In addition to the storms listed above, the IMD monitored six other depressions throughout the year. *June 12 ‚Äì 14 :Formed in the northern Bay of Bengal and made landfall in Orissa, India. *June 20 ‚Äì 21 :Formed in the northern Bay of Bengal and made landfall in West Bengal, India. *August 16 ‚Äì 17 :Formed in the Bay of Bengal and made landfall in Andhra Pradesh, India. *October 17 ‚Äì 18 :Formed in the Bay of Bengal and made landfall near the India/Bangladesh border. In Bangladesh, heavy rains and high winds, estimated at , caused significant damage. At least 100 people were injured and 1,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, mainly in the Chandpur District. Following the storm, the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society dispatched four medical teams and relief materials to the affected regions.

Produced primarily by Klas √Öhlund, Steve Booker and Orson, the album also features additional contribution from Si Hulbert, The Invisible Men, Melvin Kuiters, and Max Martin. It is the group's final album to include remaining founding member Keisha Buchanan. The album received a generally positive reception from the media and music critics,link but became the group's third lowest-charting and second lowest-selling album, reaching number eight and the top twenty in the UK and on the Irish Albums Chart, respectively. Catfights and Spotlights spawned only two singles, with the international top ten entry \\"Girls\\". The second and final single \\"No Can Do\\" was released on 22 December 2008.  Recording and theme  After they had completed their Change Tour in May 2008, the Sugababes announced that they would not go back into the recording studio until September 2008 to work on their next album, insisting they needed more time to work on their new material for a 2009 release. However, in June 2008, band member Keisha Buchanan told an interviewer that the group would start work on a new album straight away due to opportunities to record with new producers, and by 17 June the trio had started recording. Production was fast tracked after Italian musicians Melvin Kuiters and Si Hulbert brought Island Records a new track based around a sample of Ernie K. Doe's classic soul-funk song \\"Here Come the Girls\\" which was considered \\"a perfect vehicle\\" for the Sugababes sixth studio album. Less than a month later at the annual Liverpool Summer Pops in Liverpool, they announced that the lead single was completed, describing it as \\"amazing\\".

ITN Music. 12 August 2008. Retrieved 14 August 2008.  Critical reception  Allmusic editor Matthew Chisling called Catfights and Spotlights the ‚Ä≥group's strongest showing to date‚Ä≥. He felt that the album took the band \\"into a new dimension of artistic merit, flashing impeccable songwriting skills and flourishing arrangements thanks to the help of immaculate production, which throws the girl into a retro bodysuit yet never feels stale [...] Catfights and Spotlights is the true reflection of a girl group's transition from shallow pop stardom into full-fledged recording artistry.\\" Lucy Davies from BBC Music found that the album \\"bounds out like a Kate Moss Rimmel ad, all metallic, sharp-sure and savvy\\", and added: \\"The trouble with the Sugababes' sound has always been keeping the balance between blending and preserving individuality, and they've managed it here on the whole.\\" Digital Spys Nick Levine remarked that \\"Catfights and Spotlights is mellower and more classic-sounding than previous Sugababes records, with loads of strings and a conspicuous lack of synths, but it's no less polished and commercially-minded.\\" Popjustice called Catfights and Spotlights \\"the most 'complete' Sugababes album since their first.\\" In his review for The Guardian, Dorian Lynskey noted \\"a general transition from crisp modernity towards self- consciously grown-up, Duffyesque soul\\". Indeed, half of it is as colourless as promised, but the half credited to Swedish songwriter/producer Klas Ahlund is unflaggingly terrific [...] Sugababes have always lacked a reliably sympathetic ally who can pull the best from them: a Xenomania to their Girls Aloud. In Ahlund, they might just have found one.\\" The Times reviewer Priya found that \\"Sugababes are attempting to put some electricity back into their sound\\" with the album. While he felt, that the band \\"make the 1960s sound their own [and] recall the urban angst that made us fall in love with them [...] the throaty-voiced Amelle Berrabah is no replacement for the soulful, feisty pipes of the former member Mutya Buena.\\" Planet Sound felt that \\"mainly working with new producers has mixed success for the girlband\\". The Teletext music page noted \\"too many ballads\\" on the album, \\"but just enough singles here not to disrupt momentum\\". Elan Mark Edwards from The Sunday Times wrote, that \\"there are 14 tracks on Catfights and Spotlights, and there isn't a single turkey among them\\".  Sales and impact  Catfights and Spotlights debuted at number eight on the UK Albums Chart with first week sales of over 23,000 copies, becoming their fifth studio album to reach the top ten in the United Kingdom. However, it also became their first album since their debut One Touch (2000) not to peak inside the national top three. The album fell out of the top fifty in its fourth week of release.The UK Albums Chart Week 9 November 2008 In the week of 19 January, the album jumped 22 places from 96 to 74 with sales 2,000. Catfights and Spotlights was eventually certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 7 November 2008. In Ireland, the album debuted at number 18, before falling to number 42 the following week. As with the UK, it became the group's lowest-charting album and first album to miss the top ten since One Touch.Sugababes - Catfights and Spotlights Irish Top 100 In Greece, the album entered at number 33, before dropping to number 37 the following week. However, on its third week the album climbed to number 22. In an interview with Daily Star Sunday, Sugababes member Range blamed their music label, Island Records, for disappointing sales of Catfights and Spotlights. According to Range, \\"The sales have been disappointing but I don't think it is a reflection on the album's quality, and the problem is the promotion, I don't actually think our fans know we've even got an album out.\\" In a 2009 interview with The Guardian, Buchanan further elaborated: \\"We're still really proud of [Catfights and Spotlights], even though it wasn't our most successful album [...] I was surprised ‚Äì I think Change should've got those bad reviews, because that was a lot poppier.

The figure of Tuck was common in the May Games festivals of England and Scotland during the 15th through 17th centuries. He appears as a character in the fragment of a Robin Hood play from 1475, sometimes called Robin Hood and the Knight or Robin Hood and the Sheriff, and a play for the May games published in 1560 which tells a story similar to \\"Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar\\". (The oldest surviving copy of this ballad is from the 17th century.) The character entered the tradition through these folk plays, and he was originally partnered with Maid Marian: \\"She is a trul of trust, to serue a frier at his lust/a prycker a prauncer a terer of shetes/a wagger of ballockes when other men slepes\\".Child, Francis J. The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, vol. 3, 122. Quotation is from A mery geste of Robyn Hoode and of hys lyfe, wyth a new playe for to be played in Maye games very pleasaunte and full of pastyme (c. 1561). His appearance in \\"Robin Hood and the Sheriff\\" means that he was already part of the legend around the time when the earliest surviving copies of the Robin Hood ballads were being made. A friar with Robin's band in the historical period of Richard the Lion-Hearted would have been impossible because the period predates friars in England (but see Eustace the Monk, a medieval outlaw); however, the association of Robin Hood with Richard I was not made until the 16th century; the early ballad \\"A Gest of Robin Hood\\" names his king as \\"Edward\\". What follows is a story which includes different versions of the legend. He was a former monk of Fountains Abbey (or in some cases, St Mary's Abbey in York, which is also the scene of some other Robin Hood tales) who was expelled by his order because of his lack of respect for authority. Because of this, and in spite of his taste for good food and wine, he became the chaplain of Robin's band. In Howard Pyle's The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, he was specifically sought out as part of the tale of Alan-a-Dale: Robin has need of a priest who will marry Allan to his sweetheart in defiance of the Bishop of Hereford.Michael Patrick Hearn, \\"Afterword\\", Howard Pyle The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, p 384 In many tales, from \\"Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar\\" to The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, his first encounter with Robin results in a battle of wits in which first one and then the other gains the upper hand and forces the other to carry him across a river. This ends in the Friar tossing Robin into the river. In some tales, he is depicted as a physically fit man and a skilled swordsman and archer with a hot-headed temper. However, most commonly, Tuck is depicted as a fat, bald and jovial monk with a great love of food and ale, though the two are not mutually exclusive. Sometimes, the latter depiction of Tuck is the comic relief of the tale. Two royal writs in 1417 refer to Robert Stafford, a Sussex chaplain who had assumed the alias of Frere Tuk. This \\"Friar Tuck\\" was still at large in 1429. These are the earliest surviving references to a character by that name. Portrayals in other media Richard the Lionheart in Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe.250pxthumb In the 1891 romantic opera Ivanhoe by Sir Arthur Sullivan and Julian Sturgis, Friar Tuck was played by Avon Saxon. In the film Robin Hood (1922) he was portrayed by Willard Louis. In the film, The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) the character Friar Tuck was played by actor Eugene Pallette as a fat individual fond of food but also skilled with a sword. He was also quick to quarrel with anyone who slighted him, deprived him of his food or made fun of his girth. In the film The Bandit of Sherwood Forest (1946) he was portrayed by Edgar Buchanan. In the film The Prince of Thieves (1948) he was portrayed by Alan Mowbray. In the film Rogues of Sherwood Forest (1950) he was portrayed by Billy House. In the late 1950s British television series The Adventures of Robin Hood, he was played by Alexander Gauge as a fat friar a tad too devoted to good eating. He is also clearly devoted to the Church and the poor people he serves, using his wits to spare them unjust taxes, provide them education or shelter them from harm. He often uses the power and rights of the Church to good effect against the forces of the Sheriff. The 1958 Merrie Melodies animated short Robin Hood Daffy featured Porky Pig as a \\"fat friar\\", who sought Robin Hood, but refused to believe Daffy Duck was the legendary outlaw. At the end of the cartoon, Daffy becomes \\"Friar Duck\\". In the 1966 television series Rocket Robin Hood, Friar Tuck is again depicted as a traditional fat friar with a tonsure, despite the story taking place in the year 3000. Friar Tuck is memorable for a vignette that played during each episode depicting him in front of a large feast, taking a single bite of each piece of food on the table before throwing it over his shoulder. The veteran character actor James Hayter played Friar Tuck twice: in The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952) and A Challenge for Robin Hood (1967). In the 1973 Disney animated Robin Hood, Friar Tuck is a badger, voiced by Andy Devine. He is taken to be executed at the end of the film in a plot of Prince John's to lure Robin Hood out of hiding, but is rescued in time. In the 1975 TV series When Things Were Rotten, Friar Tuck was played by Dick Van Patten. In the British Robin of Sherwood TV series of the 1980s, Friar Tuck was played by Phil Rose. In this version, the character reluctantly served the Sheriff of Nottingham's brother, an evil abbot, and also served as Maid Marian's confessor. He helped Marian escape and joined the band alongside her. In the anime series Robin Hood no Daib≈çken, Friar Tuck (voiced by Kenichi Ogata) is an old monk who lives on the edge of Sherwood Forest and helps Robin and his friend if needed while offering sagely advice. In the animated series Young Robin Hood, Friar Tuck is made to be a young man around Robin's age and re-titled to Brother Tuck (Voiced by Harry Standjofski). A very young monk, sometimes questioning his choice being an outlaw. He is very pious and speaks Latin every now and then. In Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Tuck was played by Mike McShane, drawing heavily on the overweight, ale-loving interpretation. The Mel Brooks movie Robin Hood: Men in Tights parodies the character as \\"Rabbi Tuckman,\\" a self-described \\"purveyor of sacramental wine and mohel extraordinaire.\\" Brooks, who also plays the character, made Tuckman Jewish (as Brooks himself is Jewish), reprising a gag from Blazing Saddles where Brooks made a cameo as a Jewish Native American. In the video game Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood, Tuck was once again portrayed as Marian's confessor. He joins the band at her request. His enjoyment of alcohol is in the game as one of his abilities involves leaving beer flasks to intoxicate the guards. In the 1991 film adaptation Robin Hood, Friar Tuck (played by Jeff Nuttall) is portrayed as an itinerant seller of phony relics, who is first mugged and then adopted by the Merry Men. He also confesses to being on the run for killing the nephew of an abbot. In the 1997 film The Lost World, the second movie in the Jurassic Park franchise, big game hunter Roland Tembo refers to a Pachycephalosaurus as Friar Tuck. He could not read its proper name in his dinosaur identification booklet while travelling over rough ground towards the beginning of the film. In 1999, he featured in the video game Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings as a monk. In the 2004 DreamWorks film Shrek 2 the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming take King Harold to a fast food restaurant called \\"Friar's Fat Boy\\". This is a parody of the American restaurant chain Bob's Big Boy and features a statue of Friar Tuck outside of the restaurant similar to the famous Big Boy statue from its real life inspiration. The fictional restaurant returns again in the 2005 Activision published videogame Shrek Super Slam as a fighting location. The game even features theme music for the restaurant, which plays in the background of the fight. Friar Tuck is called Brother and later Father Tuck in Angus Donald's Outlaw Chronicles series ‚Äì so named as \\"there were no friars in England at that time\\"; consisting of Outlaw (2009), Holy Warrior (2010), and King's Man (2011). The first appearance of Tuck (in this case, not an anachronistic Friar) in the BBC show Robin Hood came in 2009 during its third series. After Robin was hurled over a ravine by Guy of Gisbourne, Tuck finds Robin further downstream. Tuck distracts Guy from the cave he is treating Robin in after Guy is told to look for Robin's body, thus saving Robin's life. He is played by David Harewood and portrayed as African. Mark Addy plays Friar Tuck in Ridley Scott's Robin Hood (2010). In the film, his hobby is beekeeping, which he uses to make mead and as a weapon against the French. Data impersonates Friar Tuck in the episode \\"Qpid\\" (1991) from Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek: The Next Generation series (4th season, episode 20). He was portrayed by Michael P. Northey in the TV series Once Upon a Time and its spin-off Once Upon a Time in Wonderland. He was portrayed by Trevor Cooper in the Doctor Who Series 8 episode, \\"Robot of Sherwood\\". In the VeggieTales show, Robin Good and His Not-So-Merry Men, Archibald Asparagus portrays a version of him named Friar Cluck. He was portrayed by Tim Minchin in the 2018 film Robin Hood.

The programme first premiered on SBS One on 29 September 2008. A second season was ordered following the high ratings for the premiere episode and positive comments from advertisers, and the second season began broadcasting from 11 May 2009. After acquiring the rights to broadcast the UK version in 2009, the Nine Network started airing their own version of Top Gear Australia in September 2010. Top Gear Australia returned for a fourth season in 2011. The show was cancelled on 28 April 2012 due to declining ratings. Top Gear Australia is also the name of a licensed version of the British Top Gear magazine. The Australian magazine is produced by ACP Magazines (Australian Consolidated Press). The magazine features articles from many writers including Steven Corby, Craig Jamieson, Bill Mckinnon, James Stanford, Ben Smithurst, Jason Barlow, Sam Phillip, Ollie Marriage, Dan Read and Paul Horrell. Presenters Prior to filming SBS made an open casting call for presenters, resulting in over 4000 applications. The original hosts chosen for Top Gear Australia were cartoonist and motoring columnist Warren Brown, MotoGP commentator Charlie Cox, and race driver / driving instructor Steve Pizzati. Marketing prior to the first episode stated that the presenters would be joined by The Stig's \\"Australian cousin\\", but in the first episode the driver was introduced as just \\"The Stig\\". Steve Pizzati suggested that The Stig have an \\"Australian\\" name, such as \\"Stiggo\\", but the other presenters refused. The season 2 opener clarified that Top Gear Australias Stig is not intended to be the same Stig from the UK series. On 19 December 2008, Charlie Cox announced he was leaving the program as he felt he was unable to offer enough time to the show. SBS subsequently announced that trumpeter James Morrison would be his replacement, joining Warren and Steve for season two.AUSmotive.com ‚Äì Top Gear Australia loses Cox and blows Morrison‚Äôs trumpet Morrison had previously appeared as a guest in the sixth episode. For the third season, early reports claimed that former Australian cricketer Shane Warne would take over the hosting of the show alongside original Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson, although the BBC ultimately ruled out Clarkson's involvement in the Australian version. On 20 June 2010, it was announced that actor and comedian Shane Jacobson and Top Gear Australia magazine editor Ewen Page would join a returning Steve Pizzati to present the show for the Nine Network, which premi√®red on 28 September 2010 with a 75-minute The Ashes special, in which the hosts faced off against their Top Gear UK counterparts in a series of motoring-related challenges. The UK presenters won after cheating in the final challenge by using a professional race driver instead of James May. Production Mirroring the UK series, the studio segments were recorded at Bankstown Airport in Sydney. An exact copy of the UK studio at Dunsfold Park was constructed in a hangar (Hangar Building 581). The power laps and \\"Star in a Bog Standard Car\\" were recorded at Camden Airport with parts of the runways and taxiways used as a test track. Top Gear Australia uses the same theme music as the UK series, a version of The Allman Brothers Band's \\"Jessica\\". Episodes Segments Top Gear Australia season 1 presenters from L to R: Warren Brown, Steve Pizzati, Charlie Cox. Season 2 presenter James Morrison and The Stig. Top Gear Australia features segments that mirror those seen on the BBC series, including build challenges and test drives. A significant difference is that speeds and power are quoted in metric units and prices are quoted in Australian dollars. Power Lap A test track around Camden Airport is used for power laps. The initial track used in the first two seasons consisted of nine corners running in an anti-clockwise direction. The first corner was The Question Mark followed by Clarkson Corner then The Crest and Turn 4 which was followed by the Main Straight before coming to a series of Chicanes then 06 Corner (named after the direction of the runway) then the Short Left Hander and the Bus Stop Entry and Exit followed by the finish line. At the start of Season 3, Top Gear Australia revealed a new test track. Still situated at Camden Airport, the new course built upon the old one by adding a new section, thus looping into a figure of eight. It contains twelve corners, a total length of 2.3 km and moves the Start/Finish line from between the Bus Stop and The Question Mark to the end of the Back Straight, ahead of the Bus Stop. The direction of the course is now clockwise, turning the main runway into the first straight. The first corner leads into a Hammerhead-like corner called The Blowout, followed by another straight which crest a small hill into a couple of Left Handers, turns 3 and 4. Exiting turn 4 leads back to the main runway and turn 5, Brocky's Corner. The track then crosses over The Blowout into a right then left hander called The Flipper. The next turn is the Question Mark hairpin from the old track. Finally, after a short straight, the course reaches the signature Bus Stop which is then followed by two right hand corners (including the old 06 Corner) back into the Start/Finish. =Lap times= :* The Nissan GT-R was listed as 180 km/h speed limited for its run in Episode 1 of Season 1, it was subsequently run without the limiter in Episode 7 of Season 2. :** Pizzati placed it at the top of the board despite being in the bottom three. :*** In keeping with the theme of the car, the Ford Model T's Power Lap was presented in a black-and-white silent film format. New Track Lap Times Star in a Bog Standard Car The Star in a Reasonably- Priced Car segment is mirrored with the name \\"Star in a Bog Standard Car\\". It is identical in execution.

V8 to the Rescue In series three, a new segment called V8 to the Rescue, was introduced.

Stuart Martin, motoring writer for the Adelaide Advertiser said a franchise was \\"always going to have a tough job living up to the UK original\\" but noted that Top Gear was not an overnight success and urged viewers to \\"give the locals a chance to find their niche\\". In retrospect Philip King said that the first season \\"received lukewarm reviews and couldn't get close to the ratings success of the original\\". The first episode debuted with an audience of 933,000 viewers, SBS's highest ever ratings for a locally produced television programme. Top Gear Australia came third in its time slot and beat an elimination episode of Australian Idol. The figure was slightly higher than any season premiere of the BBC version aired on SBS, up until that date. However, subsequent episodes failed to match this figure, and the first season averaged around 650,000 viewers an episode. In comparison, viewing figures for the previous three Top Gear UK episodes shown in the same timeslot averaged around 903,000 viewers, though during this period Top Gear Australia still remained the highest rating program on SBS.TV Tonight: Ratings Archive Series one has since been repeated on SBS Two. For the second series SBS attempted to address some of the criticism brought up against the first series.TV Tonight: Car Tuning The second series of the show debuted with 689,000 viewers,Top Gear Australia takes a second test-drive averaging 576,500 viewers across the series against the high rating MasterChef Australia. Ratings dropped throughout the second series, leading to speculation that SBS would not buy a third series. Jeremy Clarkson has commented on the Australian version, saying \\"We're loving it, even though your funny accents make you hard to understand\\". The third series premiered on 28 September 2010 on the Nine Network, pulling in 1,538,000 viewers, making it the second most watched television programme that day. The 75-minute The Ashes special, which featured the Top Gear UK presenters facing against the Australian presenters in a series of challenges, also won its timeslot against competing programmes. The Nine Network renewed the series for a 4th season in 2011 before being cancelled after three of the six recorded episodes aired due to declining ratings. The remaining unaired episodes were eventually burnt-off on Nine's subchannel Go! in April 2012. Episodes Magazine An Australian version of Top Gear magazine titled Top Gear Australia (published by Park Publishing, a partnership between ACP Magazines and the BBC) was launched in June 2008 and features an amalgam of original Australian articles together with licensed content from the British and other international versions of the magazine. DVD Release The third series of Top Gear Australia was released on 3 March 2011, and contained the first three episodes from the series, as well as The Ashes Special. Series four was released on 1 March 2012, and also contained episode four from the third series. Unaired Episodes Channel 9 had not shown the final episode of the third series, or the final three episodes from the fourth. The remaining episodes from series four began to be shown in April 2012 on GO!. The episode from series three was going to be included in the first DVD release, but was removed at the last minute. Images from this episode appear on the case and discs, and the episode is included in the running time. All of the unaired episodes were included in the second DVD release.

Doraine and Ellis (Doraine Renard: 1913‚Äì2003 and Ellis Lucas: 1916‚Äì2006) were an American husband and wife vaudeville and variety singing team of the twentieth century, who often billed themselves as \\"The Singing Sweethearts\\" or \\"America's Foremost Singing Team\\". Touring with the USO for hundreds of performances during World War II at the behest of Bob Hope, whom the couple knew from their days of performing at nightclubs around the United States, Doraine and Ellis entertained Allied troops on bills with such performers as Morey Amsterdam and Martha Raye before being forced to return stateside following minor injuries received in London during the Blitz. USO years Following a show at the Atlanta Biltmore Hotel, where the duo was playing an extended engagement shortly after the outbreak of World War II, General James Mollison, who was in the audience, asked the couple to perform for his troops. Shuttling from Atlanta to Mobile, Alabama for Sunday shows on their days off, Doraine and Ellis gave several performances for Mollison's troops who were stationed there. Bob Hope then requested that they sign up to go overseas with their show and had a tour of U.S. military installations arranged for them by the Hollywood Victory Committee. Their initial tour was to include only installations in the southwest U.S.; however, while playing an engagement in Indio, California, the couple received instructions to leave for New York the following day for a show at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. From there, they were sent to Miami for a show but were quickly diverted to play for British troops in the Bahamas and Bermuda. By 1944, Doraine and Ellis's overseas work in World War II had taken them on a 13-month tour of fighting fronts in 23 countries, placing them in the ranks of the most seasoned veterans of U.S.O. camp shows. The couple's U.S.O. shows took them to Iceland, England, and British, French, and Dutch Guiana in addition to many tropical island locations that they were prevented from disclosing to others at the time for security reasons. \\"A lot of times we were flown to a ship or an island and never did know just where we were,\\" Ellis said in a contemporary newspaper article about their work. Troops that Doraine and Ellis entertained on their overseas tour appreciated most the couple's offerings of semiclassical and light operatic fare, requesting their versions of \\"Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life\\", \\"Indian Love Call\\", and Jerome Kern's \\"Make Believe\\". According to Doraine, the troops wanted to hear their versions of \\"sentimental songs that reminded them of their girls back home.\\" In a 2004 interview Ellis commented that the soldiers always appreciated the effort to distract them from their deadly duties. \\"They needed to be entertained to relieve the pressures they were under on the battlefield. They were just so enthusiastic.\\" The need for military secrecy played out in other ways during the couple's tour. In late 1944, they reported that the show that most stood out in their memory to that date was one that had taken place at a bomber base in England in June 1944, when the colonel in charge had to cancel a post- performance visit to the officers' club, citing pending \\"important business\\" the next morning and the need for \\"a few hours sleep\\". The next morning they learned that the colonel's \\"important business\\" was D-Day. Doraine and Ellis often joked that \\"bugs rather than bombs\\" were their chief disturbance on tour. \\"At one jungle training camp in a malarial control zone, we were supposed to give an afternoon show, but travel was so bad that we didn't arrive until after sundown. You're not supposed to go around at night without net covering but Doraine stood in the spotlight in a flimsy gown, bare neck and shoulders, singing to soldiers all covered with mosquito netting.\\" Danger from bombings was a reality though: during their stay in England, the couple were knocked out by a robot bomb and narrowly escaped injury from another. Doraine was hit by falling plaster in a War Department building. While playing the London Palladium, an air raid alert sounded. Both expected a rush for shelters but were amazed that the rest of the show went on. Seeing the courage of their fellow performers and of the audience, they continued with their own performance. Eventually, the couple were forced to return to America after being among those injured from the first successful German V-1 rocket to hit England in June 1944. Post-War and later career In the immediate post-war years of the 1940s Doraine and Ellis held the house record at many venues, including the Empire Room at Chicago's Palmer House, returning annually for many seasons. The couple appeared on early television shows such as The Morey Amsterdam Show. In later years, they toured the country extensively in their Costumed Calvacade of Broadway's Greatest Musical Hits, a revue in which they presented musical selections from Show Boat, Annie Get Your Gun, South Pacific, Oklahoma!, My Fair Lady, The Music Man and so on and became successful producers in their own right through their production company, Harmony House Attractions. In the 1960s, accompanist Earl Wentz joined the team for several tours throughout the United States. Critical response Doraine and Ellis presented an optimistic, glamorous, yet wholesome portrait of America in their act, garnering wide acclaim: \\"They more than live up to their title \\"Romance in Song\\";New York Daily News \\"Sensational singing duo...glamorous costuming, as well as excellent stage presence make them one of the most delightful attractions to appear here;Chicago Daily News and \\"You'll fall in love with Doraine and Ellis. They radiate wholesome charm.\\".St. Louis Post-Dispatch The show business publication, Variety raved, \\"Fine voices and personalities combine to produce a smooth session of well chosen, cleverly arranged songs.\\".Variety The team made appearances in 48 states and 23 countries before retiring in the 1990s. Their extensive costume collection was donated to the costume department of Central Piedmont Community College in Charlotte, NC.

As a direct result of her efforts, Egyptian women were granted the right to vote by the Egyptian constitution. Early life and career Shafik was born in Tanta, in the Nile Delta of Northern Egypt and studied in a French mission school. At the age of 16 she became the youngest Egyptian to earn the French Baccalaureate degree. At 19 she was awarded a scholarship by the Egyptian Ministry of Education to study at the Sorbonne University in Paris. She also studied for a PhD in philosophy at the Sorbonne. She wrote two thesis, one refuting the merely utilitarian ends generally associated with Ancient Egyptian art, and the second, arguing about recognised women's equal rights. She was awarded her PhD (Doctorat d'Etat) with high qualifications (Mention tr√®s honorable). While in Paris, Shafik married Nour Al Din Ragai, a law student who was also on scholarship and working on his PhD. Upon her return from France to Egypt in 1940, Shafik hoped to contribute to the education of her country's youth, but the dean of the Faculty of Literature of Cairo University denied her a teaching position on the pretext that she was \\"too modern.\\" In 1945, Princess Chevicar, the first wife of Egypt's then former King Fuad I, offered Shafik the position of editor-in-chief of La Femme Nouvelle, a French cultural and literary magazine addressing the country's elite. Shafik accepted the position, and with Chevicar's death in 1947, took complete responsibility for the magazine, including its financing. Under her direction La Femme Nouvelle gained regional status. Also in 1945, Shafik decided to publish an Arabic magazine, Bint Al Nil (Daughter of The Nile), intended to educate Egyptian women and to help them to have the most effective role possible within their family and their society. The first issue came out in November 1945 and was almost immediately sold out. In 1948 Shafik created the Bint Al Nil Union, to help solve women's primary social problems and to ensure their inclusion in their country's policies. The union also worked to eradicate illiteracy by setting up centres for that purpose throughout the country, set up an employment office and a cafeteria for working women. Storming Parliament In February 1951, she managed to secretly bring together 1500 women from Egypt's two leading feminist groupings (Bint Al-Nil and the Egyptian Feminist Union). She organized a march of people that interrupted parliament for four hours after they gathered there with a series of demands mainly related to women's socioeconomic rights. Mufidah Abdul Rahman was chosen to defend Shafik in court in regards to this. When the case went to trial, many Bint al-Nil supporters attended the courtroom, and the judge adjourned the hearing indefinitely. However, in spite of receiving promises from the President of the Senate, women's rights experienced no improvements. Struggle against occupation In 1951, Shafik decided to contribute to efforts towards ridding Egypt from British occupation by creating the first female military unit, which brought together 2000 women, prepared them for the front and to carry out essential nursing activities. Bint Al-Nil Party  After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, Shafik requested government recognition of Bint Al-Nil as a political party, with Shafik herself as its president, which the government accepted to grant. First hunger strike  On 12 March 1954, Shafik undertook an eight-day hunger strike at the press syndicate, in protest at the creation of a constitutional committee with no women on it. She ended her strike upon receiving a written statement that President Naguib was committed to a constitution that respected the rights of women.  Trip around the world  As a result of the interest sparked by her hunger strike, Shafik was invited to lecture in Asia, Europe and the United States about Egyptian women. She travelled to Italy, England, France, the United States, Japan, India, Ceylon and Pakistan.  Right to vote As a result of Shafik's efforts, women were granted the right to vote under the constitution of 1956, with the proviso, however, that they be literate, which was not a prerequisite for male voting.  Second hunger strike In 1957 Shafik undertook a second hunger strike in the Indian embassy, in protest over President Gamal Abdel Nasser's dictatorial regime. As a result, she was put under house arrest by Nasser, her name was banned from the press and her magazines from circulation. Literary work In addition to her magazines, Shafik wrote a novel, L'Esclave Sultane, several volumes of poetry published by Pierre Fanlac, her own memoirs which is translated into many languages. Seclusion and death Following her house arrest Shafik led a solitary life, even when her movement was no longer restricted. She spent her last years reading, writing and mainly in the company of her daughters and grandchildren. She came to her death after falling from her balcony in 1975. The New York Times regretted not printing her obituary and finally printed one in 2018. Personal life Shafik married Nour Al-Din Ragai in Paris in 1937. He would go on to become a prominent lawyer in Egypt and to support all of her efforts. They were together for 31 years (till 1968 when they divorced) and had two daughters, Aziza and Jehane. She was survived by them and by her four grandchildren. Tribute On December 14, 2016, Google dedicated a Doodle to the writer for the 108th anniversary of her birth. The Doodle reached all the countries of the Arab World. In 2018, the New York Times published a belated obituary for her.

It was written by one of the season's co-executive producers, Jack Burditt, and one of the season's executive producers, Robert Carlock. It was directed by Paul Feig. It first aired on April 19, 2007 on the NBC network in the United States. Guest stars in this episode included Jennifer Bassey, Kevin Brown, Grizz Chapman, Eric Dysart, Ramsey Faragallah, Lori Hammel, Lester Holt, Traci Hovel, Gregory Korostishevsky, Jenelle Marlbrough, Anthony Mazza, Raymond McAnally, Jack Moran, Emily Mortimer, Maulik Pancholy, Brian Patrick Russell, Mitch Poulos, Justin Smith, Jason Sudeikis, Gary Tacon, Mira Tzur and Julian Walker. In this episode, Liz Lemon (played by Tina Fey) and Floyd (Jason Sudeikis) visit Cleveland, Ohio when Floyd says he wishes that he could live there. Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) goes on the run from The Black Crusaders. Liz discovers that Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) fianc√©e, Phoebe (Emily Mortimer), is keeping some deceiving secrets.  Plot  When Floyd (Jason Sudeikis) loses out on a possible job promotion to Alan Garkel (Eric Dysart)‚Äîan African-American candidate in a wheelchair‚Äîhe informs Liz Lemon of his aspirations to move back home to Cleveland. After Floyd asks Liz about her own future in New York, she begins to notice all the problems she has with the city and so they plan a visit to Floyd's hometown. Meanwhile, Jack returns from a weekend in Paris with Phoebe, his new fianc√©e, and insists that Liz should get to know Phoebe better. He tells her to take Phoebe and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) on a girls' day out. As their day progresses Liz senses Phoebe is not who she claims to be. Liz's suspicions are confirmed when she covertly follows Phoebe to a restaurant and spies her holding hands with an older gentleman. This is alarming for two reasons: first, Phoebe is already engaged to Jack, and secondly, she has previously claimed to be afflicted by \\"Avian Bone Syndrome,\\" a result of which is that her purportedly brittle bones would not be able to stand such intense physical contact. Even though Liz tries to remain inconspicuous at the restaurant, Phoebe notices her. Knowing that Liz is on to her deceptions, Phoebe confronts Liz, who is not interested in Phoebe's excuses and tells her that she has a choice: tell Jack about her cheating or Liz will do so herself. Phoebe becomes angry and then shocks Liz when she drops her British accent. Liz tries to tell Jack about her suspicions, but he is immediately offended by her seemingly unfounded and slanderous comments about his fianc√©e, which puts a heavy strain on their working relationship. Finally, Tracy has somehow become entangled in a character assassination plot. When Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) tells Tracy that he read in a magazine that Bill Cosby hates him, Tracy realizes that The Black Crusaders, a cabal of powerful African Americans (a reference to the 2006 conspiracy theory hoax regarding a similar group called the Dark Crusaders driving Dave Chappelle off his Comedy Central show), are out to destroy his career. The Black Crusaders have managed to put a stop to all productions featuring Tracy. Fearing for his life, Tracy goes on the run to Cleveland and, from there, into Needmore, Pennsylvania.  Production  This episode was the fourth episode written by Jack Burditt and also the fourth episode written by Robert Carlock. It was the first episode directed by Paul Feig. The scenes set in Cleveland, Ohio were actually filmed in Battery Park City, Manhattan. Similarly, the scenes in the town of Needmore, Pennsylvania in the following episode, \\"Hiatus\\", were filmed in Douglaston, Queens. Jason Sudeikis and Tina Fey sing the montage when touring Cleveland.  Reception  \\"Cleveland\\" brought in an average of 5.2 million viewers upon its original broadcast in the United States. It also achieved a 2.5/7 in the key 18- to 49-year-old demographic. The 2.5 refers to 2.5% of all people of ages 18‚Äì49 years old in the U.S., and the 7 refers to 7% of all people of ages 18‚Äì49 years old watching television at the time of the broadcast in the U.S.. Robert Canning of IGN thought that this episode \\"was by far the funniest, laugh-out- loud, near genius episode of 30 Rock this season.\\" He wrote that \\"there wasn't a moment wasted in the entire half hour, which not only gave us plenty of laughs, but it continued the ongoing storylines with fantastic pacing and ease.\\" Canning stated that \\"the best part of this episode by far was Tracy's paranoia over The Black Crusaders\\" and he rated the episode 9.7 out of 10. Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote regarding Emily Mortimer's guest appearance that \\"she's not the first thought for most sitcoms looking to fill a vacancy. But here, she's obviously relishing (as Isabella Rossellini did) the chance to go a bit bonkers. When she lapsed out of the accent, what fun.\\" Anna Johns of AOL's TV Squad wrote that she \\"didn't find 'Cleveland' nearly as funny as the super-sized 'Fireworks' episode two weeks ago, but it was still pretty good. The best sources of humor in this show are Kenneth the Page and Tracy Jordan, neither of which had a very prominent role this week.\\"  References   External links  2007 American television episodes 30 Rock (season 1) episodes Television programs directed by Paul Feig ","title":"Cleveland (30 Rock)"},{"id":"18834454","text":"Poladlƒ± or Poladly or Polatlu or Polatly may refer to: *Poladlƒ±, Agdam, Azerbaijan *Poladlƒ±, Aghjabadi, Azerbaijan *Poladlƒ±, Gadabay, Azerbaijan *Poladlƒ±, Gobustan, Azerbaijan *Poladlƒ±, Qubadli, Azerbaijan *Poladlƒ±, Tartar, Azerbaijan ","title":"Poladlƒ±"},{"id":"18834463","text":"K…ônd…ôbil (also, Gendabil‚Äô and Gendebil‚Äô) is a village and municipality in the Zardab Rayon of Azerbaijan.

A lawyer and politician, his career was defined by the influence of his kinsman, Julio Argentino Roca, who propelled him into a legislative career. He was a staunch promoter of separation of church and state and an aristocratic liberal. As president of Argentina, he promoted public works but was not capable of maintaining economic stability and had to contend with the powerful opposition of the Civic Union Party, and his leader Leandro N. Alem. After the Revoluci√≥n del Parque, after he defeated the uprising, he was forced to resign and retired from political life.  Youth  Ju√°rez Celman was born and raised in C√≥rdoba, Argentina, where he studied under the Jesuits at the Colegio de Montserrat. He studied Law, becoming a lawyer in 1869. In 1867, he became an active Freemason. Thanks to his family connections, he came from an aristocratic family, he entered political life early. He was elected Representative just after obtaining his doctorate and from the provincial parliament he headed the movement to promote the secularization of education. Two years later he was elected to the Senate of Argentina and in 1877 became its president. He spent little time as president as after the death of Governor Climaco de la Pe√±a, the new Government of Antonio Del Viso nominated him as Government Minister. His energetic work earned him the nomination and election as Governor of C√≥rdoba on May 17, 1880.  Governor  He was Governor-elect when there was an insurrection in Buenos Aires, led by Carlos Tejedor and Lisandro Olmos, opposed to the federalization of Buenos Aires. The federalization succeeded in 1880 and was followed by the establishment of state elementary education in the capitalArgentina 11516-1987 by David Rock - Chapter IV during the presidency of Julio A. Roca.  President  Having become a national Senator in 1883, and becoming close to President Roca, he obtained Roca's support in his bid to become presidential candidate for the National Autonomist Party (PAN). He won the 1886 national election, not without accusations of fraud, which was not uncommon in the PAN. His Vice-President was Carlos Pellegrini, ex-War Minister under Roca, who had supported his candidacy from the pages of the Sud Am√©rica newspaper. His presidency was marked by a degree of paranoia. An 1890 rugby match in Buenos Aires resulted in the arrest of both teams and all 2,500 spectators.Cotton, p29 Ju√°rez Celman was particularly vigilant after the Revolution of the Park in the city earlier in the year, and the police had suspected that the match was in fact a political meeting. Most observers expected Ju√°rez Celman's administration to be a continuation of Roca's with the retired president managing from behind the scenes, but in a display of independence, he took control of the PAN with in a more authoritative form becoming what his opponents dubbed the unicato (one-man rule). This, combined with economic regression, led to the formation of the Civic Union, an opposition group that was later split into the National Civic Union and the Radical Civic Union, the latter being still important in Argentinian politics. In 1890, a revolution forced Ju√°rez to resign, and Vice-President Carlos Pellegrini, succeeded him.La revoluci√≥n argentina del '90 by Luis V. Somni Ju√°rez Celman died in Arrecifes, aged 64.

Number 28 (and final) in the Marvel Treasury Edition series, it is the \\"spiritual sequel\\" to 1976's Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man. Like the earlier Superman - Spider-Man crossover, the issue is noncanonical, as it assumes that the heroes and their respective cities of residence, Metropolis and New York, exist in the same universe, with no explanation given as to why they had never before met or been mentioned in each other's individual stories. It also does not explicitly mention the events of the first crossover story. Publication history Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man was very much a collaboration between the two companies; this second treasury-sized edition was largely the work of Marvel, with DC's approval. The first team-up featured the heroes' most popular enemies, Lex Luthor and Doctor Octopus, but with this story writer Jim Shooter clearly sought plot convenience over \\"rogues gallery\\" prominence, and chose Doctor Doom (more typically a Fantastic Four villain, though he had occasionally battled Spider-Man and would do so in the future as well) from Marvel, and the Parasite (a lesser-known Superman foe) from DC. The comic also pits Superman against the Hulk for the first time, and Spider-Man against Wonder Woman. The book was officially co-written by Shooter and Marv Wolfman, who at the time was writing the popular DC title The New Teen Titans. John Buscema penciled the story, and Joe Sinnott inked the main figures. The backgrounds were inked by a who's who of contemporary Marvel talent: Terry Austin, Klaus Janson, Bob Layton, Steve Leialoha, Bob McLeod, Al Milgrom, Josef Rubinstein, Walt Simonson, Brett Breeding, and Bob Wiacek.Marvel Treasury Edition #28 at the Grand Comics Database The front cover was painted by Bob Larkin from a layout by John Romita, Sr. Other features of the book include Superman and Spider- Man's origins on the inside front cover, an earlier cover concept on the inside back cover, and house ads for both Marvel and DC. Plot summary The story begins in Manhattan, where Spider-Man foils a bank robbery. Easily dispatching the criminals, his Spider-sense alerts him about a nearby construction site, but unable to determine any immediate danger, he moves on. The reader learns, however, that the site camouflages an elaborate base of the Latverian monarch Doctor Doom, connected with a years-long plot of his known as \\"Project Omega.\\" Doom initiates Omega by luring the Hulk to Superman's hometown of Metropolis using a special micro-transmitter. Spider-Man's alter- ego of Peter Parker is assigned by The Daily Bugle to cover The Hulk's advance towards Metropolis. Parker arrives in Metropolis just in time to witness the confrontation between Superman and the Hulk. Parker changes into Spider-Man, but is outclassed and unable to help. Battling the Hulk, Superman discovers the beacon and destroys it, calming the Hulk and winning his trust. The Hulk reverts to his Bruce Banner form, but Doom's plan has worked: the damage Hulk caused released the Parasite from a special underground cell. S.T.A.R. Labs takes custody of Banner, hoping to find a cure for his condition. Doom, monitoring everything, still needs Banner for his plan, and now he knows exactly where to find him. Peter Parker goes to work for The Daily Planet while Superman's alter-ego of Clark Kent takes a leave and joins the staff of the Bugle in New York City, each seeking to investigate the crisis from a different end. Superman has realized that the Hulk's rampage was designed to free the Parasite, and reasons that, as Luthor is behind bars, only Dr. Doom could be behind the scheme. Superman visits the monarch of Latveria at its New York embassy, where Doom freely admits he's plotting world domination. Superman is sworn to uphold the laws of men, and on Latverian soil, Doom is the law. He even makes an attempt to capture the Man of Steel, but Superman uses the lead-lined everything room of Doom's headquarters to his advantage. When Doom releases some kryptonite, Superman rolls himself in the lead-lining and blocks the lethal radiation. Nonetheless, Doom remains untouchable. While Clark Kent works his mild-mannered charm on the Bugle's cantankerous publisher J. Jonah Jameson, Peter Parker has to deal with Steve Lombard, the jock sportscaster who harassed Kent throughout the 1970s. Soon enough, Parker stumbles onto the Metropolis division of Doom's Project Omega, around the same time as Wonder Woman, who has also been following this case. (Actually Doom planted evidence in order to lure Wonder Woman; her capture is also part of his master plan.) Spider-Man and Wonder Woman fall into fighting under false pretenses, but quickly realize they're on the same side and join forces. Doom captures Wonder Woman before they can accomplish anything, however, while Spider-Man escapes and trails her captors to their destination, finally learning the truth about Project Omega. The Omega installations, positioned all across the world, will go online and emit a particular radiation which will render most forms of fuel useless. Only a special generator ‚Äî built by Doom, of course ‚Äî will provide the energy the world needs; he will step in and make himself absolute monarch. In exchange for making him Doom's privileged enforcer, Doom enhances the Parasite's abilities with the absorbed powers of Wonder Woman, the Hulk, and Superman. The Parasite likes the idea, but only because he intends to turn on Doom. Of course, he won't get that chance; Doom knows that all that power will burn out the Parasite, turning his body into a unique kind of crystal with unique energy-absorbing properties that will allow Doom to use it to control the power of his super-reactor. The story comes to a climax as the heroes battle the Parasite, Doom and his henchmen, and a giant robot. Doom and the Parasite turn on each other after Parasite absorbs some of Spider-Man's powers during the fight and his spider-sense alerts him to the danger of Doom's plan. Superman and Spider-Man use their respective abilities to foil Doom's plot, Spider-Man using his webbing as an improvised 'lint brush' to 'clean' Superman of the kryptonite dust Doom used to immobilize him, and Superman subsequently taking Doom's gauntlet to knock out the Parasite (correctly deducing that Doom would have developed an armour that would prevent the Parasite from absorbing him). They also prevent the accidental world-destroying explosion of Doom's super-reactor after the controls are damaged in the fight; Superman contains the reactor from the inside long enough for Spider-Man to use his spider-sense to find the lever necessary to fully turn the reactor off. The Hulk wanders off when the stasis tube in which he was imprisoned cracks, while the Parasite is recaptured and Wonder Woman released after the crisis is over. Doom manages to make it back to the Latverian Embassy, where he enjoys diplomatic immunity, seconds before Superman catches up with him.

Background Elizabeth Jackson Howe was born circa 1637 near Rowley, Yorkshire, the daughter of William and Joane Jackson. Elizabeth married James Howe in April 1658; the couple had six children, and resided in Topsfield, Massachusetts. * James Howe (b. 1659) * Elizabeth Howe Jr. (b.1661) * Mary Howe (b. 1664) * Deborah Howe (b.1667) * John Howe (b. 1671) * Abigail Howe (b. 1673) Topsfield was a Puritan community. They were a deeply pious society, with an extreme religious focus not only as a community but also on an individual basis.Bruic, Lisa. \\"A Historical and Legal Analysis of the Salem Witchcraft Hysteria\\", Dissertation Brigham Young University (1983). They believed firmly in the devil, and felt that he was not only an enemy to mankind, but to the Puritans specifically. \\"The devil, as envisioned by the people of Salem, was a short, black man with cloven feet who stood about as high as a walking stick\\". The fight against the devil was viewed as an individual religious responsibility. Accused of witchcraft The Perley (also spelled Pearly) family of Ipswich, Massachusetts, were among the chief accusers of Elizabeth Howe. They had a ten-year-old daughter they claimed was being afflicted by Howe. The child complained of being pricked by pins and sometimes fell into fits.Boyer, Paul, and Nissenbaum, Stephen eds. Salem Witchcraft Papers New York: Da Capo Press, 1977. Vol. II pp. 433-34, 437, 439, 442-44, 449-50. In their testimony against Howe, on June 1, 1692, they quoted their daughter as saying, \\"I could never afflict a dog as Good Howe afflicts me.\\" At first the parents did not believe their daughter's accusations. They took the child to several doctors who told them she was \\"under an evil hand\\". Her condition continued for two or three years, until \\"she pined away to skin and bones and ended her sorrowful life\\". Howe was accused of afflicting several other girls within Salem Village. The identities of the girls Elizabeth Howe was accused of afflicting are recorded in the transcript of her examination: *Mercy Lewis was nineteen years old during the Salem trials. When her entire family was killed in an Indian attack she was sent to be a servant in the house of Thomas Putnam. Mercy Lewis acted as key player in the accusation of Elizabeth Howe, as well as many other individuals in Salem Village.Carroll, Meghan, and Stone, Jenny. \\"Salem Witch Trials: Documentary Archive and Transcript Archive\\" (2002). University of Virginia. May 12, 2008. Mercy Lewis was a major contributor of spectral evidence in the examination of Elizabeth Howe. She threw herself to the floor in a fit as soon as Howe entered the meeting house. *Mary Walcott played a significant role in the Salem trials, being one of the original girls to become \\"afflicted\\".McCandlish, Kelly. \\"Salem Witch Trials: Documentary Archive and Transcript Archive\\" (2001). Her name not only appeared on the arrest warrant served to Elizabeth Howe but appeared in one of two indictments. Her cousin, Ann Putnam, Jr., was one of the most active accusers. *Ann Putnam, Jr. was one of the \\"afflicted\\" girls. She was one of the most aggressive accusers, her name appearing over 400 times in court documents. Ann was twelve years old at the start of the trials. She accused nineteen people and saw eleven of them hanged. This is a significant amount when one considers the fact that only nineteen people total hanged because of the accusations against them. In 1706, Ann Putnam, Jr. apologized for her actions; she was the only \\"afflictee\\" to do so publicly.Alvarez, Kate. \\"Salem Witch Trials: Documentary Archive and Transcript Archive\\" (2002). Ann Putnam *Abigail Williams was 11 at the time of Elizabeth Howe's trial in 1692. She was one of the most well-known \\"afflicted\\" girls in the Salem witch trials. Her name appeared on the arrest warrant for Elizabeth Howe. She was the niece of Reverend Samuel Parris, reverend of Salem Village and was one of the first two girls to become \\"afflicted\\".Yosts, M. Melissa. \\"Salem Witch Trials: Documentary Archive and Transcript Archive (2002). *Mary Warren was 21 when the trials began. She was employed as a servant in the house of John Proctor of Salem Village. Warren participated in some of the \\"afflicted girls\\" accusations before confessing that the other girls were lying. However, they turned on her and Warren herself was eventually tried for being a witch. She escaped conviction by changing sides again, accusing her employer and his wife of \\"certain deeds, although she hesitated to call them a witch and a wizard\\".Kirk, Devan. \\"Salem Witch Trials: Documentary Archive and Transcript Archive\\" (2002) This safely placed Mary Warren back on the accusing side of the line. Warrant for arrest On May 28, 1692 a warrant was released for the arrest of Elizabeth Howe by John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin. She was to be apprehended and taken to the home of Lieutenant Nathaniel Ingersolls. She stood charged with \\"Sundry Acts of Witch-craft done or [committed] on the [bodies] of Mary Walcott, Abigail Williams, and others of Salem Village.\\" She was apprehended by Ephraim Wildes, constable of Topsfield, on May 29, 1692. A copy of her original warrant can be read below. This transcript was taken from The Salem Witchcraft Papers. Imprisonment The accused \\"witches\\" were, \\"bound with cords and irons for months, subjected to insulting, unending examinations and excommunication from the church\\". In Marion L. Starkey's The Devil in Massachusetts it says, \\"...they were periodically subjected by prison officials, especially by the juries assigned to search them for witch marks\\".Starkey, Marion L. \\"The Devil in Massachusetts.\\" New York: Anchor, 1989, pp. 151, 168, 175, 267. While Elizabeth Howe was imprisoned in these conditions she was able to rely on the support of her family. Her daughters, and occasionally her blind husband, would take turns in making regular trips to Boston. Starkey said they would bring her \\"country butter, clean linen, and comfort\\". Trial Chaos in the Courtroom Court conditions verged on the point of ridiculous during the Salem witch trials. There are many pauses in court records because of the chaos that surrounded trials of the supposed witches. For instance, \\"afflicted\\" girls would throw themselves on the ground in hysterical fits, and when the examinant moved their body the afflicted individuals would cry out in pain. Magistrate Samuel Sewall of Boston recorded his observation about the conditions he found in the meeting house. His diary reads, \\"Went to Salem, where in the meeting house, the persons accused of witchcraft were examined ... 'twas awful to see how the afflicted persons were agitated\\".Hansen, Chadwick. \\"Witchcraft at Salem\\" New York: George Braziller, 1969. As cited in Bruic, Lisa. \\"A Historical and Legal Analysis of the Salem Witchcraft Hysteria\\", Dissertation Brigham Young University (1983). Such was the case of Elizabeth Howe's trial which began on May 31, 1692. The following is a true account of the examination of Elizabeth Howe as witnessed by Samuel Parris. This account is taken from The Salem Witchcraft Papers, Transcripts of the Legal Documents from the Salem Witch Trials. When Howe was brought in for examination Mercy Lewis and Mary Walcott, two of her main accusers, fell into a fit. She was accused by Mary of pinching and choking her in the month of May. Ann Putnam, Jr. added her accusations to these by saying she had been hurt three times by Howe. When asked how she pleaded to the charges made against her, Elizabeth Howe boldly responded, \\"If it was the last moment I was to live, God knows I am innocent of any thing of this nature.\\" Actual examination: Indictments against Elizabeth Howe These indictments are transcripts of the legal documents taken from The Salem Witchcraft Papers (3).Anno Regis et Reginae Evidence in the court and witnesses against Howe There were many different types of evidence that were used to convict a supposed witch. These were confession, supernatural attributes, the witch's teat or witch's mark (any small skin growth or abnormality found on the body of the accused), anger followed by mischief, and probably most importantly spectral evidenceStirland, McKay T. \\"Thou shalt Not Suffer a Witch to Live\\". Dissertation, Brigham Young University (1987). defined by The Witches of Early America as \\"the supernatural phenomena thought to occur when a vision or 'spectre' of an accused witch appeared to a witness\\".Booth, Sally Smith. The Witches of Early America, New York: Hastings House, 1975. As cited in Bruic, Lisa. A Historical and Legal Analysis of the Salem Witchcraft Hysteria Dissertation, Brigham Young University (1983). Witch examination Anger followed by mischief is one form of evidence that was brought against Elizabeth Howe. The Perley (sometimes spelled Pearly) family, who had also accused her of afflicting their ten-year-old daughter, blamed the sudden illness of the family's cow upon her. This was due, they claimed, to the fact that they had thwarted Elizabeth Howe's chance of becoming a member of the Ipswich Church. Samuel Perley (or Pearly) stated: \\"the above said goode how had a mind to joyn to iPswich Church thai being unsatisfied sent to us to bring in what we knew thai se cause to Put a stoP to her coming into the Church.\\" Samuel went on to explain a few days afterwards his cow suddenly went mad and ran into a pond drowning herself. Spectral evidence played a key role in the Salem Witch Trials. The Witches of Early America defines spectral evidence as, \\"the supernatural phenomena thought to occur when a vision or 'spectre' of an accused witch appeared to a witness\\". The accusation of the Perley family (also spelled Pearly) is not a direct example of when \\"an accused witch appeared to a witness\\". However, they did bring forth spectral evidence with the story of their daughter. Apparently she told her parents that when she went near fire or water, \\"this witch [pulled her] in\\". Another accusation of anger before mischief was raised against Elizabeth Howe by her own brother-in-law. From his account we learn that she asked John Howe to go with her to \\"Salem farmes\\". He told her that had she been accused of any other thing he would go with her, but because the accusation was witchcraft he \\"would not for ten pounds\\", he continued, \\"If you are a witch tell me how long you have a witch and what mischeve you have done and then I will go with you\\". His report explains that she \\"semed to be aingry with me\\". John owned a sow with six small piglets. Around sunset he recounted the sow \\"leaped up about [three or four feet high] and [turned about] and gave one [squeak] and fell [down dead]\\". He went on to say that he cut off the ear of the sow and the hand he used to do this became numb and full of pain for several days after. All of this he blamed upon his sister-in-law Elizabeth How . Witnesses on behalf of Howe Having witnessed a conversation between Samuel Perley (also spelled Pearly)'s little girl and Elizabeth Howe. Reverend Phillips of Rowley was able to testify in her defense on June 3, 1692. This testimony is taken from the Salem Witchcraft Papers. A colleague of Phillips, Payson of Rowley, was also present at this \\"encounter\\" between Elizabeth Howe and the Perley (also spelled Pearly)'s daughter. He added his testimony as a second witness stating, \\"their afflicted daughter, upon something that her mother spake to her with tartness, presently fell into one of her usuall strange fitts, during which, she made no mention(as I observed)of the above s'd How her name, or any thing relating to her some time after, the s'd how came in.\\" In her defense, Elizabeth Howe's father-in-law testified to her good nature. He said that she, \\"[set] a side humain infurmitys as [become] a Christion with Respact to [himself] as a father very dutifully & a wifife to [his] son very carfull loveing obedient and kind Considering his want of eye sight.\\" He concluded his witness by saying, \\"now desiering god may guide your honours to se a difference between predigous and Consentes I rest yours to Sarve.\\" Execution Public execution was considered the most severe punishment of the time in Puritan Massachusetts.Hoffer, Charles Peter. Johns Hopkins University Press; Reprint edition (March 10, 1998), , pp. 105-06. Convicted witches were hanged on Gallows Hill. Elizabeth Howe was hanged on July 19, 1692, along with Rebecca Nurse (her sister-in-law), Sarah Good, Sarah Wildes and Susanna Martin. The execution methods in New England were very similar to those used in England. The condemned would ride to the execution spot with a minister. He would then elaborate on the saving grace of Jesus Christ and repentance. The minister would also preach a sermon to the crowd that had gathered to watch the execution. Historian Louis P. Masur wrote, \\"The ritual of execution day required that condemned prisoners demonstrate publicly that they were penitent, and the execution sermons repeatedly pounded the chord of penitence.\\" In an ideal situation the convicted would confess to their crime, alleviating worry from the community that they were sending an unprepared soul to the next life. Conclusion Elizabeth Howe, Rebecca Nurse, Sarah Good, Sarah Wildes and Susanna Martin were hanged on July 19, 1692, and buried in a crevice on Gallows hill. Giles Corey (image) Nineteen people were hanged for witchcraft during the Salem witch trials, and one man, Giles Corey, was pressed to death because he refused to attest to the indictment against him.Jorgenson, Eric. \\"The Salem Witch Trials\\", Dissertation. Brigham Young University (1983). In 1709, many were encouraged to join in a petition with Phillip English; they began with approximately twenty-one accused witches and children of the accused; although, later many others added their sentiments. Among these were the daughters of Elizabeth Howe. They requested that their good names be restored and also wanted financial compensation for their losses during the trials. It was not until 1711 that a sum of approximately ‚Ç§598 was distributed among the survivors.

As it was the final episode filmed they took a moment to pay tribute to the characters (except for Trapper John McIntyre) who had left the series before its conclusion. It also introduces the character of Soon-Lee, who would play a vital role in the series' final episode and the short-lived spin-off AfterMASH. The episode is dedicated to Connie Izay, RN, one of the show's medical advisors. Although this was the penultimate episode of the series, it was the final episode produced, wrapping on January 14, 1983 at exactly 6:05PM. The series finale, Goodbye, Farewell and Amen, had been filmed earlier in the season's production schedule. Synopsis The episode opens in the Officer's Club, with Sgt. Rizzo sleeping at the bar. B.J. shouts \\"is the general's Jeep ready?\\", causing Rizzo to jump out of his slumber. Rizzo seeks revenge, and decides to get it using a dummy hand grenade he borrows from Igor. Winchester reads a story in the newspaper about a new skyscraper in Los Angeles that will have a time capsule placed in its cornerstone. Major Houlihan becomes enamoured with this idea and decides to place a time capsule to commemorate the 4077. Hawkeye also likes the idea, and volunteers to help Houlihan. Hawkeye later confides to B.J. and Winchester that Houlihan's time capsule would only represent the army side of their lives, and he wants to be sure to include something to represent \\"us malcontents\\". Father Mulcahy helps a distraught elderly Korean couple board a transport headed for a refugee camp, separated from their daughter in the middle of the fighting. As they leave, Mulcahy tells them to ask the officials at the refugee camp for help. A shipment of wounded arrives, and one of the medics advises Colonel Potter of a helicopter that was sent earlier that day with a sniper victim. Colonel Potter tells the medic that the helicopter never arrived, and orders Klinger to have it reported as MIA. The medic tells Potter and Klinger that they managed to capture the sniper and produce a young Korean woman named Soon-Lee Han, who was found with an M1 Carbine rifle in the fields and is suspected of being the sniper. Soon-Lee claims her innocence, saying that she found the rifle as she was ploughing. Klinger is ordered to lock up Soon-Lee until Army Intelligence can interrogate her. As work on the time capsule continues, Houlihan grows increasingly frustrated with Hawkeye's suggestions and throws Hawkeye off the project. Undaunted, Hawkeye soldiers on with his own time capsule. Rizzo decides to carry out his revenge when he goes into the shower tent, where B.J. is enjoying a shower. Rizzo begins playing with the dummy grenade, and pretends to accidentally pull the pin. Fearing for his life, B.J. runs naked out of the shower tent. When B.J. learns that the grenade was a dummy and this was all a prank, he vows to get back at Rizzo. When Father Mulcahy hears Soon- Lee's story, they all become convinced that the elderly Korean couple are Soon-Lee's parents. Soon-Lee urges Klinger to let her go, but Klinger cannot. The missing helicopter finally arrives with the sniper's victim. The pilot puts his delay down to engine trouble, and his radio silence to a damaged radio. The sniper's victim tells the real story to Hawkeye and Houlihan. The helicopter took enemy fire destroying the radio and the fan belt, forcing them to land. This left the helicopter only able fly a maximum of 200 yards before the engine overheated. The pilot walked ahead 200 yards to find a safe clearing to land, and by the time he returned to the chopper, the engine was cool and ready to fly again. He repeated this \\"walk, return, fly\\" process until it was too dark to fly, and then began the next morning as soon as it was light. Hawkeye and Houlihan are touched by the pilot's heroism. While the sniper's victim is in surgery Klinger has B.J. extract the bullet, which is too big to have come from the rifle Soon-Lee had. Now that she's free, Klinger, Father Mulcahy, and Soon-Lee drive to the refugee camp to find her parents. When they arrive, they are met with heartbreak. They are not Soon- Lee's parents. Rizzo and Winchester have an argument in the mess tent, and Rizzo uses his grenade prank to get back at him. Winchester throws Rizzo to safety, and then uses his body to smother the grenade. Winchester takes the grenade and says he will dispose of it safely, much to Rizzo's chagrin. When Rizzo is gone, Winchester signals to B.J., showing that they planned it to get back at Rizzo for what he did to B.J. Houlihan is holding a ceremony to bury her time capsule when Hawkeye, B.J., and Winchester arrive to bury their own. Hawkeye makes one last attempt to get some his items in Houlihan's capsule. First he offers the broken fan belt from the helicopter, saying that the pilot's heroism is something that deserves to be remembered in 100 years. Houlihan agrees, and takes the fan belt. Hawkeye then offers her Radar's teddy bear, saying it can stand for the soldiers who came as boys and went home as men. B.J. offers her a fishing lure that belonged to Henry Blake, to stand for those who never made it home. Father Mulcahy then offers her a pair of boxing gloves, saying that if countries in the future feel the need to go to war, they can use them to resolve their differences. Houlihan relents, and allows a bottle of cognac from Winchester (arguing that the cognac will have aged for over 100 years) and a little black dress from Klinger (dedicated to \\"all the women we left behind\\"). Hawkeye's time capsule is empty, with everything put into Houlihan's. Winchester asks why nothing was added to remember Frank Burns. Hawkeye jokes about including Burns' scalpel, but \\"didn't want to include any deadly weapons\\" (Hawkeye has always thought Burns was a bad surgeon and killed patients). They meet up with Klinger and Soon-Lee, and all decide to go to the Officer's Club, which is packed full. Winchester says he believes a few tables will open up soon, as he pulls the dummy grenade from his pocket. Actual M*A*S*H time capsule As this was the final episode filmed, the cast decided to take a cue from this episode and bury a real time capsule filled with props from the show. It was the hope of the cast that the time capsule would remain undisturbed for 100 years. However, they did not inform 20th Century Fox, and the company soon sold the property where the box was located, unaware of its existence. The time capsule was then dug up by a construction worker who took it home. The construction worker tried to return the time capsule to the cast, but Alan Alda told the worker to keep it.

It is Nr. 43 in the composer's catalogue of works, and lasts 96 minutes in performance. History Markus Stockhausen created the trumpet part in Sirius Sirius has been described as \\"a modern mystery play, clothed as a science fiction story\\" . While not described by the composer as an opera, it is nevertheless a musical drama, in which four emissaries from a planet orbiting the star Sirius bring a message to earth. \\"This was to be the big leap into theatre proper. . . . Sirius is the key work that leads to his magnum opus LICHT (LIGHT)\\" . When Stockhausen's daughter, Julika (aged 5 or 6 at the time), asked for a dog, he obtained one for her and named it Sirius, after the star in the constellation Canis Major, which was in his mind because he had just finished composing Sternklang (\\"Star-sound\\", 1971). Shortly afterward, he chanced upon a passage in a book by Jakob Lorber describing Sirius as the sun at the center of our universe, and this fired his imagination: > Other snippets of vitally important information then came to me through a > couple of revelatory dreams. Crazy dreams, from which it emerged that not > only did I come from Sirius itself, but that, in fact, I completed my > musical education there. Suzanne Stephens (shown with a basset horn) created the bass clarinet part in Sirius Stockhausen never explained these dreams in detail , maintaining that \\"It would lead to misunderstanding and false interpretation\\" . In the composer‚Äôs imagination, for beings from the planets of the Sirius system, \\"everything is music, or the art of co-ordination and harmony of vibrations. . . . The art is very highly developed there, and every composition on Sirius is related to the rhythms of nature . . . the seasons, the rhythms of the stars.\\" Stockhausen‚Äôs composition therefore is based on \\"the cycles and rhythms of nature‚Äîof the seasons‚Äîwith all of their characteristics, and to the planets, animals, and to the twelve main characters of human beings\\" . Sirius was commissioned by the West German government to celebrate the United States bicentenary, and is dedicated to the \\"American pioneers on earth and in space\\". Composition was begun in 1975, and the first performance was given before an invited audience at the opening of the Albert Einstein Spacearium in Washington, D.C., on 15 July 1976, though only the \\"summer\\" section had been completed by then. The \\"autumn\\" portion was added in time for performances later that year in Japan, France, Germany, and Italy. After interrupting work in order to compose the second part of his choral opera Atmen gibt das Leben and the orchestral Jubil√§um, Stockhausen finished Sirius and the premi√®re of the complete form took place on 8 August 1977 at the Aix-en-Provence Festival . Form and content Sirius is Number 43 in the composer's catalog of works, and consists of three main parts: \\"Presentation\\", \\"The Wheel\\" (subdivided into four sections, corresponding to the four seasons), and \\"Annunciation\\". The words were written by Stockhausen, except for a text by Jakob Lorber used in the Annunciation. The musical material consists of the twelve zodiac melodies of Tierkreis, Nr. 41¬Ω (1974‚Äì75), originally composed for music boxes in connection with the percussion sextet Musik im Bauch (Music in the Belly), Nr. 41 (1975). Four of these melodies are principal, each associated with one of the protagonists, and are subjected to a variety of transformations, not merely by superimposition even of metamorphosis through a system of cross- fertilization processes in which \\"one melody progressively assumes the features of another, as a series of mists and frosts 'borrowed' from winter will gradually transform the autumnal aspect of October from summer nostalgia into winter foreboding\\" . The remaining eight melodies serve a subsidiary role. In the Presentation, the four characters introduce themselves and their attributes. They are: * North (bass): Earth, Man, Night, Winter, Seed * East (trumpet): Fire, Youth, Morning, Spring, Bud * South (soprano): Water, Woman, Midday, Summer, Blossom * West (bass clarinet): Air, Friend/Beloved, Evening, Autumn, Fruit. The main, central \\"wheel\\" lasts over an hour, and can be rotated, according to the season of the performance, to produce four different forms: * Winter version, beginning with \\"Capricorn\\" * Spring version, beginning with \\"Aries\\" * Summer version, beginning with \\"Cancer\\" * Autumn version, beginning with \\"Libra\\". The total duration of Sirius is 96 minutes. The eight-channel electronic music was realized in the Electronic Music Studio of WDR, Cologne in 1975‚Äì77, using an EMS Synthi 100 synthesizer. The electronic music can be performed by itself, without the four soloists, and there are also three excerpted versions, each for a soloist with a specially prepared version of the electronic music: Aries, for trumpet (Nr. 43¬Ω, 1980), Libra, for bass clarinet (Nr. 43‚Öî), and Capricorn, for bass voice (Nr. 43¬æ).

He later served as a Confederate general officer during the American Civil War. Winder was noted for commanding prisoner-of-war camps throughout the South during the war, and for charges of improperly supplying the prisoners in his charge. Early life and career Winder was born at \\"Rewston\\" in Somerset County, Maryland, a son of U.S. Army Brig. Gen. William H. Winder and his wife Gertrude Polk.Wakelyn, p. 442.Gertrude Polk was a 1st cousin about 4 times removed to Colonel Ezekiel Polk grandfather of US President James Knox Polk. See Polk family genealogy Winder's father fought in the War of 1812, most notably, as the American commander, in the disastrous and rallying defeat at the Battle of Bladensburg and was a second cousin to future Confederate general Charles Sidney Winder.Eicher, p. 757. Winder as a U.S. Army captain In 1814, Winder entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, and graduated 11th of 30 cadets in 1820. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the artillery, and served first at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland, and then in Florida. During the early 1820s, Winder went through numerous transfers, going from the U.S. Rifle Regiment in 1820, to the 4th U.S. Artillery.Blakey's p. 76. Winder resigned his commission on August 31, 1823, and would not return to the Army for almost four years. On the 12th of February 1823, he married Elizabeth Shepherd. The next year his father died, placing him in deep economic strain, and his mother was forced to turn her home into a boardinghouse. Winder failed to manage his father-in-law's plantation successfully, and he was unable to help his mother. In 1826, Elizabeth died, leaving him to raise their young son William A. Winder, which forced him back into the U.S. Army. On April 2, 1827, Winder was reinstated as a second lieutenant, and he served in the 1st U.S. Artillery. He was promoted to first lieutenant on November 30, 1833. He taught tactics at West Point in 1827 where he met Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee, Blakey pg 85-86 but lost his position after one year having lost his temper with a cadet. Winder served as the 1st Artillery's regimental adjutant from May 23, 1838, until January 20, 1840. He was promoted to captain on October 7, 1842. Mexican-American War Winder fought with distinction in Mexico, winning brevet promotions to major on August 20, 1847 (for his conduct at the Battle of Contreras and for the Battle of Churubusco), and to lieutenant colonel on September 14 (for the Battle for Mexico City.) He was wounded in an encounter near the Bel√©n Gate when a piece of bone from the skull of one of his men scratched him in the face.Blakey, p. 103 At the battle of Chapultepec, Winder was responsible for attacking the Military Academy that was defended by Felipe Xicot√©ncatl and a few hundred cadets. While Winder's forces succeeded in either killing and capturing many of the cadets, that battle became a key part of Mexico's patriotic lore known as the Ni√±os H√©roes. In 1947, President Harry S. Truman on a visit to Mexico City made an unscheduled stop at the stone monument to the child heroes. In front of Mexican cadets standing at attention, Truman placed a floral wreath helping to heal the century old wound. American Civil War Winder resigned his U.S. Army commission on April 20, 1861 and offered his services to the state of North Carolina. He was appointed a colonel in the Confederate Army infantry on May 21st. He was then promoted to brigadier general on June 21 and the next day was made Assistant Inspector General of the Camps of Instruction that were in the Confederacy's capital of Richmond, Virginia, a post he would hold until October 21. On March 1st 1862, Jefferson Davis declared martial law in Richmond and appointed Winder provost marshal general.Blakey, p. 120 Winder designated Samuel B. Maccubbin chief of detectives and gave him a force of Plug Uglies imported from Baltimore to police the population of Richmond. Winder's first order was established prohibition of alcohol and required all citizens to surrender their firearms.Blakey, p. 122 Even though there were daily accusations or entrapment and corruption against his \\"plug-ugly\\" police force, Winder refused to order an investigation.Blakey, p. 123-124 By October of 1864 newspapers reported the crime rate in Richmond exceeded the worst days of Baltimore or New York and much of the blame went to the corrupt police force.Blakey, p. 141 This earned him the moniker \\"The Dictator of Richmond\\".Blakey, pages 119-152 In addition to his duties involving prisons, he was responsible for dealing with deserters, local law enforcement, and for a short time setting the commodity prices for the residents of a city dealing with a doubled population.Warner, p. 341. During this time, he commanded Libby Prison in Richmond as well. Libby Prison, Richmond, Virginia In April 1864, Winder appointed Captain Henry Wirz commandant of a new prison camp in Georgia called Camp Sumter, better known as the infamous Andersonville Prison. Winder commanded the Department of Henrico for much of the war, until May 5, 1864. He then commanded the 2nd District of the Department of North Carolina & Southern Virginia from May 25 until June 7. Ten days later, he briefly commanded Camp Sumter himself, until July 26. Winder then was given command of all military prisons in Georgia as well as those in Alabama until November 21, when he was put in charge of the Confederate Bureau of Prison Camps, a post which he held until his death on February 7, 1865. The assignment to run prisons in the South during the Civil War was a difficult job at best, hampered by the Confederacy's poor supply system combined with diminishing resources. In their post-war writings, some of the high level leaders of the Confederate government voiced the difficulties of Winder's assignment, saying: During the war, Winder was frequently derided in Northern newspapers, which accused him of intentionally starving Union prisoners. Military historian Ezra J. Warner believes these charges were without merit, saying, \\"Winder adopted every means at his command to assure that the prisoners received the same ration as did Confederate soldiers in the field, scanty as that allotment was.\\" However, John McElroy's eyewitness account in his 1879 memoir Andersonville appears to contradict this. McElroy depicts Winder as boasting that he was \\"killing off more Yankees than twenty regiments in Lee's Army.\\" McElroy claims that on July 27, 1864, Winder issued an order that if Union troops (under General Stoneman) were to come within seven miles of Andersonville, the guards were to \\"open upon the Stockade [i.e. upon the prisoners] with grapeshot, without reference to the situation beyond these lines of defense.\\" The major causes of the high mortality rates in Andersonville, Florence, and other prisons overseen by Winder were scurvy (which is easily avoided with inexpensive food sources of vitamin C) and exposure. Most prisoners had to sleep on the ground, even in freezing weather. The camp was in a wilderness area surrounded by forest, but the prisoners generally were not permitted to build huts or make campfires to cook their daily ration ‚Äî about a pint of poorly ground corn meal. At the post-war trial of Captain Henry Wirz, who was in charge of Andersonville, dozens of nearby residents testified that there was plenty of food available in that part of Georgia at the time.

Holmes County Board of Education, 396 U.S. 19 (1969), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ordered immediate desegregation of public schools in the American South. It followed 15 years of delays to integrate by most Southern school boards after the Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregated public schools were unconstitutional.  Background  Justice Felix Frankfurter demanded that the opinion in 1955's Brown v. Board of Education II order desegregation with \\"all deliberate speed\\". The South took it as an excuse to emphasize \\"deliberate\\" over \\"speed\\" and conducted resistance to desegregating schools, in some jurisdictions closing public schools altogether. For fifteen years, schools in the South remained segregated. In 1968, freedom of choice plans had been condemned by the Supreme Court in Green v. County School Board of New Kent County.  Case   Holmes County  Beatrice Alexander, mother of children, sued the Holmes County, Mississippi School District, arguing the District didn't do any meaningful attempt to integrate its schools, basing her opinion on the small number of black pupils in mainly White schools.  Procedural history  Early in the summer of 1969, the federal appeals court had asked the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) to submit desegregation plans for thirty-three school districts in Mississippi including Holmes County School District, so HEW could order them implemented at the beginning of the school year. HEW was responsible for drawing up desegregation plans, as mandated by the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and had submitted the plans on time. At the last minute, however, both HEW and the Justice Department asked Judge William Harold Cox for extensions until December 1, claiming that the plans would result in confusion and setbacks. This was the first time the federal government had supported a desegregation delay in the federal courts. The Fifth Circuit granted the delay, and no specific date for implementing the desegregation plans was set. Justice Hugo Black, the supervisory Justice for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and senior Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, considered this delay to be Nixon's payoff to the South, after its electoral support had helped him win the presidential election, and as part of his \\"Southern Strategy\\" of appealing to conservative whites. The NAACP Legal Defense Fund contacted Black to contest the delay in desegregation.On September 3, Black received a memo from the Justice Department - Solicitor General Griswold was urging Black to permit the Mississippi delay.Black reluctantly permitted the delay as supervisory Justice, but invited the NAACP Legal Defense Fund to bring the case to the Supreme Court as soon as possible. The case was brought as Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education.  Issue at question  The desegregation orders of Brown I and Brown II had not been followed for more than a decade, and schools in the South were desegregating slowly if at all. During lower court battles over segregation, school districts would remain segregated until all appeals were exhausted. The petitioners and others suing the Holmes County Board of Education in Mississippi for failure to desegregate, were represented by Jack Greenberg. They asked the Court to order the original HEW plans to be implemented, and proposed that the Court shift the burden of proof, making desegregation the main objective of plans.  Internal Court deliberations  New Chief Justice Warren Burger, appointed by President Nixon, did not at first think that the requested delay was unreasonable. Senior Associate Justice Hugo Black thought that allowing any delay was a signal to the South to further delay desegregation; he suggested a short, simple order mandating immediate integration, with no mention of debate over plans or delay. He threatened to dissent from any opinion mentioning the word \\"plan,\\" which would shatter a much-desired unanimous Court opinion. Justice William O. Douglas supported Black. Justice Harlan did not support any notion of \\"immediate desegregation\\", but he did support overturning the Fifth Circuit's delay. Justices Stewart, White, and Brennan were all initially put off by Black's demands for immediate desegregation. Justice Thurgood Marshall, the Court's only African American, suggested an implementation deadline of January, the beginning of the next school semester. A majority of justices agreed on three elements: # reversing the appeals court's decisions to grant a delay in the submission of plans # keeping the Court of Appeals in control # excluding the federal district court from a role due to its years of allowing stalling. Warren Burger, along with Justices White and Harlan, drafted an early opinion with no \\"outside\\" deadline, but the court's three most liberal justices - Brennan, Marshall, and Douglas - rejected that draft, knowing it would be unacceptable to Justice Black. The basic Court breakdown was four in favor of immediate desegregation and no full Court opinion (Black, Douglas, Brennan, and Marshall), and another four wanting a more practical, less absolute opinion. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.'s draft, made with the help of justices Douglas and Marshall, and later presented to Justice Black, ordered immediate desegregation. It later was adopted as the Court's final opinion, with some edits by Harlan and Burger.  Opinion of the Court  The final opinion was a two-page per curiam that reflected the initial demands of Justice Black. The Court wrote, \\"The obligation of every school district is to terminate dual school systems at once and to operate now and hereafter only unitary schools.\\" The previously set pace of \\"all deliberate speed\\" was no longer permissible.  Subsequent developments  The decision was announced on October 29.  Political reactions  Republican Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina decried the decision, while praising President Richard Nixon for having \\"stood with the South in this case\\" while former Alabama Governor George Wallace said the new Burger court was \\"no better than the Warren Court,\\" and called the Justices \\"limousine hypocrites.\\" Sam Ervin filed an amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which failed, stating freedom of choice was the standard for integration. The decision came as a surprise to the Nixon administration, which had previously referred to those calling for immediate integration as an \\"extreme group.\\" In Mississippi, Governor John Bell Williams promised the establishment of a private school system, but advised against violence. This position was pushed by Jimmy Swan while William K. Scarborough advocated nullification. Demonstrations against this decision were held. To the opposite of this, a group of Protestant, Catholic and Jewish clerics backed integration. In order to smooth the transition, Federal agents were sent. Ted Kennedy expressed satisfaction to the ruling while Hugh Scott wanted to raise the funding of the HEW to give them the resources needed to implement Alexander. Some districts tried to set up single-sex education in their schools.  Effects in Holmes County  The Supreme Court's effort to integrate the Holmes County School District was unsuccessful. In 1968 there were 771 white students in the county school system. Desegregation occurred in 1969, and that year the white student population decreased to 228. In 1970 no white students were enrolled. Over 99% of students attending public schools in Holmes County are black. White students attended East Holmes Academy and Central Holmes Christian School, privately controlled segregation academies.

It is, de jure, part of Agdam Rayon in the Republic of Azerbaijan.  Geography  The village of Nor Ghazanchi was founded on the left bank of the Xa√ßƒ±n River in the mountainous regions of Murovdaƒü. It's total area is 2181 hectares of which 487ha are of agricultural significance and 1582ha consists of forest lands. The village is located on the Aƒüd…ôr…ô-Xank…ôndi mountain road, which was built in the early 1960s. Nor Ghazanchi is 30 km away from Aƒüdam and Mardakert and 40 km away from Stepanakert.  History   Before the collapse of the USSR  The current village was founded in the 17th century, but the ancient landscape shows that it was a settlement since the 12th century. A church, Gevorg Church was built in the 19th century, but was later destroyed. There are numerous khachkars and ancient gravestones in the surroundings of Tunis Beekeeper, Beacarac sacred places, the Red Kala, the Aristamz bar, the Jalalants bath and other places. 167 people took part in the WW II, 65 were killed, in memory of which the monument is erected The collective was formed in 1931 and was electrified in 1963. Until the collapse of the USSR it was part of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO), established in 1923. In April 1991, in connection with the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the Sƒ±rxav…ônd territorial executive committee was established by the decision of the then government of the Azerbaijan. The goal was to create a management center for 12 Azerbaijani villages in Aƒüd…ôr…ô (today Martakert) with Sƒ±rxav…ônd as its administrative center, homing the territorial police department, the agricultural department, the education department, a logistics supply base, an automotive base, two road repair office and more. Various enterprises were created and started operating. In December 1991, the village self-defense battalion was created officially, appointing B…ôhm…ôn M…ômm…ôdov head of the battalion.  During the Nagorno-Karabakh-war  The village was occupied by Armenian Armed Forces on March 12, 1992, together with other Aƒüd…ôr…ô villages of Azerbaijan - B…ô≈üirl…ôr, Qara≈ülar, Ba≈ü G√ºneyp…ôy…ô, Orta G√ºney, Xatƒ±nb…ôyli and the surrounding territory. From then on, until the cease-fire, there haven been various attempts by Azerbaijan to recapture the territory, in one of these attempts, on November 2, 1992, the \\"National Hero of Azerbaijan\\" Anvar Talish oglu Arazov was killed there.  Population   Azeri population  Nor Ghazanchi was the largest village in the Rayon inhabited by Azerbaijanis, with about 2,000 inhabitants and about 250 houses according to Azerbaijan sources and according to Armenian sources at the beginning of the 1990s there were 35 houses, 325 residents, 89 houses in 1970, 455 residents, 75 houses in 1987, 260 inhabitants. Indeed, since the first day of the NKAO since 1923, it, like other villages finding itself in the heart of the Autonomous Oblast, have been exposed to hidden migration, especially in the early 1950s. For ten years, no work has been done for socio-economic and cultural development of the Azerbaijani villages, new jobs have not been created, specialists have not been provided with jobs, and as a result, thousands of Azerbaijanis were driven to migrate from the region due to the socio-economic difficulties.

Edward was born during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria as the eldest child of the Duke and Duchess of York, later King George V and Queen Mary. He was created Prince of Wales on his sixteenth birthday, seven weeks after his father succeeded as king. As a young man, Edward served in the British Army during the First World War and undertook several overseas tours on behalf of his father. While Prince of Wales, he engaged in a series of affairs that worried his father and the British prime minister, Stanley Baldwin. Edward became king on his father's death. As king, he showed impatience with court protocol, and caused concern among politicians by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions. Only months into his reign, he caused a constitutional crisis by proposing to Wallis Simpson, an American who had divorced her first husband and was seeking a divorce from her second. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective queen consort. Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as the titular head of the Church of England, which at the time disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive. Edward knew the Baldwin government would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would have ruined his status as a politically neutral constitutional monarch. When it became apparent he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne, he abdicated. He was succeeded by his younger brother, George VI. With a reign of 326 days, Edward is one of the shortest-reigning monarchs in British history. After his abdication, Edward was created Duke of Windsor. He married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937, after her second divorce became final. Later that year, the couple toured Germany. During the Second World War, Edward was at first stationed with the British Military Mission to France, but after private accusations that he was a Nazi sympathiser, he was appointed Governor of the Bahamas. After the war, Edward spent the rest of his life in retirement in France. He and Wallis remained married until his death in 1972. Wallis died 14 years later.  Early life  his father and younger siblings (Albert and Mary), photograph by his grandmother Alexandra, 1899 Edward was born on 23 June 1894 at White Lodge, Richmond Park, on the outskirts of London during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria.Windsor, p. 1 He was the eldest son of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George V and Queen Mary). His father was the son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). His mother was the eldest daughter of Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge and Francis, Duke of Teck. At the time of his birth, he was third in the line of succession to the throne, behind his grandfather and father. He was baptised Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David in the Green Drawing Room of White Lodge on 16 July 1894 by Edward White Benson, Archbishop of Canterbury. The names were chosen in honour of Edward's late uncle, who was known to his family as \\"Eddy\\" or Edward, and his great- grandfather King Christian IX of Denmark. The name Albert was included at the behest of Queen Victoria for her late husband Albert, Prince Consort, and the last four names ‚Äì George, Andrew, Patrick and David ‚Äì came from the patron saints of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales.Ziegler, p. 5 He was always known to his family and close friends by his last given name, David.Ziegler, p. 6 As was common practice with upper-class children of the time, Edward and his younger siblings were brought up by nannies rather than directly by their parents. One of Edward's early nannies often abused him by pinching him before he was due to be presented to his parents. His subsequent crying and wailing would lead the Duke and Duchess to send him and the nanny away.Windsor, p. 7; Ziegler, p. 9 The nanny was discharged after her mistreatment of the children was discovered, and she was replaced by Charlotte Bill.Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 16‚Äì17 Edward's father, though a harsh disciplinarian,Windsor, pp. 25‚Äì28 was demonstratively affectionate,Ziegler, pp. 30‚Äì31 and his mother displayed a frolicsome side with her children that belied her austere public image. She was amused by the children making tadpoles on toast for their French master as a prank,Windsor, pp. 38‚Äì39 and encouraged them to confide in her.Ziegler, p. 79  Education  HMS Hindustan, 1910 Initially, Edward was tutored at home by Helen Bricka. When his parents travelled the British Empire for almost nine months following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, young Edward and his siblings stayed in Britain with their grandparents, Queen Alexandra and King Edward VII, who showered their grandchildren with affection. Upon his parents' return, Edward was placed under the care of two men, Frederick Finch and Henry Hansell, who virtually brought up Edward and his brothers and sister for their remaining nursery years.Parker, pp. 12‚Äì13 Edward was kept under the strict tutorship of Hansell until almost thirteen years old. Private tutors taught him German and French. Edward took the examination to enter the Royal Naval College, Osborne, and began there in 1907. Hansell had wanted Edward to enter school earlier, but the prince's father had disagreed.Parker, pp. 13‚Äì14 Following two years at Osborne College, which he did not enjoy, Edward moved on to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. A course of two years, followed by entry into the Royal Navy, was planned. Edward automatically became Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay on 6 May 1910 when his father ascended the throne as George V on the death of Edward VII. He was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester a month later on 23 June 1910, his 16th birthday. Preparations for his future as king began in earnest. He was withdrawn from his naval course before his formal graduation, served as midshipman for three months aboard the battleship Hindustan, then immediately entered Magdalen College, Oxford, for which, in the opinion of his biographers, he was underprepared intellectually. A keen horseman, he learned how to play polo with the university club. He left Oxford after eight terms, without any academic qualifications.Parker, pp. 14‚Äì16  Prince of Wales  Edward was officially invested as Prince of Wales in a special ceremony at Caernarfon Castle on 13 July 1911. The investiture took place in Wales, at the instigation of the Welsh politician David Lloyd George, Constable of the Castle and Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Liberal government.Windsor, p. 78 Lloyd George invented a rather fanciful ceremony in the style of a Welsh pageant, and coached Edward to speak a few words in Welsh.Ziegler, pp. 26‚Äì27 Edward during the First World War When the First World War broke out in 1914, Edward had reached the minimum age for active service and was keen to participate.Windsor, pp. 106‚Äì107 and Ziegler, pp. 48‚Äì50 He had joined the Grenadier Guards in June 1914, and although Edward was willing to serve on the front lines, Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener refused to allow it, citing the immense harm that would occur if the heir apparent to the throne were captured by the enemy.Roberts, p. 41 and Windsor, p. 109 Despite this, Edward witnessed trench warfare first-hand and visited the front line as often as he could, for which he was awarded the Military Cross in 1916. His role in the war, although limited, made him popular among veterans of the conflict.Ziegler, p. 111 and Windsor, p. 140 He undertook his first military flight in 1918, and later gained a pilot's licence. Edward's youngest brother, Prince John, died at the age of 13 on 18 January 1919 after a severe epileptic seizure.\\"Death of Youngest Son of King and Queen\\". Daily Mirror. 20 January 1919. p. 2. Edward, who was 11 years older than John and had hardly known him, saw his death as \\"little more than a regrettable nuisance\\".Ziegler, p. 80 He wrote to his mistress of the time that \\"[he had] told [her] all about that little brother, and how he was an epileptic. [John]'s been practically shut up for the last two years anyhow, so no one has ever seen him except the family, and then only once or twice a year. This poor boy had become more of an animal than anything else.\\" He also wrote an insensitive letter to his mother which has since been lost.Tizley, Paul (director) (2008), Prince John: The Windsors' Tragic Secret (Documentary), London: Channel 4, retrieved 26 April 2017 She did not reply, but he felt compelled to write her an apology, in which he stated: \\"I feel such a cold hearted and unsympathetic swine for writing all that I did ... No one can realize more than you how little poor Johnnie meant to me who hardly knew him ... I feel so much for you, darling Mama, who was his mother.\\" Edward in Ashburton, New Zealand with returned servicemen, 1920 Throughout the 1920s, Edward, as the Prince of Wales, represented his father at home and abroad on many occasions. His rank, travels, good looks, and unmarried status gained him much public attention. At the height of his popularity, he was the most photographed celebrity of his time and he set men's fashion. During his 1924 visit to the United States, Men's Wear magazine observed, \\"The average young man in America is more interested in the clothes of the Prince of Wales than in any other individual on earth.\\" Edward visited poverty-stricken areas of Britain,Windsor, p. 215 and undertook 16 tours to various parts of the Empire between 1919 and 1935. On a tour of Canada in 1919, he acquired the Bedingfield ranch, near Pekisko, Alberta, and in 1924, he donated the Prince of Wales Trophy to the National Hockey League. In 1929 Sir Alexander Leith, a leading Conservative in the north of England, persuaded him to make a three-day visit to the County Durham and Northumberland coalfields, where there was much unemployment.Windsor, pp. 226‚Äì228 From January to April 1931, the Prince of Wales and his brother Prince George travelled on a tour of South America, steaming out on the ocean liner , and returning via Paris and an Imperial Airways flight from Paris‚ÄìLe Bourget Airport that landed specially in Windsor Great Park. Though widely travelled, Edward shared a widely held racial prejudice against foreigners and many of the Empire's subjects, believing that whites were inherently superior.Ziegler, pp. 158, 448 In 1920, on a visit to Australia, he wrote of Indigenous Australians: \\"they are the most revolting form of living creatures I've ever seen!! They are the lowest known form of human beings & are the nearest thing to monkeys.\\" In 1919, Edward agreed to be president of the organising committee for the proposed British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Park, Middlesex. He wished the Exhibition to include \\"a great national sports ground\\", and so played a part in the creation of Wembley Stadium.  Romances  Portrait by Reginald Grenville Eves, c. 1920 By 1917, Edward liked to spend time partying in Paris while he was on leave from his regiment on the Western Front. He was introduced to Parisian courtesan Marguerite Alibert, with whom he became infatuated. He wrote her candid letters, which she kept. After about a year, Edward broke off the affair. In 1923, Alibert was acquitted in a spectacular murder trial after she shot her husband in the Savoy Hotel. Desperate efforts were made by the Royal Household to ensure that Edward's name was not mentioned in connection with the trial or Alibert. reviewed in See also: Godfrey, pp. 138, 143, 299; Ziegler, pp. 89‚Äì90 Edward's womanising and reckless behaviour during the 1920s and 1930s worried Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, King George V, and those close to the prince. George V was disappointed by his son's failure to settle down in life, disgusted by his affairs with married women, and reluctant to see him inherit the Crown. \\"After I am dead,\\" George said, \\"the boy will ruin himself in twelve months.\\" George V favoured his second son Albert (\\"Bertie\\") and Albert's daughter Elizabeth (\\"Lilibet\\"), later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II respectively. He told a courtier, \\"I pray to God that my eldest son will never marry and have children, and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne.\\" In 1929, Time magazine reported that Edward teased Albert's wife, also named Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother), by calling her \\"Queen Elizabeth\\". The magazine asked if \\"she did not sometimes wonder how much truth there is in the story that he once said he would renounce his rights upon the death of George V ‚Äì which would make her nickname come true\\". Thelma Furness and the Prince of Wales in 1932 In 1930, George V gave Edward the lease of Fort Belvedere in Windsor Great Park.Windsor, p. 235 There, he continued his relationships with a series of married women, including Freda Dudley Ward and Lady Furness, the American wife of a British peer, who introduced the prince to her friend and fellow American Wallis Simpson. Simpson had divorced her first husband, U.S. naval officer Win Spencer, in 1927. Her second husband, Ernest Simpson, was a British-American businessman. Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales, it is generally accepted, became lovers, while Lady Furness travelled abroad, although the prince adamantly insisted to his father that he was not having an affair with her and that it was not appropriate to describe her as his mistress.Ziegler, p. 233 Edward's relationship with Simpson, however, further weakened his poor relationship with his father. Although his parents met Simpson at Buckingham Palace in 1935,Windsor, p. 255 they later refused to receive her.Bradford, p. 142 Edward's affair with an American divorc√©e led to such grave concern that the couple were followed by members of the Metropolitan Police Special Branch, who examined in secret the nature of their relationship. An undated report detailed a visit by the couple to an antique shop, where the proprietor later noted \\"that the lady seemed to have POW [Prince of Wales] completely under her thumb.\\" The prospect of having an American divorc√©e with a questionable past having such sway over the heir apparent led to anxiety among government and establishment figures.Ziegler, pp. 231‚Äì234  Reign  Edward VIII surrounded by heralds of the College of Arms prior to his only State Opening of Parliament, 3 November 1936 King George V died on 20 January 1936, and Edward ascended the throne as King Edward VIII. The next day, accompanied by Simpson, he broke with custom by watching the proclamation of his own accession from a window of St James's Palace.Windsor, p. 265; Ziegler, p. 245 He became the first monarch of the British Empire to fly in an aircraft when he flew from Sandringham to London for his Accession Council.Matthew, H. C. G. (September 2004; online edition January 2008) \\"Edward VIII, later Prince Edward, duke of Windsor (1894‚Äì1972)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, , retrieved 1 May 2010 (Subscription required) Edward caused unease in government circles with actions that were interpreted as interference in political matters. His comment during a tour of depressed villages in South Wales that \\"something must be done\\" for the unemployed coal miners was seen as an attempt to guide government policy, though it has never been clear what sort of remedy he had in mind. Government ministers were reluctant to send confidential documents and state papers to Fort Belvedere, because it was clear that Edward was paying little attention to them, and it was feared that Simpson and other house guests might read them, improperly or inadvertently revealing government secrets.Ziegler, pp. 273‚Äì274 Edward's unorthodox approach to his role also extended to the coinage that bore his image. He broke with the tradition that the profile portrait of each successive monarch faced in the direction opposite to that of his or her predecessor. Edward insisted that he face left (as his father had done),Windsor, pp. 293‚Äì294 to show the parting in his hair.A. Michie, God Save The Queen Only a handful of test coins were struck before the abdication, and all are very rare. When George VI succeeded to the throne he also faced left to maintain the tradition by suggesting that, had any further coins been minted featuring Edward's portrait, they would have shown him facing right. Left-facing coinage portrait of Edward VIII On 16 July 1936, an Irish fraudster called Jerome Bannigan, alias George Andrew McMahon, produced a loaded revolver as Edward rode on horseback at Constitution Hill, near Buckingham Palace. Police spotted the gun and pounced on him; he was quickly arrested. At Bannigan's trial, he alleged that \\"a foreign power\\" had approached him to kill Edward, that he had informed MI5 of the plan, and that he was merely seeing the plan through to help MI5 catch the real culprits. The court rejected the claims and sent him to jail for a year for \\"intent to alarm\\". It is now thought that Bannigan had indeed been in contact with MI5, but the veracity of the remainder of his claims remains open. In August and September, Edward and Simpson cruised the Eastern Mediterranean on the steam yacht Nahlin. By October it was becoming clear that the new king planned to marry Simpson, especially when divorce proceedings between the Simpsons were brought at Ipswich Assizes.Broad, pp. 56‚Äì57 Although gossip about his affair was widespread in the United States, the British media kept voluntarily silent, and the general public knew nothing until early December.Broad, pp. 44‚Äì47; Windsor, pp. 314‚Äì315, 351‚Äì353; Ziegler, pp. 294‚Äì296, 307‚Äì308  Abdication  Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson on their Mediterranean holiday, 1936 On 16 November 1936, Edward invited Prime Minister Baldwin to Buckingham Palace and expressed his desire to marry Simpson when she became free to remarry. Baldwin informed him that his subjects would deem the marriage morally unacceptable, largely because remarriage after divorce was opposed by the Church of England, and the people would not tolerate Simpson as queen.Windsor, pp. 330‚Äì331 As king, Edward was the titular head of the Church, and the clergy expected him to support the Church's teachings. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Gordon Lang, was vocal in insisting that Edward must go. Edward proposed an alternative solution of a morganatic marriage, in which he would remain king but Simpson would not become queen consort. She would enjoy some lesser title instead, and any children they might have would not inherit the throne. This was supported by senior politician Winston Churchill in principle, and some historians suggest that he conceived the plan. In any event, it was ultimately rejected by the British CabinetWindsor, p. 346 as well as other Dominion governments.Windsor, p. 354 Their views were sought pursuant to the Statute of Westminster 1931, which provided in part that \\"any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\\" The Prime Ministers of Australia (Joseph Lyons), Canada (Mackenzie King) and South Africa (J. B. M. Hertzog) made clear their opposition to the king marrying a divorc√©e;Ziegler, pp. 305‚Äì307 their Irish counterpart (√âamon de Valera) expressed indifference and detachment, while the Prime Minister of New Zealand (Michael Joseph Savage), having never heard of Simpson before, vacillated in disbelief.Bradford, p. 187 Faced with this opposition, Edward at first responded that there were \\"not many people in Australia\\" and their opinion did not matter.Bradford, p. 188 Cypher on postbox erected during his short reign Edward informed Baldwin that he would abdicate if he could not marry Simpson. Baldwin then presented Edward with three options: give up the idea of marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate.Windsor, pp. 354‚Äì355 It was clear that Edward was not prepared to give up Simpson, and he knew that if he married against the advice of his ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis. He chose to abdicate.Windsor, p. 387 Edward duly signed the instruments of abdication at Fort Belvedere on 10 December 1936 in the presence of his younger brothers: Prince Albert, Duke of York, next in line for the throne; Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; and Prince George, Duke of Kent.Windsor, p. 407 The document included these words: \\"declare my irrevocable determination to renounce the throne for myself and for my descendants and my desire that effect should be given to this instrument of abdication immediately\\". The next day, the last act of his reign was the royal assent to His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936. As required by the Statute of Westminster, all the Dominions had already consented to the abdication. On the night of 11 December 1936, Edward, now reverted to the title and style of a prince, explained his decision to abdicate in a worldwide radio broadcast. He famously said, \\"I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.\\" He added that the \\"decision was mine and mine alone ... The other person most nearly concerned has tried up to the last to persuade me to take a different course\\". Edward departed Britain for Austria the following day; he was unable to join Simpson until her divorce became absolute, several months later.Ziegler, p. 336 His brother, the Duke of York, succeeded to the throne as George VI. George VI's elder daughter, Princess Elizabeth, became heir presumptive.  Duke of Windsor  On 12 December 1936, at the accession meeting of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, George VI announced he was to make his brother the \\"Duke of Windsor\\" with the style of Royal Highness. He wanted this to be the first act of his reign, although the formal documents were not signed until 8 March the following year. During the interim, Edward was universally known as the Duke of Windsor. George VI's decision to create Edward a royal duke ensured that he could neither stand for election to the British House of Commons nor speak on political subjects in the House of Lords.Clive Wigram's conversation with Sir Claud Schuster, Clerk to the Crown and Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor quoted in Bradford, p. 201 Letters Patent dated 27 May 1937 re-conferred the \\"title, style, or attribute of Royal Highness\\" upon the Duke, but specifically stated that \\"his wife and descendants, if any, shall not hold said title or attribute\\". Some British ministers advised that the reconfirmation was unnecessary since Edward had retained the style automatically, and further that Simpson would automatically obtain the rank of wife of a prince with the style Her Royal Highness; others maintained that he had lost all royal rank and should no longer carry any royal title or style as an abdicated king, and be referred to simply as \\"Mr Edward Windsor\\". On 14 April 1937, Attorney General Sir Donald Somervell submitted to Home Secretary Sir John Simon a memorandum summarising the views of Lord Advocate T. M. Cooper, Parliamentary Counsel Sir Granville Ram, and himself: Ch√¢teau de Cand√©, the Windsors' wedding venue The Duke married Simpson, who had changed her name by deed poll to Wallis Warfield, in a private ceremony on 3 June 1937, at Ch√¢teau de Cand√©, near Tours, France. When the Church of England refused to sanction the union, a County Durham clergyman, the Reverend Robert Anderson Jardine (Vicar of St Paul's, Darlington), offered to perform the ceremony, and the Duke accepted. George VI forbade members of the royal family to attend, to the lasting resentment of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Edward had particularly wanted his brothers the Dukes of Gloucester and Kent and his second cousin Lord Louis Mountbatten to attend the ceremony.Ziegler, pp. 354‚Äì355 The denial of the style Royal Highness to the Duchess of Windsor caused further conflict, as did the financial settlement. The Government declined to include the Duke or Duchess on the Civil List, and the Duke's allowance was paid personally by George VI. The Duke compromised his position with his brother by concealing the extent of his financial worth when they informally agreed on the amount of the allowance. Edward's wealth had accumulated from the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall paid to him as Prince of Wales and ordinarily at the disposal of an incoming king. George VI also paid Edward for Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle, which were Edward's personal property, inherited from his father and thus did not automatically pass to George VI on his accession.Ziegler, pp. 376‚Äì378 In the early days of George VI's reign the Duke telephoned daily, importuning for money and urging that the Duchess be granted the style of Royal Highness, until the harassed king ordered that the calls not be put through.Ziegler, p. 349 Relations between the Duke of Windsor and the rest of the royal family were strained for decades. The Duke had assumed that he would settle in Britain after a year or two of exile in France. King George VI (with the support of Queen Mary and his wife Queen Elizabeth) threatened to cut off Edward's allowance if he returned to Britain without an invitation. Edward became embittered against his mother, Queen Mary, writing to her in 1939: \\"[your last letter] destroy[ed] the last vestige of feeling I had left for you ... [and has] made further normal correspondence between us impossible.\\"Ziegler, p. 384 The Duke and Duchess with Adolf Hitler, 1937 SS guards with Robert Ley, 1937 The Duke and Duchess at Hitler's mountain retreat at Berchtesgaden in the Bavarian Alps, 1937 In October 1937, the Duke and Duchess visited Nazi Germany, against the advice of the British government, and met Adolf Hitler at his Berghof retreat in Bavaria. The visit was much publicised by the German media. During the visit the Duke gave full Nazi salutes.Donaldson, pp. 331‚Äì332 In Germany, \\"they were treated like royalty ... members of the aristocracy would bow and curtsy towards her, and she was treated with all the dignity and status that the duke always wanted\\", according to royal biographer Andrew Morton in a 2016 BBC interview. The former Austrian ambassador, Count Albert von Mensdorff-Pouilly-Dietrichstein, who was also a second cousin once removed and friend of George V, believed that Edward favoured German fascism as a bulwark against communism, and even that he initially favoured an alliance with Germany.Papers of Count Albert von Mensdorff-Pouilly-Dietrichstein (1861‚Äì1945) in the State Archives, Vienna, quoted in According to the Duke of Windsor, the experience of \\"the unending scenes of horror\\"Windsor, p. 122 during the First World War led him to support appeasement. Hitler considered Edward to be friendly towards Germany and thought that Anglo-German relations could have been improved through Edward if it were not for the abdication. Albert Speer quoted Hitler directly: \\"I am certain through him permanent friendly relations could have been achieved. If he had stayed, everything would have been different. His abdication was a severe loss for us.\\" The Duke and Duchess settled in France.  Second World War  In May 1939, the Duke was commissioned by NBC to give a radio broadcast (his first since abdicating) during a visit to the World War I battlefields of Verdun. In it he appealed for peace, saying \\"I am deeply conscious of the presence of the great company of the dead, and I am convinced that could they make their voices heard they would be with me in what I am about to say. I speak simply as a soldier of the Last War whose most earnest prayer it is that such cruel and destructive madness shall never again overtake mankind. There is no land whose people want war.\\" The broadcast was heard across the world by millions.David Reynolds, \\"Verdun ‚Äì The Sacred Wound\\", episode 2. BBC Radio 4, first broadcast 24 February 2016.Terry Charman, \\"The Day We Went to War\\", 2009, p. 28. It was widely seen as supporting appeasement,Bradford, p. 285 and the BBC refused to broadcast it.Bradford, p. 285; Ziegler, pp. 398‚Äì399 It was broadcast outside the United States on shortwave radioThe Times, 8 May 1939, p. 13 and was reported in full by British broadsheet newspapers.e.g. The Times, 9 May 1939, p. 13 On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the Duke and Duchess were brought back to Britain by Louis Mountbatten on board HMS Kelly, and Edward, although an honorary field marshal, was made a major-general attached to the British Military Mission in France. In February 1940, the German ambassador in The Hague, Count Julius von Zech-Burkersroda, claimed that the Duke had leaked the Allied war plans for the defence of Belgium,No. 621: Minister Zech to State Secretary Weizs√§cker, 19 February 1940, in Documents on German Foreign Policy 1918‚Äì1945 (1954), Series D, Volume VIII, p. 785, quoted in Bradford, p. 434 which the Duke later denied. When Germany invaded the north of France in May 1940, the Windsors fled south, first to Biarritz, then in June to Francoist Spain. In July the pair moved to Portugal, where they lived at first in the home of Ricardo Esp√≠rito Santo, a Portuguese banker with both British and German contacts.Bloch, p. 91 Under the code name Operation Willi, Nazi agents, principally Walter Schellenberg, plotted unsuccessfully to persuade the Duke to leave Portugal and return to Spain, kidnapping him if necessary.Bloch, pp. 86, 102; Ziegler, pp. 430‚Äì432 Lord Caldecote wrote a warning to Winston Churchill, who by this point was prime minister: \\"[the Duke] is well-known to be pro-Nazi and he may become a centre of intrigue.\\"Ziegler, p. 434 Churchill threatened the Duke with a court-martial if he did not return to British soil.Bloch, p. 93 In July 1940, Edward was appointed Governor of the Bahamas. The Duke and Duchess left Lisbon on 1 August aboard the American Export Lines steamship Excalibur, which was specially diverted from its usual direct course to New York City so that they could be dropped off at Bermuda on the 9th.Bloch, pp. 93‚Äì94, 98‚Äì103, 119 They left Bermuda for Nassau on the Canadian steamship Lady Somers on 15 August, arriving two days later.Bloch, p. 119; Ziegler, pp. 441‚Äì442 The Duke did not enjoy being governor and privately referred to the islands as \\"a third-class British colony\\".Bloch, p. 364 The British Foreign Office strenuously objected when the Duke and Duchess planned to cruise aboard a yacht belonging to a Swedish magnate, Axel Wenner-Gren, whom British and American intelligence wrongly believed to be a close friend of Luftwaffe commander Hermann G√∂ring.Bloch, pp. 154‚Äì159, 230‚Äì233; The Duke was praised for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands, although he was as contemptuous of the Bahamians as he was of most non-white peoples of the Empire. He said of √âtienne Dupuch, the editor of the Nassau Daily Tribune: \\"It must be remembered that Dupuch is more than half Negro, and due to the peculiar mentality of this Race, they seem unable to rise to prominence without losing their equilibrium.\\"Ziegler, p. 448 He was praised, even by Dupuch, for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in Nassau in 1942, even though he blamed the trouble on \\"mischief makers ‚Äì communists\\" and \\"men of Central European Jewish descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draft\\".Ziegler, pp. 471‚Äì472 He resigned from the post on 16 March 1945. Many historians have suggested that Hitler was prepared to reinstate Edward as king in the hope of establishing a fascist Britain.Ziegler, p. 392 It is widely believed that the Duke and Duchess sympathised with fascism before and during the Second World War, and were moved to the Bahamas to minimise their opportunities to act on those feelings. In 1940 he said: \\"In the past 10 years Germany has totally reorganised the order of its society ... Countries which were unwilling to accept such a reorganisation of society and its concomitant sacrifices should direct their policies accordingly.\\"Bloch, pp. 79‚Äì80 During the occupation of France, the Duke asked the German forces to place guards at his Paris and Riviera homes; they did so.Roberts, p. 52 In December 1940, the Duke gave Fulton Oursler of Liberty magazine an interview at Government House in Nassau. Oursler conveyed its content to the President in a private meeting at the White House on 23 December 1940. The interview was published on 22 March 1941 and in it the Duke was reported to have said that \\"Hitler was the right and logical leader of the German people\\" and that the time was coming for President Franklin D. Roosevelt to mediate a peace settlement. The Duke protested that he had been misquoted and misinterpreted.Bloch, p. 178 The Allies became sufficiently disturbed by German plots revolving around the Duke that President Roosevelt ordered covert surveillance of the Duke and Duchess when they visited Palm Beach, Florida, in April 1941. Duke Carl Alexander of W√ºrttemberg (then a monk in an American monastery) had told the Federal Bureau of Investigation that the Duchess had slept with the German ambassador in London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, in 1936, had remained in constant contact with him, and had continued to leak secrets. Author Charles Higham claimed that Anthony Blunt, an MI5 agent and Soviet spy, acting on orders from the British royal family, made a successful secret trip to Schloss Friedrichshof in Germany towards the end of the war to retrieve sensitive letters between the Duke of Windsor and Adolf Hitler and other leading Nazis.Higham, Charles (1988), The Duchess of Windsor: The Secret Life, New York: McGraw-Hill Publishers, pp. 388‚Äì389 What is certain is that George VI sent the Royal Librarian, Owen Morshead, accompanied by Blunt, then working part-time in the Royal Library as well as for British intelligence, to Friedrichshof in March 1945 to secure papers relating to the German Empress Victoria, the eldest child of Queen Victoria. Looters had stolen part of the castle's archive, including surviving letters between daughter and mother, as well as other valuables, some of which were recovered in Chicago after the war. The papers rescued by Morshead and Blunt, and those returned by the American authorities from Chicago, were deposited in the Royal Archives.Bradford, p. 426 In the late 1950s, documents recovered by U.S. troops in Marburg, Germany, in May 1945, since titled The Marburg Files, were published following more than a decade of suppression, enhancing theories of the Duke's sympathies for Nazi ideologies. After the war, the Duke admitted in his memoirs that he admired the Germans, but he denied being pro-Nazi. Of Hitler he wrote: \\"[the] F√ºhrer struck me as a somewhat ridiculous figure, with his theatrical posturings and his bombastic pretensions.\\"Windsor, p. 277 In the 1950s, journalist Frank Giles heard the Duke blame British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden for helping to \\"precipitate the war through his treatment of Mussolini ... that's what [Eden] did, he helped to bring on the war ... and of course Roosevelt and the Jews\\". During the 1960s the Duke said privately to a friend, Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross, \\"I never thought Hitler was such a bad chap.\\"Lord Kinross, Love conquers all in Books and Bookmen, vol. 20 (1974), p. 50: \\"He indeed remarked to me, some twenty-five years later, 'I never thought Hitler was such a bad chap'.\\"  Later life  The Duke in 1945 At the end of the war, the couple returned to France and spent the remainder of their lives essentially in retirement as the Duke never held another official role. Correspondence between the Duke and Kenneth de Courcy, dated between 1946 and 1949, emerged in a US library in 2009. The letters suggest a plot where the Duke would return to England and place himself in a position for a possible regency. The health of George VI was failing and de Courcy was concerned about the influence of the Mountbatten family over the young Princess Elizabeth. De Courcy suggested the Duke buy a working agricultural estate within an easy drive of London in order to gain favour with the British public and make himself available should the King become incapacitated. The Duke, however, hesitated and the King recovered from his surgery. The Duke's allowance was supplemented by government favours and illegal currency trading.Bradford, p. 442 The City of Paris provided the Duke with a house at 4 route du Champ d'Entra√Ænement, on the Neuilly-sur-Seine side of the Bois de Boulogne, for a nominal rent.Ziegler, pp. 534‚Äì535 The French government exempted him from paying income tax,Roberts, p. 53Bradford, p. 446 and the couple were able to buy goods duty-free through the British embassy and the military commissary. In 1952 they bought and renovated a weekend country retreat, Le Moulin de la Tuilerie at Gif-sur-Yvette, the only property the couple ever owned themselves. In 1951, the Duke had produced a ghost- written memoir, A King's Story, in which he expressed disagreement with liberal politics. The royalties from the book added to their income. The Duke and Duchess effectively took on the role of celebrities and were regarded as part of caf√© society in the 1950s and 1960s. They hosted parties and shuttled between Paris and New York; Gore Vidal, who met the Windsors socially, reported on the vacuity of the Duke's conversation. The couple doted on the pug dogs they kept. In June 1953, instead of attending the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, his niece, in London, the Duke and Duchess watched the ceremony on television in Paris. The Duke said that it was contrary to precedent for a Sovereign or former Sovereign to attend any coronation of another. He was paid to write articles on the ceremony for the Sunday Express and Woman's Home Companion, as well as a short book, The Crown and the People, 1902‚Äì1953.Ziegler, pp. 539‚Äì540 U.S. President Richard Nixon and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1970 In 1955 they visited President Dwight D. Eisenhower at the White House. The couple appeared on Edward R. Murrow's television- interview show Person to Person in 1956, and in a 50-minute BBC television interview in 1970. That year President Richard Nixon invited them as guests of honour to a dinner at the White House.UPI. \\"Duke, Duchess Have Dinner With Nixons\\" The Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina) 6 April 1970; p. 13 The royal family never fully accepted the Duchess. Queen Mary refused to receive her formally. However, Edward sometimes met his mother and his brother, George VI; he attended George's funeral in 1952. Queen Mary remained angry with Edward and indignant over his marriage to Wallis: \\"To give up all this for that\\", she said.Bradford, p. 198 In 1965 the Duke and Duchess returned to London. They were visited by Elizabeth II, his sister-in-law Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, and his sister Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood. A week later, the Princess Royal died, and they attended her memorial service. In 1967 they joined the royal family for the centenary of Queen Mary's birth. The last royal ceremony the Duke attended was the funeral of Princess Marina in 1968.Ziegler, pp. 554‚Äì556 He declined an invitation from Elizabeth II to attend the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969, replying that Prince Charles would not want his \\"aged great-uncle\\" there.Ziegler, p. 555 In the 1960s the Duke's health deteriorated. In December 1964 Michael E. DeBakey operated on him in Houston for an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, and in February 1965 Sir Stewart Duke-Elder treated a detached retina in his left eye. In late 1971, the Duke, who was a smoker from an early age, was diagnosed with throat cancer and underwent cobalt therapy. On 18 May 1972, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Duke and Duchess of Windsor while on a state visit to France; she spoke with the Duke for fifteen minutes, but only the Duchess appeared with the royal party for a photocall as the Duke was too ill.  Death and legacy  On 28 May 1972, ten days after the Queen's visit, the Duke died at his home in Paris, less than a month before his 78th birthday. His body was returned to Britain, lying in state at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. The funeral service took place in the chapel on 5 June in the presence of the Queen, the royal family, and the Duchess of Windsor, who stayed at Buckingham Palace during her visit. He was buried in the Royal Burial Ground behind the Royal Mausoleum of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at Frogmore.Ziegler, pp. 556‚Äì557 Until a 1965 agreement with the Queen, the Duke and Duchess had planned for a burial in a cemetery plot they had purchased at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, where the Duchess's father was interred. Frail, and suffering increasingly from dementia, the Duchess died in 1986, and was buried alongside her husband. In the view of historians, such as Philip Williamson writing in 2007, the popular perception in the 21st century that the abdication was driven by politics rather than religious morality is false and arises because divorce has become much more common and socially acceptable. To modern sensibilities, the religious restrictions that prevented Edward from continuing as king while planning to marry Simpson \\"seem, wrongly, to provide insufficient explanation\\" for his abdication.

The genus includes two species: the type species S. mirus from Scotland, which is known from two mostly complete skulls and other cranial material, and the species S. pereger from Nova Scotia, which is known from a single fragment of the skull table. Based on the S. mirus material, the appearance of Spathicephalus is unlike that of any other early tetrapod, with a flattened, square-shaped skull and jaws lined with hundreds of very small chisel-like teeth. However, Spathicephalus shares several anatomical features with a family of stem tetrapods called Baphetidae, leading most paleontologists who have studied the genus to place it within a larger group called Baphetoidea, often as part of its own monotypic family Spathicephalidae. Spathicephalus is thought to have fed on aquatic invertebrates through a combination of suction feeding and filter feeding. History of study The type species of Spathicephalus, S. mirus, was named by paleontologist D. M. S. Watson in 1929. Watson described seven fossil specimens from an outcrop of the Rumbles Ironstone in the town of Loanhead in Midlothian, Scotland. The ironstone dates to the late Namurian stage (earliest Upper Carboniferous) and is part of the Limestone Coal Group. These specimens were discovered in the 1880s and include a mostly complete skull with the palate exposed, an impression of the underside of a skull roof, a right portion of the back of a skull, and various jaw fragments. At the time, Spathicephalus and other tetrapods from the Namurian of Scotland were some of the oldest tetrapods known, predating the better-known Late Carboniferous tetrapod assemblages of the British Coal Measures. In November 1974, Scottish paleontologist Stanley P. Wood discovered additional skull and jaw fragments of Spathicephalus in an open-pit mine (the Dora Open Cast Mine) near the town of Cowdenbeath in Fife. Wood found these fossils in a layer of siltstone that is the same age as the ironstone in Loanhead. Sydney Harbor. American paleontologist Donald Baird named a second species of Spathicephalus, S. pereger, from Nova Scotia in 1962. Baird named S. pereger on the basis of an impression of the right half of a skull table that collectors from the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology found on a beach between Point Edward and Keating Cove on Cape Breton Island. The impression was preserved in siltstone from the Point Edward Formation, which dates to the latest Upper Carboniferous (equivalent to the early Namurian in Europe), meaning that S. pereger predates S. mirus by several million years. Description Unlike most other early tetrapods which have rounded or pointed snouts, Spathicephalus mirus has a flattened, almost perfectly square- shaped skull up to in both width and length. The squared shape is caused primarily by a widening of the paired nasal bones along the midline of the snout. The premaxilla bones at the tip of the snout form the entire front edge of the square, while the maxilla bones form the side edges. The maxillae of Spathicephalus are unusual in being thin (no more than in thickness) along their entire length. The orbits or eye sockets are large, facing directly upward and positioned close together near the back of the skull. Unlike the roughly circular orbits of most tetrapods, the orbits of Spathicephalus are kidney-shaped because they have fused with another pair of holes called the antorbital fenestrae (in other early tetrapods, the antorbital fenestrae lie in front of the orbits and are separate from them). The skull table behind the orbits is very small in comparison to those of other Carboniferous tetrapods, but like those of other tetrapods, it bears a small hole in its center called a pineal foramen. Small tabular \\"horns\\" extend laterally from the back of the skull table, forming the temporal notches. The surface of the skull roof is covered by raised bumps and ridges, a condition paleontologists E. H. Beaumont and T. R. Smithson describe as \\"pustular ornamentation\\". Another distinguishing feature of S. mirus is its dentition; it jaws are lined with hundreds of small, chisel-shaped, closely spaced teeth. These marginal teeth are each about in cross-sectional diameter and form an unbroken row along both the upper and lower jaws. While they point directly downward in the upper jaw, the marginal teeth slant slightly inward (mesially) in the lower jaw. Teeth on the vomer bones form a second parallel row on the palate that is not as extensive as the marginal tooth row. At about in diameter, these teeth are smaller than the marginal teeth. The rest of the palate has subtle pustular ornamentation at a finer scale than on the skull roof. This is a unique condition among early tetrapods, many of which have more extensive ornamentation on the palate including bony denticles, additional tooth rows, and palatal tusks. The dentition of Spathicephalus is so unusual that isolated jaw fragments with teeth in them can easily be identified. Although the species S. pereger is only known by a partial skull roof, paleontologist Donald Baird assigned it to Spathicephalus with confidence because the shapes of its bones closely matched the corresponding bones in S. mirus. One of the few differences that separate S. pereger from S. mirus is the reticulate or \\"honeycomb\\" ornamentation on its skull roof, characterized by pits and grooves. The pustular ornamentation seen in S. mirus is in fact rare among early tetrapods (plagiosaurid temnospondyls and the very early tetrapod Ichthyostega are some of the few to have them), while the reticulate ornamentation of S. pereger is more typical. Evolutionary relationships Spathicephalus is an early member of the group Tetrapoda, which includes all four-limbed vertebrates. According to the most recent studies of early tetrapod phylogeny, it belongs to a clade or evolutionary grouping within Tetrapoda called Baphetoidea but lies outside a subgroup of baphetoids called Baphetidae, which form the \\"core\\" of Baphetoidea. Most recent studies of tetrapod evolutionary relationships find baphetoids to be stem group tetrapods, meaning that they branched off from other tetrapods before the most recent common ancestor of living tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) appeared. Paleontologists recognized that Spathicephalus was a close relative of baphetids ever since D. M. S. Watson first described it in 1929. Two main features link Spathicephalus with baphetids: antorbital fenestrae that have fused with the orbits, and a closed palate formed mostly from a pair of broad pterygoid bones. Watson placed Spathicephalus in Loxommatidae, a family he had named twelve years earlier to include what are now called baphetids. Although the name Baphetidae has existed since 1865 and takes precedence over Loxommatidae, paleontologists referred to these tetrapods as loxommids throughout much of the twentieth century. In a 1947 review of early tetrapods, paleontologist Alfred Romer called Spathicephalus \\"a grotesque type of loxommid,\\" considering its unusual skull to be evidence of a primitive position within the group. Spathicephalus was not included in a modern phylogenetic analysis of early tetrapod relationships until the 2000s. In 2009, paleontologists Angela Milner, Andrew Milner, and Stig Walsh incorporated the anatomical characteristics of S. mirus into an analysis of baphetoid interrelationships. The analysis placed Spathicephalus just outside Baphetidae as the sister taxon of the group, a result which they used to justify its placement in a distinct family, Spathicephalidae. The analysis also found Eucritta melanolimnetes, an older species from the Vis√©an stage of Scotland, to be the most basal member of Baphetoidea. Below is a cladogram showing the results of their analysis: Possible close relatives The enigmatic Carboniferous tetrapod species Doragnathus woodi may be related to Spathicephalus. In two papers published in 1993 and 1994, Russian paleontologist O. A. Lebedev proposed that Doragnathus was a junior synonym of Spathicephalus. Doragnathus woodi, named by Smithson in 1980 from the Dora Open Cast Mine in Fife, Scotland (the same mine where paleontologist Stanley P. Wood discovered remains of S. mirus), is known only from upper and lower jaw fragments. The jaws themselves closely resemble those of other Carboniferous tetrapods, but the numerous very small, closely packed, pointed, and inward (lingually) curving marginal teeth they hold are unique. Given that Doragnathus and Spathicephalus were the only known Carboniferous tetrapods at the time with marginal teeth that are very small and closely packed, Lebedev argued that the two represent the same taxon. Because the Doragnathus material was smaller than every S. mirus specimen that was known at the time, he also proposed that Doragnathus represented the juvenile form of Spathicephalus and that the curved, pointed teeth of the former transformed into the straight, chizel-shaped teeth of the latter during development. However, this hypothesis was refuted by Beaumont and Smithson, who in 1998 reported a jaw of S. mirus that was just as small as the Doragnathus material but possessed straight, chizel-shaped teeth. Beaumont and Smithson also pointed out that Doragnathus differs from Spathicephalus in possessing an additional tooth row along the parasymphesial plate and coronoids (a series of bones forming the inner parts of the lower jaw of early tetrapods that was lost later in tetrapod evolution). Another stem tetrapod, Sigournea multidentata from the Early Carboniferous of the United States, may also be related to Spathicephalus. Named in 2006 from a Visean-aged fissure fill deposit in Iowa, Sigournea is slightly older than Spathicephalus. It resembles both Spathicephalus and Doragnathus in having numerous small, closely packed teeth. Sigournea differs from Spathicephalus and resembles Doragnathus in having pointed rather than chizel-shaped marginal teeth and a second row of teeth in the lower jaws, and differs from both taxa in having a hole on the inner surface of the lower jaw called the exomeckelian fenestra. However, given that Sigournea is only known from a single lower jaw, its relationships to other tetrapods remain uncertain. Milner et al. (2009) raised the possibility that Doragnathus woodi and Sigournea multidentata could both belong to Spathicephalidae, although they did not include the two species in their phylogenetic analysis. An earlier phylogenetic analysis published by Marcello Ruta and John R. Bolt in 2008 included Doragnathus woodi, Sigournea multidentata, and Spathicephalus mirus but did not find all three species to group together. Instead they found good support for Sigournea grouping with Occidens portlocki from the earliest Carboniferous (Tournaisian) of Ireland and Doragnathus grouping with Greererpeton burkemorani from the Vis√©an of West Virginia in the United States. Feeding behavior The bizarre cranial morphology of Spathicephalus suggests that its feeding habits differed greatly from those of other Carboniferous tetrapods. Most stem tetrapods including baphetids were most likely piscivorous (fish-eating) given their large teeth and deep skulls, which provided attachment points for strong, fast-acting jaw muscles. The small chizel-shaped teeth of Spathicephalus would have been ill-suited for catching fish. Moreover, the flattened shape of its skull means that the depressor mandibulae, muscles that attach to the back of the skull and are responsible for opening the lower jaw, would not have had much room to anchor and therefore would have had poor mechanical advantage. Although only distantly related, another group of flat-headed aquatic tetrapods called plagiosaurid temnospondyls may have resembled Spathicephalus in their feeding behavior. Plagiosaurids, which lived during the Triassic, are thought to have been bottom-dwelling piscivores that compensated for their weak depressor mandibulae with powerful adductor muscles that would have rapidly closed the lower jaw. They may have rested on the bottom of lakes and rivers with their jaws open, snapping them shut to capture fish. Paleontologist Alfred Romer proposed in 1947 that Spathicephalus was a bottom-dwelling piscivore, but unlike plagiosaurids it would have had weak adductor muscles. In Spathicephalus, plagiosaurids, and many other early tetrapods, a pair of holes at the back of the palate called the subtemporal fossae function as anchors for the adductors. These fossae are large in plagiosaurids, which is why they are thought to have had powerful adductors. Spathicephalus, however, has smaller subtemporal fossae, meaning that it would have had weak adductors and depressor mandibulae. In 1998, paleontologists E. H. Beaumont and T. R. Smithson hypothesized that Spathicephalus fed on aquatic invertebrates through a combination of suction feeding and filter feeding. To feed, it would have rested on a lake or river bottom with its jaws slightly opened and its hyoid apparatus closing off the throat. When a group of small invertebrates approached, it would have lowered its hyoid, opening the throat and causing a rapid decrease in pressure inside the mouth. Water would then flow into the mouth, carrying the prey with it. Even with weak adductors, Spathicephalus could have shut its jaws before prey escaped, and then raised the hyoid again to force water back out while filtering the invertebrates with its rows of small teeth.

Symptoms often include periods of excessive daytime sleepiness and brief involuntary sleep episodes. About 70% of those affected also experience episodes of sudden loss of muscle strength, known as cataplexy. These experiences can be brought on by strong emotions. Less commonly, there may be vivid hallucinations or an inability to move (sleep paralysis) while falling asleep or waking up. People with narcolepsy tend to sleep about the same number of hours per day as people without, but the quality of sleep tends to be lessened. The exact cause of narcolepsy is unknown, with potentially several causes. In up to 10% of cases, there is a family history of the disorder. Often, those affected have low levels of the neuropeptide orexin, which may be due to an autoimmune disorder. In rare cases, narcolepsy can be caused by traumatic brain injury, tumors, or other diseases affecting the parts of the brain that regulate wakefulness or REM sleep. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and sleep studies, after ruling out other potential causes. Excessive daytime sleepiness can also be caused by other sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, major depressive disorder, anemia, heart failure, drinking alcohol and not getting enough sleep. Cataplexy may be mistaken for seizures. While there is no cure, a number of lifestyle changes and medications may help. Lifestyle changes include taking regular short naps and sleep hygiene. Medications used include modafinil, sodium oxybate and methylphenidate. While initially effective, tolerance to the benefits may develop over time. Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may improve cataplexy. Estimates of frequency range from 0.2 to 600 per 100,000 people in various countries. The condition often begins in childhood, with males and females being affected equally. Untreated narcolepsy increases the risk of motor vehicle collisions and falls. Signs and symptoms There are two main characteristics of narcolepsy: excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal REM sleep. Excessive daytime sleepiness occurs even after adequate night time sleep. A person with narcolepsy is likely to become drowsy or fall asleep, often at inappropriate or undesired times and places, or just be very tired throughout the day. Narcoleptics may not be able to experience the amount of restorative deep sleep that healthy people experience due to abnormal REM regulation ‚Äì they are not \\"over-sleeping\\". Narcoleptics typically have higher REM sleep density than non-narcoleptics, but also experience more REM sleep without atonia. Many narcoleptics have sufficient REM sleep, but do not feel refreshed or alert throughout the day. This can feel like living their entire lives in a constant state of sleep deprivation. Excessive sleepiness can vary in severity, and it appears most commonly during monotonous situations that don't require much interaction. Daytime naps may occur with little warning and may be physically irresistible. These naps can occur several times a day. They are typically refreshing, but only for a few hours or less. Vivid dreams may be experienced on a regular basis, even during very brief naps. Drowsiness may persist for prolonged periods or remain constant. In addition, night-time sleep may be fragmented, with frequent awakenings. A second prominent symptom of narcolepsy is abnormal REM sleep. Narcoleptics are unique in that they enter into the REM phase of sleep in the beginnings of sleep, even when sleeping during the day. The classic symptoms of the disorder, often referred to as the \\"tetrad of narcolepsy,\\" are cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Other symptoms may include automatic behaviors and night-time wakefulness. These symptoms may not occur in all people with narcolepsy. * Cataplexy is an episodic loss of muscle function, ranging from slight weakness such as limpness at the neck or knees, sagging facial muscles, weakness at the knees often referred to as \\"knee buckling\\", or inability to speak clearly, to a complete body collapse. Episodes may be triggered by sudden emotional reactions such as laughter, anger, surprise, or fear. The person remains conscious throughout the episode. In some cases, cataplexy may resemble epileptic seizures. Usually speech is slurred and vision is impaired (double vision, inability to focus), but hearing and awareness remain normal. Cataplexy also has a severe emotional impact on narcoleptics, as it can cause extreme anxiety, fear, and avoidance of people or situations that might elicit an attack. Cataplexy is generally considered to be unique to narcolepsy and is analogous to sleep paralysis in that the usually protective paralysis mechanism occurring during sleep is inappropriately activated. The opposite of this situation (failure to activate this protective paralysis) occurs in rapid eye movement behavior disorder. * Periods of wakefulness at night *Sleep paralysis is the temporary inability to talk or move when waking (or less often, when falling asleep). It may last a few seconds to minutes. This is often frightening but is not dangerous. *Hypnagogic hallucinations are vivid, often frightening, dreamlike experiences that occur while dozing or falling asleep. Hypnopompic hallucinations refer to the same sensations while awakening from sleep. These hallucinations may manifest in the form of visual or auditory sensations. In most cases, the first symptom of narcolepsy to appear is excessive and overwhelming daytime sleepiness. The other symptoms may begin alone or in combination months or years after the onset of the daytime naps. There are wide variations in the development, severity, and order of appearance of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations in individuals. Only about 20 to 25 percent of people with narcolepsy experience all four symptoms. The excessive daytime sleepiness generally persists throughout life, but sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations may not. Many people with narcolepsy also suffer from insomnia for extended periods of time. The excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy often become severe enough to cause serious problems in a person's social, personal, and professional life. Normally, when an individual is awake, brain waves show a regular rhythm. When a person first falls asleep, the brain waves become slower and less regular, which is called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. After about an hour and a half of NREM sleep, the brain waves begin to show a more active pattern again, called REM sleep (rapid eye movement sleep), when most remembered dreaming occurs. Associated with the EEG-observed waves during REM sleep, muscle atonia is present called REM atonia. In narcolepsy, the order and length of NREM and REM sleep periods are disturbed, with REM sleep occurring at sleep onset instead of after a period of NREM sleep. Also, some aspects of REM sleep that normally occur only during sleep, like lack of muscular control, sleep paralysis, and vivid dreams, occur at other times in people with narcolepsy. For example, the lack of muscular control can occur during wakefulness in a cataplexy episode; it is said that there is an intrusion of REM atonia during wakefulness. Sleep paralysis and vivid dreams can occur while falling asleep or waking up. Simply put, the brain does not pass through the normal stages of dozing and deep sleep but goes directly into (and out of) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. As a consequence night time sleep does not include as much deep sleep, so the brain tries to \\"catch up\\" during the day, hence excessive daytime sleepiness. People with narcolepsy may visibly fall asleep at unpredicted moments (such motions as head bobbing are common). People with narcolepsy fall quickly into what appears to be very deep sleep, and they wake up suddenly and can be disoriented when they do (dizziness is a common occurrence). They have very vivid dreams, which they often remember in great detail. People with narcolepsy may dream even when they only fall asleep for a few seconds. Along with vivid dreaming, people with narcolepsy are known to have audio or visual hallucinations prior to falling asleep. Narcoleptics can gain excess weight; children can gain 20 to 40 lb (9 to 18 kg) when they first develop narcolepsy; in adults the body-mass index is about 15% above average. Causes The exact cause of narcolepsy is unknown, and it may be caused by several distinct factors. The mechanism involves the loss of orexin-releasing neurons within the lateral hypothalamus (about 70,000 neurons). In up to 10% of cases there is a family history of the disorder. Family history is more common in narcolepsy with cataplexy. There is a strong link with certain genetic variants. In addition to genetic factors, low levels of orexin peptides have been correlated with a past history of infection, diet, contact with toxins such as pesticides, and brain injuries due to, head trauma, brain tumors or strokes. Autoimmunity may also play a role. Genetics The primary genetic factor that has been strongly implicated in the development of narcolepsy involves an area of chromosome 6 known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. Specific variations in HLA genes are strongly correlated with the presence of narcolepsy; however, these variations are not required for the condition to occur and sometimes occur in individuals without narcolepsy. These genetic variations in the HLA complex are thought to increase the risk of an auto-immune response to orexin-releasing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. The allele HLA-DQB1*06:02 of the human gene HLA-DQB1 was reported in more than 90% of people with narcolepsy, and alleles of other HLA genes such as HLA-DQA1*01:02 have been linked. A 2009 study found a strong association with polymorphisms in the TRAC gene locus (dbSNP IDs rs1154155, rs12587781, and rs1263646). A 2013 review article reported additional but weaker links to the loci of the genes TNFSF4 (rs7553711), Cathepsin H (rs34593439), and P2RY11-DNMT1 (rs2305795). Another gene locus that has been associated with narcolepsy is EIF3G (rs3826784). H1N1 vaccine A link between GlaxoSmithKline's H1N1 flu vaccine Pandemrix and narcolepsy has been found in both children and adults. Finland's National Institute of Health and Welfare recommended that Pandemrix vaccinations be suspended pending further investigation into narcolepsy. Pathophysiology Loss of neurons Orexin, otherwise known as hypocretin, is a neuropeptide that acts within the brain to regulate appetite and wakefulness as well as a number of other cognitive and physiological processes. Loss of these orexin-producing neurons causes narcolepsy and most individuals with narcolepsy have a reduced number of these neurons in their brains. Selective destruction of the HCRT/OX neurons with preservation of proximate structures suggests a highly specific autoimmune pathophysiology.50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Cerebrospinal fluid HCRT-1/OX-A is undetectable in up to 95% of patients with type 1 narcolepsy. The system which regulates sleep, arousal, and transitions between these states in humans is composed of three interconnected subsystems: the orexin projections from the lateral hypothalamus, the reticular activating system, and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus. In narcoleptic individuals, these systems are all associated with impairments due to a greatly reduced number of hypothalamic orexin projection neurons and significantly fewer orexin neuropeptides in cerebrospinal fluid and neural tissue, compared to non-narcoleptic individuals. Those with narcolepsy generally experience the REM stage of sleep within five minutes of falling asleep, while people who do not have narcolepsy (unless they are significantly sleep deprived) do not experience REM until after a period of slow-wave sleep, which lasts for about the first hour or so of a sleep cycle. Disturbed sleep states The neural control of normal sleep states and the relationship to narcolepsy are only partially understood. In humans, narcoleptic sleep is characterized by a tendency to go abruptly from a waking state to REM sleep with little or no intervening non-REM sleep. The changes in the motor and proprioceptive systems during REM sleep have been studied in both human and animal models. During normal REM sleep, spinal and brainstem alpha motor neuron hyperpolarization produces almost complete atonia of skeletal muscles via an inhibitory descending reticulospinal pathway. Acetylcholine may be one of the neurotransmitters involved in this pathway. In narcolepsy, the reflex inhibition of the motor system seen in cataplexy has features normally seen only in normal REM sleep. Diagnosis The third edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) differentiates between narcolepsy with cataplexy (type 1) and narcolepsy without cataplexy (type 2), while the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) uses the diagnosis of narcolepsy to refer to type 1 narcolepsy only. The DSM-5 refers to narcolepsy without cataplexy as hypersomnolence disorder. The most recent edition of the International Classification of Diseases, ICD-11, currently identifies three types of narcolepsy: type 1 narcolepsy, type 2 narcolepsy, and unspecified narcolepsy. ICSD-3 diagnostic criteria posits that the individual must experience \\"daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep\\" for both subtypes of narcolepsy. This symptom must last for at least three months. For a diagnosis of type 1 narcolepsy, the person must present with either cataplexy, a mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes, and two or more sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs), or they must present with a hypocretin-1 concentration of less than 110 pg/mL. A diagnosis of type 2 narcolepsy requires a mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes, two or more SOREMPs, and a hypocretin-1 concentration of more than 110 pg/mL. In addition, the hypersomnolence and sleep latency findings cannot be better explained by other causes. DSM-5 narcolepsy criteria requires that the person to display recurrent periods of \\"an irrepressible need to sleep, lapsing into sleep, or napping\\" for at least three times a week over a period of three months. The individual must also display one of the following: cataplexy, hypocretin-1 concentration of less than 110 pg/mL, REM sleep latency of less than 15 minutes, or a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) showing sleep latency of less than 8 minutes and two or more SOREMPs. For a diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder, the individual must present with excessive sleepiness despite at least 7 hours of sleep as well as either recurrent lapses into daytime sleep, nonrestorative sleep episodes of 9 or more hours, or difficulty staying awake after awakening. In addition, the hypersomnolence must occur at least three times a week for a period of three months, and must be accompanied by significant distress or impairment. It also cannot be explained by another sleep disorder, coexisting mental or medical disorders, or medication. Tests  Diagnosis is relatively easy when all the symptoms of narcolepsy are present, but if the sleep attacks are isolated and cataplexy is mild or absent, diagnosis is more difficult. Three tests that are commonly used in diagnosing narcolepsy are polysomnography (PSG), the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). These tests are usually performed by a sleep specialist. Polysomnography involves the continuous recording of sleep brain waves and a number of nerve and muscle functions during night time sleep. When tested, people with narcolepsy fall asleep rapidly, enter REM sleep early, and may often awaken during the night. The polysomnogram also helps to detect other possible sleep disorders that could cause daytime sleepiness. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a brief questionnaire that is administered to determine the likelihood of the presence of a sleep disorder, including narcolepsy. The multiple sleep latency test is performed after the person undergoes an overnight sleep study. The person will be asked to sleep once every 2 hours, and the time it takes for them to do so is recorded. Most individuals will fall asleep within 5 to 8 minutes, as well as display REM sleep faster than non-narcoleptic people. Measuring orexin levels in a person's cerebrospinal fluid sampled in a spinal tap may help in diagnosing narcolepsy, with abnormally low levels serving as an indicator of the disorder. This test can be useful when MSLT results are inconclusive or difficult to interpret. Treatment People with narcolepsy can be substantially helped, but not cured. However, the technology exists in early form such as experiments in using the prepro-orexin transgene via gene editing restored normal function in mice models by making other neurons produce orexin after the original set have been destroyed or replacing the missing orexinergic neurons with hypocretin stem cell transplantation are both steps in that direction for fixing the biology effectively permanently once applied in humans. Additionally effective ideal non-gene editing and chemical- drug methods involve hypocretin treatments methods such as future drugs like hypocretin agonists (such as TAK-994) which the enterprise targets it to be available by 2024 or hypocretin replacement, in the form of hypocretin 1 given intravenous (injected into the veins), intracisternal (direct injection into the brain), and intranasal (sprayed through the nose), the latter being low in efficacy, at the low amount used in current experiments but may be effective at very high doses in the future. General strategies like people and family education, sleep hygiene and medication compliance, and discussion of safety issues for example driving license can be useful. Potential side effects of medication can also be addressed. Regular follow-up is useful to be able to monitor the response to treatment, to assess the presence of other sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea, and to discuss psychosocial issues. The main treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy is central nervous system stimulants such as methylphenidate, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, modafinil, and armodafinil. In late 2007 an alert for severe adverse skin reactions to modafinil was issued by the FDA. Several studies also showed that sodium oxybate is effective to treat cataplexy. Another drug that is used is atomoxetine, a non-stimulant and a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), which has no addiction liability or recreational effects. In many cases, planned regular short naps can reduce the need for pharmacological treatment of the EDS, but only improve symptoms for a short duration. A 120-minute nap provided benefit for 3 hours in the person's alertness whereas a 15-minute nap provided no benefit. Daytime naps are not a replacement for night time sleep. Ongoing communication between the health care provider, person, and their family members is important for optimal management of narcolepsy. Another FDA-approved treatment option for narcolepsy is sodium oxybate, also known as sodium gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). It can be used for cataplexy associated with narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Solriamfetol is a new molecule indicated for narcolespy of type 1 and 2. Antidepressants Narcolepsy has sometimes been treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, such as clomipramine, imipramine, or protriptyline, as well as other drugs that suppress REM sleep. Venlafaxine, an antidepressant which blocks the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, has shown usefulness in managing symptoms of cataplexy, however, it has notable side-effects including sleep disruption. The antidepressant class is used mainly for the treatment of cataplexy, for people with narcolepsy without cataplexy these are usually not used. Children Common behavioral treatments for childhood narcolepsy include improved sleep hygiene, scheduled naps, and physical exercise. Many medications are used in treating adults and may be used to treat childhood. These medications include central nervous system stimulants such as methylphenidate, modafinil, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Other medications, such as sodium oxybate or atomoxetine may also be used to counteract sleepiness. Medications such as sodium oxybate, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, and clomipramine may be prescribed if the child presents with cataplexy. Epidemiology Estimates of frequency range from 0.2 per 100,000 in Israel to 600 per 100,000 in Japan. These differences may be due to how the studies were conducted or the populations themselves. In the United States, narcolepsy is estimated to affect as many as 200,000 Americans, but fewer than 50,000 are diagnosed. The prevalence of narcolepsy is about 1 per 2,000 persons. Narcolepsy is often mistaken for depression, epilepsy, the side effects of medications, poor sleeping habits, recreational drug use, or laziness, making misdiagnosis likely. While narcolepsy symptoms are often confused with depression, there is a link between the two disorders. Research studies have mixed results on co-occurrence of depression in people with narcolepsy, as the numbers quoted by different studies are anywhere between 6% and 50%. Narcolepsy can occur in both men and women at any age, although typical symptom onset occurs in adolescence and young adulthood. There is about a ten-year delay in diagnosing narcolepsy in adults. Cognitive, educational, occupational, and psychosocial problems associated with the excessive daytime sleepiness of narcolepsy have been documented. For these to occur in the crucial teen years when education, development of self-image, and development of occupational choice are taking place is especially devastating. While cognitive impairment does occur, it may only be a reflection of the excessive daytime somnolence. Society and culture In 2015, it was reported that the British Department of Health was paying for sodium oxybate medication at a cost of ¬£12,000 a year for 80 people who are taking legal action over problems linked to the use of the Pandemrix swine flu vaccine. Sodium oxybate is not available to people with narcolepsy through the National Health Service. Name The term \\"narcolepsy\\" is from the French narcolepsie. The French term was first used in 1880 by Jean-Baptiste-√âdouard G√©lineau, who used the Greek ŒΩŒ¨œÅŒ∫Œ∑ (narkƒì), meaning \\"numbness\\", and Œª·øÜœàŒπœÇ (lepsis) meaning \\"attack\\". Research Histamine-directed medications It remains to be seen whether H3 antagonists (i.e., compounds such as pitolisant that promote the release of the wakefulness-promoting molecule amine histamine) will be particularly useful as wake-promoting agents. However, usage now does exist in various nations such as in France, United Kingdom's (NHS as of September 2016) after being given marketing authorisation by European Commission on the advice of the European Medicines Agency and in the United States by the approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as of August 2019. GABA-directed medications Given the possible role of hyper-active GABAA receptors in the primary hypersomnias (narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia), medications that could counteract this activity are being studied to test their potential to improve sleepiness. These currently include clarithromycin and flumazenil. =Flumazenil= Flumazenil is the only GABAA receptor antagonist on the market as of Jan 2013, and it is currently manufactured only as an intravenous formulation. Given its pharmacology, researchers consider it to be a promising medication in the treatment of primary hypersomnias. Results of a small, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial were published in November 2012. This research showed that flumazenil provides relief for most people whose CSF contains the unknown \\"somnogen\\" that enhances the function of GABAA receptors, making them more susceptible to the sleep-inducing effect of GABA. For one person, daily administration of flumazenil by sublingual lozenge and topical cream has proven effective for several years. A 2014 case report also showed improvement in primary hypersomnia symptoms after treatment with a continuous subcutaneous flumazenil infusion. The supply of generic flumazenil was initially thought to be too low to meet the potential demand for treatment of primary hypersomnias. However, this scarcity has eased, and dozens of people are now being treated with flumazenil off-label. =Clarithromycin= In a test tube model, clarithromycin (an antibiotic approved by the FDA for the treatment of infections) was found to return the function of the GABA system to normal in people with primary hypersomnias. Investigators therefore treated a few people with narcolepsy with off-label clarithromycin, and most felt their symptoms improved with this treatment. In order to help further determine whether clarithromycin is truly beneficial for the treatment of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia, a small, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was completed in 2012. \\"In this pilot study, clarithromycin improved subjective sleepiness in GABA-related hypersomnia. Larger trials of longer duration are warranted.\\" In 2013, a retrospective review evaluating longer-term clarithromycin use showed efficacy in a large percentage of people with GABA-related hypersomnia. ‚ÄúIt is important to note that the positive effect of clarithromycin is secondary to a benzodiazepine antagonist-like effect, not its antibiotic effects, and treatment must be maintained.‚Äù Orexin receptor agonists Orexin-A ( hypocretin-1) has been shown to be strongly wake-promoting in animal models, but unfortunately it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, companies have developed orexin receptor antagonists, like suvorexant, for the treatment of insomnia. It is also likely that an orexin-A receptor agonist will be found and developed for the treatment of hypersomnia. In August 2015, Nagahara et al published their work in synthesizing the first HCRT/OX2R agonist, compound 26, with good potency and selectivity. L-carnitine Abnormally low levels of acylcarnitine have been observed in people with narcolepsy. These same low levels have been associated with primary hypersomnia in general in mouse studies. ‚ÄúMice with systemic carnitine deficiency exhibit a higher frequency of fragmented wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and reduced locomotor activity.‚Äù Administration of acetyl-L-carnitine was shown to improve these symptoms in mice. A subsequent human trial found that people with narcolepsy given L-carnitine spent less total time in daytime sleep than people who were given a placebo. Animal models Animal studies try to mimic the disorder in humans by either modifying the Hypocretin/Orexin receptors or by eliminating this peptide. An orexin deficit caused by the degeneration of hypothalamic neurons is suggested to be one of the causes of narcolepsy. More recent clinical studies on both animals and humans have also revealed that hypocretin is involved in other functions beside regulation of wakefulness and sleep. These functions include autonomic regulation, emotional processing, reward learning behaviour or energy homeostasis. In studies where the concentration of the hypocretin was measured under different circumstances, it was observed that the hypocretin levels increased with the positive emotion, anger or social interaction but stayed low during sleep or during pain experience. The most reliable and valid animal models developed are the canine (narcoleptic dogs) and the rodent (orexin-deficient mice) ones which helped investigating the narcolepsy and set the focus on the role of orexin in this disorder. =Dog models= Dogs, as well as other species like cats or horses, can also exhibit spontaneous narcolepsy with similar symptoms as the one reported in humans. The attacks of cataplexy in dogs can involve partial or full collapse. Narcolepsy with cataplexy was identified in a few breeds like Labrador retrievers or Doberman pinschers where it was investigated the possibility to inherit this disorder in the autosomal recessive mode. According to a reliable canine model for narcolepsy would be the one in which the narcoleptic symptoms are the result of a mutation in the gene HCRT 2. The animals affected exhibited excessive daytime sleepiness with a reduced state of vigilance and severe cataplexy resulted after palatable food and interactions with the owners or with other animals. =Rodent models= Mice that are genetically engineered to lack orexin genes demonstrate many similarities to human narcolepsy. During nocturnal hours, when mice are normally present, those lacking orexin demonstrated murine cataplexy and displayed brain and muscle electrical activity similar to the activity present during REM and NREM sleep. This cataplexy is able to be triggered through social interaction, wheel running, and ultrasonic vocalizations. Upon awakening, the mice also display behavior consistent with excessive daytime sleepiness. Mice models have also been used to test whether the lack of orexin neurons is correlated with narcolepsy. Mice whose orexin neurons have been ablated have shown sleep fragmentation, SOREMPs, and obesity. Rat models have been used to demonstrate the association between orexin deficiency and narcoleptic symptoms. Rats who lost the majority of their orexinergic neurons exhibited multiple SOREMPs as well as less wakefulness during nocturnal hours, shortened REM latency, and brief periods of cataplexy.

The rectory was built first: in 1911 it was a hostel and community center under the supervision of Episcopal Bishop Nathaniel Thomas. Church services were held there until 1916, when the church was built. The church and hostel are among the largest log structures in Jackson Hole. The rectory was the first location in Jackson to hold regular Episcopal services, beginning in 1911. Services had been held intermittently since 1908. With the construction of the new church in 1916 the rectory was used as a hostel so that ranchers and lodgers at dude ranches more than a day's travel distant could stay overnight. The rectory was also used as a meeting place and social hall, and eventually as a community library with over 1000 volumes. The rectory is a 1-1/2 story building, featuring carefully built log dormers. The 1916 church was built by Butch and Ed Robinson of Jackson, using logs cut and cured by George and Clarence Blain, with finish work by master carpenter Raul A. Imeson. The church and rectory were designed using the locally prevailing rustic style that was becoming popular for dude ranches and park structures. The church measures approximately by , covered with an open log-trussed roof. This building is now referred to as a chapel, since a new, larger church was built in 1995. The site also includes a 1950s rectory and a frame parish hall, both considered non-contributing structures. St. John's Church operates the Chapel of the Transfiguration in Grand Teton National Park. The church was instrumental in organizing the hospital in Jackson, now named St. John's Medical Center.

Initially released in November 2008 for Japanese audiences by Tecmo, an English version of the game was officially announced for North America by Ignition Entertainment for an October 2009 release. The game's development was headed by producer Keisuke Kikuchi, with programming and three-dimensional graphics by Matrix Software, who had previously developed Square Enix's Nintendo DS versions of Final Fantasy III and Final Fantasy IV. Taking place in an alternate reality steampunk version of the 19th century, the game follows Eddie, a London boy and son of a great adventurer as he and his friends travel the world in an airship in search of his missing father. The game features turn-based combat and aerial battles between the player's customizable airship, the Maverick, and enemy airships. The player's party, consisting of Eddie, the street urchin Pad, a witch named Melody and the mysterious Fiona were shown in early trailers to be traveling to such places as New York City, Cairo, Tokyo, Northern Europe and South America. Gameplay Nostalgia is a traditional role-playing video game featuring three-dimensional characters and environments. Players control a young London boy named Eddie and his compatriots as they travel across an alternate history 19th-century Earth on a high-powered zeppelin, visiting various locales and raiding ruins in order to uncover the truth about an ancient civilization, as well as find Eddie's lost father. In order to advance the story, players must visit towns and interact with non-player characters to obtains clues on their next destination, as well as traverse dangerous dungeons and environments in order to find hidden treasures. Taking advantage of the Nintendo DS's dual screens, gameplay is featured on one screen while a map of the player's current location is present on the other, which fills as they travel through new areas. While traveling through the game, the player will randomly encounter enemies as they move through dangerous areas, which must be defeated in battle. Battles in Nostalgia use a turn-based combat system where both characters and enemies acting in an order relative to their \\"speed\\" statistic. A Combat Order bar is present in battles that shows which of the player's party members or enemies will act next, with the player selecting a character's command just before their turn. In any given turn, a player may choose to attack an enemy, defend, use an item for beneficial effects, or use special skills unique to each character. In addition to ground battles, a player may also encounter enemies while in their airship, leading to a ship- to-ship combat sequence with unique commands. Players must defeat all of their enemies by attacking them until their hit points are extinguished, which grants each character experience points that go towards gaining levels, thus making them stronger and giving them access to more abilities. The player's party is judged at the end of each battle with a letter grade based on their actions in combat, and is determined by how quickly and flawlessly they have defeated their enemies and may give additional rewards. Plot Characters Main Characters There are five main playable characters in the game: * Edward \\"Eddie\\" Brown - the lone son of famous British adventurer Gilbert Brown. He is an aristocrat who lives with his parents in the countryside of London in a vast and beautiful mansion. Though he is not spoiled or selfish, Pad Ironically calls him a spoiled brat as a running gag. It is implied he may have feelings for Fiona. When his father disappears during an adventure, Edward takes it upon himself to becomes an adventurer to find him. He is a trained swordsman * Pad Remington - a young man living in London's east end and the son of adventurer Patrick Remington. Separated from his parents at a young age, he learned to survive on his own and looked after the kids of the slum. Initially, he thinks of adventuring as a waste of time until he travels with Eddie. Although he initially looked down on Eddie due to his high society status, he eventually grows to accept him as a true friend and see past his social status. It is heavily implied throughout the game that he may have feelings for Melody. He is reunited with his mother Elisabeth after 15 years of separation. He has skill with firearms. * Melody Farklight - a young witch who grew up in her family's isolated Mervielle Village. With no friends her own age, she grew to have a selfish and egotistical personality. Throughout her adventures with her friends, she starts to grow more humble and open, eventually seeing her companions as true friends (especially Pad, for whom she is hinted to have romantic feelings). Her mother, Medea Farklight, gave her life to protect Melody from Hartmann of The Cabal. Her skills include sorcery and magic. * Fiona - a mysterious amnesiac girl saved by adventurer Gilbert Brown from the Ancient Father's Cabal. She was known as the Princess of the White Order and of Asgard royalty, and was called the \\"Bearer of the White Wings\\" before being sealed in Pandora's box for thousands of years. The Cabal pursued her relentlessly as she was the only person capable of touching the tablets The Cabal desperately vies for, as they're the key to opening the portal to Asgard. Her mysterious powers deal in benevolent white magic and healing abilities (Note: Fiona was a guest character for a short amount of time before permanently joining the group). * Gilbert Brown - Eddie's father and a famous British adventurer. He disappeared after saving Fiona from The Cabal, having fallen from his airship, and his whereabouts were unknown until his son found him, injured in a battle with the Ancient father's Cabal. Later in the story, he is recovering at the Brown's mansion. His special skill is swordplay and firearms (Note: Gilbert is only playable for a short amount of time, after that, he becomes a guest character). Guest Members Guest characters are characters that join the party for a temporary time as guests. Guest character's equipment cannot be changed nor can they be controlled in battle. They participate in battle with the playable characters and, like them, they take turns attacking enemies. * Scarlett Fellini - a lone-wolf sky pirate of Italian descent, she flies in her deep crimson airship the Esperanza. Her long-lost sister Astell had been kidnapped and brainwashed by The Cabal and was convinced she was dead until she was reunited with her after defeating Yang Gui, who had been mind-controlling her long lost sister. She is a highly trained swordswoman. * Carlos - an agent of the Royal Exploration Agency. Carlos is a trusted and reliable member, and is skilled at investigation, infiltration, and destruction. He is trusted as Director Fogg's right-hand man and because of this, goes along with Fogg's plan to backstab Eddie and his friends to steal the tablets for themselves. Near the end, he has a change of heart and betrays Fogg to assist the group. His special skill is firearms. * Magi - a mysterious and autistic member of the Royal Exploration agency with psychic powers and a past in The Cabal. Born physically weak, she lives in a wheelchair. She can stop time for a limited period which is how she stunted her own growth, she is actually an elderly woman stuck in the body of a child. Magi, along with Shirley, are the only two members to oppose Fogg. Her special skills are her psychic powers, and she also has healing abilities. * Astell Fellini - a former elite of the Ancient Father's Cabal, though not by choice. She had been kidnapped long before the game's events, her memory erased and brainwashed by The Cabal, to be their perfect weapon, until Scarlett risks her life to save her and help her remember her past life, reuniting the two sisters. She is a master manipulator and skilled in deceit, but once freed from the influence of The Cabal, she is shown to have a kind heart. She is a shapeshifter, capable of transforming into a doppelg√§nger of anybody she sees at will, her weapon of choice is a parasol. * Yang Gui - an elite of the Ancient Father's Cabal and is in charge of mind-controlling and keeping Astell at their command. Disguised as a member of the Royal Exploration Agency, she fools Eddie and the group into accepting her as a guest member to find one of the missing tablets, having ulterior motives. With her abilities of astral projection, she has no physical form and can't be attacked. She uses this technique to keep her body safe from harm during battle, she also has healing abilities when ‚Äúassisting‚Äù the group. The Cabal The Cabal are a group of elites who are the main antagonists of Nostalgia and are ruled by their leader Terra. Their goal is to obtain the ancient tablets that are the key to opening the portal to Asgard, tablets only Fiona is capable of touching, which is why The Cabal relentlessly pursue her throughout the game, to use her to get to the tablets and open the gate to Asgard.. * Carmine The \\"Invincible\\" - an elite of The Cabal with the power of invincibility; he can instantly cure all physical damage to his body. He also takes pride in being a knight and is of Italian ancestry, he is the strongest elite of The Cabal and lords over his fellow elites. * Hartmann the \\"Silent Guru\\" - an elite of The Cabal and is the oldest of them. Though a wizard born in Mervielle village, he was banished for abusing his magic and using it to soothe his own selfish desires. He is responsible for the death of Melody's mother and of the village elder. Later in the game, he is finally killed by Melody in an act of revenge. * Roswell the \\"God's Right Hand\\" - an elite of The Cabal and their mechanical engineer and scientist. Roswell, being a top scientist, often builds weapons for The Cabal such as airships and works for their technical department. His right arm is mechanical and is of French descent. His most prized invention is their airship the Ouroboros. * Kakyo The \\"Impenetrable\\" - an elite of The Cabal. Of Japanese descent, he manages the Cabal's secret Mt. Fuji base in Japan and is a descendant of samurai. He has the blood of ogres and can literally walk through anything. He is capable of distorting matter around him so that he can walk through solid obstacles at will. * Terra The \\"Emperor\\" - the emperor of The Cabal, his real name is Fredrick. Years ago Terra worked alongside Gilbert and Fogg as an adventurer. He plans to collect the tablets and open the gate to Asgard to harness the power of the Tower of the Sun to destroy the world. The Royal Exploration Agency The Royal Exploration Agency is an organization disguised as a museum. The agency pursues the tablets as well but for different reasons, to prevent The Cabal from obtaining them. In truth, this was all a ruse set up by Fogg, and the agency ends up betraying the protagonists and reveal that they used Eddie to get to the tablets so that Julius Fogg can obtain the power of Asgard for himself. The only to members to oppose this plan are Magi and Shirley. * Julius Fogg - to many unsuspecting people, he is just the Royal Museum's chief curator, but in truth he is the director of the Royal Exploration Agency. He betrays the protagonists to obtain the powers of Asgard for himself by stealing the tablets. * Shirley Crawford - a member of the Royal Exploration Agency. She admires Gilbert as her master and honors his work. She becomes a great sympathizer to Eddie and, along with Magi, are the only two to oppose Julius Fogg. Her special skill is archaeology. The Black Order The Black Order are a trio of Gods who waged a war against the White Order (Fiona) and lost, the result left them sealed in Pandora's box for thousands of years along with Fiona and after being released try to exact revenge on Fiona with Metheus stealing the vessel of Terra to return to Asgard and use The Cabal to do so. * Metheus the \\"Bearer of the Black Wings\\" - the androgynous king(?) of the Black Order and ancient ruler of the Asgard underworld. Defeated by the White Order, it was sealed in pandora's box for thousands of years and used Terra's body as a vessel to return to Asgard and exact its revenge. It has a special hatred for Fiona and its special skill is black magic. * Frey - the king of swords who was sealed in Pandora's box for thousands of years. He seeks prosperity for the Black Order and tries to exact revenge on Fiona. His special skill is swordplay. * Freyja - the Goddess of death who was sealed in Pandora's box for thousands of years. She has a special hatred for Fiona and tries to kill her as soon as she's released from her prison. She has the skill of instant death. Major Recurring Characters * Jim Evans - Gilbert's long time overweight friend and supporter of Eddie. Evans is in search of the world's hidden mysteries and treasures as the deputy chief curator of the Royal Museum. * Beatrice Fitzgerald - an aristocrat living in London's west end and often gathers information for the protagonists.

Development Nostalgia was first announced in a July 2008 issue of Japanese magazine Famitsu, where it was revealed that both Matrix Software and Red Entertainment would be teaming with Tecmo to bring the game to players the following November. The game was produced by Tecmo's Keisuke Kikuchi, best known for his work on the company's Fatal Frame series, whose goal was to inject traditional role-playing elements with simple gameplay, aspiring to \\"make a product that everyone could play. Airship design sketches from the Japanese pre-order bonus artbook Project director Naoki Morita of Red Entertainment envisioned the game's historical setting as an alternate 19th century Earth, which was wholly supported by Kikuchi who remarked that \\"I knew this game had such potential when I saw Mr. Morita's project book - It is an adventure game set in another Earth, offering an enjoyable story that involves various cultures in many diverse locations.\\" Morita originally wanted to produce an alternate history-style role-playing game as far back as 1996, but became sidetracked due to the runaway success of his Sakura Taisen series on the Sega Saturn and shelved the project until work began on the Nintendo DS. Despite the large delay in production, Morita remained confident of his original vision, declaring that \\"I was confident that no matter how long it took, our designs for [Nostalgia] wouldn't lose their luster.\\" The staff of Matrix Software were largely responsible for the game's programming, and had previously worked with Square Enix to create the Nintendo DS version of Final Fantasy III and Final Fantasy IV. The music for Nostalgia was composed by Rei Kondoh, Kaori Komuro, and Shinichiro Sato, who were credited alongside their musical unit \\"T's Music\\". Tecmo released a special promotional album featuring ten songs from the game to players who pre-ordered the title in Japan, along with an artbook that included design sketches and official artwork. In December 2008, North American publisher Xseed Games announced that the game was already claimed by another company to be released in the English under the title Nostalgia. The following April, Ignition Entertainment officially announced that they had secured the publishing rights to the title and would be bringing it to North America in September. Shane Bettenhausen, the company's Director of New Business Development, stated that he was \\"deeply honored\\" to be given the opportunity to release the game in English, and felt the game would have a place in the current western game market as a unique and original title, stating that \\"amid a sea of remakes and rehashes, this endearing adventure blazes its own unique path\\". Reception Nostalgia received \\"average\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one eight, one seven, one eight, and one seven, for a total of 30 out of 40. The game had a modest sales start during its original release in Japan, selling 7,930 copies in its first week.

Lawless was based at the Royal Oak gym in the Canning Town district of London.Enzo: King maker of the Valleys' Kronk mirror.co.uk Sport Giller was his publicist throughout his career. His early stable of local boxers included former London amateurs such as Stan Kennedy, Johnny Caiger, Jimmy Tibbs, Silvester Mittee and Jimmy Anderson.

Tibbs later rejoined Lawless as a trainer, as did George Francis, who formed a winning team with Frank Bruno. He was associated with promoters Mickey Duff,Punch drunk New Statesman 24 January 2000 Jarvis Astaire, Harry Levene, and Mike Barrett, who effectively controlled British boxing. The team dealt primarily with the BBC, which gave rise to the famous relationship between Frank Bruno and the commentator Harry Carpenter, but they were ousted during the late 1980s by Frank Warren, who initially had the support of ITV.ITV Can Lead Boxing Back Into Big Time buzzle.com Famous for looking after his fighters like a father rather than a manager, Lawless often fell out with matchmaker Mickey Duff because he did not want to expose his boxers to unnecessary dangers. Duff stated in his autobiography that Lawless was always asking for opponents who would defend but not attack. This was the reason Frank Bruno never faced David Pearce. While living in retirement in Marbella with his wife of more than 50 years Sylvia, Lawless often said he was happy to be remembered as the manager who did not want his boxers hurt. Jim Watt, one of six Lawless-trained and managed boxers who went on to win world titles (including Frank Bruno, and Joe Calzaghe under different management), wrote in his autobiography, Watt's My Name: Personal life He was married to his wife Sylvia for 53 years and they had two children, Lorraine and Steven.

Mary was one of the mistresses of Henry VIII for an unknown period of time. It has been rumoured that she bore two of the king's children, though Henry did not acknowledge either of them as he had acknowledged Henry FitzRoy, his son by another mistress, Elizabeth Blount. Mary was also rumoured to have been a mistress of Henry VIII's rival, King Francis I of France, for some period between 1515 and 1519.Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, X, no.450. Mary Boleyn was married twice: in 1520 to William Carey, and again, secretly, in 1534, to William Stafford, a soldier from a good family but with few prospects. This secret marriage to a man considered beneath her station angered both King Henry VIII and her sister, Queen Anne, and resulted in Mary's banishment from the royal court. She died seven years later, having spent the remainder of her life in obscurity. Early life Mary was probably born at Blickling Hall, the family seat in Norfolk, and grew up at Hever Castle, Kent.Letters of Matthew Parker, p.15. She was the daughter of a rich diplomat and courtier, Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, by his marriage to Lady Elizabeth Howard, the eldest daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk. There is no evidence of Mary's exact date of birth, but it occurred sometime between 1499 and 1508. Most historians suggest that she was the eldest of the three surviving Boleyn children.Ives, p. 17; Fraser, p. 119; Denny, p. 27. All three scholars argue that Mary was the eldest of the three Boleyn children. Evidence suggests that the Boleyn family treated Mary as the eldest child; in 1597, her grandson Lord Hunsdon claimed the earldom of Ormond on the grounds that he was the Boleyns' legitimate heir. Many ancient peerages can descend through female heirs, in the absence of an immediate male heir. If Anne had been the elder sister, the better claim to the title would have belonged to her daughter, Queen Elizabeth I. However, it appears that Queen Elizabeth offered Mary's son, Henry, the earldom as he was dying, although he declined it. If Mary had been the eldest Boleyn sister, Henry would have inherited the title upon his grandfather's death without a new grant from the queen. There is more evidence to suggest that Mary was older than Anne. She was married first, on 4 February 1520;The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn: The Most Happy by Eric Ives an elder daughter was traditionally married before her younger sister. However, in 1532, when Anne was created Marchioness of Pembroke, she was referred to as \\"one of the daughters of Thomas Boleyn\\". Were she the eldest, that status would probably have been mentioned. Overall - most historians now accept Mary as the eldest child, placing her birth some time in 1499.Antonia Fraser, The Wives of Henry VIII (Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1992), p. 119 During her early years, it is most likely that Mary was educated alongside her brother George, and her sister, Anne at Hever Castle in Kent. She was given a conventional education deemed essential for young ladies of her rank and status, which included the basic principles of arithmetic, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing. In addition to her family genealogy, Mary learned the feminine accomplishments of dancing, embroidery, etiquette, household management, music, needlework, and singing, and games such as cards and chess. She was also taught archery, falconry, riding, and hunting. Mary remained in England for most of her childhood, until she was sent abroad in 1514 around the age of fifteen when her father secured her a place as maid-of-honour to the King's sister, Princess Mary, who was going to Paris to marry King Louis XII of France. After a few weeks, many of the Queen's English maids were sent away, but Mary was allowed to stay, probably due to the fact that her father was the new English ambassador to France. Even when Queen Mary left France after she was widowed on 1 January 1515, Mary remained behind at the court of Louis's son-in-law and daughter, Francis I and Claude. Royal affair in France Mary was joined in Paris by her father, Sir Thomas, and her sister, Anne, who had been studying in France for the previous year. During this time Mary is supposed to have embarked on sexual affairs, including one with King Francis himself. Although most historians believe that the reports of her sexual affairs are exaggerated, the French king referred to her as \\"The English Mare\\", \\"my hackney\\", and as \\"una grandissima ribalda, infame sopra tutte\\" (\\"a very great whore, the most infamous of all\\").Charles Carlton, Royal Mistresses (1990)Denny, p. 38 She returned to England in 1519, where she was appointed a maid-of-honour to Catherine of Aragon, the queen consort of Henry VIII.Marie-Louise Bruce, p. 13 Mary was reportedly considered to be a great beauty, both at the French and English court. Royal mistress Signature of Mary Boleyn as \\"Mary Carey\\" after her marriage to William Carey Soon after her return, Mary was married to William Carey, a wealthy and influential courtier, on 4 February 1520; Henry VIII was a guest at the couple's wedding. At some point, Mary became Henry's mistress; the starting date and duration of the liaison are unknown. It was rumoured that one or both of Mary's children were fathered by the King,Ives, Eric William (2004). \\"The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn\\", p. 369 (note 75). Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub. although no evidence exists to support the argument that either of them was the King's biological child. Henry VIII's wife, Catherine of Aragon, had first been married to Henry's elder brother Arthur when he was a little over fifteen years old, but Arthur had died just a few months later. Henry later used this to justify the annulment of his marriage to Catherine, arguing that her marriage to Arthur had created an affinity between Henry and Catherine; as his brother's wife, under canon law she became his sister. When Mary's sister Anne later became Henry's wife, this same canon law might also support that a similar affinity had been created between Henry and Anne due to his earlier liaison with Mary. In 1527, during his initial attempts to obtain a papal annulment of his marriage to Catherine, Henry also requested a dispensation to marry Anne, the sister of his former mistress.Kelly, Henry Angsar: The Matrimonial Trials of Henry VIII pp42 ff Sister's rise to power Anne had returned to England in January 1522; she soon joined the royal court as one of Queen Catherine's maids-of-honour. Anne achieved considerable popularity at court, although the sisters already moved in different circles and were not thought to have been particularly close. Although Mary was said to have been more attractive than her sister, Anne seems to have been more ambitious and intelligent. When the king took an interest in Anne, she refused to become his mistress.Weir, p. 160 By the middle of 1526, Henry was determined to marry her. This gave him further incentive to seek the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. When Mary's husband died during an outbreak of sweating sickness, Henry granted Anne Boleyn the wardship of her nephew, Henry Carey. Mary's husband had left her with considerable debts, and Anne arranged for her nephew to be educated at a respectable Cistercian monastery. Anne also interceded to secure her widowed sister an annual pension of ¬£100.Karen Lindsey, p. 73 Second marriage In 1532, when Anne accompanied Henry to the English Pale of Calais on his way to a state visit to France, Mary was one of her companions. Anne was crowned queen on 1 June 1533 and on 7 September gave birth to Henry's daughter Elizabeth, who later became Queen Elizabeth I. In 1534, Mary secretly married an Essex landowner's younger son: William Stafford (later Sir William Stafford). Since Stafford was a soldier, his prospects as a second son so slight, and his income so small, many believed the union was a love match. When Mary became pregnant, the marriage was discovered. Queen Anne was furious, and the Boleyn family disowned Mary. The couple were banished from court. Mary's financial circumstances became so desperate that she was reduced to begging the king's adviser Thomas Cromwell to speak to Henry and Anne on her behalf. She admitted that she might have chosen \\"a greater man of birth\\" but never one that should have loved her so well, nor a more honest man. And she went on, \\"I had rather beg my bread with him than to be the greatest queen in Christendom. And I believe verily ... he would not forsake me to be a king\\". Henry, however, seems to have been indifferent to her plight. Mary asked Cromwell to speak to her father, her uncle, and her brother, but to no avail. It was Anne who relented, sending Mary a magnificent golden cup and some money, but still refused to reinstate her position at court. This partial reconciliation was the closest the two sisters attained; it is not thought that they met after Mary's exile from the king's court. Mary's life between 1534 and her sister's execution on 19 May 1536 is difficult to trace. There is no record of her visiting her parents, and no evidence of any correspondence with, or visits to, her sister Anne or her brother George when they were imprisoned in the Tower of London. Mary died of unknown causes, on 19 July 1543, in her early forties. Issue Mary Boleyn was the mother of: *Catherine Carey (1524 ‚Äì 15 January 1569). Maid-of-honour to both Anne of Cleves and Catherine Howard, she married a Puritan, Sir Francis Knollys, Knight of the Garter, by whom she had issue. She later became chief lady of the bedchamber to her cousin, Queen Elizabeth I. One of her daughters, Lettice Knollys, became the second wife of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, the favourite of Elizabeth I. * Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon (4 March 1526 ‚Äì 23 July 1596). He was ennobled by Queen Elizabeth I shortly after her coronation, and later made a Knight of the Garter. When he was dying, Elizabeth offered Henry the Boleyn family title of Earl of Ormond, which he had long sought, but at that point, declined. He was married to Anne Morgan, by whom he had issue. Mary's marriage to William Stafford (d. 5 May 1556) may have resulted in the birth of two further children:Hart p. 118 * Edward Stafford (1535‚Äì1545). * Anne Stafford (b. 1536?‚Äì?), probably named in honour of Mary's sister, Queen Anne Boleyn. Depictions in fiction Mary was played by Valerie Gearon in the 1969 film Anne of the Thousand Days, by Perdita Weeks in the Showtime television series The Tudors (2007‚Äì2010) and by Scarlett Johansson in the film The Other Boleyn Girl while Eric Bana portrayed King Henry VIII (2008) A fictionalised form of her character also features prominently in the novels: * Brief Gaudy Hour: A Novel of Anne Boleyn by Margaret Campbell Barnes (1949) * Anne Boleyn by Evelyn Anthony (1957) * The Concubine: A Novel Based Upon the Life of Anne Boleyn by Norah Lofts (1963) * Anne, the Rose of Hever by Maureen Peters (1969) * Anne Boleyn by Norah Lofts (1979) * Mistress Anne: The Exceptional Life of Anne Boleyn by Carolly Erickson (1984) * The Lady in the Tower by Jean Plaidy (1986) * I, Elizabeth: the Word of a Queen by Rosalind Miles (1994) * The Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn by Robin Maxwell (1997) * Dear Heart, How Like You This? by Wendy J.

Her novel was a bestseller and spawned five other books in the same series. However, it was controversial, since many historians found the work inaccurate in regards to historical events and individual characterizations. For example, Gregory characterizes Anne, not Mary, as the elder sister, and makes no mention of Mary's relationships prior to her affair with Henry.Gregory, Philippa, \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" The Other Boleyn Girl was made into a BBC television drama in January 2003, starring Natascha McElhone as Mary and Jodhi May as Anne. Mary also appeared as a character in the 2007 television series The Tudors, portrayed by Perdita Weeks. In Wolf Hall, Boleyn is portrayed by Charity Wakefield.

The chapel, which was built in 1925, is owned and operated by St. John's Episcopal Church in Jackson. Description The chapel complex is composed of the chapel itself, an entrance canopy that incorporates a small bell tower, and a storage shed. The chapel and accessory buildings were designed by C.B. Loomis in a rustic style, also called Western Craftsman. The entrance canopy aligns the approach on the desired axis to the Cathedral Group and provides shelter to the chain- operated bell.Kaiser, Harvey (1997). \\"Landmarks in the Landscape\\", San Francisco: Chronicle Books , p. 160 Access to the chapel is by boardwalk, leading to a beveled plank door with decorative ironwork. The by T-shaped chapel has exposed log interior walls with stained glass windows on either side. Behind the altar on the chapel's axis, a picture window frames a view that substitutes for a stained glass composition. A sacristy stands to one side. History The chapel was built to serve guests and employees of the dude ranches that stretched north of Jackson along the base of the Teton Range. The land was donated by Maud Noble, owner of nearby Menor's Ferry, predating the establishment of Grand Teton National Park in 1929 and its expansion into the Moose area in 1950. The design was based on Our Father's House in Ethete on the Wind River Indian Reservation. Construction materials, labor and funds were provided by local ranchers. It played a primary role in the movie Spencer's Mountain, which was filmed in Jackson Hole in 1963, and featured Henry Fonda and Maureen O'Hara. The chapel was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 10, 1980 The somewhat larger Chapel of the Sacred Heart was built in the park in similar rustic style near Signal Mountain by the Our Lady of the Mountains Catholic Church of Jackson in 1958.

They were first described in 1862 and further described in 1870 when two more craniums were found. It is mostly associated with the area of the United Kingdom. They share features with modern reptiles as well as with fish. They had 4 paddle-like limbs that they used to swim in lakes, but they breathed air. Their diet consisted mostly of live fish. They are of the order Baphetidae which are distinguished by their keyhole shaped orbits, while Loxomma themselves are distinguished by the unique texture on their skulls, said to be honeycomb-like.  History and discovery  1910 restoration of Loxomma in its ecological environment, hiding under the bush on the right The genus Loxomma was discovered and named by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1862 via a near perfect cranium, a vertebra and a rib in the Lanarkshire coal-field of Scotland. The family Baphetidae were among the first Carboniferous tetrapods to be found and were first described by William Dawson in 1863, with Loxomma being the earliest in the family. The subfamily within Baphetidae includes three genera: Loxomma, Megalophalus, and Kyrinion. One cranium was found in May 1870 and another was found in June 1870, both by Thomas Atthey.  Specimen belonging to Loxomma   B. orientalis Discovered in Nyrany, Czech Republic, the skull of this new specimen was studied in order to determine whether it belonged in the Loxomma group or Baphetes group. The classification was determined by comparing the shape of the skulls from a closely related species. In order to check for similarities and differences between Loxomma and Baphetes 2 other skulls were used, belonging to L. acutirostris and B. kirkbyi. Loxomma skulls were high and triangular, while the Baphetes had more of a broad flat snout. In Loxomma, the premaxilla showed space for 8 teeth, while Baphetes had space for 10-11 teeth. After checking the specimen, what was thought to be B. orientalis was found to be closer to the Loxomma group. Due to this closer relationship it was proposed to call the specimen L. lintonensis, which is closer to the L. acutirostris in a cladogram.Milner AC, Milner AR, Walsh SA. A new specimen of Baphetes from N√Ω≈ôany, Czech Republic and the intrinsic relationships of the Baphetidae.Acta Zoologica. 2009;90:318-334. doi:10.1111/j.1463-6395.2008.00340.x.  Description  Ventral view of upper jaw  Skull and dentition  Loxomma and the family Baphetidae are distinct by their large and irregular orbits that have a forwardly directed extension, creating a keyhole shaped orbit. There is a unique pitting on the exposed surfaces of the cranial bones in Loxomma often described as being honeycomb- shaped or net-like that can be used as a distinguishing feature. When looking at the upper surface of the skull it looks like that of Archegosaurus or an alligator of the Crocodilia order, however, the snout and the whole skull is actually broader than that of an alligator. Drawing of parts of the mandible of Loxomma Large Labyrinthodonts have their lower jaw greatly prolonged behind the hinge to give additional leverage to muscles. Loxomma do not have this feature. Instead they have a hinge at the very end of the lower jaw; in this way they lose some mechanical advantages and power in their bite but gain speed instead. The jaws and palates have a battery of large, curved, and slightly keeled teeth. On the upper jaw there is a pair of vomerine tusks, and two pairs of palatal tusks with 5 or 6 smaller teeth between each of the pairs. Each pair of tusks has a depression for two teeth on each side of the jaw with only one tooth present at a time. It was one thought that the empty depression was fit for the teeth of the lower jaw in order to close the mouth, but upon further inspection small bits of tooth could be seen in the empty depressions showing that there was a tooth there once. The size of the teeth varies on the upper and the lower jaw, the larger teeth being more anchored into the mandible than the smaller ones on the lower jaw.  Paleobiology  Restoration Based only on the size of the skull, the full body size of Loxomma is approximated to be 14 feet long, although it is hard to tell definitively without the presence of any post-cranial bones. They lived between the water and the land feeding on live fish as is evident in the shape of their jaw hinge and their two-edged teeth. Because the nasal bones are paired and the nasal apertures are both anterior and pharyngeal, it is indicated that they did breathe air. The location of the orbits on the skull are raised up higher than the snout allowing for the animal to stick out its eyes while the rest of the body is underwater. Loxomma had 4 limbs that were paddle-like, based on the presence of one humerus that is elongated and broad below and narrow at its upper end, that they used to swim. It is concluded that they were a rather sluggish reptile that was still capable of rapid movements for predation, swimming like a fish but breathing air like the alligators or crocodiles of today.

Previously, he has played for the Minnesota Twins, Washington Nationals, Tampa Bay Rays, and Philadelphia Phillies. He is a two- time All-Star, and a Silver Slugger Award winner. Professional career Minnesota Twins Ramos signed with the Minnesota Twins as a non-drafted free agent on July 7, 2004. He caught 43% of potential base stealers in his minor league career, and has a .987 fielding percentage. In 2008, with the Twins' High-A affiliate, the Fort Myers Miracle, he batted .242 with eight home runs and 42 runs batted in (RBIs) in the first half of the 2008 season, helping his team capture the Florida State League first-half West Division title. When 2008 Florida State League All-Star catcher James Skelton of the Lakeland Flying Tigers suffered an injury, Ramos was added to the West Division All-Star team, joining teammates Rob Delaney, Brian Dinkelman, Jeff Manship, Anthony Slama and Danny Valencia. Ramos with the Fort Myers Miracle in 2008 Ramos' batting average jumped to .333 in the second half of 2008. For the season, he batted .288 with thirteen home runs, and was named to the All FSL Team. His 78 RBIs was fourth in the Florida State League. Ramos entered the 2009 season ranked as the Twins third best prospect by Baseball America behind Aaron Hicks and Ben Revere, and #71 in all of minor league baseball. The Twins added Ramos to their 40-man roster, and invited him to Spring training. After which, he was assigned to the Twins' double A Eastern League affiliate, the New Britain Rock Cats. He broke his right index finger in May and suffered a hamstring injury in June, forcing him to do a nearly two-month rehab assignment, during which he hit three home runs in five games with the Gulf Coast League Twins. Ramos rejoined his team in August, and batted .317 with four home runs and 29 RBIs for the season. Ramos batted over .400 in spring training in 2010. However, with Joe Mauer behind the plate, the Twins sent Ramos to the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings rather than have him serve in a back-up role in the majors. Ramos received his first major league call-up on May 1, when Mauer was sidelined by a bruised left heel and was limited to emergency pinch hitting. Ramos took the roster spot of Pat Neshek, who was placed on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to April 29 with inflammation of the middle finger on his right hand. On May 2, facing the Cleveland Indians, Ramos slapped a single between third base and the shortstop in the top of the second inning for his first major league hit. Ramos went four-for- five on the day with three singles and a double. He is the first Twins player since Kirby Puckett in 1984 to collect four hits in a major league debut, and the only catcher in modern history (since 1900) to collect four hits in his MLB debut. On May 3, he followed up his debut by going 3 for 4 and driving in his first RBI. All told, he played seven games with the Twins while filling in for Mauer, batting .296 with three doubles and one RBI. On May 13, with Mauer ready to return to action, and Jos√© Morales coming off the DL, Ramos was reassigned to Rochester.

He was placed on the 60-day disabled list for the 2012 season. Ramos with the Nationals in 2011 Ramos and Kurt Suzuki began 2013 as the Nationals starting catchers. However, on April 13, Ramos hurt his hamstring while trying to beat out a ground ball, putting him on the disabled list, with Jhonatan Solano replacing him and Suzuki started. After being activated on April 29, Ramos quickly went back on the disabled list on May 16 with the same injury. Ramos was activated on July 4, and in his first game back against the Brewers, he went 3‚Äì4 with a three-run home run and five RBI game. His solid July, in which he hit .302/.333/.540 with four HR and 17 RBI in 18 games, earned him more starts over Suzuki before they eventually traded Suzuki to Oakland on August 23.

In 2020, on defense Ramos tied for the NL lead in stolen bases allowed, with 28. Kidnapping Declassified Department of State Cable While in Valencia, Venezuela on November 9, 2011, at approximately 6:45 pm local time, Ramos was kidnapped at gunpoint from his mother's home. According to his account four gunmen threw Ramos into the back of a Chevrolet Captiva and drove him to a mountainous region near the town of Montalban, Venezuela. On November 10, 2011 at approximately 4:00 pm local time, Ramos was reported alive. Originally back in his homeland to play during the offseason for his Venezuelan team, Tigres de Aragua, Ramos was rescued on November 12, 2011. A declassified Department of State cable, obtained by The National Security Archive through a Freedom of Information Act request, shows that Venezuela's Corps of Scientific, Penal, Criminal Investigative Corps (CICPC) ‚Äúalready had the abductors under investigation prior to Ramos‚Äôs kidnapping because the group had kidnapped other individuals in the same area of Valencia.‚Äù Because of this the CICPC was able to immediately identify the kidnappers and their location. After being held in captivity for 50 hours, the police rescued Ramos after exchanging gunfire with the kidnappers. According to the declassified State Department cable, the exchange of gunfire was an intentional CICPC technique used to create a ‚Äúdiversion to disorient the abductors during the raid.‚Äù The former President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez repeatedly called CICPC for updates on the rescue mission. The declassified cable from the State Department also indicated that around 300 CICPC officials worked to rescue Ramos. Six people were arrested in relation to the kidnapping, although a Sports Illustrated article speculated that these arrests may have been arbitrary. Reflecting over the incident, Ramos said \\"I'm very thankful, and I feel like I've been born again.\\"\\"Eight Arrested in Wilson Ramos Kidnapping\\" , Associated Press via Fox News Latino, November 17, 2011.

The band specializes in the Technobanda genre. They are best known for popularizing the Quebradita dancing style that became popular in the 1990s in Mexico and the United States. Their songs are often satirical, filled with sexual innuendos and of double entendres. Some of these include \\"Las Nachas\\", \\"Me Llamo Raquel\\", \\"El Pr√≥ximo Tonto\\" and \\"La Manguera\\", \\"Sigues Siendo La Reina\\". The band has been together for over 30 years and has recorded over 29 albums. History Early Years (1990-1992) The band was formed in 1990 with 12 members. They recorded and released their first album, Serian Las Dos, on cassette the following year in 1991. Composed primarily of cumbias, rancheras and corridos, the band's debut achieved moderate success. In 1992, Banda Machos issued their second album, Casimira, with the title track, Lena De Pirul, La Culebra, Un Indio Quiere Llorar, No Soy Monedita De Oro, La Cosita and Traficantes Michoacanos becoming major hits. They also interpreted El Viejo Joven and Un Cari√±o Como Tu, both well known songs by Joan Sebastian. Breakthrough success (1992-1995) The band's breakthrough happened in 1992 following the release of their third album, Sangre De Indio which peaked at number 16 in the Mexican regional album chart This was in large part on the strength of Al Gato Y Al Raton, their biggest hit at the time. Other hits on the album were La Secretaria, Y La Quiere Paco, Escuadras Del Sur, Sangre De Indio, Volvere, Mi Tesoro and Chaparra De Mi Amor. In 1993, they released their fourth album, Los Machos Tambien Lloran. The album featured Guerita, Motivos, Mi Luna, Mi Estrella, Las Nachas, La Carga Del Diablo, Las Ma√±anitas and Tu Abandono, all of which were popular songs in Mexico and the United States. The album cover was the first to display the band's unique costumes that they gained recognition for. This production included the essential touch of their name by what many call \\"El Macho\\" consisting of a figure with a hat and suit. It is usually black, although it has changed color. Gracias Mujer was released in 1994. Hits on the album include Las Habas, La M√°s Bonita De Todas, El Puchoncito, Mi Otra Mitad, Esclavo y Amo and an interpretation of B√©same Mucho. The band became known early on as \\"La Reina de las Bandas\\" (Queen of the Bands), both because of their unique costumes and their early contributions to the Quebradita genre. Change in Lineups and Continued Success (1995-2001) At the time, the band's lead singer was Ra√∫l Ortega, who after this release attempted a solo career with his own band known as Banda Arre. Raul had little success with his solo adventure, so he decided to return to the band in 2001. Machos released two albums, La Reunion and A Prueba De Balas that year. His return was short- lived, and soon after he left for good. During his absence, Raul was replaced by Jos√© (Pepe) Elpidio Morfin as lead vocalist. Mi Chica Ideal, released in 1995, had the singles Mi Chica Ideal, Usted, Te Lo Debo A Ti and Si La Miro Ma√±ana, that dominated the charts. The album proved to be a big seller. In 1996, they followed up with Palabra De Machos. The majority of the album's success came from the singles Morenaza, Se Lo Dejo A Dios, Mala, Chiquita Bonita and Entre Perico Y Perico. The album's cover dubbed Banda Machos La Reina De Las Bandas (Queen of the Bands), a name that was given to the band. In 1997, their album Historia Sin Fin was released with great anticipation. The title track, Ya Lo Pagaras, Muevete, Tres Minutos, Me Canse De Ti and Sentimiento Navide√±o were the most popular songs on the album. The band continued steadily releasing new material well into the late 1990s, such as 1998's Vivir Sin Ella (which included Besame y Abrazame, Las Mafias del Norte and Sierras Milagrosas) and 1999's Rancheras De Oro. Rancheras De Oro featured En Toda La Chapa, No Compr√≥ Amores and Recu√©rdame Y Ven, the latter two having a music video. In 2000, Me Llamo Raquel, from their 11th studio album, Mi Guitarra Y Yo, took over radio waves in the United States and Latin America. Other songs include Fracase, Si Los Caminos Hablaran, A Capa y Espada, Los Dos Zacatecanos, A Mover El Bote and Ya No Me Dejo. After Mi Guitarra Y Yo, lead vocalist Jos√© Morfin, Mauricio Bueno & Bernando Lomeli opted to leave the band and formed Banda BM3. Since 2001 (more change in lineups and plagiarism lawsuits against Banda Mach) In 2002, release a self-titled album with Eric Perez and Julio C√©sar Guerrero sharing lead vocals. It featured the hit, La Suegra. In 2003, Banda Machos released El Cantante Del Siglo Y La Reina De Las Bandas in honor of Pedro Infante. In 2004, the band released Pura Pasion, which featured Te Vas, La Manguera and La Noche Que Chicago Muri√≥. Some time after, Alejandro D√≠az joined Banda Machos and shared lead vocals with Julio C√©sar and in 2005, Banda Machos released Alma De Fuego. La Negra Le Pone was the lead single of the album. They celebrated their 15th year as band by performing for a live audience in Morelia. The entire performance was presented and is available on DVD. In early 2006, 20 Mil Heridas was released and nominated for a Grammy for Best Banda Album. Hits included 20 Mil Heridas, Regalenme Aire, Sue√±os Compartidos and Chivas Del Coraz√≥n. A Pesar De Todo was released in the spring of 2007. Songs on the album include the title track, Cuatro Meses, El Chubasco, Copa Tras Copa, El D√≠a Que Me Muera and Entre Copa y Copa. In 2008, El Proximo Tonto, the band's 20th studio album in eighteen years, was released with the title track, La Novia Coja and No Hay Problema becoming hits. Banda Machos released Estas Seleccionada in 2009 with Arrem√°ngala Arremp√∫jala as the lead single. Other songs that generated album sales are La Petacona and Te Lavaste La Cara Y El Mono No. Currently, the lead vocalists are Alejandro D√≠az and Jonathan del √Ångel. The back up singers are Rub√©n de Landa and Agust√≠n Mariscal. In 2012, a former Banda Machos member, Pepe Guardado, created a new band which emulated Banda Machos and called itself Banda Mach, an obvious attempt at copying Banda Machos style. They had some success, in part, because Raul Ortega, the original Banda Machos frontman, joined the project. As a result Banda Machos sued to prevent the band from performing and recording. They succeeded in January 2020. Musical contributions Along with Banda el Recodo, among other bands, they were responsible for constructing a more danceable style of traditional Banda music. This was the Quebradita style which essentially combined cumbia with banda. Awards and Larger Recognition In 1993, Banda Machos was awarded by Univisi√≥n's Lo Nuestro for Revelation of the Year in the Mexican/Regional category, achieving a Furia Musical award for Best Mexican Band. Since then they have won Lo Nuestro Award for Banda Artist of the Year multiple times. They have also won multiple gold and platinum records. Banda Machos' \\"Zappa Mambo\\" was featured in the movie My Family, produced by Francis Ford Coppola in 1995. Social impact One of the songs recorded by the band was \\"La Culebra\\" (The Snake), a cover of a Cuban song. This song was played during the campaign stop in which the PRI candidate to the Mexican Presidency in 1994, Luis Donaldo Colosio, was murdered. It is said that \\"La Culebra\\" was supposed to act as the signal to go ahead with the murder. The key stanza was where the song says \\"Ay, si me muerde los pies!, Yo la quiero acurru√±ar si me muerde los pies, Yo la tengo que matar\\". (If it bites my feet, I have to grab it, If it bites my feet, I have to kill it). In the only video recording of the event, one can hear the song in the background as the gun approaches the candidate's temple. Thanks to its album Sangre De Indio, Banda Machos was considered the creator of \\"The Ravine\\", a distinctive dance of the techno-band, as Jorge Luis Berdeja cited in an article in the Cultural section newspaper \\"El Universal\\" from Mexico in 1997, which refers to the band as an element of identity especially among Mexicans living in the United States.

The original debut was in Volume 21, Issue 124. James later made some revisions, including changes to the family name and eldest daughter when he published the story in the UK in 1885. It has been included in several anthologies, including American Gothic Tales, edited by Joyce Carol Oates. Plot summary The tale begins in the 18th century in Massachusetts. It features the Willoughby family (called Wingrave in the 1885 revision), consisting of a widowed mother, one son, and two daughters. The girls, Perdita and Viola (changed to Rosalind in the 1885 version), are considered by the narrator to be equally beautiful. The girls are to be married, but their suitors seem more interested in their looks and possessions than in the women themselves. Both women fall in love with Mr. Arthur Lloyd, who then feels he must choose between them. The sisters vow not to be envious or angry at his choice. When Lloyd chooses Perdita, Viola is jealous in spite of herself. The new Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd move twenty miles away from the Willoughby home, and Viola becomes bitter and depressed. Mr. Lloyd leaves the now-pregnant Perdita at home when he attends the wedding of his brother-in-law, where he encounters Viola, and the two develop a friendship. Arthur receives a message that his daughter has been born but his wife's health is failing. Perdita, aware that she is dying and angry that her husband was with Viola while she (Perdita) was in childbirth, makes Arthur promise to preserve the gowns she has saved in a chest for their daughter. She fears Viola will marry Lloyd and appropriate the dresses for herself. Arthur promises Perdita that he will protect the chest and its contents. After Perdita's death, Viola comes to the Lloyd home to help take care of her niece, and eventually she and Mr. Lloyd marry. A series of misfortunes follow, leaving them with significant financial losses and with Viola unable to bear children. At this time, Viola begins to pressure Arthur to open the chest. Arthur argues that he made a promise to Perdita and tells Viola that the matter is closed. However, Viola's hounding continues and eventually, Arthur surrenders and allows her to open the chest. Later in the evening, when Viola has failed to attend dinner or respond to several of Mr. Lloyd's summons, he climbs the stairs to the attic, where the chest is kept, to look for her. In the attic, he finds Viola dead, on her knees in front of the opened chest, with ten hideous wounds inflicted by ghostly hands. Analysis The tale is considered to be a Gothic tale due to its Freudian uncanny nature. It is something that is familiar while at the same time as being repressed. It is possibly something that is hidden, but has been brought to life. Freud describes it as atavistic feelings of death. Reception Many critics seem to agree this story is a reflection of the Sigmund Freud's theory of \\"the uncanny\\". Critics say that it is a revenge story about the grudges of the dead combined with sibling rivalry. Arthur is considered to be a Shakespeare of his time, and he refers to Perdita's appearance as Shakespearean poetic character. Other critics note that James' writing style in this work reflects Nathaniel Hawthorne's.

The Water Resources Development Act of 1992 authorized the Lower Mississippi River Museum and Riverfront Interpretive Site. Consultation was directed with the Smithsonian Institution in the planning and design of the museum and site and with the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service in the planning, design, and implementation of interpretive programs. The museum is the first of its kind in the United States as it will be the first and only museum to maintain and house a fully restored, dry docked riverboat.  M/V Mississippi IV  M/V Mississippi IV Motor Vessel Mississippi is the fourth United States Army Corps of Engineers' vessel to carry that name. It is a diesel-powered vessel with an all-steel superstructure. Powered by two 8-cylinder engines, each of 1860 horsepower, for extra maneuverability it used controllable pitch propellers which allowed it to generate a reverse thrust of over 70% in the forward direction. The four levels on the superstructure are the main deckhouse, second deckhouse, Texas deckhouse, and the pilothouse. It served as a towboat and inspection vessel until decommissioned in 1993. On September 26, 2007 it was moved to its permanent location on land at the museum.  Kiosk installation & website build  The United States Army Corps of Engineers and Southeastern Archaeological Research, Inc. (SEARCH), located in Jonesville, Florida, needed a strong and modern online presence for the project. Fusioncorp Design‚Ñ¢ Creative Solutions, a brand marketing and website design firm in Lexington, Kentucky, was commissioned in August 2011 specifically for that purpose. Their team immediately began focusing on touchscreen technology and the design of websites for the museum and the M/V Mississippi IV. Fusioncorp wanted the project to be the digital gateway to the museum. The SEARCH team contracted Fusioncorp to develop public websites for the main museum, the M/V Mississippi IV, and a specialized microsite only accessible to users who physically visit the museum. Upon thorough review, they decided the project needed an additional team to acquire the hardware and provide installation for the project. Rely Technology Group, based in Lexington, Kentucky, was subcontracted by Fusioncorp Design to transport and install the interactive hardware and software for both the museum and the riverboat. LMRM.org, the main Lower Mississippi River Museum website, was designed by Daniel Boone, the principal of Fusioncorp. It holds interactive photo galleries, customizable online forms, general information regarding the museum, and is fully visible to the public. The microsite or \\"trivia\\" website (as the website designers referred to it) was designed by Tim Raymer, Fusioncorp's CEO and Chief Designer. Its main goal was to provide an \\"on-the- boat\\" interactive user experience complete with three trivia sections to test the knowledge of visitors, HTML5 audio and video, a guestbook to which users could post, and virtual tours of the M/V Mississippi IV. This website is not visible to the public and is only accessible on the museum kiosks. The teams decided to utilize Apple Computers products and Elo TouchSystems touchscreens as the primary hardware for the elaborate project. Apple proved to be the most stable hardware and software platform, is more efficient for cooling, and has better overall visual aesthetics than Microsoft Windows hardware. Apple's firmware is very compatible with the touchscreen interface as well. The United States Army Corps of Engineers purchased custom kiosks, and Rely Technology fitted them with audio modules and touchscreens at their headquarters in Kentucky prior to transporting them to Vicksburg in mid July 2012. They successfully installed the hardware on August 13, 2012 before the grand opening of the museum August 24, 2012.

It lies along the concurrent U.S. Routes 87 and 287, south of the city of Dumas, the county seat of Moore County. Its elevation is . Although Masterson is unincorporated, it has a post office, with a ZIP code of 79058. According to Olien and Olien, \\"Out in the country, oil companies built camps for workers and their families in and near oil fields. As elsewhere, the camps for workers were necessary because decent housing and good roads were scant, but camps were also directed toward employee retention by offering amenities of suburban life in the middle of nowhere at rock-bottom prices.\\" Masterson was founded in 1927 as a support community for Canadian River Gas plant and gas pipeline, together comprising the Panhandle Field. Masterson was named for Robert Masterson, while the plant was named Bivins Compressor station, after Lee Bivins, another Panhandle rancher. The community eventually included 32 company houses for families and a hotel for single men. The Bivins Elementary School was built in 1937 and educated children through the eighth grade, after which they attended school in Dumas, Texas. Starting in 1943, helium was extracted from the gas at the Exell Helium Plant, which is located nearby and managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The government built 75 houses for employee families. The Masterson post office was established in 1950 and was located in the Exell Store, built in 1948. The compressor station was sold to Colorado Interstate Gas (CIG) Company in 1951. CIG was acquired by the Coastal Corporation in 1973, which then merged with El Paso Corp. in 1999, which was bought by Kinder Morgan in 2011. Starting in 1963, the housing at both the Bivins and the Exell camps was phased out. The Bivins school was closed in 1978. The station was bought by Pioneer Natural Resources in 2002. Panhandle Gas Field The Panhandle Field is a structural trap, characterized by the Amarillo-Wichita Uplift or sometimes referred to as the buried \\"Amarillo mountains\\", which is bounded by three sedimentary basins: the Anadarko Basin to the north, the Dalhart Basin to the west, and the Palo Duro Basin to the south. This tectonic uplift occurred in the Late Mississippian to Early Pennsylvanian time and was sufficient to expose and erode the Precambrian granitic and rhyolitic basement complex forming a granitic wash, which was subsequently submerged and buried by marine sediments in the Permian (specifically, the Wolfcampian carbonates). The granitic wash and these marine sediments form the pay zones but the \\"gas, oil and water cut across formational boundaries\\". The Wolfcampian marine sediments include an arkosic lime, an arkosic dolomite, the Moore County Limestone, the White Dolomite, and the Brown Dolomite. The Leonardian Panhandle Lime, or Wichita, and Red Cave overlay these Wolfcampian sediments, with the anhydrite and dense-dolomite nature of the Wichita forming the reservoir seal. The source for the oil, gas and helium accumulations are the sedimentary rocks of Pennsylvanian age in the Palo Duro and Anadarko Basins. The helium would have been derived from uraniferous rocks and radiogenic in origin. The Panhandle Field has a pressure which is about 400 psi lower than the surrounding basins, which allows gases to migrate into it. Although low, the pressure is at normal hydrostatic pressure relative to the water table. Charles N. Gould mapped the John Ray Dome, which was drilled by the Amarillo Oil Company in 1918 resulting in the Panhandle Field discovery. Drilled to a depth of 2,395 feet, the well, No. 1 Masterson C, produced 5 million cubic feet of gas per day at a pressure of 420 psi. Oil in the Panhandle Field was discovered in 1921 with Gulf Producing Company's No. 2 Burnett well, producing 200 barrels per day. Charles N. Gould After founding the geology department at the University of Oklahoma in 1900, Charles N. Gould worked summers doing field work for Frederick Haynes Newell, first director of the United States Reclamation Service (later known as the United States Bureau of Reclamation), investigating \\"the underground water resources of a portion of the southern part of the Great Plains.\\" His first summer trip through the Panhandle in 1903 resulted in Water Supply Paper 154 of the United States Geological Survey, Geology and Water Resources of the Eastern Portion of the Panhandle of Texas, and a similar trip in 1905 resulted in Water Supply Paper 191, Geology and Water Resources of the Western Portion of the Panhandle of Texas. It was during this second trip Gould \\"explored and prepared a geological map of Palo Duro Canyon...giving names to the formations\\" and \\"studied the anticlines along the Canadian River, indications of which he saw in 1903. In 1908, Gould became director of the Oklahoma Geological Survey and in 1916 was asked by \\"M.C. Nobles, a wholesale grocer of Amarillo\\" if he knew of \\"any oil and gas prospects..in the Panhandle\\" to which Gould replied \\"there appeared to be several big anticlines or domes in that region\\" but it \\"would probably be necessary to send a Plane table party into the field and prepare a detailed contour map of the area.\\" Nobles organized the Amarillo Oil Company on 24 April 1917, from ten businessmen investing one thousand dollars each, and hired Gould to survey an area that included Lee Bivins' ranch south of the Canadian River, and R.B. Masterson's ranch north of the river. The resultant map showed a large dome fifteen miles in diameter with four hundred feet of relief, which Gould named the John Ray Dome after a nearby butte. The company bought oil and gas leases on 64,000 acres around this \\"typical oil-and-gas structure\\" and Gould received one-sixteenth of the acreage, plus one thousand dollars, and paid expenses for his services. The nearest oil or gas was 225 miles away at the time which prompted the following speech by Gould before C.M. Hapgood drilled the company's first well, \\"No one knows whether or not the Lord has put any gas or oil in the Panhandle of Texas, but if there should be any oil or gas in this part of the world, this would appear to be the best place to find it. And, because this seems to be a very large dome, it is my judgement that one is more likely to find gas, rather than oil, in the first well drilled on the apex, or high point, of the dome.\\" The well, Masterson Number 1, encountered several gas-bearing sands over its 2,200 feet depth in Dec. 1918, and flowed eleven million cubic feet a day. Gould later discovered the Cliffside Dome, near the station Cliffside northwest of Amarillo, a large deposit of helium gas, the 666 dome, the north slope of which is where the Borger Oil Field was located, and named the buried granite ridge in the Panhandle the \\"Amarillo Mountains\\". Gould's philosophy, \\"we always told our clients, the business of prospecting for oil or gas was first, last, and all the time a gamble. No one knows in advance of drilling what will be found at any particular place. There is always risk in drilling for oil and all the geologist can do is to minimize that risk.\\" Gallery File:Bivin's House 001.jpgTypical CIG company house at Bivins Station, 1966.

It runs from the Perimeter Highway (PTH 100) at Winnipeg to the border town of Emerson, ending at Manitoba Highway (PTH) 75 at Emerson, near the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border.  Route description  PR 200 begins as a continuation of Winnipeg Route 52 (St. Mary's Road) immediately south of the Perimeter Highway in Winnipeg and runs southward parallel to the flood plain of the meandering Red River. It passes through the community of St. Adolphe and passes by Ste. Agathe before leaving the Red River to run directly south through a heavily agricultural area to the community of Dominion City. There it turns east, joining together with Provincial Road 201 for one mile, before turning south again, towards Emerson. At the south end of Emerson, PR 200 stops at an intersection only 3 metres from the United States border and 150 metres from the former Noyes‚ÄìEmerson East Border Crossing, barricaded since 2006. This intersection was the junction of PR 200 and PTH 75 and southern terminus of PR 200 prior to re-designation of PTH 75 in 2012. PR 200 has since been extended to head west from the intersection, over the Red River, to PTH 75 whose southern terminus is now the Pembina‚ÄìEmerson Border Crossing. History The PR 200 designation first appeared on Manitoba's official map in 1966, the first map issued after Manitoba established the Provincial Road numbering system in 1965. The northern part was originally known as St. Mary's Road (French: Chemin St. Mary's or, rarely, Chemin Ste. Marie), one of the Red River Trails connecting the francophone settlements along the eastern shore of the Red River with St. Boniface, the centre of Manitoba's French community. Much of PR 200 is now paved, but sections of the road between PR 305 and PTH 23 remain a gravel road. St. Mary's Road is continued south of Ste. Agathe by PR 246.

Description The Pookie was a small one-person vehicle named after the bush baby, and fitted with large Formula One tires bought second hand after the South African Grand Prix. The wide tyres prevented the detonation of buried mines by exerting less ground pressure than a human footprint and spanning the mines' circumference. The vehicle was made with readily available parts from the Volkswagen Kombi and resembles a small go-cart with an elevated cab to protect the driver. The bottom of the cab had a V-shaped reinforced hull to deflect the blast away from the operator. Sensor 'pans', resembling rectangular wings, were lowered and used parallel to the ground below the cab. When the vehicle was transported, the pans were raised at a 45 degree angle. According to Trevor Davies Engineering, manufacturer of the Pookie, \\"...of the 76 vehicles built between 1976 and 1980 none ever detonated a mine, though 12 were lost and two drivers were killed.\\" Remotely detonated mines were responsible for the loss of the 12 vehicles and one of the fatalities, though it is not clear if the remaining fatality, caused by an RPG, also resulted in the loss of vehicle and if that loss was included in the previous count. In 1999, an unknown number of new Pookies were manufactured by MineTech, a British company specialising in mine countermeasures. The MineTech Pookie was virtually identical to the Rhodesian Pookie, only fitted with a different engine and detailed improvements such as hydraulic steering. It was deployed to Afghanistan and Somalia by private de-mining contractors.IED‚Äôs, Mines, Route Clearance and Talisman Operators *: Rhodesian Security Forces *: South African Police Footnotes  References  *Laurent Touchard, Guerre dans le bush!

The cabin was built as a homestead in Jackson Hole and represents an adaptation of an Appalachian building form to the West. The cabin was built just south of Spread Creek by John Pierce Cunningham, who arrived in Jackson Hole in 1885 and subsisted as a trapper until he established the Bar Flying U Ranch in 1888. The Cunninghams left the valley for Idaho in 1928, when land was being acquired for the future Grand Teton National Park. Cunningham and his wife grew about of hay, later irrigating another to provide feed for 100 cattle and eight horses. His brother, W. Pierce Cunningham, settled his family nearby. By 1924 the Cunningham ranch comprised . By 1926 Cunningham had moved out of cattle and was raising sheep on the land. J. Pierce Cunningham was one of the original county commissioners chosen when Teton County was organized in 1923. He was also, at various times, justice of the peace, postmaster and game warden. After 1895 the Cunninghams, who had built a more commodious house, used the cabin as a barn or a smithy. A small fortification was erected in 1895 during unrest involving the Bannack Indians. Traces of foundations survive. Gunfight at the Bar Flying U Ranch Two Montana wranglers approached Cunningham in the fall of 1892 to purchase hay. Cunningham allowed the strangers to winter on his ranch. Rumors spread that the men were horse thieves. Next spring, a man claiming to be a U.S. Marshal, with three deputies, rode into Jackson from Idaho. Joined by Jackson recruits, the marshal's men surrounded the ranch at night. In the morning, the posse gunned down the alleged thieves. The men's guilt, the allegations, and the marshal's identity were never confirmed. Description The cabin is a sod-roofed double-pen or dog-trot style building with a room on either side of the central breezeway or \\"dog-trot.\\" The form is Appalachian in origin. No nails or metal fastenings were used in the cabin's construction. The cabin was reconstructed in 1956, resetting the wall logs after replacing the sill logs and rebuilding the roof. The logs are saddle-V-notched at the corners. The site comprises , including the cabin, 1890 house site, fort site, barn site, bunkhouse and outbuildings sites, as well as pits that may have been wells or privies. The cabin measures about by . Two rooms both open into the breezeway, each room with two windows facing northeast and southwest. The south room was the living quarters, the north was used as a forge.

Whether a listener is present or not is sometimes irrelevant. It answers the question: \\"Why has this been said?\\" The four basic sentence functions in the world's languages include the declarative, interrogative, exclamative, and the imperative. These correspond to a statement, question, exclamation, and command respectively. Typically, a sentence goes from one function to the next through a combination of changes in word order, intonation, the addition of certain auxiliaries or particles, or other times by providing a special verbal form. The four main categories can be further specified as being either communicative or informative. Communicative vs. informative While communication is traditionally defined as the transfer of information, the two terms, under present context, are differentiated as follows below: Communicative sentences These types of sentences are more intended for the speaker's sake than for any potential listener. They are meant more for the speaker's immediate wants and needs. These sentences tend to be less intentional (out of frustration for example), in general more literal, more primitive, and are usually about the here and now. Because of these features, it is generally speculated that this is pretty much the basis or limitation of any form of animal communication. (Speculated because scientists will never truly be able to understand non-human forms of communication like we do our own; although studies with \\"talking\\" primates have clued us in to a certain degree.) =Exclamatory= * Ouch! * I'll never finish this paper in time! =Imperative= An imperative sentence gives anything from a command or order, to a request, direction, or instruction. Imperative sentences are more intentional than exclamatory sentences and do require an audience; as their aim is to get the person(s) being addressed either to do or to not do something. And although this function usually deals with the immediate temporal vicinity, its scope can be extended, i.e. you can order somebody to move out as soon as you find yourself a job. The negative imperative can also be called the prohibitive and the inclusive plural imperative, the hortative. It is debatable whether the imperative is only truly possible in the second person. The vocative case of nouns can be said to indicate the imperative as well since it does not seek information, but rather a reaction from the one being addressed. An imperative can end in either a period or an exclamation point depending on delivery. * Look at me. * After separating them from the yolks, beat the whites until they are light and fluffy. Informative sentences Informative sentences are more for the mutual benefit of both the listener and the speaker, and, in fact, require more of an interaction between both parties involved. They are more intentional or premeditated, less essential, more cooperative, and they aim to either provide or retrieve information, making them quintessential abstractions. But perhaps the most differentiating quality that distinguishes informative sentences from the communicative is that the former more naturally and freely make use of displacement. Displacement refers to information lost in time and space which allows us to communicate ideas relating to the past or future (not just the now), and that have taken or can take place at a separate location (from here). To an extent, this is one of the biggest differences between human communication and that of other animals. =Declarative= The declarative sentence is the most common kind of sentence in language, in most situations, and in a way can be considered the default function of a sentence. What this means essentially is that when a language modifies a sentence in order to form a question or give a command, the base form will always be the declarative. In its most basic sense, a declarative states an idea (either objectively or subjectively on the part of the speaker; and may be either true or false) for the sheer purpose of transferring intel. In writing, a statement will end with a period. * Roses are red and violets are blue. * She must be out of her mind. =Interrogative= An interrogative sentence asks a question and hence ends with a question mark. In speech, it almost universally ends in a rising inflection. Its effort is to try to gather information that is presently unknown to the interrogator, or to seek validation for a preconceived notion held. Beyond seeking confirmation or contradiction, sometimes it is approval or permission that is sought as well, among other reasons one could have for posing a question. The one exception in which it isn't information that is needed, is when the question happens to be rhetorical (see allofunctional implicature section below). While an imperative is a call for action, an interrogative is a call for information. * What do you want? * Are you feeling well? Declarative vs. affirmative vs. positive A declarative statement should not be deemed synonymous with an affirmative one. This is because although a declarative statement can state facts (given that the speaker is not consciously lying), it can also express something which is not true. The information he or she is providing, regardless of whether it be true or not in reality, is in fact true or false to that speaker. Therefore, a declarative can be either in the affirmative or in the negative, and we can say that, Joanna is late and Joanna is not late, both technically qualify as declarative sentences. Declarative refers to a sentence's function or purpose, while affirmative and negative deal with a sentence's veracity, or grammatical polarity, which is why the different terms can overlap simultaneously. Though not as erroneous as the above misnomer, there is a clouding that can occur between the slight distinction of the affirmative, and the positive. Although it semantically speaking comes natural that positive is the opposite of negative, and therefore should be completely synonymous with affirmative, grammatically speaking, once again they tend to be separate entities; depending on specificity. Positive in linguistic terms refers to the degree of the quality of an adjective or adverb, while affirmative refers to the perceived validity of the entire sentence. Thus, all three terms being separate entities, an adjective or adverb can be in the positive degree but expressed in the negative, so that the sentence, This hummer does not seem to be eco-friendly, has all negative, positive, and declarative properties. In fact, an exclamatory, imperative, as well as a question can be in the negative form: I can't do this!, Don't touch me, Don't you want to? Allofunctional implicature There are many instances in which a sentence can be grammatically shaped as one function, yet in actual execution, may serve a completely different purpose than suggested by the way it was constructed; hence, allofunctional, to mean 'serving a different purpose than originally intended'. Or in other words, it is very subtly yet unequivocally implied by process of pragmatics that its function must be changed to another in order for the sentence to make sense in the present context of conversation. A classic example would be the \\"question\\": Could you pass the salt? In the above sentence, although it is grammatically structured as a question, it can quite safely be inferred that the speaker is not inquiring as to whether the person they are addressing is physically capable of passing the salt at the dinnertable or not. What the speaker really wants is to get the salt. It is a request, or call for action as opposed to information, thus making the sentence allofunctional (note that adding a word like 'please' at the end would tend to make this point clearer, and when posed as a question, this request is perceived as being more polite than if it were simply in the natural imperative). Therefore, what at first may come off as an interrogative sentence upon initial delivery, the listener must almost immediately reinterpret as an imperative and respond accordingly. Other examples include; *Exclamative interrogative (interrogative structure with exclamative function): Why does this keep happening to me? **I might utter this phrase only to vent out my frustration vocally. *Imperative declarative (declarative structure with imperative function): I would feel more comfortable if you wore your seatbelt. **If I say this to you I'm strongly urging you to buckle up. The list goes on, and as a matter of fact, all 12 combinations between each of the four functions and their three other counterparts should be theoretically possible. Another important point to note is that the allofunctionality of a sentence is completely language specific as to how it differentiates function. To exemplify this, we can look at English and generalize that imperative sentences, when affirmative, tend to begin with the verb, while declarative sentences that are prosaic will almost always start with the subject (this is because in the imperative, the subject is implied, or obviously unmistakable, since it is the subject itself which is being spoken to). All that being taken into account, we can more clearly see why a statement such as, You are not going to that bar. (I forbid it), would qualify as allofunctional. Other functions J. L. Austin discussed sentences that have \\"perlocutionary force\\": uttering them (at least in the correct context) directly causes something to be or to occur. For example, \\"I promise\\", \\"I warn\\", \\"I forgive\\" or \\"I resign\\". Such utterances do not fit readily into any of the traditional sentence functions described above.

The engagement  According to Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet left their base in Sevastopol, Ukraine, on the evening of 8 August. On 10 August RIA Novosti ‚Äì quoting a source in the Russian Navy headquarters ‚Äì reported that a group of Russian warships had arrived at the maritime border with Georgia in the eastern part of the Black Sea. According to the source, the vessel Moskva, accompanied by a patrol vessel and supply ships, travelled from Sevastopol. They would join three large landing ships that had earlier arrived in the area from Sevastopol and from Novorossiysk. \\"The purpose of the Black Sea Fleet vessels' presence in this region is to provide aid to refugees\\", the source said. The source denied media reports that the warships were enforcing a blockade of Georgia's coast. \\"A blockade of the coastline would mean war with Georgia, and we are not in a state of war with Georgia.\\" Abkhaz officials said that several Georgian warships had attempted on 9 August to approach the coast of Abkhazia, but the attempts were curbed by the Russian ships. On 10 August a naval skirmish between the Russian ships and several Georgian naval vessels took place. According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, four Georgian fast missile boats breached the \\"security zone\\" declared around the Russian Navy ships off Abkhazia. After an attempt at hailing the intruding units, the Russian units opened fire with artillery, sinking one of the ships and forcing the remaining three Georgian boats to withdraw towards the port of Poti. The Russian navy earlier said that Russian warships originally said to be near the Georgian coast had put into Novorossiysk. This action constituted the Russian Navy's first real sea battle since 1945. Russian media reported that a naval battle took place on 10 August 2008. The ITAR-Tass news agency quoted a ministry spokesman as saying that Georgian missile patrol boats twice tried to attack Russian ships. According to a sailor interviewed in Sevastopol on 13 August, a Georgian vessel was struck and sunk in 300 m of water by P-120 Malakhit (SS-N-9 'Siren') missile, fired allegedly by the guided missile corvette MRK Mirazh. Furthermore, the sailor claimed that a second ship was also damaged during the battle. He said that the vessel sunk in action was the missile boat Tbilisi. It is reported that the vessel disappeared from the surface within 90 seconds in 300 meters of water. Russian media also reported that the sunk Georgian vessel was Tbilisi. However, this was disputed. It was suggested that the destroyed vessel was the P-21 patrol boat Giorgi Toreli. Russian Navy operations According to Georgian sources, the Russian navy that moved toward Georgia, comprised the following vessels: * Ropucha-class landing ships Tsezar Kunikov and Yamal. * Alligator-class landing ship Saratov. * Albatros-class Anti-Submarine Corvettes Kasimov, Povarino and Suzdalets. * Moma Class Surveillance ship Ekvator. * Natya-class minesweepers Zhukov and Turbinist. * Nanuchka-class corvette Mirazh. * Bora-class guided missile hovercraft Samum (Breeze) * Small Landing Ship Koida * Sorum Class Fleet Tug MB-31. * Kashin-class destroyer Smetlivyy * Slava-class cruiser Moskva. * Alrosa B-871 which landed in Suhumi According to PONARS Eurasia, a total of 13 ships were headed towards the Georgian coast, including the Slava- class cruiser Moskva, the Kashin-class destroyer Smetlivyy, several Grisha- class corvettes (Suzdalets, Aleksandrovsk, Muromets, and possibly Kasimov), the Nanuchka-class missile ship Mirazh, two patrol craft, three amphibious landing craft (two Ropucha-class, Tsezar Kunikov and Yamal, and one Alligator- class, Saratov), two mine warfare ships (Admiral Zheleznyakov and Turbinist), the transport ship General Ryabikov, and the tugboat Epron. The Georgian coast was blockaded by vessels of the Russian Black Sea Fleet on 10 August 2008. According to Interfax news agency citing Russian navy source, the blockading units were assigned the task to not allow arms and military hardware supplies to reach Georgia by sea. Ukraine, where the ships were based, warned Russia that it had the right to bar the ships from coming back to port because of their mission. Georgia has not acknowledged the loss of a patrol boat and does not mention any naval skirmish with the Russian navy. The Black Sea Fleet, according to the Georgian Foreign Ministry statement, landed 4,000 troops in Ochamchire. It then went on to attack Georgian troops deployed at Kodori Gorge. According to the Georgian source, a missile attack was launched against an inland target in Kodori. Russians appeared in Poti on 12 August 2008. All the naval vessels there, which were Coast Guard Border Police patrol vessels, were mined and exploded. While the war started on Friday August 8, the Black Sea Fleet reportedly arrived off the coast of Georgia on Saturday August 9. While the distance from Sevastopol to Ochamchire is about 400 nautical miles, the Russian convoy (including Moskva, Smetlivyy, Muromets, and Aleksandrovets) sailed from Sevastopol with an assortment of support vessels that could only make 12-16 knots at best. It was suggested that was a 25-hour trip at best, meaning the ships would have departed from Sevastopol almost immediately after the war began. Some analysts even suggested that these ships may have left base before the outbreak of the war. Aftermath Ukrainian authorities declared that they were ready to discuss with Russians the return of ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet to Crimea. The commanding officer of the corvette Mirazh, Captain Ivan Dubik, was received in Moscow by Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, who awarded him a military medal, along with other members of the Russian armed forces.

It is closely related to ferroelectricity; the relation between antiferroelectricity and ferroelectricity is analogous to the relation between antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetism. An antiferroelectric material consists of an ordered (crystalline) array of electric dipoles (from the ions and electrons in the material), but with adjacent dipoles oriented in opposite (antiparallel) directions (the dipoles of each orientation form interpenetrating sublattices, loosely analogous to a checkerboard pattern). This can be contrasted with a ferroelectric, in which the dipoles all point in the same direction. In an antiferroelectric, unlike a ferroelectric, the total, macroscopic spontaneous polarization is zero, since the adjacent dipoles cancel each other out. Antiferroelectricity is a property of a material, and it can appear or disappear (more generally, strengthen or weaken) depending on temperature, pressure, external electric field, growth method, and other parameters. In particular, at a high enough temperature, antiferroelectricity disappears; this temperature is known as the N√©el point or Curie point.

In the general election, the incumbent Democrat Shelley Berkley defeated Republican Kenneth Wegner, a Gulf War veteran and part-time Bail Enforcement Agent. District 2 thumb This district covered all of Nevada except for parts of Clark County. Reno, along with surrounding Washoe County, casts about 70% of the district's vote. The 2nd District had been represented by Republicans continuously since its creation, and had been represented by Republican Dean Heller of Carson City since 2007. He defeated Democrat Jill Derby of Gardnerville, a former Nevada System of Higher Education Regent and Chair of the Nevada Democratic Party. Heller had previously defeated Derby in the 2006 election, although this time the margin of victory was 10.4%, as opposed to just 5% two years before. District 3 thumb This district covered the suburbs of Las Vegas, including Henderson, parts of North Las Vegas and Summerlin, and much of unincorporated Clark County. Incumbent Republican Jon Porter of Boulder City (campaign website) was considered to be at risk due to the increasingly Democratic electorate in the 3rd District. Porter lost re-election to the Democratic nominee, Nevada Senate Minority Leader Dina Titus of Las Vegas (campaign website). He was also challenged by Bob Giaquinta of the Green Party (campaign website), Floyd Fitzgibbons of the Independent American Party, Joseph P. Silvestri of the Libertarian Party (campaign website), and independent Jeffrey C. Reeves (campaign website). CQ Politics had forecasted the race as 'No Clear Favorite'. Porter had represented the district since its creation in 2003, but he faced a tough race: he won by only 48% to 46% in 2006 against a former aide to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and won by 54% in 2004. George W. Bush barely won this district with 50% to 49% for John Kerry in 2004 (CPVI=D+1). Leading Democratic candidates included Fraud Examiner Andrew Martin and Clark County prosecutor Robert Daskas, but Daskas dropped out in late April, citing family concerns.

Self aligning torque, also known as aligning torque, aligning moment, SAT, or Mz, is the torque that a tire creates as it rolls along, which tends to steer it, i.e. rotate it around its vertical axis. In the presence of a non-zero slip angle, this torque tends to steer the tire toward the direction in which it is traveling, hence its name. The magnitude of this torque can be calculated as the product of the lateral force generated at the contact patch and the distance behind the wheel centre at which that force acts. This distance is known as the pneumatic trail. The steering torque around a non-vertical steer axis with non-zero mechanical trail is given by : (trail + pneumatic trail) * cos(caster angle) * Fy. Even if the slip angle and camber angle are zero, and the road is flat, this torque will still be generated due to asymmetries in the tire's construction and the asymmetrical shape and pressure distribution of the contact patch. Typically for a production tire this torque reaches a maximum at 2‚Äì4 degrees of slip (this figure depends on many variables) and falls to zero as the tire reaches its maximum lateral force capability.

She currently resides in Espa√±ola, New Mexico, just north of Santa Fe and is a member of the Santa Clara Pueblo. Description The sculpture consists of five separate sculptures, that make up a family. Grounded in figures from Santa Clara Pueblo oral tradition the sculptures are named: * Father * Mother * Little one * Moon Woman * Mountain Bird The sculptures were built in-situ over the summer of 2007, Nora Naranjo- Morse worked with her niece Athena Swentzell Steen and her husband Bill Steen who are experts at building structures with natural material, and the family of Don Juan Morales (Tepehuan) from the Mexican state of Durango, as well as many volunteers including museum staff and visitors. Materials The Sculptures are made entirely of natural materials: dirt, sand, straw, clay, stone, black locust wood, bamboo, grass, and yam vines. These natural elements were selected to take on a life of their own and thus affect the sculptures over time. In this way the materials ensure the forms are 'always becoming'. Dimensions The five sculptures range in size from seven and a half to sixteen feet tall. History and Location On May 24, 2006, the National Museum of the American Indian announced that Naranjo-Morse had won its outdoor sculpture design competition. \\"Always Becoming\\" was selected unanimously from more than 55 entries submitted by Native artists from throughout the Western Hemisphere. During the summer of 2007, on the grounds of the National Museum of the American Indian, Washington, DC, Naranjo-Morse built a family of clay sculptures. The commissioned work is located on the 'Native landscape' at the museum's south entrance on Maryland Avenue S.W. near 4th Street and Independence Avenue S.W., Washington, D.C. A public dedication, officially opening these public works of art, took place on September 1, 2007. The sculptures are intended to disintegrate over time, and the lives of sculptures from the initial idea through the continued process of stewardship are being documented by Filmmaker Dax Thomas (Laguna/Acoma). As the sculptures disintegrate the films of their life will form a more permanent record of their existence and are therefore an essential part of the artistic process, and the work of art itself.

Principle of operation  Its construction and principle of operation is simple. It consists of a titanium filament through which a high current (typically around 40 Amps) is passed periodically. This current causes the filament to reach the sublimation temperature of titanium, and hence the surrounding chamber walls become coated with a thin film of clean titanium. Since clean titanium is very reactive, components of the residual gas in the chamber which collide with the chamber wall are likely to react and to form a stable, solid product. Thus the gas pressure in the chamber is reduced.VG Scienta retrieved 8 April 2009 But after some time, the titanium film will no longer be clean and hence the effectiveness of the pump is reduced. Therefore, after a certain time, the titanium filament should be heated again, and a new film of titanium re-deposited on the chamber wall. Since the time taken for the titanium film to react depends on a number of factors (such as the composition of the residual gas, the temperature of the chamber and the total pressure), the period between successive sublimations requires some consideration. Typically, the operator does not know all of these factors, so the sublimation period is estimated according to the total pressure and by observing the effectiveness of the outcome. Some TSP controllers use a signal from the pressure gauge to estimate the appropriate period. Since the TSP filament has a finite lifetime, TSPs commonly have multiple filaments to allow the operator to switch to a new one without needing to open the chamber. Replacing used filaments can then be combined with other maintenance jobs. The effectiveness of the TSP depends on a number of factors. Amongst the most critical are; the area of the titanium film, the temperature of the chamber walls and the composition of the residual gas. The area is typically maximised when considering where to mount the TSP. The reactivity of the new titanium film is increased at lower temperatures, so it is desirable to cool the relevant part of the chamber, typically using liquid nitrogen. However, due to the cost of the nitrogen and the need to ensure a continuous supply, TSPs are commonly operated at room temperature. Finally the residual gas composition is important - typically the pump works well with the more reactive components (such as CO and O2), but is very ineffective at pumping inert components such as the noble gasses. Therefore, TSP must be used in conjunction with other pumps. Other pumps which use exactly the same working principle, but using something other than titanium as a source are also relatively common. This family of pumps are usually called 'getter pumps' or 'getters' and typically consist of metals which are reactive with the components of the residual gas which are not pumped by the TSP. By choosing a number of such sources, most constituents of the residual gas, except for the noble gases, can be targeted. Practical considerations When mounting the TSP in the chamber, a number of important considerations must be made. First, it is desirable that the filament can deposit on a large area. However, one must take care that the titanium is not deposited onto anything it can damage. For example, electrical feedthroughs containing ceramic insulators will fail if the titanium forms a conducting film which bridges the ceramic insulator. Samples may become contaminated by titanium if they have line-of-sight to the pump. Also, titanium is a very hard material, so titanium film which builds up on the inside of the chamber may form flakes which fall into mechanical components (typically turbomolecular pumps and valves) and damage them. Many chambers containing TSPs also have an ion pump. Often the ion pump provides a good location for the TSP, and some manufacturers promote the use of combined TSP/ion-pumps.Varian Inc, \\"ion sublimation pump\\" retrieved 8 April 2009 Furthermore, TSPs have been shown to be effective against the regurgitation effects of ion pumps.

In the 20th century the Inuit diet began to change and by the 21st century the diet was closer to a Western diet. Although traditional or country foods still play an important role in the identity of Inuit, a large amount of food is purchased from the store, which has led to health problems and food insecurity.Nunavut Food Security Coalition According to Edmund Searles in his article Food and the Making of Modern Inuit Identities, they consume this type of diet because a mostly meat diet is \\"effective in keeping the body warm, making the body strong, keeping the body fit, and even making that body healthy\\". Food sources * Hunted meats: ** Sea mammals such as walrus, seal, and whale. Whale meat generally comes from the narwhal, beluga whale and the bowhead whale. The latter is able to feed an entire community for nearly a year from its meat, blubber, and skin. Inuit hunters most often hunt juvenile whales which, compared to adults, are safer to hunt and have tastier skin. Ringed seal and bearded seal are the most important aspect of an Inuit diet and is often the largest part of an Inuit hunter's diet. ** Land mammals such as caribou, polar bear, and muskox ** Birds and their eggs ** Saltwater and freshwater fish including sculpin, Arctic cod, Arctic char, capelin and lake trout. * While it is not possible to cultivate native plants for food in the Arctic, Inuit have traditionally gathered those that are naturally available,Searles, Edmund. \\"Food and the Making of Modern Inuit Identities.\\" Food & Foodways: History & Culture of Human Nourishment 10 (2002): 55‚Äì78.Bennett, John, and Susan Rowley, eds.

They are no longer skilled in hunting like their ancestors and are growing more accustomed to the (\\"white people\\") food that they receive from the south. The high costs of hunting equipment‚Äîsnowmobiles, rifles, sleds, camping gear, gasoline, and oil‚Äîis also causing a decline in families who hunt for their meals. An Inuit hunter skinning a ringed seal * Seal: Depending on the season, Inuit hunt for different types of seal: harp seal, harbour seal, and bearded seal. Ringed seals are hunted all year, while harp seals are only available during the summer. Because seals need to break through the ice to reach air, they form breathing holes with their teeth and claws. Through these, Inuit hunters are able to capture seals. When a hunter arrives at these holes, they set up a seal indicator that alerts the hunter when a seal is coming up for a breath of air. When the seal comes up, the hunter notices movement in the indicator and uses his harpoon to capture the seal in the water. Walrus hunting * Walrus: They are often hunted during the winter and spring since hunting them in summer is much more dangerous. A walrus is too large to be controlled by one man, so it cannot be hunted alone. In Uqalurait: An Oral History of Nunavut, an Inuit elder describes the hunt of a walrus in these words: \\"When a walrus was sighted, the two hunters would run to get close to it and at a short distance it is necessary to stop when the walrus's head was submerged... the walrus would hear you approach. [They] then tried to get in front of the walrus and it was harpooned while its head was submerged. In the meantime, the other person would drive the harpoon into the ice through the harpoon loop to secure it.\\" * Bowhead whale: Similar to walrus, they are captured by harpoon. The hunters use active pursuit to harpoon the whale and follow it during attack. At times, Inuit were known for using a more passive approach when hunting whales. According to John Bennett and Susan Rowley, a hunter would harpoon the whale and instead of pursuing it, would \\"wait patiently for the winds, currents, and spirits to aid him in bringing the whale to shore.\\" Bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), caught in an Inuit subsistence whale hunt in Igloolik, Nunavut in 2002 * Caribou: During the majority of the year, they roam the tundra in small herds, but twice a year large herds of caribou cross the inland regions. Caribou have excellent senses of smell and hearing so that the hunters must be very careful when in pursuit. Often, Inuit hunters set up camp miles away from the caribou crossing and wait until they are in full view to attack. There are many ways in which the caribou can be captured, including spearing, forcing caribou into the river, using blinders, scaring the caribou, and stalking the caribou. When spearing caribou, hunters put the string of the spear in their mouths and the other end they use to gently spear the animal. * Fish: They are caught by jigging. The hunter cuts a square hole in the ice on the lake and fishes using a fish lure and spear. Instead of using a hook on a line, Inuit use a fake fish attached to the line. They lower it into the water and move it around as if it is real. When the live fish approach it, they spear the fish before it has a chance to eat the fake fish. Nutrition Caribou meat from hunt. Greenland Because the climate of the Arctic is ill- suited for agriculture and lacks forageable plant matter for much of the year, the traditional Inuit diet is lower in carbohydrates and higher in fat and animal protein compared to the global average. When carbohydrate intake is inadequate for total energy requirements, protein is broken down in the liver through gluconeogenesis and utilized as an energy source. Inuit studied in the 1970s were found to have abnormally large livers, presumably to assist in this process. Their urine volumes were also high, a result of additional urea which the body uses to purge waste products from gluconeogenesis. However, in multiple studies the traditional Inuit diet has not been shown to be a ketogenic diet. Not only have multiple researchers been unable to detect any evidence of ketosis resulting from the traditional Inuit diet, but the ratios of fatty-acid to glucose were observed to be well below the generally accepted level of ketogenesis. Inuit actually consume more carbohydrates than most nutritionists have assumed. Because some of the meat the Inuit eat is raw and fresh, or freshly frozen, they can obtain more carbohydrates from their meat, as dietary glycogen, than Westerners can. The Inuit practice of preserving a whole seal or bird carcass under an intact whole skin with a thick layer of blubber also permits some proteins to ferment, or hydrolyze, into carbohydrates. Furthermore, the blubber, organs, muscle and skin of the marine mammals that Inuit eat have significant glycogen stores, which assist those animals when oxygen is depleted on prolonged dives. For instance, when blubber is analyzed by direct carbohydrate measurements, it has been shown to contain as much as 8‚Äî30% carbohydrates. While postmortem glycogen levels are often depleted through the onset of rigor mortis, marine mammals have a much delayed onset of rigor mortis, even in warm conditions, presumably due to the high content of oxymyoglobin in the muscle that may permit aerobic metabolism to continue slowly for some time after the death of the animal. Additionally, in cold conditions, glycogen's depletion is halted at -18 ¬∞C (-0.4 ¬∞F) and lower temperatures in comminuted meat.Lawrie 2014, p. 298. Traditional Inuit diets derive approximately 50% of their calories from fat, 30‚Äì35% from protein and 15‚Äì20% of their calories from carbohydrates, largely in the form of glycogen from the raw meat they consumed. This high fat content provides valuable energy and prevents protein poisoning, which historically was sometimes a problem in late winter when game animals grew lean through winter starvation. It has been suggested that because the fats of the Inuit's wild-caught game are largely monounsaturated and rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the diet does not pose the same health risks as a typical Western high-fat diet. However, actual evidence has shown that Inuit have a similar prevalence of coronary artery disease as non-Inuit populations and they have excessive mortality due to cerebrovascular strokes, with twice the risk to that of the North American population. Indeed, the cardiovascular risk of this diet is so severe that the addition of a more standard American diet has reduced the incidence of mortality in the Inuit population. Furthermore, fish oil supplement studies have failed to support claims of preventing heart attacks or strokes. Vitamins and minerals which are typically derived from plant sources are nonetheless present in most Inuit diets. Vitamins A and D are present in the oils and livers of cold-water fishes and mammals. Vitamin C is obtained through sources such as caribou liver, kelp, muktuk, and seal brain; because these foods are typically eaten raw or frozen, the vitamin C they contain, which would be destroyed by cooking, is instead preserved. Eating habits and food preparation Searles defines Inuit food as mostly \\"eaten frozen, raw, or boiled, with very little mixture of ingredients and with very few spices added.\\" Some preparations include: * : berries mixed with fat. * : flatbread * Food preservation techniques include fermenting fish and meat in the form of * Labrador tea * a traditional soup made from seal, whale, caribou, or seabirds. One common way to eat the meat hunted is frozen. Many hunters will eat the food that they hunt on location where they found it. This keeps their blood flowing and their bodies warm. One custom of eating meat at the hunting site pertains to fish. In Overland to Starvation Cove: A History, Heinrich Klutschak explains the custom: \\"...no fish could be eaten in a cooked state on the spot where caught but could only be enjoyed raw; only when one is a day's march away from the fishing site is it permitted to cook the fish over the flame of a blubber lamp.\\" Inuit eat only two main meals a day, but it is common to eat many snacks every hour.Klutschak, Heinrich. Overland to Starvation Cove. Trans. and Ed. William Barr. Canada: Univ. of Toronto Press, 1987. Customs among Inuit when eating and preparing food are very strict and may seem odd for people of different cultures. When eating a meal, Inuit place large slabs of meat, blubber, and other parts of the animal on a piece of metal, plastic, or cardboard on the floor. From here, anyone in the house is able to cut off a piece of meat. At these meals, no one is obliged to join in the meal; Inuit eat only when hungry. Sometimes, though, meals are announced to the whole camp. A woman does this by the shout of \\"Ujuk!\\" which means \\"cooked meat\\". After a hunt, the eating habits differ from normal meals. When a seal is brought home, the hunters quickly gather around it to receive their pieces of meat first. This happens because the hunters are the coldest and hungriest among the camp and need the warm seal blood and meat to warm them. The seal is cut in a specific way directly after a hunt. Borr√© explains the cutting of the seal in this way: \\"one of the hunters slits the abdomen laterally, exposing the internal organs. Hunters first eat pieces of liver or they use a tea cup to gather some blood to drink.\\" At this time, hunters may also chop up pieces of fat and the brain to mix together and eat with meat. Women and children are accustomed to eating different parts of the seal because they wait until the hunters are done eating. Intestines are the first thing to be chosen and then any leftover pieces of the liver are consumed. Finally, ribs and backbone are eaten and any remaining meat is distributed among the camp. Food sharing in the community Inuit are known for their practice of food sharing, a form of food distribution where one person catches the food and shares with the entire community. Food sharing was first documented among the Inuit in 1910 when a little girl decided to take a platter around to four neighboring families who had no food of their own. 300px According to Uqalurait: An Oral History of Nunavut, \\"food sharing was necessary for the physical and social welfare of the entire group.\\" Younger couples would give food from their hunt to the elders, most often their parents, as a sign of respect. Food sharing was not only a tradition, but also a way for families to make bonds with one another. Once you shared food with someone, you were in a \\"lifelong partnership\\" with them. Inuit often are relentless in making known that they are not like in the sense that they do not eat the same food and they are communal with their food. believe that the person who purchases the food is the owner of the food and is free to decide what happens to the food. Searles describes the Inuit perspective on food by saying that \\"in the Inuit world of goods, foods as well as other objects associated with hunting, fishing, and gathering are more or less communal property, belonging not to individuals but to a larger group, which can include multiple households.\\" Food in an Inuit household is not meant to be saved for the family who has hunted, fished, gathered, or purchased it, but instead for anyone who is in need of it. Searles and his wife were visiting a family in Iqaluit and he asked for permission to have a cup of orange juice. This small gesture of asking was taken as offensive because Inuit do not consider food belonging to one person. Perceived benefits and beliefs of the diet Arctic char fishing The Inuit believe that their diet has many benefits over the western food. They are adamant about proving that their diet will make one stronger, warmer, and full of energy. One example is the drinking of seal blood. When interviewing an Inuit elder, Searles was told that \\"Inuit food generates a strong flow of blood, a condition considered to be healthy and indicative of a strong body.\\" After the consumption of seal blood and meat, one could look at their veins in the wrist for proof of the strength that Inuit food provides. Borr√© states that \\"seal blood is seen as fortifying human blood by replacing depleted nutrients and rejuvenating the blood supply, it is considered a necessary part of the Inuit diet.\\"Borr√©, Kristen. \\"Seal Blood, Inuit Blood, and Diet: A Biocultural Model of Physiology and Cultural Identity.\\" Medical Anthropology Quarterly 5 (1991): 48‚Äì62. Inuit also believe that eating raw meat keeps them warmer and stronger. They say that raw meat takes effect on one's body when eaten consistently. One Inuk, Oleetoa, who ate a combination of and Inuit food, told of a story of his cousin Joanasee who ate a diet consisting of mostly raw Inuit food. The two compared their strengths, warmth, and energy and found that Joanasee benefited most based on his diet. Inuit choose their diet based on four concepts, according to Borr√©: \\"the relationship between animals and humans, the relationship between the body and soul and life and health, the relationship between seal blood and Inuit blood, and diet choice.\\" Inuit are especially spiritual when it comes to the customs of hunting, cooking, and eating. The Inuit belief is that the combination of animal and human blood in one's bloodstream creates a healthy human body and soul. Hunting beliefs A particularly strong belief held by the Inuit is about the relationship between seal and Inuit. According to Inuit hunters and elders, hunters and seals have an agreement that allows the hunter to capture and feed from the seal if only for the hunger of the hunter's family. Borr√© explains that through this alliance \\"both hunter and seal are believed to benefit: the hunter is able to sustain the life of his people by having a reliable source of food, and the seal, through its sacrifice, agrees to become part of the body of the Inuit.\\" Inuit are under the belief that if they do not follow the alliances that their ancestors have laid out, the animals will disappear because they have been offended and will cease to reproduce. As saltwater animals, seals are always considered to be thirsty and are therefore offered a drink of fresh water as they die. This is shown as a sign of respect and gratitude toward the seal and its sacrifice. This offering is also done to please the spirit Sedna to ensure food supply. Healing beliefs Borr√© tells of a time when she saw an Inuit woman fall ill who blamed her sickness on the lack of seal in her diet. Once receiving seal meat, the woman felt better within hours and said that her quick recovery was due to the consumption of seal meat and blood. Borr√© experienced this many times among many different members of the group and they all attributed their sickness to the lack of Inuit food.

Three years later, the North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company arrived and began hydraulic mining operations. By 1876, the population swelled to 2000. But in 1884, when hydraulic mining ended because of Woodruff v. North Bloomfield Gravel Mining Company, a lawsuit by Sacramento area farmers, North Bloomfield became an uninhabited San Juan Ridge ghost town. In the present day, the town of North Bloomfield is contained within the Malakoff Diggins State Historic Park. Some of the town's original buildings remain and a few have been reconstructed: * Skidmore House * E Clampus Vitus Building * McKillicam & Mobley General Store * St. Columncille‚Äôs Catholic Church The post office was open from 1857 to 1942, moving once in 1875.

Bruner and Sean D. Carr, The Panic of 1907. Lessons Learned from the Market's Perfect Storm, passim. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons, 2007. Early life Charles T. Barney was born on January 27, 1851, in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Ashbel H. Barney (1816‚Äì1886) and Susan (Tracy) Barney. His father was a successful forwarding and commission merchant.Who Was Who in America, Vol. I, p. 59. Chicago: The A.N. Marquis Company, 1943. In 1857, the family moved to New York City, where his father was a director (1859‚Äì83), vice president (1867‚Äì69) and president (1869‚Äì70) of Wells Fargo & Company.Noel M. Loomis, Wells Fargo, pp. 145, 197, 205, 212, 215, 254. New York: Clarkson N. Potter, Inc., 1968. Barney attended Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where he was a member of The Kappa Alpha Society, graduating in 1870. Following graduation he moved to New York and entered banking.Who Was Who in America, op. cit. With his mustache and beard and slightly thinning hair, Barney somewhat resembled his late, well-regarded father in appearance. Banking career The headquarters of the Knickerbocker Trust Company in 1905, at the corner of 5th Avenue and 34th Street His ties to the Whitney family helped him achieve great success in banking, real estate investment\\"Mr. Bar4ney's Real Estate.

Barney was made a special member of the firm of Rogers & Gould, members of the New York Stock Exchange. He joined the Knickerbocker Trust Company in 1884, was elected vice president in the 1890s and in 1897 succeeded Robert MacClay as president. During his tenure at Knickerbocker, the company's total deposits rose from $11 million to over $65 million.\\"Mr. Barney's Career. Prominent All His Life in Finance, Art and Realty Operations\\", The New York Times, November 15, 1907. At its peak it was the third largest trust company in the city.Bruner and Carr, p. 45 In 1902-04 it built a new main office at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street (pictured), designed by McKim, Mead and White. There were also branch offices at 66 Broadway and in Harlem and The Bronx. In his real estate operations, Barney joined William C. Whitney, Henry F. Dimock, W.E.D. Stokes, Francis W. Jenks, and others in forming the New York Loan and Improvement Company in 1890. This concern was responsible for the development of the Washington Heights section of New York City.\\"Mr. Barney's Career. Prominent All His Life in Finance, Art, and Realty Operations\\", The New York Times, November 15, 1907. He formed with George D. Sheldon and others in 1899 the so-called Barney-Sheldon real estate syndicate.\\"Mr. Barney's Real Estate. For 20 Years He Was a Prominent Operator--Still Had Large Holdings\\", The New York Times, November 15, 1907. Besides serving as president and a director of the Knickerbocker Trust Company, Barney was president and a director of the New York Loan and Improvement Company; a trustee of the Bank for Savings; a director of the Brooklyn Life Insurance Company, Lawyers' Mortgage Insurance Company, United States Realty and Improvement Company, Title Insurance Company of New York, New York Mortgage and Security Company, Century Realty Company, Hudson Mortgage Company and Chelsea Realty Company; and a shareholder of the Santa Cecilia Sugar Company, Cuba Hardwood Company, Cuba Northeastern Railroad, American Ice Company, Ice Securities Company, Eastern Steamship Company, Metropolitan Steamship Company, Dominion Iron Company Ltd., Dominion Iron and Steel Company Ltd., and the Hudson Navigation Company (the Hudson River Night Line). He was also an investor in the New York City Subway and the Metropolitan Opera and Real Estate Company. Barney was also treasurer of the New York Zoological Society from 1901 to 1903. Panic of 1907 In 1907, the Knickerbocker entered into a deal organized by speculators F. Augustus Heinze and Charles W. Morse to corner the market of the United Copper Company. On Tuesday, October 15, 1907, their plan failed spectacularly when the share price of United Copper collapsed. Heinze's brokerage firm failed on October 17, and he was forced to resign as president of the Mercantile National Bank. On October 19 Morse was forced out of the banks with which he had been associated.Walter Lord, The Good Years. From 1900 to the First World War, pp. 182-183. New York: Harper & Brothers, 1960. Realizing that the Knickerbocker was involved in the failed cornering, depositors began to remove their deposits from the bank.Bruner and Carr, p. 48‚Äì49 On October 21, Monday of the week after the bid collapsed, the board of the Knickerbocker Trust Company asked Barney to resign after he admitted involvement in the Morse speculations. That afternoon, the National Bank of Commerce announced it would no longer clear checks for the Knickerbocker.\\"Barney and the Trust Company. No Irregularities--His Own Story of Why He Quit\\", The New York Times, November 15, 1907.Lord, p. 186. The next day, a massive bank run forced the Knickerbocker to suspend operations. George L. Rives, Henry C. Ide and Ernst Thalmann were named receivers. The failure of the Knickerbocker was the keystone of the Panic of 1907.Mark Sullivan, Our Times, 1900-1925, Vol. III, pp. 502-504. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1930.Lord, pp. 188-189. Barney's successor as president of Knickerbocker, A. Foster Higgins of Greenwich, Connecticut, was an unfortunate choice. He was 77 years old and quite garrulous.Some 20 years before, he had been a committee chairman in the Connecticut State Assembly. Roscoe Conkling Fitch, History of the Fitch Family, Vol. II, pp. 265-266. Detroit: Privately published, 1930. Foster made public statements, including one following the death of Barney, that greatly embarrassed the Rehabilitation Committee under F.G. Bourne and William A. Tucker that was trying to get the trust company on its feet again.\\"Higgins Denies Interview. Says He Did Not Make Statements Criticizing Morse and Barney\\", The New York Times, November 17, 1907.Lord, pp. 189-190.  Suicide  Barney himself was not ruined financially. Despite his resignation he still had an estimated $2.5 million in assets over and above liabilities. But personally he was disgraced.\\"Say Grief Caused His Act. Mr. Barney's Friends Declare He Couldn't Stand Loss of Prestige\\", The New York Times, November 15, 1907. On the morning of November 14, Barney was in his bedroom on the second floor of the house, with two windows facing 38th Street. He was accustomed to eating breakfast here and then conducting business by telephone before dressing in late morning. On this particular morning, Lily Barney and Mrs. Susan Abbott Mead, a guest who had arrived from Europe two weeks before, were in Lily's adjoining bedroom. Shortly before 10:00 a.m. they heard a shot fired in Barney's room. Mrs. Mead ran into the room and saw Mr. Barney standing. Mrs. Mead called to Lily Barney, who ran into the room. As she approached her husband, he fell to the floor and she cradled his head in her lap. Ashbel H. Barney II, who had heard the shot on the first floor, thereupon entered the room. Barney told his son, \\"Don't move me.\\" Barney had shot himself in the abdomen with a .32 caliber revolver. Lily Barney later told Coroner Harburger that pistols were kept on every floor of the house for protection. Medical assistance was summoned, and in the meantime Barney made and signed arrangements for the disposal of his affairs in addition to his existing will. Then, still in his home, he underwent exploratory surgery at the hands of Dr. Joseph A. Blake and the family's physician, Dr. George A. Dixon. Barney died at 2:30 p.m. while still under anesthesia. Barney's funeral was conducted at the residence on November 16, 1907, by the Rev. Dr. Charles H. Parkhurst of the Madison Square Presbyterian Church. Some 40 persons were present for the private service, among them Barney's widow and their two daughters and one son (the other was in Europe). Also present were Harry Payne Whitney, Henry Melville Whitney, Joseph S. Auerbach, Dr. George A. Dixon and Barney's lawyers, George L. Nichols and Arthur H. Masten. Following the service, the hearse took Barney's body to Grand Central Station, from whence a special train took it to Woodlawn Cemetery. Parkhurst said a prayer at the graveside. Personal life Barney married Laurinda Collins \\"Lily\\" Whitney, daughter of Brigadier General James Scollay Whitney and the former Laurinda Collins (a descendant of Plymouth governor William Bradford). She was the sister of William Collins Whitney, the patriarch of the Whitney family, industrialist Henry Melville Whitney, president of the Metropolitan Steamship Company,Bruner and Carr, p. x and Susan Collins Whitney, married attorney Henry F.

On August 13, 2008, it was reported that Ahmed Zaid Zuhair had been on a hunger strike since June 2005. Two other long-term hunger strikers died under mysterious circumstances in June 2006. On March 18, 2009, camp authorities declined to agree to moving Zuhair to Camp 4 from Camp 6 in return for his ending his hunger strike. mirror In December 2008, an Administrative Review Board cleared Zuhair for release from Guantanamo. On May 22, 2009, Zuhair was cleared for transfer once again by the Inter-Agency Review process established by President Obama. He was repatriated to Saudi Arabia on June 12, 2009. Habeas corpus petition Carol Rosenberg, writing in the Miami Herald, reported that Zuhair's June 12, 2009, repatriation came shortly before the Department of Justice would be called upon to defend his continued detention during consideration of his habeas corpus petition. Zuhair's lawyers have filed an extensive refutation of the government's allegations in court. They argue that the allegations against Zuhair are baseless: > The Government rests its case against Mr. Zuhair mainly upon two types of > evidence: raw intelligence that lacks any indicia of reliability and > statements extracted under torture that are not only inherently unreliable > but so repugnant to Constitutional protections of dignity and fairness as to > require them to be struck. As a matter of law, this Court can accord neither > sort of evidence any persuasive weight. Zuhair's lawyers point out that the type of intelligence document extensively relied upon to justify his detention almost always carry the legend \\"WARNING: INFORMATION REPORT, NOT FINALLY EVALUATED INTELLIGENCE\\" and are used to circulate possible leads, rather than verified information. Although most of the tortured-based evidence in the case remained classified, Zuhair's attorneys also produced an unclassified declaration from Sa'd Iqbal Madani, a victim of rendition and torture in Egypt and Afghanistan. In it, Madani described how, in order to avoid further mistreatment, he made false statements at Bagram that interrogators used to link Zuhair to the Cole bombing. Other detainees who were held at Bagram, including Mamdouh Habib and Moazzam Begg, also attested to the torture that Madani experienced. Zuhair's attorneys also attacked the government's allegations directly. Most importantly they demonstrate that despite investigations of the murder of William Jefferson by Bosnian police, the United Nations, and the FBI, Zuhair was never charged as a suspect. Moreover, Bosnian authorities issued an arrest warrant for another man, Fa'iz al-Shanbari, for the murder in 1998. A comprehensive 200-page investigation by the UN did not even mention Zuhair. Zuhair's attorneys conclude: > It has been thirteen years since William Jefferson was murdered, in a > country U.S. investigators would have had no problems accessing, and Ahmed > Zuhair has spent over half of that time in American custody. Under such > circumstances, the lack of an indictment against Mr. Zuhair for this crime > from either jurisdiction should speak for itself. Hunger strike Long term hunger strikers are immobilized in \\"restraint chairs\\" for twice daily force-feedings. The immobilizations last for several hours, so captives can't vomit their nutrient. A Guantanamo force-feeding kit. In May 2008, the Gulf News reported that Zuhair and Abdul Rahman Shalabi are the two remaining captives who have been on the hunger strike that started in August 2005. On October 25, 2008, the Associated Press reported that new documents, documenting Guantanamo guards' struggles to force-feed Zuhair, had recently been filed in court. According to the report: > ...according to court documents reviewed by The Associated Press, guards > have struggled with him repeatedly, at least once using pepper spray, > shackles and brute force to drag him to a restraint chair for his twice- > daily dose of a liquid nutrition mix force-fed through his nose. Joint Task Force Guantanamo guard force commander Colonel Bruce Vargo offering the justification for the use of force, stated: > ISN 669 has a very long history of disciplinary violations and noncompliant, > resistant and combative behavior. According to an affidavit filed by Ramzi Kassem, one of his attorneys, official records document that between August and October Zuhair lost over 16 kilograms, dropping to under 45 kilograms. Kassem's affidavit stated that when he last visited Zuhair, in mid November, he kept vomiting uncontrollably, because he was allergic to the liquid food substitute used during his force- feedings. > Mr. Zuhair lifted his orange shirt and showed me his chest. It was skeletal. > Mr. Zuhair's legs looked like bones with skin wrapped tight around them. Pauline Storum, a Joint Task Force Guantanamo spokesmen, stated that camp authorities monitored the captives' health closely. US District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered an independent medical examination for Zuhair. On March 17, 2009, Ben Fox, writing for the Associated Press quoted a court statement filed by Colonel Bruce Vargo, commander of the camp's guard force, who explained that camp authorities could not agree to move Zuhair to the Camp 4, due to his history of infractions of the camp rules. He stated it would set a bad precedent, and that other captives held in camp 6 might follow his example, so that they too could be moved to camp 4. Vargo's statement acknowledged that the camp's riot squad was routinely called upon to extract Zuhair from his cell for his twice-daily force-feedings. His statement said Zuhair had committed 80 infractions of the camp rules in the last four months. Vargo stated that Zuhair currently weighed 114 pounds, down from 137 pounds in August 2008. After his repatriation to Saudi Arabia on June 12, 2009, Carol Rosenberg, writing in the Miami Herald, reported that Zuhair had been the longest lasting hunger striker, whose hunger strike had lasted 1450 days. Death threats Zuhair wrote a letter to his attorneys on July 18, 2008, stating that Guantanamo guards had searched his cell, confiscated some of his correspondence with his attorneys, and threatened to kill him if he did not drop his habeas petition. Judge Emmet G. Sullivan ordered the guards involved to submit sworn declarations to the court detailing their responses to the allegations, the first time a judge had done so in a Guantanamo-related case. Repatriation Zuhair and two other Saudis, Abdelaziz Kareem Salim al- Noofayee and Khalid Saad Mohammed, were repatriated to Saudi Arabia on June 12, 2009. Fox News reported that Zuhair: \\"had been implicated in the murder of an American.\\" Saudi security officials have stated that the three men were allowed to meet with their families, shortly after their repatriation. Security officials said the three men were then taken to an undisclosed location for interrogation. The three men would go through the same Saudi jihadist rehabilitation program as other repatriated captives, even though some former captives have back-slid to supporting jihadism following their release. Admission of Insufficient Evidence Unclassified traverse filed by attorneys of ex-Guantanamo detainee Ahmed Zuhair refuting the unclassified allegations against him. During a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 17, 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder publicly admitted that Zuhair had been cleared for transfer from Guantanamo by both administrations because \\"there was no sufficient proof to bring a case\\" against him.

It is currently published on weekends, and has an online edition which is updated every day. In addition, the Sunday edition includes the women's magazine Luz.  Features  Like many European newspapers it includes a section called the \\"Reader's Ombudsman\\", with the responsibility of maintaining the newspaper's reputation. Abel Gonz√°lez was the first ombudsman in 1998. From 2005 until 15 December 2007, the journalist and neurologist Nelson Castro held that position. Andrew Graham-Yooll, formerly the chief editor of the Buenos Aires Herald, is the current ombudsman.  Editorial line  Perfil's slogan is Periodismo puro (Spanish: \\"pure journalism\\"). Jorge Fontevecchia said that \\"Pure or technical journalism is always critical, like American 'watchdog' journalism\\". Despite the implication of total objectivity, the newspaper is strongly critical of the national government.

Although Berens did not qualify to swim in any individual events, Bob Bowman, Michael Phelps's coach, revealed on Twitter that Phelps, who came in first in the 200-meter freestyle, would be scratching the race from his Olympic program, giving the third place Berens a chance to swim his first individual Olympic event.

Innis is also an inventor and engineer and has pioneered the idea of floating real estate, specifically the notion of a floating airport using pneumatic stabilized platform (PSP) technology which he has developed and patented through his company, Float Incorporated. \\"Review of Alternative Air Carrier Airport Sites & Technologies\\", 1991, San Diego Association of Governments \\"Floating Airport proposal Resurfaces\\", The San Diego Union-Tribune, By Alex Roth January 14, 2007 Innis designed several notable San Diego landmarks, including the 1970s remodeling of the San Diego Broadway Pier (one of the first pier designs to make use of significant above water landscaping and greenery), the master plan for the San Diego Embarcadero, and Terminal One of the San Diego International airport. He is a long-standing member of the American Institute of Architects. Biography Early life Innis is the middle son of Greta Matson Innis (Swedish-American, b. 1905, d. 1965) and Alwyn Osman Innis (American, b. 1896, d. 1974). His father Alwyn was an American-born RCAF squadron leader during WWII and a young American foreign exchange fighter pilot ranked as a Second Lieutenant in the British RFC's No. 46 Squadron during the final years of World War I.Air History Org - Royal Flying Corps. People Index The London Gazette, October 29, 1918 Canadian Great War Project - Alwyn Osman Innis Donald Innis' father, Alwyn Osman Innis, had trained at Canada's RFC camp at Bourden before being commissioned and sent to England. Innis' father returned to the U.S. when he left the RFC (then the RAF) in 1919 to become vice president and general manager of the Columbus Aviation Company. Fort Rosecrans Nat'l Cemetery \\"Innis\\" Surnames \\"I\\" - Interment.netCanadian Department of Militia and Defence A.P. 9321-A-78 War Service Gratuity Records Innis' father, Alwyn, would work for the S.S. Kresge dime stores, opening and managing several all across the country, including in Olean, New York, where son Donald Innis was born in 1931. A.O. Innis would later move to Chicago, Illinois to open his own dimes stores, Alywn Stores, only to close them several years later to re-join the RCAF during World War II and moving the entire family to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. After WWII, the Innis family would move back to Chicago, Illinois, and then ultimately to San Diego, California. Early career Donald A. Innis attended the University of Illinois in Chicago for one year before becoming a salesman and taking part in the racing of midget cars for Four Wheels Inc. (a Chicago auto leasing firm). Innis would race midget and stock cars on the quarter-mile track at Soldier Field in downtown Chicago and would sell used cars for the company. Innis then moved to Tucson, where he briefly attended the University of Arizona. Innis then worked for Chicago architect Maurice Webster, (b Sept. 20, 1892; d May 17, 1982, Evanston, IL.) Encyclopedia of Chicago who with architect Alfred P. Allen designed Chicago's Sky Harbor Airport, which had originally opened in 1929 just north of Chicago. Encyclopedia of Chicago History Webster also designed Stronghold Castle, a replica of a European castle which was built by Walter Strong, then publisher of the Chicago Daily News. It is now a conference center owned by the local presbytery of the Presbyterian Church.www.autonmonparade.com Innis later moved to California with his brother, artist, and writer Windsor Joe Innis. Innis worked his way up the ladder at Falkon Booth, becoming a draftsman and then drafting designer, when around 1956 he received notice that he had been drafted by the U. S. Army. Innis had previously served seven and a half years in the Navy Reserve, beginning shortly after high school. Innis' was recruited by the U.S. Army Signal Corp's Alaska Communications System (ACS) and was stationed on an Army operated cable ship in Alaska.\\"The Alaska Communications System\\" by B. McCalleySignal Corps Regiment Lineage in Alaska \\"General McArthur's Surrender Order to the Japanese\\" by Janice Reynolds CookArmy Communicator Innis oversaw the laying of thousands of miles of the first military submarine telephone communication cables across the ocean using secret military charts aboard the wooden-hulled self-propelled barge, the cable ship Col. Basil O. Lenoir. \\"History of the Atlantic Cable & Undersea Communications: U.S. Armed Forces Cables by Bill Glover Cable Laying and Repair Ships Innis' top secret job required him to enter a room \\"like Oz\\" and close curtains around him while he read the secret charts of where U.S. military communications cables would be laid at sea. After serving in the Signal Corps, Innis obtained an early release and entered U.C. Berkeley's architecture program in 1958. While studying at Berkeley, Innis taught sailing at the U.C. Berkeley sailing club at Berkeley Yacht Harbor and often sailed with Hans Albert Einstein (son of physicist Albert Einstein), a professor of hydraulic engineering, who was teaching at the university at the time. Innis graduated from Cal in 1961. Career highlights In 1961 Innis joined the San Diego-based architecture firm of Paderewski Mitchell and Dean, AIA, as chief designer. While working for C. J. \\"Pat\\" Paderewski, Innis was in charge of designing the current Terminal One at the San Diego Airport (constructed in 1967).C.J. \\"Pat\\" Paderewski 98; called S.D.'s 'Mr. Architect'\\" By Michael Kinsman San Diego Union Tribune July 12, 2007 Paderewski (then called San Diego's \\"Mr. Architect\\") had famously designed the first exterior all-glass elevator for San Diego's El Cortez Hotel (the elevator has since been demolished). Paderewski was also president of the San Diego Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, which Innis would also later head. In 1965, Innis decided to form his own firm, Donald Innis & Associates. In 1966 Innis submitted the winning proposal in a competition for a design for new Balboa Park arcades, a design featuring simple arches.San Diego Union, August 6, 1966, B-3:2-3 The winning proposal plan was not realized by Innis‚Äô firm, but a year later the plan was awarded to another firm. In 1966, Innis was joined by fellow architect Dave Tennebaum, and the firm was renamed Innis-Tennebaum Architects Inc., AIA. For more than three decades Innis-Tennebaum Architects specialized in military contracts and the building of elementary schools, residential, commercial and other architectural projects. Noteworthy projects in and around San Diego included the original San Diego Embarcadero redesign and master plan (the bay front area and docks next to the San Diego airport between Harbor Island and Downtown San Diego), Del Mar's Flower Hill Mall (built in 1977 for the Fletcher family) which included an underground restaurant, East Village Mall (Rancho Santa Fe), a total overhaul and remodeling of the historic Broadway Pier in the 1970s, adding new innovative structures (and preserving the view of the bay all the way down Broadway Street), The Harbor Seafood Mart at the Embarcadero, and the redesign of the Red Sails Inn on Shelter Island. The Broadway Pier that Innis designed was configured so that a person looking down Broadway could still see the bay (this is no longer the case with the new remodeled structure that was built in its place in 2010). Its innovative original 1970s design also originally featured planter boxes with trees and foliage, which was one of the first of its type of above-water structures to do this. The pier was featured as a location in the 1979 film Hardcore directed by Paul Schrader and starring George C. Scott (standing in as Los Angeles) and was also the location for the big, splashy 2003 premiere party for the Academy Award-winning Russell Crowe film Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, a film directed by Peter Weir. ‚ÄúMaster and Commander: The Far Side of the World‚Äù Premiere, Image Collect, November 9, 2003 Getty Images - ‚ÄúMaster and Commander: The Far Side of the World‚Äù Premiere, Image Collect, November 9, 2003 Unfortunately in 2010, the Broadway Pier building that Innis designed was demolished and a less aesthetically appealing boxy, modern cruise ship terminal was erected in its place. In 1992, Innis retired from Innis-Tennebaum to create Float Inc. and pursue his dream project of a floating airport. Floating Airport While designing terminal one of San Diego's Lindberg airport, Innis realized that the airport could not expand to meet future needs while at its current location. A new airport site would need to be close to the current airport and population centers and accessible. There was only one answer. It would need to be built on the water. To achieve a platform large enough to operate an international airport (about 1,200 acres), the technology needed to be invented to float that kind of structure. In 1992, Float, Incorporated was founded by Innis and three partners to develop this plan. A concrete structure using air for buoyancy became Innis‚Äô PSP (pneumatic stabilized platform) patent. Offshore Ports, LLC The PSP technology Innis invented uses air movement to reduce wave loads and distribute them through the platform, a platform that could be used to house offshore airports, oil and gas production facilities, floating islands, military bases, and additional real estate for coastal cities.Float Inc. The technology enables the platform to extract energy from ocean waves to create electricity and is less costly than most currently used large open ocean platforms. In August 1995, the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division took an interest in the PSP's potential to serve as a floating military base and awarded Float Inc. a contract with the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) to test PSP. Extensive numerical modeling was performed along with two series of wave tank tests. The second series of tests at 1/48th scale was focused on air exchange. A final scientific report on the test results was submitted to the Office of Naval Research (ONR) in December 2000. Although it has been tested and proven by the Navy, the idea has not yet found favor with short-sighted San Diego bureaucracy, although Innis and his associates at Float Inc. continue to pursue it. The idea has recently gained more support in the scientific community, including by the man widely considered the dean of world ocean scientists, Dr. Walter Munk, who holds the Secretary of the Navy/Chief of Naval Operations Chair at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego. However, current plans by San Diego officials only exist to demolish the existing airport structures and rebuild new terminals in their place in their current land-locked location. ‚ÄúFloating an idea: airport on the water: Noted ocean scientist Walter Munk thinks it's the solution to future problem‚Äù, By Steve Chapple, San Diego Union-Tribune, September 21, 2013 Personal life In 1962, Innis married teacher and flower designer, Virginia Maples. The couple has three children, Christina Jean Innis, Donald Innis Jr., and Cynthia Ona Innis. Virginia Innis died in February 2007 from injuries resulting from a car accident. She is buried at El Camino Memorial Park in San Diego. Innis still resides in San Diego and continues his passion for sailing and is a longtime member of the San Diego Yacht Club. Innis also continues to work every day at Float Inc. striving to realize the dream of a floating airport and/or floating real estate.

The village was founded in the mid-19th century on one of the Red River Trails by settlers from Quebec named Grouette, who built a homestead on the west bank of the Red River and farmed grain in the rich soil of the valley. A dock allowed other settlers to reach the east side of the river via ferry with their grain-laden Red River carts; a community, originally called Pointe-√†-Grouette, formed around the docking point at some time before 1871. The first mention of the name \\"Ste. Agathe\\" was some decades earlier, when the Roman Catholic Church organized the Red River colonies between St. Norbert and the United States border into the Parish of Sainte- Agathe. As that parish grew and split into numerous more manageable parishes, the parish containing Pointe-√†-Grouette was renamed the Parish of Sainte- Agathe by Archbishop Alexandre-Antonin Tach√© in 1873; the town adopted the name at some time after that date.

He has left behind eleven pastourelles, ten grand chants, and one serventois. Erart's presence at Arras can be deduced from his own writings.Theodore Karp, \\"Erart, Jehan.\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online (Accessed 13 August 2008), contains a short biographical sketch, plus a discussion of the transmission and style of his work, and a good bibliography. He was patronised by the wealthy middle and upper classes. In his serventois, a complainte on the death his patron Gherart Aniel, he asked Pierre and Wagon Wion to help him obtain the patronage of the bankers Henri and Robert Crespin. His relationship with two Arras trouv√®res is apparent in his lyrics, Guillaume le Vinier and Jehan Bretel. He is also mentioned in a work of Guibert Kaukesel, a canon of Arras. The chief characteristic of Erart's poetry is his preference for short lines, mostly penta-, hexa-, hepta-, and octosyllabic, as opposed to the traditional decasyllable, which does occur in his chansons \\"Pr√© ne vergier ne boscaige foillu\\" and \\"Encoire sui cil ki a merchi s'atent\\" and his serventois \\"Nus chanters\\".For a more detaile description of his metres, see Mary O'Neill (2006), Courtly Love Songs of Medieval France: Transmission and Style in the Trouv√®re Repertoire (Oxford: Oxford University Press), 134-5, with notes 8-12. Musically, Erart is syllabic, with a preference for major modes and refrains. His chansons are composed mainly in isometre, but his pastourelles are predominantly heterometric. His music is conservative and rarely exceeds a ninth in range. There are two death notices for Erart in the necrology of the Confr√©rie des jongleurs et bourgeois d'Arras. One records a Jehans Erardi dying in 1258 while another records Jehan Erart dying in 1259. It is possible, when considering that his works are preserved in two different sections of the Chansonnier du Roi, that there were two Jehan Erarts, but this is not likely.

The most famous member of the clan, Mirza Muhammad Haidar, was a military adventurer, historian, and the ruler of Kashmir (1541‚Äì1551). His historical work, the Tarikh-i Rashidi, provides much of the information known about the family. History Early history The Dughlat tribe is mentioned as having supported Genghis Khan during his creation of the Mongol Empire in the early 13th century. Rashid al-Din Hamadani identifies the Dughlad (Dughlat) as a minor tribe of the Mongols. At an early date the entire tribe moved out of Mongolia and eventually settled in the area comprising the ulus of Chagatai Khan. In the mid-14th century the authority of the Chagatai khans underwent a sudden decline. In the western part of the khanate (specifically Transoxiana and the bordering provinces), the khans had become rulers in name only, with real power in the hands of the local Turko-Mongol amirs after 1346. In the eastern provinces (spec. the Tarim Basin and the area that was to become Moghulistan) the authority of the khans in Transoxiana was virtually nonexistent. As a result, power there was in the hands of the local lords and tribal chiefs.Grousset, pp. 341-2 By this time the Dughlats had become one of the most eminent clans in the eastern regions. Chief among their holdings were the towns Aksu, Kashgar, Yarkand, and KhotanHodong, pp. 300-1. He notes that Muhammad Haidar (p. 7) had claimed that the Dughlats had been given a control of an area called Mangalay Sube or Mangalai Suyah by Chagatai Khan that consisted of all of the cities in the western Tarim Basin as well as the province of Ferghana. This claim is largely rejected by modern scholars. Their influence allowed them to select a Genghisid khan of their own choosing. In 1347, according to the Tarikh-i Rashidi, the Dughlat Amir Bulaji raised a certain Tughlugh Timur to the khanship and recognized his authority. The new khan, despite owing his throne to the Dughlats, was a man of strong character and maintained effective control of Moghulistan. He also converted to Islam, an act that was copied by the DughlatsGrousset, 344 (one of whom, Amir Tulik, had been secretly converted even before the khan's adoption of the faithMuhammad Haidar, p. 14). Qamar ud-Din Under Tughlugh Timur, both amirs Tuluk and Bulaji had held the office of ulus beg. After the death of Bulaji the office was given to his son Khudaidad. This was contested by Bulaji's brother, Qamar ud-Din, who desired to be ulus beg himself. His request for the office to be transferred to him was refused by Tughlugh Timur; consequently after the latter's death Qamar ud-Din revolted against Tughlugh Timur's son Ilyas Khoja Khan. He was likely responsible for the death of Ilyas Khoja; most of the family members of Tughlugh Timur were also killed. Qamar ud-Din proclaimed himself khan (the only Dughlat ever to do so) and, although he did not gain the support of many of the amirs,Hodong, p. 304 managed to maintain his position in Moghulistan.Muhammad Haidar, p. 38 Qamar ud-Din's reign consisted of a series of wars with Timur, the amir of Transoxiana. Qamar ud-Din's forces unable to defeat Timur, but at the same time Timur was incapable of decisively defeating the Moghuls, who were able to retreat into the barren steppe country of Moghulistan. During a fresh invasion by Timur and his army in 1390, however, Qamar ud-Din disappeared. His disappearance enabled a Chagatayid, Khizr Khoja, to gain control of Moghulistan.Grousset, pp. 422-4 The Dughlats in the 15th century Qamar ud-Din's disappearance had left his nephew Khudaidad the senior member of the Dughlat family. According to the Tarikh-i Rashidi, Khudaidad had been an early supporter of Khizr Khoja and had hid him from Qamar ud-Din during the latter's purge of members of the house of Chagatai. Khudaidad's power rapidly increased and he became a king-maker in the years after Khizr Khoja's death.Barthold, p. 622 He also divided Aksu, Khotan, and Kashgar and Yarkand amongst his family members;Muhammad Haidar, p. 100 this division of territory lasted until the time of Mirza Aba Bakr. Khudaidad eventually left the service of the Moghul khans; this did not preclude the other Dughlats from maintaining good relations with them. During the 15th century, Kashgar was recovered after it was temporarily seized by Timur's grandson Ulugh Beg;Barthold, p. 622 on the other hand, Aksu was given over to the Moghul khans.Muhammad Haidar, p. 78 Dughlat clan of Kazakhs Now, the Dughlat (Dulat or –î—É–ª–∞—Ç in Kazakh language) is one of the major tribe of modern Kazakh people, they belong to Senior-Juz of Kazakhs, mainly inhabited in the east and southern parts of Kazakhstan such as Almaty Oblysy and Jetysu region of Kazakhstan, with a population of approximately 3,000,000 among Kazakhs (see the Dughlat tribe of Kazakh people - from Wikipedia Dughlat introduction in Kazakh language). The Duglats sub-clans are Botpay, Shymyr, Sikymy, Zhanys and Eskeldy (see the brief introduction of Dulats). The most recently Y-DNA tests which investigated by KZ DNA Project in Kazakhstan shows that the Y-DNA haplogroup of Dughlat tribe of Kazakhs carries C3 haplogroups see KZ DNA Project. The international ports of Dulat (Dulata Kouan - ÈÉΩÊãâÂ°îÂè£Â≤∏ in Chinese) in the Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture of China was named after with the Dughlats, because of the historical inhabitant of Dughlats clans in this area in the past, the ports of Dulat was opened in 2003 with the agreement of governments of both Kazakhstan and China. Mirza Aba Bakr Mirza Aba Bakr, the great-great-grandson of Khudaidad, built up an independent kingdom for himself in the last decades of the 15th century. Beginning with the seizure of Yarkand, which was henceforth his capital, he conquered Khotan and Kashgar from other members of his familyGrousset, p. 494 and defied numerous attempts by the Moghul khans to force him into submission.Both Yunus Khan (1462-1487) and Ahmad Khan (1487-1503) unsuccessfully invaded Aba Bakr's territories. Muhammad Haidar, pp. 104-6, 122 By the beginning of the 16th century he was also conducting raids into Ferghana, Badakshan and Ladakh.Muhammad Haidar, pp. 248-50, 253-4 Near the end of his reign he even managed to plunder Aksu, which was still held by the Moghuls.Muhammad Haidar, p. 254 In 1514 his forces were defeated by the Moghul Sultan Said Khan, compelling him to flee.Muhammad Haidar, p. 133 This marked the end of Dughlat control over the western Tarim Basin cities, which were in the hands of the Moghul khans until they were conquered by the Dzungars in the late 17th century. Mirza Muhammad Haidar Mirza Muhammad Haidar was the nephew of Mirza Aba Bakr. He was the son of Muhammad Husain Kurkan, who had married into the family of the Moghul khans and had spent his life alternating between serving the Moghuls, the Timurid Babur and the Shaybanid Uzbeks.Barthold, p. 622 Mirza Haidar himself entered the service of Sultan Said Khan just before the latter's conquest of Mirza Aba Bakr's kingdom. During the khan's lifetime he conducted a holy war in Ladakh on his behalf. After Sultan Said Khan's death in 1533 his son Abdur Rashid Khan executed Mirza Haidar's uncle; fearing the same fate, Mirza Haidar fled to the MughalThe Mughal or Moghul Empire of India founded by Babur has little to do with the Moghuls of Central Asia, although Babur did come into regular contact with the Moghuls in his early years. The Turks loyal to Babur were called \\"Chagatais\\" by Mirza Haidar while the term \\"Moghul\\" was reserved for the tribe of the Central Asian khans of Moghulistan. Elias, p. 3 Emperor Humayun in northern India. It was in the service of the emperor that he undertook the conquest of Kashmir in 1541.Elias, pp. 18-9 Mirza Haidar was more or less able to retain his position as ruler of Kashmir for ten years, during which he wrote the Tarikh-i Rashidi.
