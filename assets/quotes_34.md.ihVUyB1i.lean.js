History The airline started activities in November 1976 as SBZ Cargo with a single Vickers Viscount. Due to problems concerning the national airline, Air Zaire, Scibe Airlift became the first passenger airline in the country. After covering the whole country, it bought a Boeing 707, which allowed for serving Europe. In the early 1990s Scibe Airlift was at its height, serving a multitude of destinations and leasing its aircraft out to European airlines. In 1992, it operated a DC-10-30 on its Kinshasa-Brussels route. The political instability of the country and the poor financial management of the company brought it to an end.

He gained attention across the Arab world for his singles \\"Bo'dak Habibi\\", \\"Qasawa\\", \\"Dhalim\\", \\"Min Trid Abousak\\", \\"Al Asabe3\\", \\"Melih Wa Zad\\", \\"Ya Hali\\" and many other hits including \\"Weinkom Ya Arab\\" (\\"Where are the Arabs\\"), which was a protest song against the war 2006 Lebanon-Israeli war. His new album \\"Yom Wa Sana\\" was released in July 2009 and it includes 14 songs all written and composed by Rida himself. Biography Rida Al Abdulla was born in Iraq in 1966. His work bridges Arabic classical music (maqam) with popular styles of his region and beyond. The poetry he adapts and lyrics he composes address themes of human relationships and sociopolitical ideas. Rida was born in Kirkuk. As a child he would spontaneously break into song in the classroom. Rida participated in school plays and concerts, and began writing his own songs by the age of ten. His parents encouraged him by buying him instruments. One in particular was an oud, a principle instrument of Arabic composers. Rida adored classical Iraqi singers Nathem Al Ghazali and Mohammed Al Kubanji. Rida viewed this music as refuge from the chaos and oppression of the early Hussein years. At a time when singers were being pressured to sing for the regime or not at all, Rida kept a low profile but continued singing, composing and practicing at home. Rida came of age during the Iran-Iraq war. At eighteen, he enrolled into the House of Art and Music Conservatory of Iraq in Baghdad where he studied music for the next six years. Composer Munir Bashir took an early interest in Rida, teaching him the works of Rawhy Khamash, Doctor Salem Abdel Karim, Ali Imam, and many others. Rida graduated at the top of his class as a composer and performer on the oud. Rida continued his musical studies at the Academy of Arts, Music and Theatre. He began recording his music, although Iraq's music industry was in disarray at the time and his work was not promoted. During the invasion of Kuwait and the ensuing Gulf War, Rida composed songs that encouraged citizens to put down weapons and take up instruments. Rida's musical life went on hold in 1993 when he graduated and was immediately drafted into the Iraqi Army to serve the obligatory eighteen months. The Army refused to discharge him at the end of his service, and Rida feared he would spend his life in the military and never realize his dream of becoming a singer. When his parents were detained and tortured by the authorities, Rida's personal life became overwhelmed with responsibility, as he had to support ten brothers and sisters who he continues to support to this day. During one attempt to leave the military, Rida was caught and jailed for 100 days. While in detention, he witnessed horrific acts of torture—experiences that he says haunt him to this day. Later, he was condemned have one of his ears cut off and to spend sixteen years in prison. In addition, Rida was to have a cross tattooed to his forehead, ensuring that he would never marry or obtain a job upon his release. Rida was transferred to a military camp where he was tortured and beaten for three days. On the fourth day, in the middle of the night, two men gagged him in his cell and threw him into the trunk of a car. They drove him hundreds of miles into the desert. The car stopped and when his blindfold was removed, Rida saw that his abductors were in fact his two brothers. They took him by his home to see his parents for just a few minutes. He was given a passport and told he had less than 24 hours to leave Iraq. In 1997 Rida could barely walk or talk and he set out for the Jordanian border with just a few clothes and his oud. At the border, hundreds of people waited for him. Rida thought his crossing might take days, but as luck would have it, within fifteen minutes the border officer called his name. Rida says these experiences made him more determined than ever to succeed with his music. Rida went to Amman, and then the college town of Irbid, where he performed in restaurants. An Emirati student who recognized Rida's talent helped him obtain a visa to Dubai, and he began recording the songs that would define his career. Rida began performing private concerts and weddings in Dubai, and his reputation grew. His first single \\"Meleh Wa Zad (Salt and Food)\\"—a reworking of a classic—became the top song in the Emirates for 1997. His next one \\"Hali (My Family)\\" was an original composition about a man who yearns to marry for love, against the advice of his family. From there, Rida recorded three albums for Rotana/EMI, Zalim (2001), Boadak Habiby (2003), and Enha Bzaman (2005). Boadak Habiby was a crossover from classical singing into Arabic pop. Romantic themes in Rida's lyrics were designed as parables for political woes. In July 2009, Rida is releasing his fourth album, \\"Yom Wa Sana (A Year and a Day),\\" a set of fourteen songs he produced and recorded with his team. The product of four years work, this album blends traditional Iraqi songs, Arabic and Western pop from maqam to techno. It incorporates violins, oud, cello, flute, clarinet playing in an Arabic mode, also guitars, saxophones, and Western and Arabic percussion including tabla, trap drums, and rhythmic loops. Among Rida's original compositions is \\"La Tesafer (Don't Go),\\" written for his mother about the time he left Iraq in 1997. The album's title song refers to a romance Rida had as a young man in Iraq.

During the American Civil War, he was the federal government's agent for receiving captured cotton from the Confederate States of America and selling it to benefit the Union war effort. A native of Brookfield, Massachusetts, Draper clerked for a Boston merchant before moving to New York City to begin his own business career. A successful merchant, he became wealthy enough to broaden his holdings, which grew to include real estate, insurance, and banking. A Whig in politics, and later a Republican, Draper served on the Whig state committee several times in the 1840s and 1850s; after becoming a Republican following the party's founding in the mid-1850s, he served as chairman of the New York Republican State Committee from 1860 to 1862. During the American Civil War, Draper received a high- paying patronage appointment as Collector of the Port of New York. He was also appointed as an agent of the federal government responsible to receive, store, and dispose of cotton captured in the Confederate States of America. The results of a post-war investigation indicated that Draper used this post to recover from financial setbacks he had during the Panic of 1857 by diverting some of the proceeds of the sale of captured cotton to his personal use. Draper died in Whitestone, Queens County, New York in 1866, and was buried at Trinity Church Cemetery in Manhattan. Early life Draper was born in Brookfield, Massachusetts on January 19, 1806, the eighth son and 12th child of Captain Simeon Draper (1765–1848), and his first wife, Mary \\"Polly\\" Bemis, the daughter of Col. Benjamin Bemis. He was a merchant's clerk in Boston, Massachusetts before coming to New York City where he settled as a merchant. His business interests later expanded to include real estate investment, development, and auctions, as well as insurance and investment banking. Political career Draper was a friend of Daniel Webster, William H. Seward, Thurlow Weed, and a member of the Whig Party. He began his political career in the 1840s when he was appointed a member of the Board of Ten Governors, then in charge of New York City charities. When the law creating the board was repealed, Draper served as Commissioner of Public Charities and Correction. In the 1850s, Draper was Superintendent of Canal Repairs on the Cayuga and Seneca Canal. He served as a member of the Whig state central committee several times in the 1840s and 1850s, and became a Republican when the party was founded in 1854. In 1856, he was a candidate for the Republican nomination for governor, but John A. King was selected and went on to win the general election. He was one of the original Police Commissioners of the New York Metropolitan Police District when the board was established on April 16, 1857, and was chosen to serve as the board's president. Draper resigned before the end of his term after complaining that his fellow commissioners were making police department appointments based on political considerations and without consulting him. Civil War From 1860 to 1862, Draper was the chairman of the state Republican party. He was Collector of the Port of New York from September 1864 to August 1865. In a story recounted by David Davis, Draper obtained the collector's post after paying $20,000 (about $320,000 in 2018) to Mary Todd Lincoln so that she would persuade her husband to appoint him to this lucrative post. Draper and Mrs. Lincoln both denied Davis's claim, and nothing was ever proved against them. During the American Civil War, Draper was an agent of the federal government, responsible for receiving cotton captured in the Confederate states, storing it, and then selling it on the government's behalf. According to allegations in a post-war Congressional investigation, Draper, who had been bankrupted by business reverses during the Panic of 1857, did not provide accurate reports on the types and amounts of cotton he sold, enabling him to divert some of the proceeds to his personal use. As a result, he was supposedly able to pay off his debts and leave a sizable estate at his death. Death Draper died in Whitestone, Queens County, New York on November 6, 1866. He was interred in the Draper family vault at Trinity Church Cemetery in Manhattan. Family Simeon Draper was a descendant of early Massachusetts settler James Draper. On October 30, 1834, he married Frances S. Haggerty Draper, daughter of John Haggerty, with whom he had five children: Marie (b. 1835); Fanny (b. 1837); John Haggerty (1839-1890); Julian (b. 1841, died as an infant); and Henry (1843-1898). William B. Draper was his brother. Notable descendants include great-grandsons William Draper Lewis and Francis Draper Lewis.

Posted 6/25/08. * Agriculture and Food * Electronics and Semiconductors * Energy and Environment * Health Sciences * IT and IT Enabled Industries * Science, Math, and Engineering Education  Agriculture and Food Panel  Achieving competitiveness in Agriculture and Food has become imperative in the light of the Philippines development efforts. A significant part of the population is in the rural areas and they largely depend on agriculture, either for sustenance or for income. The agriculture sector is a major source of employment and labor. People who depend on agriculture often experience the worst levels of poverty. Any investment in agriculture and food will have significant and direct effects on economic development and poverty alleviation \\"6 Panels of COMSTE\\" . COMSTE website. Accessed Jan. 9, 2009.  Electronics and Semiconductors Panel  The country has received poor assessments of its public and private institutions (ranked 95th). The panel hopes to make this sector more competitive because it composes majority of its exports. With this goal, the panel is tackling issues such as the (1) declining standard of education, (2) electricity cost, (3) lack of university-industry interaction and, (4) taxes and incentives.  Energy and Environment Panel  As one of the six COMSTE panels tasked to spearhead the development of global competitiveness in Research and Development and Science and Technology, the Energy and Environment panel is at the forefront of addressing current issues weighing on the country. Focusing on medium and long term solutions, the panel seeks to achieve a balanced system of providing clean, efficient and sustainable energy (a synthesis between existing fuel technologies and budding green technology) while also safeguarding diminishing natural resources.  Health Sciences Panel  An important and unanimous premise in this country is that health is a right, not a privilege. However, the current state of health in the Philippines is dreadful. At this position, the probability of meeting the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is low. These goals include preventing hunger and halving the proportion of underweight children under five years old, followed by reducing maternal mortality ratio by 75%. Considering these, a panel of experts were constituted to discuss and think of solutions on problems regarding (1) Policies Governing the Practice of Health Professions and Health Care Delivery, (2) Health Human Resource Development, (3) Health Research and Development, (4) Financing of Health Care, and (5) Health Service Delivery.  IT and IT Enabled Industries Panel  The Philippines is one of the top 10 outsourcing and offshoring destinations in the world. The IT and IT-Enabled Industries Panel works to ensure the country’s competitive positioning vis-à-vis other locations by attracting investments and customers. The Panel’s experts believe that the IT industry must go up the value chain—attract higher-value projects, increase skills capacities, and undertake research and development. The government, too, must provide incentives to encourage this upward growth. These efforts, ultimately, work towards a culture and an environment, which prizes and rewards excellence.  Science, Math, and Engineering Education Panel  The basic role of science, mathematics and engineering education in advancing national competitiveness is to provide the human resources and the new knowledge to continually improve the productivity and, hence, competitiveness of the nation’s firms. Any assessment of the SME education system should focus on how well it performs this role and on the reasons behind such level of performance.  Technical Advisory Council (TAC)  The Technical Advisory Council (TAC) is a consultative committee within the COMSTE that supervise the panels and review their reports. The members of the TAC also serve as Senior Advisers to the members of the Commission.Commission Members . COMSTE website. Accessed Jan. 9, 2009.

She has also performed as a featured soprano soloist in the all-female ensemble Celtic Woman.  Career  Hilary was born in Dublin, Ireland, and completed a Bachelor of Music performance degree in 2005 at the DIT College of Music.\\"Lynn\\" bio in Celtic Woman: A New Journey Souvenir Program (2007), pp. 10–11 (paraphrased information appears on p. 11) Initially singing classical music, she moved to Celtic music to be able to \\"use [her] natural vocal range\\". Among the singers who influenced her, she counts Michael Jackson, Joni Mitchell, and Karen Carpenter.  Anúna  Hilary joined the Irish choral group Anúna in 2000. She toured the United States, Morocco, the Netherlands, and Finland with the group, and she has sung with the choir and featured as a soloist on six of their albums: Invocation (2001), Winter Songs (2001), Behind the Closed Eye (2002), Sensation (2006) \\"Illumination\\" (2012) and \\"Revelation\\" (2015). She continues to sing with Anúna and has appeared with them on the soundtrack of Diablo III as a soloist.  Celtic Woman  In 2007, longtime Celtic Woman member Méav Ní Mhaolchatha decided to leave the group to focus on her solo career. As a result, Hilary joined the group in time to feature in the A New Journey tour, which started on 10 October 2007 in Estero, FL. She was the first new full-time member to join the group since its inception in 2004.Lynn was the first new full-time member of Celtic Woman since 2004, as opposed to Deidre Shannon who temporarily replaced Méav during the first American Tour in 2005. Hilary has featured to date in Celtic Woman: The Greatest Journey, Celtic Woman: Songs from the Heart, Celtic Woman: Lullaby, and the Japanese release of Celtic Woman: Believe. She has only appeared in one PBS special/DVD, Celtic Woman: Songs from the Heart which was shot at Powerscourt House and Gardens in Summer 2009. She has also appeared in three tours, A New Journey, Isle of Hope, and Songs from the Heart. Following Celtic Woman's inaugural Australian Tour in November 2010, Hilary announced she would be leaving Celtic Woman to return to her home and life in Ireland. She was replaced by actress Lisa Lambe as part of the Celtic Woman line-up. On 14 February 2014 it was announced that Lynn would be returning to Celtic Woman for their Emerald tour in March while Lisa Lambe goes on a short 'leave of absence.' Lisa Lambe returned for two tours in the fall and winter of 2014, but announced she would be concentrating on solo work in 2015. Lynn again toured with Celtic Woman Tenth for part of their Tenth Anniversary Tour, which started in January 2015 and ended in 2015.  Other appearances  Hilary performed the lead vocal of the piece \\"Cloudsong\\" from Riverdance at the Opening Ceremony of the 2003 Special Olympics in Croke Park, Dublin, and toured the US with Riverdance in 2006 as a featured soloist. She released a solo album, Take Me With You, in 2008. In September 2011, Hilary returned to music as a member of the Irish singing trio the Bluebelles, with two current Anúna members Nicola Lewis and Rebecca Winckworth. According to a trailer released in 2012, Hilary was to be a featured soloist in a new show entitled \\"The Roots of Ireland,\\" but she has since returned to Riverdance. She was a member of a musical group called Babylon Sisters which featured Lisa Nolan, and fellow Anúna singer, Rebecca Winckworth. The group disbanded when Winckworth left to tour with Celtic Nights, and Hilary with Riverdance. In 2013, Hilary recorded her second album, Saturn Return, under the label CD Baby. The album consists of \\"original songs of a jazzy, folky nature\\" and is \\"an interpretation of a life up to the point of its first Saturn Return.\\" The album represents a reflection of upon the first thirty or so years of one's life and the opportunity to transform oneself based on the lessons learned. On 11 July 2016 it was announced that Hilary was forming a new group called CaraNua. The group also consists of former Celtic Woman singer Alex Sharpe and former Celtic Woman choir member Edel Murphy.

They are used for the treatment of symptoms of the metabolic syndrome, mainly for lowering triglycerides and blood sugar. Classification PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma are the molecular targets of a number of marketed drugs. The main classes of PPAR agonists are: PPAR-alpha agonists PPARα (alpha) is the main target of fibrate drugs, a class of amphipathic carboxylic acids (clofibrate, gemfibrozil, ciprofibrate, bezafibrate, and fenofibrate). They were originally indicated for cholesterol disorders and more recently for disorders that feature high triglycerides. PPAR-gamma agonists PPARγ (gamma) is the main target of the drug class of thiazolidinediones (TZDs), used in diabetes mellitus and other diseases that feature insulin resistance. It is also mildly activated by certain NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen) and indoles, as well as from a number of natural compounds. Known inhibitors include the experimental agent GW-9662. They are also used in treating hyperlipidaemia in atherosclerosis. Here they act by increasing the expression of ABCA1, which transports extra-hepatic cholesterol into HDL. Increased uptake and excretion from the liver therefore follows. Animal studies have shown their possible role in amelioration of pulmonary inflammation, especially in asthma. PPAR-delta agonists PPARδ (delta) is the main target of a research chemical named GW501516. It has been shown that agonism of PPARδ changes the body's fuel preference from glucose to lipids. Dual and pan PPAR agonists A fourth class of dual PPAR agonists, so- called glitazars, which bind to both the α and γ PPAR isoforms, are currently under active investigation for treatment of a larger subset of the symptoms of the metabolic syndrome. These include the experimental compounds aleglitazar, muraglitazar and tesaglitazar. In June 2013, saroglitazar was the first glitazar to be approved for clinical use.http://www.wallstreet- online.de/nachricht/6228479-zydus-gelingt-durchbruch-lipaglyn-wirkstoff- indien-markt-gelangt In addition, there is continuing research and development of new dual α/δ and γ/δ PPAR agonists for additional therapeutic indications, as well as \\"pan\\" agonists acting on all three isoforms. Research PPARα/γ agonists have shown potential at treating many inflammatory conditions including asthma and eczema. Another relatively recent avenue of drug research in treating depression and drug addiction is through PPARα and PPARγ activation. Both TLR4-mediated and NF-κB-mediated signalling pathways have been implicated in the development of addiction to several drugs such as opioids and cocaine, and therefore are appealing targets for pharmacotherapy. Despite a breadth of preclinical research showing potential in animal models in the treatment of drug addictions including alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, opioids and methamphetamine, the human evidence is limited with the amount of trials looking at using PPAR agonists for humans still being low; and so far (as of 2020) not being particularly promising. There are several suggested hypotheses for the poor translation from animal to human research evidence such as the potency and selectivity of PPAR ligands, sex- related variability, and species differences in the distribution and signaling of PPAR.

Each of these stations would act as a node in a lunar geophysical network. Ultimately this network could comprise 8-10 or more nodes operating simultaneously. Each node would have a minimum of two core capabilities. These capabilities include seismic sensing, heat flow sensing, and laser retroreflectors, and would be specific to each station. Because some nodes were planned to be located on the far side of the Moon, NASA would have contributed a communications relay satellite to the project. Individual nodes launched by different space agencies could have carried additional, unique experiments to study local or global lunar science. Such experiments might include atmospheric and dust instruments, plasma physics investigations, astronomical instruments, electromagnetic profiling of lunar regolith and crust, local geochemistry, and in-situ resource utilization demonstrations. History On July 24, 2008 a meeting of the space agencies of Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States was held at NASA's Lunar Science Institute, located at the Ames Research Center. During the meeting, the representatives of the nine space agencies discussed about the cooperation on ILN and agreed on a statement of intent as a first step in planning. NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) agreed to provide two pairs of nodes (landed stations) for this network. Payload The planned scientific payloads included:https://re.grc.nasa.gov/compass/overview/past- designs/2008-designs/international-lunar-network-iln/ * seismometers * magnetometers * laser retroreflectors * subsoil thermal probes Status The network was not developed. The first two nodes were suggested to be launched in 2013 and 2014, with the second pair being launched some time between 2016 and 2017.

Write Award winner Win Lyovarin. Known as \\"Pirates Of Langkasuka\\" in the UK, as \\"Legend of Langkasuka\\" in Australia and Canada, and as \\"Legend of the Tsunami Warrior\\" in the US. Plot Queen Hijau (The Green Queen) of Pattani faces overthrow by the rebel Prince Rawai, who is allied with pirate captain Black Raven. The pirates attempt to capture a huge cannon built by Dutchman Janis Bree and Chinese inventor Lim Kiam, but the Dutch ship carrying the cannon blows up and the cannons sink into the sea. Meanwhile, an orphaned sea gypsy boy named Pari (meaning \\"stingray\\") lies in a fishing village which is constantly under attack by Black Raven's raiding parties. The boy, gifted in the magical art of Dulum, is taken by his uncle Anyar to learn the magical ways of the ocean from White Ray. However, the sage refuses to teach the boy. Nevertheless, Pari is soon able to communicate with the marine life. He grows into manhood and fights against Black Raven's pirates. Black Raven, who also a practitioner in the Dulum ocean magical arts, has been trying unsuccessfully to raise the huge cannon from the sea. The local ruler, Queen Hijau, wants her own large cannon and seeks out Lim Kiam, whom she finds is living in the sea gypsy village. She sends away her sisters, Princess Biru (The Blue Princess) and Princess Ungu (The Purple Princess). They are under the protection of the queen's loyal commander, the fierce silat exponent Lord Yarang. Yarang comes under attack at the village by Black Raven's. Pari helps fight off the pirates, and Yarang escapes. Princess Ungu was thought to have been killed, but she was rescued by Pari and taken to White Ray's remote island. A romance develops between Ungu and Pari, but Ungu is intended to marry the Prince of Pahang, an important ally of Langkasuka. Pari himself is still tortured by memories of the death of his childhood sweetheart at the hands of Black Raven's men. Pari encounters Black Ray, an evil, unstable alter ego of White Ray, and begins to learn more about Dulum and the conflict between the black and white sides of the magic. Eventually, all the forces - the rebel prince, the pirates, the ocean sorcerers, the queen and the princesses - battle for the sunken cannon. During this battle, Black Raven uses a pair of whales to tow a raft with a heavy cannon into range of the castle walls. Pari - previously presumed to be dead - responds by rising from the ocean, standing on the back of a manta ray. He calls to the whales who slip their bonds and breach, landing on and destroying Black Raven's raft Cast *Jarunee Suksawat as Queen Hijau * Jacqueline Apithananon as Princess Biru *Anna Ris as Princess Ungu *Chupong Changprung as Lord Yarang *Ananda Everingham as Pari *Sorapong Chatree as White Ray/Black Ray *Jesdaporn Pholdee as Abdul Ghafur Muhiuddin Shah of Pahang *Winai Kraibutr as Black Raven *Jakkrit Phanichphatikram as Lim Kium *Andre Machielsen as Janis Bree *Preecha Katkham as Anyar *Kunanek Naiyanaprasert as Pari (youth) *Suwinit Panjamawat as Yarang's second in command *Manassanan Patcharasopachai *Mesini Keawratri *Ake Oree as Prince Rawai *Thiti Micheli *Attaporn Theemakorn *Suppakorn Kitsuwan *Arisa Sontirod *Kamol Luangrojkul Reception Queens of Langkasuka, which went into production in 2005, was at first called Queens of Pattani, but the name was changed to avoid political connections to the South Thailand insurgency and Pattani separatism, and to tie the story in with the legend of Langkasuka. The film premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Market to mixed reviews. Derek Elley of Variety said the film lacked focus and at 133 minutes was too long. Maggie Lee of The Hollywood Reporter was more upbeat, praising the sumptuous costume design and action sequences, but also said the film was too long. Based on the reception from the industry press, studio Sahamongkol Film International pushed for a shorter version of the film. The film's August 2008 release in Thai cinemas was postponed until October, with the director citing Thailand's unstable political atmosphere. A boost of confidence was given though, when the film was scheduled for the Venice Film Festival, where it would play in a special out-of-competition midnight screening. Queens of Langkasuka was also the \\"gala opening\\" film for the 2008 Bangkok International Film Festival. Derivative works The screenplay for Queens of Langkasuka was adapted by Win Lyovarin into the novel Bunga Pari (), also released in 2008.

It includes the Old Faithful Inn, designed by Robert Reamer and is itself a National Historic Landmark, the upper and lower Hamilton's Stores, the Old Faithful Lodge, designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood, the Old Faithful Snow Lodge, and a variety of supporting buildings. The Old Faithful Historic District itself lies on the 140-mile Grand Loop Road Historic District. A notable missing portion of the district is the Old Faithful Museum of Thermal Activity, which formed part of the trailside museum group that includes the Madison Museum, Norris Museum and Fishing Bridge Museum, all listed as National Historic Landmarks. The Old Faithful Museum was torn down in 1971 to make way for the Mission 66 visitor center, which in turn has been replaced by the Old Faithful Visitor Education Center. Buildings in the historic district : The following descriptions are derived from the November 2, 1982 nomination application. The district is dominated by the Old Faithful Inn and consists of the Old Faithful Lodge, 3 stores, 2 service stations, 5 dormitories, 10 support buildings, and the guest cabins behind the Old Faithful Lodge and the Snow Lodge. The first 11 buildings listed are of similar architectural style to the Old Faithful Inn and retain their architectural and historical integrity. The following 11 buildings: have historical significance as support buildings and they are compatible with the historic scene. The cabins have historical significance and do reflect the type of cabin construction in Yellowstone National Park. While the cabins in the Old Faithful Lodge still retain some architectural integrity, the cabins behind the Snow Lodge have been altered considerably and have lost their architectural integrity. * Building #2337 - Old Faithful Lodge. Construction began in 1923 with several additions made through 1927. The irregular plan building is of frame construction with stone masonry walls, wood-shingled exterior siding, and half log decorative elements. The lodge is approximately 28 feet long with a extension, a extension, and a extension plus another wing along the east side. The windows are casement and double hung. Stepped stone masonry columns and large log poles support the porte-cochère and other covered porches. Stepped stone masonry pilasters are used at some corners. The 19-room building has a wood-shingled, gable roof with a monitored roof over the recreation hall. Exposed log rafter ends and log brackets are used. * Building #2306 - Powerhouse and Laundry. Built in 1929 by the Yellowstone Park Company, the one-story, two-room L-shaped frame structure with wood-shingle exterior siding on concrete foundation has a wood-shingled gable roof with louvered type windows. The building has exposed log rafter ends. It is approximately with the L extension being approximately . This building is scheduled to be reduced in size if laundry facilities are park centralized. * Building #2310 - Caretaker's Quarters. Built in the late 1920s, the -story building has four rooms. The approximately rectangular frame structure on concrete foundation has wood-shingle exterior siding and a wood-shingled gable roof with a transverse hip at one elevation. The windows are both double hung and casement. The building has exposed log rafter ends. The building is now the winter keeper's residence. * Building #2311 - Laundry Manager's Residence. Built in 1926, the approximately rectangular plan frame one-story structure has two rooms. The building has wood-shingle exterior siding and a wood- shingled gable roof with a transverse gable roof and casement window. The roof has exposed log rafter ends and large ridge poles which are compatible to the Old Faithful Inn. * Building #2302 - Lower Service Station. This building was built by the Hamilton Store Company at an unknown date. It is a modified T-plan structure, approximately , with a extension. The exterior walls are horizontal siding with vertical half-timbers. The roof is wood-shingled and extends over the gas pumps. Hamilton stores, Inc., and the National Park Service each have joint ownership of the building. * Building #2303 - Lower Hamilton Store. Built as Klamer Store in 1894 and sold to Charles Hamilton in 1914. Hamilton expanded the store over the years. The modified U-plan is two- story with 13 rooms plus baths. The building is approximately , with the two extensions being approximately and . The frame constructed building has novelty siding and a wood-shingled gabled roof with several transverse gables. Burled branches and logs are used as brackets and decorative elements on the north and east elevations. An unusual element is the use of the burled wood in spelling out HAMILTON STORES which hangs over the entrance to the salesroom. The interior is typical store design of the time, but the second floor contains a small sitting room called \\"The Million Dollar Room,\\" papered with canceled checks whose total is $1,000,000. This fact is reportedly recorded in Ripley's Believe It or Not. Hamilton Stores, Inc., and the National Park Service have joint ownership of the building. * Building #2780 - Photo Shop. Built in 1927 by Haynes, Inc., the T-plan structure, approximately with the leg being . The two-story, 25-room store is of frame construction with half- log and shiplap siding. A porch extends across the front of the building. The wood-shingled gabled roof has exposed log rafter ends. The store reflects the concession architecture in Yellowstone National Park during the 1920s and 1930s. The building was moved to its present location in 1971. * Building #2326 - Upper Hamilton Store. Built in 1929 by Hamilton Stores, Inc., as a store and employee dormitory. The two-story, 33-room structure is approximately , and in a U-shaped configuration. The windows are both casement and double hung sash. The walls are constructed of concrete laid to resemble hewn logs. The building is placed on a masonry stone foundation with stepped stone masonry pilasters and stepped stone masonry columns that support the two covered entrance porches. The eaves of the wood-shingled gabled roof are wood- shingled with exposed log rafter ends; log rafter purlins are used in the roof structure of the two covered entrance porches. The tips of the log rafter ends and the purlins are tapered and whittled to resemble beaver gnawnings. The building was originally part of the Old Faithful Auto Camp. Hamilton Stores, Inc., and the National Park Service each have joint ownership of the building. * Building #2327 - Upper Gas Station. Built in 1929 by Hamilton Stores, Inc., the Latin Cross plan structure has two rooms with three of the wings canopied over the gas pumps. The walls are of concrete construction laid to resemble hewn logs. Stepped stone masonry pilasters are used at the corners, similar stone columns support the canopies. The gabled roof has wood shingles and exposed log rafter ends. The structure has casement windows. Hamilton Stores, Inc., and the National Park Service each have joint ownership of the building. * Building #2305 - Old Faithful Inn. The Old Faithful Inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, July 23, 1973. Herein specifically, the nomination will be expanded to include the following interior spaces: the dining room, the lobby, Rooms 10, 127, 154, and 229. The rustic log quality of the exterior is carried throughout the interior. The lobby, a 64-foot-square space rising 85 feet to the ridgeline, is encircled with tiers of balconies used as lounges for the guests. The use of exposed logs for the ceilings, walls, the purlins and rafters are further accented by the use of vertical log supports of the second and third floor balconies and for the small open room near the ceiling called the \\"Crow's Nest.\\" In earlier days, the \\"Crow's Nest\\" was used by musicians as a place to assemble and entertain the guests far below. The lobby is further enhanced by the lighting effect produced by the many glass dormer windows placed in the steep gabled roof. An immense 16-foot- square native stone fireplace with hearths on each of its four sides dominates one corner of the lobby. Tons of local stone were used in the construction of the fireplace. The fireplace towers to the ceiling. Suspended from the ceilings in the lobby and dining room are copper light fixtures designed by the Inn's architect, Robert Reamer. Imitation candlesticks, also designed by Reamer, are mounted on the log columns and form sconces on the log walls. The original log-walled dining room is open to the roof with the log ceiling supported by log scissor trusses. A massive rock fireplace, modified after the 1959 earthquake, centers on the south wall. In 1921, the south wall ground level windows were removed to install doorways for a new dining room addition. In 1927, a multisided addition was made to the east wall of the original dining room. The original wall was removed and replaced with three support columns and panels. Interesting and significant elements of the room and the 1921 dining room addition are the arabesque on the fir panels, the spare columns, and the frieze. The etched designs are of flora and fauna and are the only rustic touches in the room. The room was converted to \\"The Bear Pit\\" a more formal cocktail lounge in 1962. Room No. 10, off the west corridor on the first floor, is one of the original rooms with modified bathroom intact.

His research and art includes work in the fields of BioArt (using molecular biology and bioinformatics), \\"space art\\", and sculpture, using media including centrifuges, radios, prosthetics, magnetic fields, and genetic material. Davis' teaching positions have been at MIT, the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), and the University of Kentucky. Davis' works include the sculpture Earth Sphere, a landmark fog fountain at Kendall Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts, near the MIT campus; RuBisCo Stars, a transmission of a message to nearby stars from the Arecibo Observatory radiotelescope in Puerto Rico, carried out in November 2009; New Age Ruby Falls, a project to create an artificial aurora using a 100,000 watt electron beam fired into the magnetosphere from a NASA space shuttle (which has not yet been carried out); and Microvenus, a piece of symbolic art involving engineering the genetic code of a microbe. Significance Davis' work has been featured in scientific journals, art magazines, and mainstream media—including Scientific American, Nature magazine, and several books. Additionally, Davis has contributed to projects associated with the DIYbio movement . He is frequently invited to speak at universities, labs, and art institutes. Davis' life was further detailed in a feature-length documentary entitled Heaven+Earth+Joe Davis. Davis has had many media appearances, including twice on the Colbert Report. A segment was also produced on Nova. In 2001, the Washington Post termed Davis the \\"éminence grise of the 'bioart' movement\\", saying further, \\"Davis eschews the art versus science argument, insisting that he speaks both languages and could not possibly tear the two disciplines apart in his own mind\\". Davis' work has further significance in documenting and critiquing early attempts at steganographic encoding of culturally important messages and images for future generations or extraterrestrial cultures.

Retrieved June 7, 2020 May 10, 1947 – January 21, 2014) was an American professional baseball catcher who played parts of nine seasons in Major League Baseball between 1970 and 1981. He played for the 1973 and World Series champion Oakland Athletics, though he was never on a postseason roster. Career Hosley was originally signed by the Detroit Tigers in 1966, and made it to the majors with them for the first time in 1970. He played in just 14 games for them over two seasons before being sold to the A's prior to the 1973 season. Again, though, Hosley's major league time was minimal, playing in 24 games over two seasons during the A's 1973 and '74 World Championship seasons. The A's were deep in catching during those seasons, often playing Gene Tenace at first base. After the 1974 season, Hosley was removed from the A's major league roster, and he was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the Rule 5 Draft. This led to Hosley's best showing in the majors in 1975, when he batted .255 with 6 home runs in 62 games while splitting time behind the plate with Steve Swisher and George Mitterwald. Despite these hitting numbers, which were good for a catcher at the time, he was placed on waivers by the Cubs just a few games into the 1976 season, and he was claimed by Oakland. His return to the A's was somewhat more successful than his first stay from the standpoint of playing time, but his batting numbers declined sharply, as he only hit for a .199 batting average over 79 games between 1976 and 1978. He remained in the A's farm system until 1981, when he was released on August 27 after one final stint at the major league level, during which he went just 2-for-21. In 1989, Tim Hosley played one more professional season for the Fort Myers Sun Sox of the Senior Professional Baseball Association.

The temple (known as a mithraeum) was built within a townhouse in the Roman city of Aquincum, now in Óbuda on the outskirts of the modern city of Budapest, Hungary.  The mithraeum.  The temple was discovered during excavations in 1888 within what appeared to be a large house near to the centre of the Roman city. Due to the size of the house and the importance of its location it must have belonged to an important individual and this must certainly be the decurion Marcus Antonius Victorinus who dedicated a number of small altars within the sanctuary. The shrine was orientated north to south and measured 7m wide by 15.03m long. The interior was divided up into three parts- two ante rooms and the sanctuary proper. The front room (Room A: 4.75 x 2.90m) is postulated by the excavators as a Shrine of Mercury.Certainly a large statue base stood here and fragments of a statue were found nearby. CIMRM 1755. A room (Room B: 0.85x2.90m) was located on the west side and is of uncertain purpose. The middle room (Room C: 5.90x3m) probably served as a narthex. The main part of the shrine was divided into three lateral parts, typical of all mithraea. A central nave about 2.18m wide and 1 meter below ground level was flanked on either side by podium benches for the initiates to recline on during the ceremonies (see Mithraic worship). Steps lead down to the lower floor level of the nave directly from the entrance and the higher benches were accessed by single steps on either side of the bottom nave step. Along the front of the benches, and slightly recessed into them, were placed a pair of small altars (H 0.65 Br. 0.30m) all dedicated by Marcus Antoninus Victorinus.

She also explained, \\"It gives men a legitimate reason to stare at boobs.\\" Samantha Paterson, a brand manager for Wonderbra, said that National Cleavage Day was started as a way to solemnise women's independence and power in all facets of life, from their careers to their relationships to their own destiny. Paterson said the day is intended to be lighthearted amusement and that the revenue will be donated to the Sunflower Fund.National cleavage day warms up to the sick SABC News The fund is a non-governmental and non-profit organisation based in Cape Town with a stated aim to help South African citizens diagnosed with leukaemia and other life-threatening blood diseases.  Locations National Cleavage Day is celebrated at office premises, restaurants and bars throughout the nation.Ladies, get ready to bust out of your tops! Independent Online Most people polled on the streets during the celebrations in 2002 expressed positive view on this event. During the occasion of the National Cleavage Day in 2002, twenty local girls in Johannesburg and another twenty girls in Cape Town were called in for the purpose of distributing stickers and G-strings to selected female drivers. Boobs are back in a big way Independent Online The celebration of the NCD in 2006 started early in the morning of 7 April when women showing their cleavages in Edgars, Foschini Group and Truworths at La Lucia Mall, Gateway Shopping Centre and the Pavilion handed out Cosmopolitan magazines free of cost to customers. A competition was organised at the Cafe Vacca Matta called the \\"Best Cleavage.\\" Thousands of women in the province of KwaZulu-Natal displayed their cleavages in support of this event. Local manufacturers and retailers of undergarments have joined in support of the celebration of the NCD and it marks some new industry shifts.A lift in the market Moneyweb.co.za After the celebration in 2007, Paterson said, \\"We will be donating money for every bra that gets sold in March. We will donate money to the Sunflower fund. We are having big parties, we have special National Cleavage Day cocktails that have been created and for every cocktail bought R2 will be donated to the sunflower fund.\\" References to National Cleavage Day, observed annually in March or April, are occasionally noted internationally as trending on Twitter. Criticism Dr. Siqwana-Ndulo, provincial gender commissioner in Eastern Cape, condemned the celebrations, warning women not to be involved in the National Cleavage Day. Siqwana-Ndulo said \\"This is a pure marketing tool using people's bodies.\\" She added, \\"The commission is against any person or advertising company, which uses people's bodies for marketing purposes be it advertising a car or anything of that sort.\\"Frowns over cleavage day Dispatch Online A paper published by the Gender Links depicted an image of two women showing their cleavages during the occasion of the NCD on 5 April 2003, with a caption \\"These two bosom buddies were all part of the fun in yesterday’s National Cleavage Day, where a number of stunning beauties, their natural assets enhanced by Wonderbra, brought traffic to a standstill in many parts of Joburg.\\" The paper argued globalisation of the media enforces \\"globalised norms\\" of gender and lowest single common denominator in \\"global\\" images of gender is \\"sex sells\\" which builds and reinforces stereotypes and bias—both male and female.Sex sells—or does it? Gender Links Vanessa Raphaely, editor of the Cosmopolitan, argued the NCD is not intended to objectify women, but to celebrate in a funny manner.

She is known for having had an affair and having a child with former US Senator John Edwards, while he was a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008.. She is said to be the basis of a character in a Jay McInerney novel. Early life Hunter was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Her parents, James Druck (1934–1990) and Gwen Druck, owned Eagle Nest Farm in Ocala, Florida, where they raised show horses. They had four daughters. James Druck was a wealthy lawyer, who specialized in defending insurance companies. Hunter went to St. John Lutheran School and North Marion High School in Ocala. After high school, Hunter attended the University of Tampa, but she transferred after two years to the University of Florida. In her junior year she withdrew from University of Florida to move to New York City to pursue an acting career. Horse killings and Henry the Hawk According to ABC News, Lisa Druck was \\"a prize-winning equestrian when her father was implicated\\" in the \\"horse murders\\" scandal, \\"an ugly plot to electrocute horses for insurance money\\". The convicted criminal and FBI informant Tommy \\"The Sandman\\" Burns stated that James Druck was involved in the 1982 insurance fraud death of Lisa's show jumper Henry the Hawk. Gwen and James Druck divorced that same year; Lisa was 17 years old at the time. James Druck was never charged, and he died of cancer in New York City in 1990. Literary inspiration \\"Brat Pack\\" novelist Jay McInerney said that Hunter, his former girlfriend, is the basis for the lead character Alison Poole in the 1988 novel Story of My Life. McInerney described their relationship and Hunter's role as the inspiration for the character in an interview in 2005. McInerney also said that he chose to write about her and her friends because he was both \\"intrigued and appalled\\" by their behavior. McInerney's friend and fellow Brat Pack author Bret Easton Ellis also includes the character Alison Poole in two of his novels, Glamorama and American Psycho. There was open speculation that Story of My Life was a roman à clef novel when it first appeared; to New York Magazine's questions \\"Is it real? Did it happen?\\" McInerney replied, \\"I'm anticipating some of that kind of speculation, but I'm utterly confident of not having any lawsuits on my hands. The book is a fully imagined work of fiction. On the other hand, it's not to say that I didn't make use of [pause] … That's why I live in New York. Mine is not an autonomous imagination.\\" In 2008, McInerney incorporated the John Edwards affair into the Allison Poole follow-up story \\"Penelope on the Pond\\" in his collections The Last Bachelor and How It Ended. Marriage and name change Lisa Druck married attorney Alexander M. \\"Kip\\" Hunter III (born April 14, 1959) in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on August 3, 1991, and they moved from New York to establish a new home in Beverly Hills, California.

Acting, film, and video career During the 1980s and 1990s, as Lisa Hunter and Lisa Jo Hunter, she appeared in several films, most notably Overboard (1987) and Ricochet (1991) in which she portrayed a reporter. According to People, during this same period, while she was married to Alexander Hunter, her husband \\"financed the production of a play for her — a coming-of-age story about a group of tough 30-something New Yorkers [...] titled Savage in Limbo,\\" which co-starred Elizabeth Dennehy. In 2000, as Rielle Hunter, she wrote, acted in, and produced a comedy short called Billy Bob and Them, which starred Wolfgang Bodison. At that time her production company was called R Hunter Films.Billy Bob and Them (2000) entry at IMdb. Retrieved August 9, 2008. In 2002, Hunter appeared as a contestant on the GSN series Lingo (episode #1061, hosted by Chuck Woolery), on which she and her partner together won $500.According to a conversation with a Game Show Network employee, episode #1061 of Lingo with Rielle Hunter will be broadcast again on December 13, 2008, if the current schedule is maintained.The episode was rebroadcast on Friday, April 30, 2010. Midline Groove Productions In 2006, Hunter pitched the idea of a series of short informal campaign videos to Democrat John Edwards when she met him at a bar in New York City, where he was attending a business meeting. The Edwards campaign soon hired her to produce a series of promotional videos portraying behind-the-scenes life on the campaign trail and Hunter filmed and produced four of these short videos for the 2008 presidential campaign of John Edwards. In July 2006, Hunter formed the production company Midline Groove Productions LLC with her partner Mimi Godfrey Hockman. This company, which was based in South Orange, New Jersey, produced campaign promotional videos for John Edwards. The series of ads, \\"Inspiring Politics: A Webisode Series Following John Edwards,\\" was broadcast on the worldwide web rather than through conventional television. According to the Associated Press, Edwards' One America Committee paid Midline Groove Productions $100,000 on July 6, 2006, five days after Hunter incorporated the firm in Delaware. The committee later made two subsequent payments totaling $14,461, the final one on April 1, 2007. In all, Midline Groove filmed and produced four of these short videos; the shortest was 2½ minutes long. Hunter's videos were uploaded to YouTube. Recognition of the innovative nature of the series was given by BusinessWeek magazine, which included one of the episodes in a 2006 feature on new developments in Web video. Catherine Holoran, writing for the magazine, noted that the Hunter videos had effectively announced the presidential candidacy of Edwards ten days before he released the information to the mainstream media. Holoran stated that Hunter's series marked a \\"tipping point\\" in the history of web video which \\"sent the message that online video [... is ...] a serious medium, ready to contend with traditional media for audiences and ad dollars.\\" In 2008, Maria Russo, the reviewer of websites for the Los Angeles Times, also mentioned that Hunter had been among the earliest adopters of YouTube for viral marketing purposes, and was the first filmmaker who exploited that venue for political campaign marketing. \\"... the peppy, jagged little production called 'Inspiring Politics: A Webisode Series Following John Edwards' was made in the summer and fall of 2006. YouTube was just over a year old, and the idea of a \\"Webisode series\\" was barely a twinkle in Hollywood’s eye — lonelygirl15, the first such series to attract mainstream attention, did not get big until September.\\" Involvement with John Edwards The National Enquirer, a U.S. tabloid, cited claims by an anonymous source that Edwards had engaged in an extramarital affair with Hunter during Edwards's 2008 presidential campaign and that Hunter was pregnant. After a report by the National Enquirer on December 19, 2007, Hunter announced she was pregnant with the child of Andrew Young, a married man who is a former staffer for John Edwards' presidential campaign. Young, his wife Cheri, and their young children were living outside of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, at the time in the same \\"Governor's Club\\" complex where Hunter was renting. Soon afterward, the Youngs and Hunter moved to California.Transcript: John Edwards Admits Extra-Marital Affair, August 8, 2008, guest host Wolf Blitzer interviewing National Enquirer reporter on CNN Larry King Live. Hunter became pregnant with Edwards' child in May 2007; she later said she found out she was pregnant only in July. She gave birth to her daughter on February 27, 2008, in Santa Barbara, California, but did not list the child's father's name on the birth certificate. She gave her own name as \\"Rielle Jaya James Druck\\" on her daughter's birth certificate, but gave the child the surname \\"Hunter\\". In July 2008, The National Enquirer said Edwards was the father of Hunter's child. On August 8, Edwards admitted the affair, but denied that he was the father of Hunter's child and stated that he was willing to take a paternity test. The Washington Post reported that Robert Gordon (Hunter's attorney) stated that she had refused to allow a DNA test to establish paternity \\"now or in the future.\\" However, Hunter's sister publicly asked Edwards to take a paternity test to determine whether the child was his. On August 12, 2008, Hunter's friend Pigeon O'Brien told CBS News that Edwards had lied about the timeline of the affair. She said the affair began in February 2006, six months before Edwards hired Hunter, and said the affair was not a brief liaison, but rather was allegedly characterized by Edwards to Hunter as a committed relationship. On August 13, 2008, Hunter's sister, Roxanne Druck Marshall, personally apologized to John Edwards's wife Elizabeth for her sister's behavior. She said Edwards had lied in his confession because, she said, the affair had been ongoing. On January 21, 2010, Edwards admitted publicly that he is the father of Hunter's daughter Quinn. On June 26, 2012 Hunter's book, What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me, was released through a Dallas-based boutique publisher, BenBella Books. The same day, Hunter stated that her relationship with Edwards had broken up. On February 9, 2016, Hunter spoke on Steve Harvey in her first televised interview in almost five years, Hunter, 51, said that the couple were actually still together up until February 2015.

The game was released in North America in October 2008, and in Europe in February 2009. The campaign mode of the game is made up of a series of varied mini-games, and tournaments against AI which can only be played in single-player mode. A sequel, titled Rocket League, was released in July 2015.  Gameplay  The game is played by one or more players, locally or online, using their car to hit a soccer ball that is much larger than the car, with hope to score a goal. Each goal is worth one point, and the team with the most points when 5 minutes have passed wins. If both teams are tied when the timer runs out, the game enters the sudden death overtime mode, which lasts indefinitely until either team scores. There are also many various mini- games and tournaments only available in single player, consisting of situations such as the player being outnumbered by computer-controlled opponents, or objectives such as shooting balls at a goal in a certain amount of time or defending a goal from shots from a cannon. For each completed mini- game or tournament, the player can earn up to 5 stars, depending on how well it was completed, along with various criteria depending on the game in question.  Reception  Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars received mixed reviews by critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. It was downloaded on the PlayStation Network over two million times.  Sequel  In March 2011, Psyonix confirmed that there was a sequel in development, but that it was far from completion due to them having difficulty pitching it to publishers or acquiring the finances required to self-publish. In September 2013, Psyonix announced more details, saying that there would be a free alpha version released for testing and improvement on the PC, before being ported to consoles. The game, Rocket League, was released for the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows on July 7, 2015, and for other platforms at later dates.

It is brown in colour, with a large number of gills and a particularly thin layer of flesh in the cap. Mycorrhizal, the mushroom is found from late summer to late autumn at the base of beech trees in small groups or individually, where it is one of the two most common species of fungi. Alternatively, it can be found in large groups in fields, sometimes with more than a hundred individual mushrooms. It is found in Europe, and, despite previous research to the contrary, is absent in North America. Although considered edible, it is not particularly useful as food due to its ivy-like taste and the fact that more choice mushrooms will be easily found at the same time. L. subdulcis is known for its abundant, sweet- tasting milk that, unlike the latex of some of its relatives, does not stain fabric yellow.  Taxonomy  Lactarius subdulcis was first described as Agaricus subdulcis by mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1801, before English mycologist Samuel Frederick Gray placed it in its current genus Lactarius in 1821 in his The Natural Arrangement of British Plants. The specific epithet is derived from Latin words sub \\"under\\", and dulcis \\"sweet\\", after the milk's delayed sweet taste. As well as mild milk cap, beech milk cap is an alternate common name.  Description  L. subdulcis is known for the large amounts of milk it produces. Lactarius subdulcis has a convex cap of across that later develops a depression. It sometimes has a small umbo, and in colour can be a reddish-brown, rusty or dark-cinnamon, later paling to buff, though darker in the middle. The cap can be fairly rigid to flexible, and smooth to slightly wrinkled. At first, the margin is incurved though it is sometimes slightly furrowed. The stem is 3–7 cm long and between 6 and 13 mm thick, and is generally cylindrical though can be club-shaped. The stem is sometimes furrowed lengthwise, and is generally the same colour as the cap, though paler at the top. The flesh is pale and there is only a thin layer in the cap. The crowded gills are adnate to slightly decurrent, and can be white or pink in colour. It has white, plentiful milk that does not stain fabrics yellow, differentiating it from other species of Lactarius, such as L. decipiens. It has a faint, oily scent.  Spores  Lactarius subdulcis has cream spore print with a slight salmon tinge. The spores are oval, with largish warts of around 1 micrometre (μm) which are joined by a well-developed network of mostly thin ridges. The spores measure 7.5–11 μm by 6.5–9 μm, and are amyloid or ellipsoid in shape.  Distribution and habitat  Lactarius subdulcis is found in Europe; it does not occur in North America, although a number of similar brownish-orange species were formerly classified under this species. It is found in broad-leaved woodland, especially on the floor at the base of beech trees. Along with L. vellereus, L. subdulcis is the most common fungi found on beech trees. The mushrooms can be found from late summer to late autumn, and are common. They are found individually, or in small groups. They can also be found in fields, generally appearing in large batches, with groups of over a hundred mushrooms not uncommon.  Edibility  Lactarius subdulcis has a mild taste with a slightly bitter after-taste. Though considered edible after cooking, it is not recommended, as it has a taste reminiscent of ivy. There are a number of other mushrooms that appear at the same time and in the same areas as L. subdulcis that are preferable to it, including L. mitissimus, meaning that L. subdulcis is not particularly useful as a foodstuff. The milk is one of distinguishing features, having a sweet taste that turns bitter in the mouth, with L. subdulcis being considered a sweet milk mushroom.

It has been instrumental in creating the Kenyan tech ecosystem, known as the Silicon Savannah, and its employees have gone on to found iHub, Akirachix, and BRCK. The organisation uses the concept of crowdsourcing for social activism and public accountability, serving as an initial model for what has been coined as \\"activist mapping\\"—the combination of social activism, citizen journalism and geospatial information. Ushahidi offers products that enable local observers to submit reports using their mobile phones or the internet, while simultaneously creating a temporal and geospatial archive of events. The Ushahidi platform is often used for crisis response, human rights reporting, and election monitoring. Ushahidi (Swahili for \\"testimony\\", closely related to shahidi which means \\"witness\\") created a website in the aftermath of Kenya's disputed 2007 presidential election that collected eyewitness reports of violence reported by email and text message and placed them on a Google Maps map. The Ushahidi platform has been used by the United Nations Department of Field Services and Peacekeeping, in response to the Haiti Earthquake in 2010, to monitor the Nigerian elections in 2011, by the Obama Campaign for America 2012, by the Nepalese army to respond to the earthquake of 2015, in and by local activists groups such as Humanitarian Tracker to monitor violence in the Syrian civil war and HarassMap to help women report on sexual harassment. Successful deployment of crisis mapping applications like Ushahidi benefits from careful attention to how the technology fits into the relevant cultural settings, and focusing on realistic goals.  Products   Ushahidi  Ushahidi v2 was built on the Kohana web framework, a fork of the CodeIgniter framework. It includes support for Nexmo wholesale SMS API and Clickatell SMS Gateway. Furthermore, the official Ushahidi-hosted websites use the commercial service. Ushahidi provides the option of using OpenStreetMap maps in its user interface, but requires the Google Maps API for geocoding. Ushahidi is often set up using a local SMS gateway created by a local FrontlineSMS set-up. Ushahidi v3 was released in September 2015. As an improvement to the v2 platform it is built as an API with a web client. It allows for custom survey creation, and the running of multiple surveys on a single deployment, amongst other feature improvements from v2 such as embeddable maps and surveys, analytics, private deployments, and management of roles and permissions. It is built on the Laravel PHP web framework. It is open source under the AGPL license. Ushahidi v4 was released in 2018, and replaces Kohana with Lumen. =Releases and codenames= * 1.0 Mogadishu – 10 December 2009 * 1.2 Haiti – ~22 January 2010 * 2.0 Luanda – 22 November 2010 * 2.1 Tunis – 9 August 2011 * 2.2 Juba – 13 March 2012 * 2.3 Juba – 24 April 2012 *3.0 - September 2015 *4.0 - 1 Oct 2018 Crowdmap Crowdmap is designed and built by the team behind Ushahidi, a platform that was originally built to crowdsource crisis information. As the platform evolved, so did its users. Crowdmap now allows users to set up their own deployments of Ushahidi without having to install it on a web server. Since its release in 2010, prominent deployments of Crowdmap have documented the global Occupy movement and the 2011 London anti-cuts protest. The original Crowdmap was a hosted version of the Ushahidi v2 open source software platform. On 31 December 2010, the Ushahidi team announced a new version of Crowdmap, that differed from the Ushahidi v2 codebase: Checkins, a geosocial add-on to Crowdmap that allows users to create a white-label alternative to sites like Foursquare and Gowalla. Rather than filling out submission forms online, checkins allow Crowdmap users to expedite data entry to their deployment, focussing first on location and adding more detailed information later. Ushahidi describes the effort as \\"checkins with a purpose\\".  SwiftRiver (discontinued)  SwiftRiver was designed as a suite of intelligence and real-time data gathering products that complement Ushahidi's mapping and visualization products. Often referred to as the SwiftRiver Initiative the goal of the project was \\"to democratize access to the tools for making sense of information\\". The project attracted a lot of interest from newsrooms. In December 2014, Ushahidi announced that it would stop development and support and reallocate the resources. SwiftRiver was a free and Open-source platform that helped people make sense of a lot of information in a short amount of time. It was born out of the need to understand and act upon a wave of massive amounts of crisis data that tends to overwhelm in the first 24 hours of a disaster. There had been a great deal of interest in Swift for other industries such as newsrooms, political analysts and marketers as an open- source alternative to more expensive, proprietary intelligence software platforms. The SwiftRiver platform offered applications which combine natural language/artificial intelligence process, data-mining for SMS and Twitter, and verification algorithms for different sources of information.  Rollcall  Ushahidi built RollCall after a team member was involved in the terrorist attack at Westgate Malle in Nairobi in 2013. Rollcall is a quick way to check in with the people someone is responsible for during critical situations. Rollcall sends a one-click message with a binary question such as \\"Are you okay?\\" to a pre-prepared contact list, such as list of colleagues, parents at a school, or an embassy's list of citizens in a country at that time, via text, email, mobile app, and Slack. The recipients respond with a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" allowing the organization responsible for them to quickly triage who is in danger. History Juliana Rotich Beginnings in Kenya Ushahidi (Swahili for \\"testimony\\" or \\"witness\\") is a website created in the aftermath of Kenya's disputed 2007 presidential election (see 2007–2008 Kenyan crisis) that collected eyewitness reports of violence sent in by email and text- message and placed them on a Google map. It is also the name of the open source software developed for that site, which has since been improved, released freely, and used for a number of similar projects around the globe. The Kenyan site was developed and run by several bloggers and software developers, all current or former residents of Kenya. They include Erik Hersman, Juliana Rotich, Ory Okolloh, and David Kobia. The site was initially proposed by Okolloh, developed cheaply, and put online within a few days. International media, government sources, NGOs, and Kenyan journalists and bloggers were used to verify eyewitness testimony. The site was later also used to facilitate donations from abroad. An analysis by Harvard's Kennedy School of Government found that Ushahidi was better overall at reporting acts of violence as they began. The data collected by Ushahidi was superior to that reported by the mainstream media in Kenya at the time. The service was also better at reporting non-fatal violence as well as information coming in from rural areas.Shirky, Clay. 2010. Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age. New York: Penguin Press. 16. On 23 December 2010, Ushahidi Co-founder and Executive Director Ory Okolloh announced that she was stepping down from her role to become Manager of Policy for Africa at Google. Post- Kenya crisis uses Soon after its initial use in Kenya, the Ushahidi software was used to create a similar site to track anti-immigrant violence in South Africa, in May 2008. The software has since been used to map violence in eastern Congo, beginning in November 2008. Ushahidi is used in Kenya, Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in June 2009 to track pharmacy stockouts in several Southeast African countries. Finally, it was used to monitor elections in Mexico and India, among other projects. It was also used by Al Jazeera to collect eyewitness reports during the 2008–09 Gaza War. The post election violence in Kenya was the subject of a Harvard Humanitarian Institute study and mentioned in a Berkman Center report. 2010 =Haiti= In 2010, due to the earthquake in Haiti, Patrick Meier launched a joint effort between Ushahidi, The Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy at Tufts University, UN OCHA/Colombia and the International Network of Crisis Mappers (CM*Net) to start the Haiti implementation. A few hours later many humanitarian/tech workers joined this initiative. Nearly 40,000 independent reports were sent to the Ushahidi Haiti Project of which nearly 4,000 distinct events were plotted. =Chile= Only a month after the Haiti earthquake, the 2010 earthquake in Chile prompted Patrick Meier to launch Ushahidi-Chile within hours of the initial quake.Net puts Kenya at centre of Chile rescue efforts, Jonathan Fildes, BBC News, 1 March 2010 The Chile site is co-managed with the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University in the United States, supported by Chilean Americans. =Louisiana, U.S.= On 20 April 2010 BP's offshore Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded killing eleven workers and precipitating the largest accidental offshore oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry. On 3 May the Louisiana Bucket Brigade (LABB) publicly released the Oil Spill Crisis Map, the first application of the Ushahidi platform in a humanitarian response in the United States. In the years since the BP oil spill, LABB continues to use the map (now the iWitness Pollution Map) as a repository of eyewitness reports and photos documenting the impacts of petrochemical pollution on human health and the environment. Reports to the map come from cities all over Louisiana, including Baton Rouge, St. Rose, and Chalmette. Since 2010 LABB has collected over 14,000 reports, making it the largest and longest-running deployment of an Ushahidi instance. =Washington, D.C.= In the wake of winter storms, the Washington Post and the web development company PICnet used the software to create a site mapping blocked roads and other information. =Italy= Elena Rapisardi, together with Giovanni Lotto, launched the first Italian crowdmap Open Foreste Italiane in order to list and map information to prevent and manage forest fires; the meaning of this project has been reported on the Ushahidi blog. Though OpenForeste did not completely achieve his goals, it showed importance for two reasons: (1) unlike previous instances, the platform was utilized in absence of an acting crisis or emergency to collect, map, share and spread information in order to manage future and potential emergencies, thus joining the awareness of the possibilities of Web 2.0 and a different approach to natural risk prevention; (2) it brought to Italy the knowledge and potential of Ushahidi, crowdmapping and social use of crowdsourcing, which was then used in following years in several instances, both private and public, especially from local Civil Protection structures and based on the new approach to the Ushahidi platform (see here a non-complete crowdmap of Italian Crowdsourcing Projects). =Russia= Ushahidi was used in Russia to set up a \\"map of help\\" for voluntary workers needed after the 2010 Russian wildfires.Карта Помощи пострадавшим от лесных пожаров 2010 в России (Help Map for victims of the 2010 forest fires in Russia)Карта Помощи. Help Map 2011 ;Christchurch Using Ushahidi, the Christchurch Recovery Map website was launched less than 24 hours after the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand. The site maps locations of services such as food, water, toilets, fuel, ATMs, and medical care. Information was gathered via Twitter using the #eqnz hashtag, SMS messages, and email. The site was founded by a group of web professionals, and maintained by volunteers. ;Middle East This software allowed pro-democracy demonstrators across the Middle East to organise and communicate what was happening around them in early 2011. On 2 March, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) requested that the Standby Volunteer Task Force be activated for Libya. The Task Force's Tech Team set up a password protected Ushahidi platform almost immediately and several days later launched a public version at OCHA's request. This allowed users to contribute relevant information about ground conditions as they occurred. ;Italy In July 2011, Giuseppe Calamita had created the first crowdmap to monitor a WIMAX/LTE Internet Service Provider to answer the issues not due to the ISP (jammer, etc.) ;India India Citizen Reports has been using Ushahidi since 2011 to collect and disseminate reports in various categories like civic problems, crimes and corruption. TelecomMap.com uses Ushahidi to map 3G network quality and Wi-Fi hotspots. ;Australia Australian Broadcasting Corporation used Ushahidi to map the Queensland floods in January.ABC's crowdsourced flood-mapping initiative abc.net ;United States The MightyMoRiver Project used Ushahidi's hosted service Crowdmap to track the Missouri River floods of 2011. ;Macedonia Transparency Watch Project is using the Ushahidi platform to track corruption reported cases in the Republic of Macedonia. PrijaviKorupcija is a joint project by Transparency International and the Center for International Relations allowing citizens to report cases of corruption via ONE by sending SMS from their mobile phones, sending an email, using the web form, the hashtag #korupcijaMK on Twitter or by reporting via phone call. Nigerian Elections Ushahidi was used to monitor the Nigerian 2011 elections under the project Reclaim Naija. A published article in the Journal of Information Technology & Politics by Catie Snow Bailard & Steven Livingston showed that, \\"Controlling for a number of factors, we find that the number and nature of crowdmap reports generated by citizens is significantly correlated with increased voter turnout (by 8%) in the 2011 Nigerian presidential election as a result of providing officials with improved information about the functionality of local polling stations.\\" 2012 ;Balkans (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia) Al Jazeera Balkans deployed Ushahidi crisis mapping platform on 5 February 2012 to track the snow/cold emergency in the Balkans. Snjezna oluja nad Balkanom 2013 Kenya Elections Ushahidi helped run the Uchaguzi partnership to monitor the 2013 Kenyan elections. The deployment gathered over 8000 reports, a report \\"Uchaguzi: A Qualitative and Quantitive Analysis of ICTS, Statebuilding, and Peacebuilding in Kenya.\\" showed that 75% of reporters said their report was responded to. 2014 Kenya Ushahidi announced Ping (now called Rollcall) in response to the attacks on Westgate Mall in Nairobi. The software was used to map out all the blood drive center locations in Nairobi and let users quickly identify places to donate, see which blood types were in demand, and identify whether equipment or volunteers were needed at any locations. Among the goals of this map was to help ensure that when the Kenyan population came out to donate blood, they would know which donation centers needed their blood type the most.  2015  Crowd sourced data were extensively used during the relief and rescue operations at Quakemap.org. Kathmandu Living Labs (KLL), a volunteer organization, set up a platform to collect and manage data from crowd using Ushahidi. KLL further managed to conduct first level of verification as well, providing the Nepalese Army with the following details: location, number of affected people, number of death/injured, support requirements, level of urgency, and contact information. The Nepalese army report said that \\"Crowd Sourcing is one of the common approaches to collect information from the public. Although it is not new in the context of disaster management, but during April Earthquake in Nepal, this approach was appropriately used in a matured way. The systematic process defined by Kathmandu Living Labs volunteers marked a path in utilization of crowd sourced data by implementing agency like Nepalese Army.\\"  2016  Ushahidi created USAelectionmonitor.com to monitor the USA 2016 Presidential Election. After the election Ushahidi set up Documenthate.org to monitor the spike in hate crimes against minorities in the USA post election. Ushahidi partnered with journalist and activist Shaun King and non-profit journalism group Propublica. The New Yorker covered the story, saying: \\"Now Shaun King, a writer for the Daily News, is working with the open-source software company Ushahidi to create a map of post-election intimidation. “Thousands of people have emailed me incident reports over the past seven days,” King wrote me in an e-mail. “The team at Ushahidi is helping me go through them, verify them the best we can, catalogue and then map them, then share them.” The aim is to raise awareness of politically motivated violence and help people stay safe, report it to authorities as needed, and create a database of such incidents.\\"  2017  Ushahidi ran the Uchaguzi partnership to monitor the 2017 Kenyan elections, the fourth country-wide election monitoring effort for the organization. Ushahidi integrated a Facebook Messenger bot to allow the 7 million Facebook users in Kenya to report via Messenger. The platform received over 7000 reports on election day. As of 2017, the platform reported that it had been deployed over 125,000 times in over 160 countries, although most of these were for evaluation, training or curiosity. Awards Ushahidi has received several awards in recognition to its effectiveness and creativity, latest being The MacArthur Award. Official blog from Ushahidi The awards received by Ushahidi so far include the following: * The MacArthur Award – 2013 The MacArthur Award * Global Adaptation Index Prize – 2012 Global Adaptation Index Prize, May 2012 * Funding of US$1.4 million from the Omidyar Network Funding from Omidyar 1.4m  Criticism   Sexual harassment allegations  On 9 July 2017, allegations surfaced online of Ushahidi covering up a sexual harassment incident perpetrated by one of the members of their senior leadership. Ushahidi released a statement the next day confirming they were aware of the allegations which were the subject of an ongoing internal inquiry. Former Ushahidi board member and co-founder Ory Okolloh, strongly condemned the laxity with which the board dealt with the issue on 11 Jul saying: “More clarity on steps that have been taken so far and the relevant timelines should be shared and those found culpable either by their action or inaction should resign”. Ushahidi released a second statement on 17 July 2017 detailing the chronology of events showed that the incident occurred on 19 January 2017 and was reported to the board on 4 May 2017, and that on 5 May the accused was placed on temporary leave, given due process, and an investigation was undertaken. After back and forth with both parties' lawyers, the board held an inquiry on 3 July and the accused was alerted of his firing 14 days later on 17 July the date of the statement. Angela Kabari came out publicly on 20 July as the victim in a Medium post detailing a 6-month ordeal and called for the resignation of the entire Ushahidi board that consisted of David Kobia, Erik Hersman, Juliana Rotich and Jenny Stefanotti at the time. She identified Daudi Were, Ushahidi's Executive Director, as the accused. Her statement to the board when she reported the matter included an un-notarized transcript of the recording of the incident and claimed an earlier occurrence the previous year. In her post, she said she encountered 11 other victims some of whom were current employees of the organisation and that the board members were aware of Daudi's misconduct in separate incidents spanning 10 years, however, no others came forward. She castigated the board for lack of support, victim shaming, slander, delays and character attacks. Angela resigned on 28 June citing frustration due to “continual stalling and inaction from the board 55 days after my complaint.” Daudi Were was alerted of his dismissal on 17 July, formally dismissed on 22 July, and Ushahidi released an apology to Angela for the harassment she experienced while working at Ushahidi. Ushahidi staff and staff from Ushahidi related organizations, under the banner \\"Women in Tech Kenya\\", released a statement on 24 Jul that supported Angela's speaking out, condemned Daudi Were's conduct, applauded his dismissal, and supporting the board following due process. The Ushahidi board did not resign and through a series of posts defended their conduct, saying that they followed due process in the pursuit of justice. In a statement released on 28 July, Ushahidi said that due to the legal process, agreed upon by all parties, all communications had to go through the legal representation and called Ms. Kabari's claims that they did not care about her disingenuous for not understanding the neutral position the board undertook in the sexual harassment investigation.

He was a member of the Colombian Communist Party. He worked with the socialist groups under Antonio Garcia and with the United People's Front with the priest, Camilo Torres. He received Haba guerrilla instruction in Cuba and communist countries of Europe. Biography Almarales was one of the founders of the M-19 and representative to the camera from the Socialist Anapo. He participated in stealing weaponry from the North Corner and in terrorist activities in the south of the country. His group recruited guerrillas and supporters in the union sector. Captured in the municipality of Bolivar (Santander) in 1979, Almares was put under house arrest and found guilty by Picota. When he rejoined civilian life, he wrote works on syndicalism and shortly thereafter helped plan the capture of the Dominican Republic. Later, his crimes were pardoned during the government of Belisario Betancur. When Carlos Toledo Plata was assassinated in 1984 in Bucaramanga, Almares organized the memorial service in Romero park, in front of the central cemetery of that city, as an insult to then-president Belisario Betancur and the Time newspaper. His group recruited young people for the armed resistance movement. Shortly thereafter, he moved to the Valley of the Cauca and collaborated with the M-19 to protect around Cali. In a popular action by the Patriotic Union (Colombia) in the Plaza de Bolivar of Bogota, Almarales spoke rudely comparing the press to a \\"sewer\\", referring to President Betancur, minister of Government Jaime Castro and the Colombian conservative group. On August 24th, 1984 he arranged a ceasefire between his group and the government of President Betancur. In front of all the television networks, he declared: \\"As of today, not a drop of blood was spilled by the subversives.\\" A radical and capable participant in negotiations, Almarales participated in the peace process. Later he was buried alongside Luis Otero Cifuentes and Alfonso Jacquin. There are two versions of his death: #Most well-known: he committed suicide in the Palace with the hostages. #He was escorted by the military to the Florero House in Bogota where he was tortured and assassinated in the Usaquén Escuela de Caballeria and secretly buried in the Palace with the others similarly killed.

Released in January 1985 as the lead single from second studio album, Strange Animal, it reached number five in Canada. Gowan refers to it as one of his signature songs. Background In a 2015 interview with Huffington Post Canada, Gowan stated that his inspiration for the song was a Kingston Penitentiary prison cell exhibit at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) to represent the Canadian penal system. The empty cell was attended by a single guard, with whom Gowan had a conversation after sitting in the cell alone for a while. The discussion about recidivist inmates led to the creation of the song. Longevity In April 1999, Gowan received a call from a member of the band Styx, which was interested in inviting him to fill in for Dennis DeYoung, who refused to perform for concerts. He met the band at the house of Tommy Shaw, where they performed a few songs, the first of which was \\"A Criminal Mind\\". The band suggested to make it \\"a Styx song\\". After the band's acrimonious split with DeYoung Gowan was asked to become a permanent member. He agreed, and they performed their first concert together in Branson, Missouri later in 1999. The song appeared on the album Styx World: Live 2001. \\"A Criminal Mind\\" is still on the band's tour set list and is played at most Canadian concerts. This has led to increased awareness of Gowan's musical repertoire amongst Styx fans. As a result, \\"A Criminal Mind\\" and other songs in his repertoire, including \\"Moonlight Desires\\", \\"All The Lovers in the World\\", \\"(You're A) Strange Animal\\", and \\"Guerrilla Soldier\\", received increased airplay on Boom FM, Q107, and other Toronto radio stations. In 2014, Gowan received three \\"Classic Music Award\\" from the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada for the songs \\"A Criminal Mind\\", \\"Dancing on My Own Ground\\" and \\"(You're A) Strange Animal\\" each having achieved 100,000 radio airplays throughout Canada since their release. Gowan has previously stated he became aware of the increased airplay because of the royalties cheques he receives. In 2018, \\"A Criminal Mind\\" was certified as a Platinum Single in Canada, surpassing a combined 80,000 physical 7\\", 12\\" single and digital downloaded units sold. Gowan was presented with the plaque on stage during a concert at Caesars Windsor in Windsor. Music video Upon completion of recording for the album, Gowan collaborated with videographer Rob Quartly to create a music video for the song. They spent two months together, during which they created \\"a ground-breaking video\\" with a unique treatment according to Keith Sharp, as well as a music video for the song \\"(You're A) Strange Animal\\". In an interview with Nick Krewen of Music Express magazine, Gowan stated that \\"videos can be powerful but they are so misused\\" and that he was \\"really happy\\" with the result for this video. Music critic John Griffin of The Gazette referred to as an \\"amazing video\\". It won the Juno Award for Best Video at the 1985 Juno Awards. Other nominees included the video for \\"(You're A) Strange Animal\\" from the same album, also produced by Quartly, and a third video produced by Quartly, for the song \\"Never Surrender\\" by Corey Hart. That year, the song was nominated for the Juno Award for Single of the Year, which was won by Corey Hart for \\"Never Surrender\\". Don Oates, vice president of sales and marketing for Columbia Records, stated that the music video was pivotal in the song receiving airplay in Canada. In an article in The Gazette, Martin Siberok stated that \\"the role of video\\" was key to the song appearing on record charts. Kirk LaPointe of Billboard magazine stated that Gowan was the \\"clearest beneficiary\\" of the existence of MuchMusic (which had launched in September 1984) as the album Strange Animal achieved double platinum status and Gowan emerged as a \\"hit domestic artist\\". In addition, Gowan appeared on a spot for the channel to emphasize that his song is about a criminal mind that needs understanding, while a criminal act is another matter entirely.Despite his domestic success and the album's United States release in May 1985, the song received little airplay in the United States.

Background and family Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, uncle of Andronikos Kontostephanos Born ca. 1132/33, Andronikos Kontostephanos was the third and youngest son of Stephen Kontostephanos, who held the title panhypersebastos and the rank of megas doux, and the 'purple- born' princess Anna Komnene, daughter of Emperor John II Komnenos (reigned 1118–43) and his empress Irene of Hungary; he was thus the nephew of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–80). Andronikos had two older brothers, John and Alexios, and a sister, Irene. The Kontostephanoi were an aristocratic Byzantine family that rose to occupy a prominent place at the heart of Byzantine politics and power through their intermarrying with the imperial house of the Komnenoi. Andronikos himself is believed to have married, ca. 1150, an unnamed member of the Doukas family, another clan with imperial connections. The couple had at least five sons, and possibly daughters, although none is mentioned in the sources. Military career Andronikos was the leading Byzantine military figure during the reign of his uncle, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. Like his father he was appointed to the office of megas doux, the commander-in-chief of the Byzantine navy and governor of the provinces of Hellas, the Peloponnese and Crete. However, his greatest success was as a general rather than as an admiral. At some point, Andronikos was also appointed commander of the Varangian Guard.John Kinnamos, 97.19. Andronikos is first mentioned during the siege of Corfu in the winter of 1148/49. The Byzantine forces, led by his father Stephen, were attempting to expel the Normans of the Kingdom of Sicily who held the city. Andronikos' father was killed during the siege in early 1149, dying in his son's arms. John Kinnamos, 96.22-98.4; Angold, p. 170. The command of the Byzantine forces in Corfu was eventually taken over by the megas domestikos John Axuch who starved the Norman garrison into evacuating the island. The French scholar Rodolphe Guilland erroneously placed Andronikos in partial command of an expedition to Cilicia against Raymond of Poitiers in 1144/45, but the Belgian historian Henri Grégoire determined that this was a different person, namely his uncle and namesake Andronikos Kontostephanos.  Wars with Hungary and the Battle of Sirmium  Andronikos next appears, along with his brother Alexios, in the course of Manuel I's attempts to settle the dynastic succession in the Kingdom of Hungary in his favour after the death of King Géza II in 1161. Manuel supported his brothers, Ladislaus II and later Stephen IV, as his successors; both had spent time at the Byzantine court as exiles, and Stephen IV had even married Manuel's niece Maria Komnene (who was also the first cousin of the Kontostephanoi brothers). This was opposed by Géza's eldest son, Stephen III, who in 1162 expelled Stephen IV from the country. A prolonged conflict ensued, not only over the succession, but also over possession of Dalmatia and the region around Sirmium, disputed among the two realms. In 1164, Stephen IV invaded Hungary on his own account, but had to be rescued by an army under Andronikos. Soon after, he was poisoned by agents of his nephew. Stephen IV's death transformed the conflict into a plain Byzantine–Hungarian war over Sirmium and Dalmatia; both areas were re-occupied by the Hungarians in 1166, after achieving major successes against the imperial forces. In response, Manuel I prepared a major counter-attack in 1167, appointing Andronikos, who months before had been named megas doux, commander-in-chief of the Byzantine navy, as the leader of the campaign, although he also gave him detailed instructions for the campaign. The Hungarian army, commanded by the palatine Denis, met the Byzantine army near Zemun on the feast day of St. Procopius, 8 July 1167. As the battle was about to begin, according to Niketas Choniates Andronikos received a message from Manuel, who forbade the battle to take place on that day due to unfavourable astrological omens. Andronikos ignored the order and kept it secret from his officers. The ensuing Battle of Sirmium resulted in \\"the most spectacular military victory [...] during Manuel's reign\\" (Paul Magdalino), thanks in large part to the crucial intervention of the reserves under Andronikos himself. The victory sealed Byzantine control over the region around Sirmium, plus all of Bosnia, Dalmatia and the area south of the Krka River. Following the victory Manuel celebrated a triumphal entry into Constantinople with Andronikos Kontostephanos riding by his side.  Invasion of Egypt and the war with Venice  Upper register: Manuel and the envoys of Amalric, an embassy which resulted in the despatch of the Byzantine force under Kontostephanos to invade Egypt. Lower register: arrival of the crusaders in Egypt (William of Tyre's Historia). In 1169, Andronikos was appointed commander of a fleet carrying a Byzantine army to invade Fatimid Egypt in alliance with the forces of Amalric, King of Jerusalem, in what was to be the last of a series of Crusader invasions of Egypt. The campaign, planned between the two Christian monarchs possibly since the marriage of Amalric with Manuel's great-niece Maria in 1167, would not only end in failure, but also lead to the establishment of the energetic Saladin in the place of the moribund Fatimid government as ruler of Egypt, in what would prove a major turning-point of the Crusades. Manuel mobilized a large force, well beyond what he was obliged, according to the chronicler William of Tyre: 150 galleys, sixty horse-carriers and a dozen dromons specially constructed to carry siege engines. The fleet set sail from the port of Melibotos in the Dardanelles on 8 July 1169. After defeating a small Egyptian scouting squadron near Cyprus, Kontostephanos arrived at Tyre and Acre in late September to find that Amalric had undertaken no preparations whatsoever. The delays on the part of the Crusaders infuriated Kontostephanos and sow mistrust among the ostensible allies. It was not until mid-October that the combined armies and fleets set forth, arriving at Damietta two weeks later. The Christians delayed three days in attacking the city, allowing Saladin to hastily move in troops and supplies. The siege was prosecuted with vigour on both sides, with Kontostephanos and his men constructing huge siege towers, but the besiegers were hampered by the growing mistrust between Byzantines and Crusaders, especially as the Byzantines' supplies dwindled, and Amalric refused to share his own with them but sold them at exorbitant prices. Exasperated by the dragging-on of the siege and the suffering of his troops, Kontostephanos once again disobeyed Manuel's instructions ordering him to obey Amalric in all things, and launched with his troops a final attack on the city. As the Byzantines were about to storm the walls, Amalric stopped them by announcing that a negotiated surrender of Damietta had just taken place. The discipline and cohesion of the Byzantine army almost instantly disintegrated after the news of the peace deal were announced, with troops burning the engines and boarding the ships in groups without order. Left with only six ships, Kontostephanos accompanied Amalric back to Palestine, returning home with part of his army by land through the crusader states of the Levant, while about half of the Byzantine ships that had sailed from Damietta was lost in a series of storms on its return journey, with the last ships arriving in their home ports only in late spring 1170. On 12 March 1171, as the result of increasingly divergent interests between Byzantium and the Republic of Venice, and in an attempt to curtail the Venetians' growing economic presence in his realm, Manuel imprisoned all Venetians in the Empire and confiscated all of their property. Venice retaliated by outfitting a fleet of 120 ships under Doge Vitale II Michele. After attacking and capturing the Dalmatian cities under Byzantine control, the Venetians landed in the island of Euboea but were expelled by imperial troops, and then occupied the island of Chios to spend the winter. The Venetians sent envoys to negotiate, but Manuel allowed them to drag on until his own counterstroke, 150 ships under Kontostephanos' command, was ready. In the meantime, the Venetians suffered of disease on Chios. In April 1172, Kontostephanos set sail, but the Venetians were forewarned by the astrologer Aaron Isaakios, one of Manuel's confidantes, and hastily abandoned Chios. Kontostephanos pursued them, but while the Venetians sailed north, raiding the islands of Thasos, Lesbos and Skyros, he assumed they would sail back westwards, and directed his fleet to Cape Malea. Learning of the Venetians' true whereabouts, he turned back north, but although he managed to capture or sink several stragglers, he was unable to bring the main Venetian fleet to battle. Doge Vitale II returned his fleet to Venice on 28 May, but the losses suffered and the failure to gain any concrete objective led to his lynching by the angry mob.  Battle of Myriokephalon and second expedition against Egypt  Manuel attacked the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm in 1176, with the intention of taking its capital, Konya, and destroying Turkish power in Anatolia. The Seljuk sultan Kilij Arslan II ambushed Manuel’s impressively large army as it moved through the pass of Tivritze in mountainous border region between the two states. In the ensuing Battle of Myriokephalon parts of the Byzantine force were very badly mauled; however, Andronikos Kontostephanos managed to get his division, bringing up the rear, through the pass with few casualties. He is credited with having persuaded his uncle the emperor, whose confidence had been severely shaken, to remain with his troops following the defeat. Through his influence with the emperor he was instrumental in facilitating the peaceful withdrawal of the Byzantine forces.Choniates, pp. 105-106; Angold, pp. 192-193; Finlay, pp. 192-195. The following year (1177), Andronikos led a fleet of 150 ships in another attempt to conquer Egypt, but he returned home after landing at Acre. He was dissuaded from continuing with the expedition by the refusal of Count Philip of Flanders, and many important nobles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, to actively co-operate with the Byzantine force.Harris p. 109 Political intrigues and an unfortunate fate Following the death of Manuel in 1180 the succession fell to his son Alexios II Komnenos. As Alexios was a child, power devolved on his mother, the empress Maria of Antioch. Her rule proved very unpopular, especially with the aristocracy who resented her Latin (Western) origins. When Manuel’s cousin Andronikos Komnenos made a bid for power in 1182 the megas doux Andronikos Kontostephanos, together with the general Andronikos Angelos, played a key role in allowing his forces to enter Constantinople. However, once in power, Andronikos Komnenos proved that he had a tyrannical nature and a vehement desire to break the power and influence of the Byzantine aristocratic families. Kontostephanos and Angelos reacted by plotting to overthrow Andronikos. The plot was discovered and Andronikos Kontostephanos was captured, whilst Angelos escaped. The megas doux Andronikos and his four sons were punished with blinding.Angold, p. 267; Finlay p. 209. Andronikos’ later fate is unknown. Legacy Due to his exploits, Andronikos is one of the few figures given heroic status in the works of the Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates.Magdalino, p. 13.

Both lines are gauge. History The line to Nová Bystřice was opened on 1 November 1897 and the line to Obrataň followed on 24 December 1906. Both lines were originally operated with steam locomotives and there were engine sheds at Jindřichův Hradec, Kamenice nad Lipou, Nova Bystřice und Obrataň. Soon after opening a goods service with roll-blocks was established. Following the founding of Czechoslovakia the railway became part of ČSD in 1924 and during World War II they came under the control of the Deutsche Reichsbahn In 1998 both lines were privatised and they are now owned and operated by JHMD. Route Near Jindřichův Hradec there is a section of dual gauge track on the České dráhy line between Veselí nad Lužnicí and Jihlava. The maximum permitted speed today is and the steepest gradient is 2.6% near Kamenice nad Lipou. Current operations Most trains consist of a diesel locomotive and one carriage. During the summer steam trains with historic carriages are operated for tourists. Rolling stock Locomotives U 37 locomotive in Jindřichův Hradec M 27 railcar and T 47 diesel locomotive Maintenance base in Jindřichův Hradec For the opening of the line to Nova Bystřice there were three 0-6-2 steam locomotives, like those used on the Murtalbahn. These were classified as class U (after Unzmarkt on the Murtalbahn) by the kkStB and were numbered U.1 - U.3. After the opening of the line to Obrataň in 1906 two more class U locomotives were acquired and numbered U.33 and U.34. In 1908 another locomotive, numbered U.41, was also acquired. After World War I only U.1, U.34 and U.41 remained in Jindřichův Hradec and in 1924 when ČSD took over the railway they were reclassified as U 37 and renumbered U 37.001, U 37.005 and U 37.006. ČSD bought three class U 47 Mallet locomotives and rented a further two identical locomotives for use on the lines. A U 37 and a U 47 are used on the railway today for tourist trains. In addition to these a Romanian Reșița locomotive, numbered U 46.001 by JHMD, and a Polish Px48, now numbered U46.101, have been bought by JHMD for tourist trains. Since 1955 traffic has mainly been handled by ČSD class T 47.0 diesel locomotives . In the 1970s more of these locomotives were transferred to Jindřichův Hradec when the Frýdlant–Heřmanice and Ružomberok–Korytnica narrow gauge railways were closed. A PKP class Lxd2 locomotive, now numbered T 48.001, and a PKP class MBxd2, now numbered M 27.001, are also in use by JHMD. Railcars Class 805.9 Railcar From 1929 two ČSD class M 11.0 railcars, which were narrow gauge versions ČSD Class M 120.4, were introduced. In 1939 two further railcars, this time ČSD class M 21.0 were acquired. Railcar services continued until shortly after World War II. Railcar M 21.004 is currently at Čierny Balog on the Čierny Hron Railway. Four modernised 805.9 railcars have been obtained to run services. Carriages Two-axled carriage in the museum train At first two-axled carriages manufactured by Ringhoffer in Prague were used. In the 1960s several four-axled carriages originally from Saxony were brought to Jindřichův Hradec from the Frýdlant-Heřmanice Railway, where they had been used since 1945. These carriages remained in use until the end of the 1970s. The class Balm/u carriages in use today were manufactured by ČKD in the 1960s. When they were built these were modern carriages with wooden benches, oil heating, fluorescent lights and toilets. In the 1980s the last remaining two-axled carriages were used to form a museum train, which is used in summer for the tourist steam trains. Goods wagons Goods traffic was originally carried in two-axled goods wagons, most of which were built by the Grazer Wagen- und Waggonfabrik AG (Graz Wagon Factory). Roll-blocks were introduced in 1906 and are still used today. The newest roll-blocks were built by Poprad Wagon Factory in the 1980s.

Holmenkolbanen opened the Holmenkoll Line in 1898, and expanded it to become the first Nordic underground railway in 1928. The company took over operations of the Smestad Line in 1933, the Sognsvann Line in 1934. The company was merged into Oslo Sporveier in 1992. History Sporveismuseet in Oslo. The company was founded on 17 February 1896 by H. M. Heyerdahl and Albert Fenger Krog as the leading executives. The goal was to build a suburban tramway—the Holmenkoll Line—from the Holmenkollen neighborhood in northwestern Oslo to the end of the street tramway at Majorstuen. The line opened first to Besserud (at the time called Holmenkolen) on 31 May 1898 and then to Frognerseteren on 15 May 1916. The second part of the line was constructed by its subsidiary A/S Tryvandsbanen, and included a single track cargo line to Tryvandshøiden. It was established on 4 January 1912 and disestablished on 1 January 1920. Holmenkolbane suburban tram car at Nationaltheatret station in 1928 To offer direct services into the city center, the company started the construction Common Tunnel (') to the underground Nationaltheatret Station. Construction started in 1912, but had to stop in October 1914 after about thirty properties had received massive damage from the construction; some even had to be razed. A settlement was not reached until 1925, and construction started again in 1926, with the line opening on 28 June 1928. However, the real estate owners were not satisfied with the settlement and it ended in court, with the property owners gaining additional claims. The cost of the tunnel was too high for the company to bear, and by 1932 it could not handle its interest. To save the company, the municipal owned Akersbanerne agreed to a merger between A/S Holmenkolbanen and two of Akersbanerne's three lines—the Smestad Line and the under construction Sognsvann Line that would both share the tunnel into the center, with the transaction taking place on 16 November 1933. In 1942 the Kolsås Line was rebuilt to terminate through the Smestad Line, and in 1944 the owner Bærumsbanen was bought by Oslo Sporveier. After the municipal merger between Aker and Oslo on 1 January 1948, the two municipal tram companies Akersbanerne and Oslo Sporveier merged; due to this the operation of all the four western lines were collected in A/S Holmenkolbanen. Operation was transferred to Oslo Sporveier on 1 August 1975, after it had bought almost all the shares in the company, and it had been delisted from the Oslo Stock Exchange. A/S Holmenkolbanen remained a separate company until 6 May 1992, when it was fully merged with Oslo Sporveier.  Historic gallery  1421 Smestad.

It was based on the Ace motorcycle, which Indian bought as part of the assets of the Ace Motor Corporation in 1927. For 1940, the Four frame was modified to include plunger rear suspension. In the same year, all Indian models were restyled with large, decorative fenders. The Four was discontinued with the rest of civilian production in 1942 and was not returned to production after World War II ended. History 1928 Indian 402 Indian purchased the ownership of the name, rights, and production facilities of the Ace Motor Corporation in 1927. Production was moved to Springfield and the motorcycle was marketed as the Indian Ace for one year. In 1928, the Indian Ace was replaced by the Indian 401, a development of the Ace designed by Arthur O. Lemon, former Chief Engineer at Ace, who was employed by Indian when they bought Ace. The Ace's leading-link forks and central coil spring were replaced by Indian's trailing-link forks and quarter-elliptic leaf spring. IOE \\"pockets\\" By 1929, the Indian 402 would have a stronger twin-downtube frame based on that of the 101 Scout and a sturdier five-bearing crankshaft than the Ace, which had a three-bearing crankshaft. Despite the low demand for luxury motorcycles during the Great Depression, Indian not only continued production of the Four, but continued to develop the motorcycle. One of the less popular versions of the Four was the \\"upside down\\" engine on the 1936-1937 models. While earlier (and later) Fours had inlet-over-exhaust (IOE) cylinder heads with overhead inlet valves and side exhaust valves, the 1936-1937 Indian Four had a unique EOI cylinder head, with the positions reversed. In theory, this would improve fuel vaporization, and the new engine was more powerful. However, the new system made the cylinder head, and the rider's inseam, very hot. This, along with an exhaust valvetrain that required frequent adjustment, caused sales to drop. The addition of dual carburetors in 1937 did not revive interest. The design was returned to the original configuration in 1938. 1940 Indian Four (Model 440), with plunger rear suspension and large fenders For 1940, the Four frame was modified to include plunger rear suspension. In the same year, all Indian models were restyled with large, decorative fenders. In 1941, the 18-inch wheels of previous models were replaced with 16-inch wheels with balloon tires. The Indian Four was discontinued in 1942. Legacy Recognition of the historical significance of the 1940 four-cylinder model was made with an August 2006 United States Postal Service 39-cent stamp issue, part of a four panel set entitled American Motorcycles.

Built as a chapel of ease, it became one of Brighton's most important churches, gaining its own parish and becoming closely associated with the Prince Regent and fashionable Regency-era society. It remains an active church. History In the 18th century, Brighton was a small town based on a declining fishing industry and still suffering the effects of damage caused by the Great Storm of 1703. Its population in the middle of the century was approximately 2,000. Its fortunes improved after a doctor from nearby Lewes, Richard Russell, wrote a treatise encouraging the use of seawater as a cure for illness, in particular glandular swellings. He recommended bathing in the sea and drinking the water at Brighton. This form of medical therapy became popular, and helped make the town a fashionable place to visit.John H. Farrant, 'Russell, Richard (1687–1759)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2005, (subscription required for online access). Retrieved 8 August 2008. Brighton became increasingly popular throughout the rest of the century, but received its next significant boost when the Prince Regent, son of King George III, made his first visit in 1783. By 1786 he had a home in the town—a rented farmhouse near the Old Steine, inland from the coast—and he later commissioned the architect John Nash to build a palace, the Royal Pavilion, for him on the site. The Prince was an infrequent churchgoer, and Brighton's only Anglican church, St Nicholas, was a long way from his home and up a steep hill. Furthermore, the ever-increasing number of visitors and residents caused overcrowding in the church. In 1789 the new Vicar of Brighton, Revd Thomas Hudson, decided to resolve these problems by building a new chapel near the Prince's house. He hoped to encourage the Prince to attend, and thereby worship more often than he had in the past, and considered that a more central chapel would relieve the pressure on the parish church. The Prince was happy with the arrangement, agreeing to rent a pew and lay the foundation stone. A ceremony took place on 25 November 1793 at the corner of North Street and the newly built and named Prince's Place. Construction work, overseen by a builder named Bodle and to the design of London-based architect Thomas Saunders, lasted a year. The Prince and his wife of four months, Caroline of Brunswick, attended the inaugural service on 3 August 1795. Revd Hudson owned and ran the chapel himself at first, opening it only during the peak seasons when Brighton was at its busiest. In 1803 it became the official chapel of ease to St Nicholas Church when he obtained a private Act of Parliament formalising this. Among other things, this Act allowed Hudson, in his position as Vicar of Brighton, and his successors in that role, to appoint a perpetual curate for the chapel, and to fund a stipend of £115 (at 1803 prices) by the rental of pews. Of the pew spaces in the church, only 224 had to be provided free—the others could be \\"auctioned\\"—and visitors with no pew of their own could be charged an admission fee of 1/-. In return, the curate's responsibilities included paying for a clerk and the sacramental bread and wine used at Communion, and funding maintenance of the building. Many later chapels of ease in Brighton and Hove had similar Acts passed for them, imposing similar conditions. Holy Trinity Church came close on three occasions to being included within the Chapel Royal's parish; when it closed, its congregation transferred to the Chapel Royal. Soon after becoming a formal chapel of ease, the Chapel Royal was consecrated by the Bishop of Chichester, John Buckner. However, by that date (16 August 1803), the Prince Regent was no longer worshipping there. His attendance became infrequent soon after the chapel was built, and he eventually stopped worshipping there when a sermon, said to have been on the topic of immorality, offended him. (Sources differ on who preached the sermon, thought to have been entitled \\"Thou art the man\\".) Other members of the Royal Family occasionally visited the chapel later, however; the last recorded attendance was by Princess Augusta Sophia, the Prince Regent's sister, in 1840. Later in the 19th century, two future British Prime Ministers were regular worshippers at the chapel. William Ewart Gladstone attended whenever he visited Brighton, and Winston Churchill attended between 1883 and 1885 when he was a pupil at a local school. The ownership of the chapel passed to various curates until Revd Thomas Trocke, formerly of St Nicholas Church, became perpetual curate in 1834. He stayed until his retirement in 1875, seeing the chapel taking charge of its own district for the first time in 1873 when the parish structure in Brighton was reorganised. The building was closed for eight months in 1876 and 1877 for internal structural repairs and reordering. Architect Arthur Blomfield was responsible for the changes, which cost £2,700. Soon afterwards, in 1880, demolition of houses facing North Street revealed the southern face of the chapel for the first time: until then, only the east elevation (facing Prince's Place) could be seen. Blomfield produced a design for a completely new exterior, including a tower in the southeast corner at the junction of the two streets. The work was completed in two parts—the new south face first, then the remodelled east elevation in 1896—and cost £1,200. The chapel gained its own full parish for the first time in 1896, at which point the ownership of the church was transferred to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. By this time, however, the residential population of central Brighton was declining rapidly as the streets making up the parish became more commerce– and retail–focused. Three proposals had been made by 1930 to incorporate the unparished Holy Trinity Church in nearby Ship Street into the Chapel Royal's parish, in order to expand it and make it more viable. These were all resisted, however, and by the mid-20th century the local population was so low that the parish was instead merged with that of St Peter's Church at the top of Old Steine. Legally, this took effect from 25 July 1978 by means of an Order in Council. The Chapel Royal again became a separate parish in July 2009 after the legal redundancy of St. Peters Church. Services became irregular, and one aisle of the chapel was converted into a Christian bookshop. However, the closure of the Holy Trinity church in 1984 resulted in additional services being provided for the displaced congregation, and a regular schedule of services is now in operation. Alterations and a reconfiguration of the church interior in the bicentennial year (1995) completed the transition from a parish church, focusing on the population of a specific locality, to a \\"city church\\" open to the whole community and meeting the spiritual needs of the permanent and transient population of Brighton. Architecture The original chapel was a stuccoed building in a broadly Classical style, with rounded sash windows and a pediment with the Prince's coat of arms. A row of Doric columns flanked the entrance. Inside there were galleries on each wall, supported by decorated columns. The gallery above the altar contained the organ, and there was a tall, highly decorated pulpit. The alterations of 1876–1877 removed the gallery above the altar and added a chancel, separated from the nave by an iron rood screen, new pulpit and lectern. The rebuilding of the exterior in 1882–1883 (south elevation) and 1896 (east elevation), prompted by the demolition of buildings adjacent to the south side of the chapel to allow North Street to be widened, involved replacing the stucco with red brick, enlarging the pediment and giving the new south elevation a similar appearance. It is neither as tall nor as long as the east side (facing Prince's Place), and has no pediment, but was otherwise very similar until the alterations of 1995 changed the entrance area and added more glass to make more of the interior visible from the street. The most significant feature of Arthur Blomfield's work on the exterior was the tall, red-brick clock tower. This has some flintwork and a hipped slate roof. The tower has four clock faces, each in a terracotta insert. The chapel today The main weekly service at the Chapel Royal is held on Sundays at 10.00am. Other services are held on Saturdays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. There has been a long musical tradition at the chapel; concerts have been held right from the beginning, and continue to be a regular feature, usually on Tuesdays. A coffee shop, run jointly by parishioners from the Chapel Royal and St Peter's Church on behalf of local charities, operates every Saturday. The building is also a venue for regular Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, as part of the chapel's pastoral responsibility to help people in the city who face difficulties in their lives. The chapel was listed at Grade II* on 30 July 1992. As of February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. External conservation repairs Repairs were carried out in 2012 by HMDW Architects and PAYE Stonework, due to unsafe, falling brickwork, particularly due to Freeze- thaw erosion in the cold winter of 2009. The scope of work included terracotta replacement across the south elevation and tower, areas of repointing in lime mortar, replacement of steel lintels in the south elevation and the installation of a lightning conductor. The conservation project received the King of Prussia Gold Medal in 2012.

Use of the knife demanded a high level of skill and mastery, and was eventually supplanted by modifications of cataract surgery through the Kelman phacoemulsification technique that emphasized a small incision. History Von Graefe knife Until the acceptability of the keratome-and-scissors method after the early 1940s, an essential part of cataract surgery was mastery of the von Graefe knife. With increased popularity of sutures—especially pre- placed scleral groove (McLean) sutures, it became difficult for the occasional surgeon to develop the skill required to make an acceptable von Graefe incision. If the surgeon was not ambidextrous, the use of the von Graefe knife might be even more difficult with the non-dominant hand. With his right hand, he introduced the knife into the anterior chamber of the right eye at 9. He would then perforate the limbal area at 3. An upward sweep was then made to complete the incision. Most frequently, there was no conjunctival flap. However, some especially skilled eye surgeons formed a conjunctival flap as they were completing the upward sweep. Normally, the ambidextrous von Graefe surgeon would switch to his left hand so that he could enter the left eye at 3 and exit at 9. If he used his dominant right hand for the left eye, the nose became an impediment when he attempted to enter the eye at 9 and attempted to counter perforate at 3. Often, poor results could have been prevented by the use of post-placed sutures. Unfortunately, in the early years of cataract surgery, suitable sutures and needles were not in the armamentarium of many cataract surgeons. In the 1980s, with the ever-increasing popularity of the Kelman phacoemulsification technique that emphasized a small incision and extra-capsular cataract extraction (ECCE), the keratome-and-scissors, large incision surgery technique combined with intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) became obsolete, although the use of the von Graefe knife still continued in India. Sutures had limited if any use in routine cataract surgery for the high-volume most experienced and skilled eye surgeons in the world. Their experience and skill resulted in the outstanding rural cataract camps so common in India. Formally trained Indian ophthalmologists were and are among the deftest in the use of the von Graefe knife. Ultraviolet-rich India with its vast rural and underclass population afflicted with nutritional eye diseases combined with a multitude of public health problems was and still is the “Land of Eye Disease and Eye Surgery“. Few Western ophthalmologists have the daily volume of eye pathology and eye surgery that faces their Indian counterparts. It is possible for an eye to recover from an intracapsular cataract operation that entailed a 170 to 180 degree superior corneal or limbal incision without the closure of the incisional wound by means of sutures. Recovery was significantly dependent on the quality of a well-made von Graefe knife incision with a well-honed and well-maintained knife. Unlike keratome-and-scissors incision, a well-performed von Graefe knife maneuver produced a corneal or limbal incision with well-opposed edges that resulted in rapid healing and a scar that was almost invisible to the naked eye. However, a poorly made von Graefe knife incision could lead to horrendous disasters. Dr. Charles Kelman’s revolutionary modifications of cataract surgery through phacoemulsification eliminated the use of the von Graefe knife—a bête noire for many earlier aspirants seeking to be skilled cataract surgeons.

Mynors, was an English classicist, textual critic, and medievalist who held the senior chair of Latin at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. He is most renowned for his contribution to the study of manuscripts, from which most classical texts are reconstructed. Mynors' academic career spanned most of the 20th century and straddled both of England's two oldest universities. Having been educated at Eton College, he read Classics at Balliol College, Oxford and spent the early stages of his academic career as a fellow of the college. He later served as the Kennedy Professor of Latin at Cambridge from 1944 to 1953 and as the Corpus Christi Professor of Latin at Oxford from 1953 to 1970. He died in a car accident on the way to his country residence in 1989. At the time of his death in 1989, Mynors had earned a reputation as one of Britain's foremost classicists. (subscription required) An expert on palaeography, he has been credited with unravelling a number of highly complex manuscript relationships in his catalogues of the Balliol and Durham Cathedral libraries. However, his best known publications are critical editions of the works of Vergil, Catullus, and Pliny the Younger. The final accomplishment of his lengthy career was a comprehensive commentary on Vergil's Georgics. In addition to honorary degrees and fellowships from various institutions, Mynors was knighted for his service to classical scholarship in 1963. Early life and secondary education Mynors was born into a family of gentry in the south-west of England. The Mynors family had owned the estate of Treago Castle since the 16th century and Mynors would reside there in his later life. His mother was Margery Musgrave, and his father, Aubrey Baskerville Mynors, was an Anglican clergyman and rector of Langley Burrell in Wiltshire, who in 1908 had been secretary to the Pan-Anglican Congress. Among his four siblings was his identical twin brother Humphrey Mynors, who went on to become Deputy Governor of the Bank of England. The brothers shared a close friendship and lived together in their ancestral home after Roger's retirement. Humphrey died just months before his brother's death in 1989. He attended Summer Fields School in Oxford, and from 1916, attended Eton College as a scholar. At Eton, he was part of a generation of pupils that included the historian Steven Runciman and the author George Orwell. His precocious interest in Latin Literature and its transmission was fostered by the encouragement of two of his teachers, Cyril Alington and M. R. James. Alington in particular became an influential mentor and friend since he shared with Mynors a fascination for the manuscript traditions of medieval Europe Academic career Balliol College, Oxford In 1922, Mynors won an exhibition to study classics at Balliol College, Oxford. Sharing the college with the literary critic Cyril Connolly, musicologist Jack Westrup, the future Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, Walter Fraser Oakeshott, and the historian Richard Pares, he experienced a highly successful time as an undergraduate. Graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1926, he won the Hertford, Craven, and Derby scholarships. He then was elected to a fellowship at the same college and became a tutor in Classics. In 1935 he was elevated to a University Lecturership. At the time of his university appointment, much of Mynors' teaching was dedicated to the poet Vergil, whose complete works he would edit over the course of the following decades. Treago Castle, the Mynors family's country residence His tenure at Oxford University saw the beginning of his comprehensive work on medieval manuscripts. From the late 1920s onwards, Mynors was drawn more to matters of codicology than to purely classical questions. He prepared an edition of the 6th century scholar Cassiodorus, for which he travelled extensively to continental Europe; a critical edition was published in 1937. In 1929, he was appointed librarian of Balliol College. This position gave impetus to create a catalogue of the college's medieval manuscripts. A similar project, a catalogue of the manuscripts housed at Durham Cathedral, was compiled in the 1930s. Mynors' interest in codicology gave rise to a close co-operation with the medievalists Richard William Hunt and Neil Ripley Ker. In 1936, near the end of his tenure at Balliol, Mynors made the acquaintance of Eduard Fraenkel, who had been elected to a chair of Latin at Oxford. Having relocated to England because of the increasing discrimination of German Jews, Fraenkel was a preeminent exponent of Germany's scholarly tradition. His influence contributed to Mynors' transformation from a gentleman-scholar to a professional critic of Latin texts. Since the two men maintained a close friendship, Mynors became well placed to exhibit the virtues of both the British and the German tradition in his academic work. Mynors spent the winter of 1938 as a visiting scholar at Harvard University. In 1940, after a brief return to Balliol, British involvement in the Second World War led to his being employed at the Exchange Control Department of the Treasury. At Balliol, Mynors taught from 1926 until 1944, a time during which he taught many future scholars, including the Wittgenstein expert David Pears. Pembroke College, Cambridge In 1944, encouraged by Fraenkel, Mynors took up an offer to assume the Kennedy Professorship of Latin at the University of Cambridge. He also became a fellow of Pembroke College. The move to Cambridge meant a significant advance of his academic career, but he soon came to contemplate a return to Oxford. In 1949 he applied unsuccessfully to become master of Balliol College, but the historian David Keir was elected in his stead. In 1945, shortly after moving to Cambridge, he married Lavinia Alington, daughter of his former teacher and Eton headmaster Cyril Alington. They did not have any children. His post at Cambridge caused changes to Mynors' profile as an academic. His duties at Balliol had centred on the supervision of undergraduates, while he was free to focus on palaeographical topics in his research. At Cambridge, Mynors was required to lecture extensively on Latin literature and to supervise research students, a task of which he had little experience. The duties of his university post left little time to get involved in the activities of the college, which led Mynors to regret his departure from Oxford, going so far as to describe the decision as a \\"fundamental error\\" in a personal letter. Although his post was chiefly that of a Latinist, his involvement in the publication of medieval texts intensified during the 1940s. After he was approached by V. H. Galbraith, a historian of the Middle Ages, Mynors became an editor on Nelson's Medieval Texts series in 1946. Working on the series in several roles, he served as the principal editor of editions of Walter Map's De nugis curialium and of Bede's Ecclesiastical History. Corpus Christi College, Oxford In 1953, Mynors was appointed Corpus Christi Professor of Latin and could thus return to his alma mater to succeed Eduard Fraenkel. At the time, there was no precedent for such a move. Most of his work as an editor of Latin texts took place during this second period at Oxford. Working for the Oxford Classical Texts series, he produced critical editions of the complete works of Catullus (1958) and Vergil (1969), and of Pliny the Younger's Epistulae (1963). In the 17 years he spent at the college, Mynors sought to maintain its position as a centre of excellence in the Classics and fostered contacts with a new generation of Latinists, including E.J. Kenney, Wendell Clausen, Leighton Durham Reynolds, and Michael Winterbottom. Retirement and death In 1970, Mynors retired from his teaching duties and relocated to his estate at Treago Castle. Though he cultivated leisurely pursuits, such as arboriculture and a stamp collection, his retirement saw work on a commentary on Vergil's Georgics, which appeared posthumously in 1990. He also maintained an interest in the nearby Hereford Cathedral. On 17 October 1989, Mynors was killed in a road accident outside Hereford on his way back from a day working on the cathedral's manuscripts. As he left the building he was heard to say that he had had a good day. He was survived by his wife Lavinia and buried at St Weonards. The cathedral's Honorary Archivist later revealed that Mynors had on the same day expressed his delight about his own scholarly work on the death of Bede: \\"He told me he was glad that he had translated for the Oxford Medieval Texts the account of Bede's death, and that Bede had not ceased in what he saw as his work for God until the very end.\\" Legacy During his career, Mynors gained a reputation as one of the leading Latinists of his generation. His chief interest lay in palaeography, the study of pre-modern manuscripts. He has been credited with unravelling a number of highly complex manuscript relationships in his catalogues of the Balliol and Durham Cathedral libraries. Mynors has been described as a distinguished editor of Latin texts by fellow Classicists, an activity aided by his mastery of palaeography. His Oxford editions of the poets Catullus and Vergil in particular have proved important contributions to the field: they still serve as the standard editions of their texts in the early 21st century. In 1983, on the occasion of his 80th birthday, Mynors' service to the study of Latin texts was honoured by the publication of Texts and Transmission: A Survey of the Latin Classics, edited by the Oxford Latinist L. D. Reynolds. Because of his reluctance to emend beyond the transmitted readings, he has been described as a conservative textual critic. This approach is thought to have originated in Mynors' tendency to ascribe great historical value to manuscripts and their scribes. His scholarly legacy was enhanced by his posthumous commentary on Vergil's Georgics. A comprehensive guide to Vergil's didactic poem on agriculture, the commentary has been lauded for its meticulous attention to technical detail and for Mynors' profound knowledge of agricultural practice. In spite of its accomplishments, critics have also noted that the commentary fails to engage seriously with contemporary scholarship on the text, such as the tension between optimistic and pessimistic readings. In this regard, Mynors' last work reflects his lifelong scepticism towards literary criticism of any persuasion. Honours Mynors was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1944 and was knighted in 1963. He was granted honorary fellowships by Balliol College, Oxford (1963), Pembroke College, Cambridge (1965), and Corpus Christi College, Oxford (1970). The Warburg Institute honoured him in the same way.

Beunans Meriasek (English: The Life of Saint Meriasek) is a Cornish play completed in 1504. Its subject is the legends of the life of Saint Meriasek or Meriadoc, patron saint of Camborne, whose veneration was popular in Cornwall, Brittany, and elsewhere. It was written in the Cornish language, probably written around the same time and in the same place as Bewnans Ke, the only other extant Cornish play taking a saint's life as its subject. The manuscript of Beunans Meriasek is held in the Peniarth Collection at the National Library of Wales. Outline The legend of Meriasek, son of a Duke of Brittany, who, for love of the priestly profession, refused marriage with a wealthy princess and led the life of a miracle-working hermit, first in Cornwall and afterwards in his native land; the legend of Saint Sylvester, who healed the emperor Constantine the Great of leprosy by a dip in the baptismal font, and then aided him in establishing Christianity throughout his broad dominion; and the curious legend of a mother who, on the Virgin's continued disregard of her prayer for the deliverance of a son in captivity, carried off the Christ Child from the arms of the Virgin's statue, and refused to yield up the baby to the Madonna until her own son was restored to her.Bates, K.

There is some coverage of recent events, for example the conflict Libya, work in Afghanistan and the deaths of Osama Bin Laden and Anwar Al Awlaki. It also looks at domestic issues such as the new CONTEST and Prevent strategies, and security for the Olympics.

History A group of involved physicists met at Fisk University in 1973 to honor several well known African-American physicists. In 1977, the Society was established at Morgan State University, with its founding co-chairs being Walter E. Massey and James Davenport. Activities The organization holds its annual conference in February. More recently, it has jointly held these conferences with the National Society of Hispanic Physicists. Attendance at these conferences is upwards of 500 persons, drawing people from all over the world, from Kenya to California. This conference has a cutting-edge scientific program as well as a student professional development program that includes mentor-protégé match-making and a recruiting fair. Throughout its history NSBP has had an active interest in physics related activities outside of the United States. Twenty years ago under the leadership of the late Nobel Laureate, Abdus Salam, and the late Charles Brown, several NSBP members organized the Edward Bouchet-Abdus Salam Institute (EBASI). EBASI (1) provides mechanisms for synergistic scientific and technical collaborations between African and American physical scientists, engineers, and technologists, (2) enhances the impact of science and technology on the sustainable development of the countries on the African continent, and (3) increases the technical manpower pool working in Africa today by facilitating the training of Ph.D. students from African universities. More recently, through a program funded by the Kellogg Foundation NSBP will assist South Africa in its efforts to increase the number of Black astronomers and astrophysicists and to build capacity in the field. The organization offers scholarships, some in conjunction with Black Enterprise magazine, and conducts outreach programs aimed at students from kindergarten through high school.

Bill Dollar was the number one DJ in Charlotte for seven years, according to Arbitron. Early life Dollar was born in Humboldt, Tennessee to Dick, a farmer, and Pauline, an English teacher. When he was a boy he would play with crystal radio sets and homemade transmitters. As a teenager he would hang around a local radio station, and eventually he was given the chance to play records on the air for 90 cents an hour. He also operated the control board for University of Tennessee football broadcasts. Professional career Later, Dollar worked at other radio stations, eventually moving up to larger cities such as Memphis, Tennessee and Birmingham, Alabama. He was music director at WGST in Atlanta, Georgia when that station changed to news radio. In 1979, Dollar applied to the Federal Communications Commission for a frequency allocated to Boone, North Carolina. While waiting for his application to be approved, he moved to Shelbyville, Tennessee and served as morning host and sales manager, but decided he would be better off working for someone else rather than being his own boss. WSOC-FM in Charlotte, North Carolina was advertising for a morning DJ in Broadcasting and Cable Magazine. Dollar applied, but the job went to another applicant. By 1982, Dollar had surpassed Robert Murphy as the most popular DJ in town, and he held this position for the next seven years. He did this without making fun of The PTL Club, a favorite target of radio DJs in the area, even when the show's scandal became national news.Jeff Borden, \\"Born to Be Mild - Charlotte's No. 1 Deejay, Bill Dollar, Has Taken the Middle Road to the Top,\\" The Charlotte Observer, May 14, 1989.

But Dollar's ratings with 25-54 listeners were way down, and he returned from vacation, on his 44th birthday, to find he had been moved to middays, replaced in the morning by Paul Schadt and Cindy O'Day. Program director Paul Johnson said the change would attract more younger listeners with \\"a more contemporary face\\" and \\"energy, entertainment and fun.\\" The station tried to claim Dollar asked for the change, but he would not confirm that.Tim Funk, \\"Station's Switch Puts Dollar on Air Later, in Midday Slot,\\" The Charlotte Observer, August 25, 1994.

Retrieved February 29, 2016 Besides a small number of Latin rite locals, most Roman Catholics in Iran are foreigners living in the country. The majority of Catholics in Iran belong to the Chaldean Catholic Church, and there is also a small Armenian Catholic diocese. Predecessor in the 14th century Roman Catholic presence in Iran has always been a function of the relations between the Roman pope and the rulers of Iran. The first Roman Catholic diocese in Iran was founded by Dominicans in 1318 at Soltaniyeh which then was the capital of the Mongol Ilkhan rulers.http://www.irandoms.org/history/dominicans-in-iran It lasted less than 100 years into the beginning of the 15th century and disappeared during the conquests of Timur Lenk.http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/ds611.html History The diocese was established by Italian Dominican friars on October 12, 1629 when Isfahan was the capital of the Safavid Empire. The cathedral was situated in the then Christian suburb of New Julfa.In the modern city of Isfahan, of which New Jolfa nowadays is a quarter, here are twenty-five churches in the city, of which eleven are still functioning. This diocese continued under the rule of Shah Safi I. The next appointments of bishops were only possible with longer interruptions from 1693 until 1708 (Elias Mutton) and from 1716 until 1731 (Barnabas Fedeli). The small Catholic community in Isfahan was devastated by the Afghan invasion of the city in 1722. In consequence the titular diocese was administered from the see of Baghdad with only a handful of Catholic families surviving in Isfahan. In the 19th century Catholic missionaries were able to restart activities in Iran. From their center in Urmia, apostolic administrators tried to reorganize the Latin Church in the country. In 1896, the Lazarist missionary François Lesné was made bishop of Isfahan. Like his successor, Jacques-Emile Sontag, he resided in Urmia in Western Iran which until the First World War held a sizeable Christian population of Assyrian and Chaldaean Christians. The diocese was elevated to an archdiocese on July 1, 1910. After the devastation of the Christian population during and after the First World War the see of Isfahan fell vacant again. It was not until 1974 that a new archbishop of Isfahan could be instituted. For this the Dominican priest Kevin William Barden at Tehran was chosen. Since then the see of the diocese has been at Tehran. When Barden was expelled from the country in the beginning of the Islamic revolution in 1980, it took another 9 years until the Salesian Ignazio Bedini was consecrated new archbishop. Since his retirement in 2014, the diocese has been administered by an apostolic administrator.

DeBartolo Corporation, it originally featured a Gimbels as the main anchor store. As part of the 1981 enclosure project, Clover was added as a second anchor. It had of retail space. The mall was taken over by New York City based Thor Equities when Simon Property Group sold the mall in 2005 for $71.5 million. Gimbels was an original anchor and closed in 1986. The lower level of the store became a ShopRite grocery store in 1995, and the upper level was slated to become a Bradlees discount store a year later. However, Bradlees never opened due to bankruptcy, so their space instead became Burlington Coat Factory (now known as Burlington). Also in 1997, the Clover store closed and was replaced by Value City. In summer 2014, the mall was foreclosed and put up for sale.

Hungarian National Museum, Budapest. Sculpture of God Jupiter Dolichenus, Archaeological Museum in Kladovo Jupiter Dolichenus was a Roman god whose mystery cult was widespread in the Roman Empire from the early-2nd to mid-3rd centuries AD. Like several other figures of the mystery cults, Jupiter Dolichenus was one of the so-called 'oriental' gods; that is Roman re-inventions of ostensibly foreign figures in order to give their cults legitimacy and to distinguish them from the cults of the traditional Roman gods. Like the other mystery cults (including the other pseudo-oriental ones), the cult of Jupiter Dolichenus gained popularity in the Roman Empire as a complement of the open 'public' religion of mainstream Roman society. Unlike the Roman public cults, but like the other mysteries, the temples of the cult of Jupiter Dolichenus were nominally closed to outsiders and followers had to undergo rites of initiation before they could be accepted as devotees. As a result, very little is known about the cult's beliefs and practices from the few clues that can be obtained from the sparse iconographic, archaeological or epigraphic evidence. The cult gained popularity in the 2nd century AD, reached a peak under the Severan dynasty in the early 3rd century AD, and died out shortly thereafter. At least nineteen temples (including two discovered in 2000) are known to have been built in Rome and the provinces which, while substantial, is far below the popularity enjoyed by the comparable pseudo-oriental cults of Mithras, Isis or Cybele.  History  Until the late 20th-century, Roman exoticism was usually taken at face value, and Jupiter Dolichenus was therefore like the other pseudo-oriental figures also assumed to have really been a Roman continuation of an oriental figure. In the case of Jupiter Dolichenus, the exoticism was attributed to an interpretatio romana derivation from a semitic Hadad-Baal-Teshub cult, which had its cult center on a hill () near Doliche, 30 Roman Miles west of Samosata on the Euphrates, in the Commagene in eastern Asia Minor (The present-day name of the hill is Baba Tepesi, \\"Father Teshub\\". Historical Doliche is on a height now known as Keber Tepe, just west of Dülük, Gaziantep Province, Turkey). It is from the city of Doliche that the epithet 'Dolichenus' \\"of Doliche\\" was adopted. However, since the 1980s it has become increasingly evident that the exotic gloss the Romans gave to their so-called 'oriental' gods was mostly superficial, and based primarily on Roman perceptions (hearsay and their own imagination) of what the foreign gods were like. Accordingly, in the context of Roman religion, the term 'oriental' no longer carries much weight and is now mostly only used as an archaeological docket tag. (This development applies to all Roman 'oriental' gods equally; for a discussion of the issue in relation to Jupiter Dolichenus, see especially ). The cult of Jupiter Dolichenus is especially difficult to assess in this respect because the archaeological finds at Dülük indicate that, at some point, Roman material was exported to Doliche, thus obscuring the distinction between Roman and native cult there. These scholastic issues notwithstanding, the Romans perceived Jupiter Dolichenus as 'Syrian', and that perception, not the reality, influenced the Roman world. Reinvented or not, the Roman cult appears to have been informed by Baal's roles as a national god and as a 'king' god (i.e. the senior-most of his pantheon), both aspects also being features of Roman Jupiter. How much doctrine (if any) the Romans borrowed remains unknown. thumb: Inscription of the provincial governor Lucius Lucceius Martinus (legatus Augustorum pro praetore provinciae Germaniae inferioris) commemorating the restoration of a temple dedicated to Jupiter Dolichenus. The dedication is also for the well-being of the family of the emperor M(arcus) Aurelius (Severus) Antoninus, i.e. Caracalla. From Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, dated to around 211/212. The earliest traces of the cult of Jupiter Dolichenus appear in the early 2nd-century, perhaps as a by-product of contact between Roman and Commagenian troops during the allied Roman-Commagenian campaigns against the Kingdom of Pontus in 64 BC, but perhaps also as a product of greatly embellished (or even freely invented) travel accounts or colportage which circulated around the Mediterranean rim in the Hellenistic and early Roman periods. The earliest dateable evidence for the Roman cult is an inscription () from Lambaesis in Numidia (in present-day Algeria), where the commander of Roman troops and de facto governor dedicated an altar in 125 AD. The cult is next attested in Rome, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius (r. 161-180) when a temple to Jupiter Dolichenus was built on the Caelian Hill. Not much later, the cult is attested in Germany where a centurion of Legio VIII Augusta dedicated an altar in 191 at Obernburg in Germania Superior (). A large number of dedications then occur under Septimius Severus (r. 193-211) and Caracalla (r. 198-217), which represents the high point of the cult. A once-held idea that the cult of Jupiter Dolichenus received imperial support, in particular from the Severan dynasts (who were of Syrian-African descent), is no longer followed. Another older notion that Jupiter Dolichenus was the tutelary divinity of the army is also obsolete. Unlike the other pseudo-oriental mystery cults, the worship of Jupiter Dolichenus was very fixed on its 'Doliche'/'Syrian' exoticism and identity, which contributed to the cult's demise. Through an identification with the Severan dynasty (which was perceived to be 'Syrian' as Caracalla was half Syrian and spent much of his reign in the eastern provinces), following the assassination of Alexander Severus in 235 the cult perhaps became a target as part of an 'Illyrian reaction' against the fallen 'Syrian' dynasty and its supporters. The archaeological record reveals violent destruction of all known Dolichenus temples in the provinces on the Rhine and Danube during the reign of Maximinus Thrax (r. 235-238). The Thracian emperor is known to have filled his coffers from sanctuaries, and the cult of Jupiter Dolichenus was an easy target since it was not very widespread. However, the destruction of the sanctuaries in the Rhine/Danubian provinces was not the end of the cult, either in those provinces or anywhere else, and several monuments date to the next two decades. However, in 253 or 256, the Sassanid emperor Shapur I captured and sacked Doliche. It appears that with the loss of Dolichenus' ostensible main sanctuary, the god was permanently discredited in terms of his perceived power, and evidence of the cult ceased thereafter. The cult had tied itself so firmly to the sanctity of Doliche and to the oriental nature of the god that it had never achieved the universality that it needed in order to survive the loss. The last known Dolichenus monument is from the Esquiline Hill temple and dates to the reign of Gallienus (r. 253-268). Several monuments were formerly thought to be of a later date, but those estimates are now obsolete.  Worship  Jupiter Dolichenus as a Roman commander, but with the standard weapons of the god: a double-axe in his right hand, and a lightning bolt in his left. From (centurio) leg(ionis) X G(eminae) / et Val(eria) Digna / v(otum) s(olverunt) l(ibentes) m(erito) ‘To Jupiter Optimus Maximus Dolichenus, for the well-being of Emperor Caesar M. Aurelius Commodus Augustus, C. Spurius Silvanus—a centurion of the legio X Gemina—and Valeria Digna freely and deservedly fulfilled their vow’. Jupiter Dolichenus was always addressed in full as Jupiter Optimus Maximus Dolichenus, in Latin epigraphical dative case abbreviated 'IOM Dolicheno', or 'Iovi Optimo Maximo Dolicheno' in full. 'Optimus Maximus', meaning 'Best and Greatest', was the stock epithet of Jupiter, with whom Jupiter Dolichenus was co-identified and for whom the term of respect was maintained. The adoption of Jupiter's Optimus Maximus epithet co-identified the two, but may also be seen as an attempt to attract worshippers to their own cult. Jupiter Dolichenus did however also receive some distinctive forms of address. One inscription from a temple on the Aventine hill in Rome, for example, addresses Jupiter Dolichenus as 'eternal preserver' (), while another acknowledges the god as 'Jupiter Optimus Maximus Dolichenus Eternal, preserver of the firmament, pre-eminent divinity, invincible provider' (). The cult of Jupiter Dolichenus was a mystery religion whose customs and rituals were restricted to initiates. Very little is known about the cult as it did not last long enough to appear in polemical Christian literature that provided so many useful clues on other mystery cults such as that of Mithras. The archaeological and epigraphic material is very sparse. A reference to a ' (priest) in / shows that there was an internal structure, though one that did not seem to have any great complexity. In a temple to Jupiter Optimus Maximus at Porolissum, a number of priests are mentioned (Sacerdotes Dei Iovi): Marcus Aurelius Vitalus, a duumvir; Antonius Mavius, a decurion; Acius Flavus; Caius Marcius Vegesius; and one Attonaris Bassus. An inscription () from the Aventine temple (see below) gives a list of the members of one community. The group consists of 32 names, 7 of which are identified as being a ' (patron). The text of the inscription refers to ' and ' (candidates), so it may be that the other names were men who held status of '. Whether the men were candidates for initiation or candidates for a higher rank is unclear. The patrons may have been sponsoring new candidates to join the community, but the text of the inscriptions refers to both as ' (brothers), which suggests that the candidates are all already initiates. One priest dedicates the inscription and styles himself as 'father of the candidates'. In another inscription () the roles of 'recorder', 'leaders of this place' and 'litter-bearers of the god' are identified. The members of the community are introduced by the phrase 'Jupiter Optimus Maximus Dolichenus chose the following to serve him'. Of the 260 devotees named in votive inscriptions, 97 are for soldiers, and it thus seems that the cult had a particular attraction for members of the military. In from Ostia Antica, an inscription from around 186 AD, an entire naval unit a detachment of the fleet at Misenum is named as dedicator. Several votive tablets include depictions of military standards and war trophies. Dedications to Jupiter Dolichenus by the commanders of provincial armies indicate there was a certain measure of support for the cult in high ranking army circles. Also the inscription suggests that the cult could attract important patrons. That inscription of the provincial governor Lucius Lucceius Martinus (legatus Augustorum pro praetore provinciae Germaniae inferioris) commemorates the restoration of a temple dedicated to Jupiter Dolichenus in 211/212. However, it's not clear how involved such a dignitary might have been in the cult, or whether the governor was even an initiate. The dedication could merely represent the fulfillment of political duties. The inscription does however indicate a measure of support from influential persons. Jupiter Dolichenus is frequently depicted in the company of Jupiter's consort, Juno. Within the cult of Jupiter Dolichenus, Juno takes the name Juno Dolichena. In iconography she always appears on the right of her partner. The cult of Jupiter Dolichenus also gave prominence to Apollo and Diana, who often appear on votive tablets as a pair of busts side by side. The reason for this placement is unknown. Equally important seem to have been Sol, god of the sun, and Luna, goddess of the moon. These two provide a clear cosmic element. Rather than being distinct members of the pantheon it may be that Apollo and Sol are serving the same function as sun gods, as are Diana and Luna with the moon. Castor and Pollux also frequently appear and their role is less clear. Most likely they are seen as the sons of Jupiter. Isis and Serapis also appear with some frequency, perhaps as 'guests' or as allusions to the royal pair of Doliche.  Art and iconography  Votive relief to Jupiter Dolichenus (left, with double-axe and lightning bolt) and Juno Dolichena (right, with mirror and scepter). From Rome, 3rd century. Few of the characteristic attributes of Jupiter appear in the representation of Jupiter Dolichenus, apart from the thunderbolt, a beard, and at times the eagle. In all other respects the god is a new creation which blends \\"oriental\\" with Hellenistic conventions. The god always appears dressed in a military fashion, armed and dressed in a cuirass. This does not necessarily mean that his cult was especially militaristic; rather, the attributes signify power and royalty. The cuirass in particular is a Hellenistic artistic convention to portray divinity. The weapon that the god carries is usually a double-headed axe (a labris), a weapon often associated with the kings of Thrace and Asia Minor and not a common soldier's weapon. In accord with Roman conventions, Jupiter Dolichenus is also depicted with Phrygian cap and trousers, thus presenting the god as \\"oriental\\". The unique feature of representations of Jupiter Dolichenus is that he is almost always shown standing on the back of a bull. There has been much speculation over the fact that Jupiter Dolichenus is always depicted as standing on the back of the animal. It must have had significance to the cult myth (a mystery cult's myth is that cult's mystery) that would have been transmitted to devotees, but what that myth might have been is unknown. The bull had a long association with concepts of strength, virility and fertility, and was identified in Hellenistic Asia Minor with Nike/Victoria. Bulls also appear frequently in the furnishings of the cult's temples. At the temple to Jupiter Dolichenus at the Zugmantel, a Roman cohort post on the Upper Limes Germanicus near present-day Taunusstein, Germany, the altar table was supported by legs carved in the shape of two bulls. In contrast Juno Dolichena rides a deer, an animal with suitably royal associations. At Croy Hill she seems to have stood on a cow which is associated with motherhood. An altar from Obernburg (), now in the Stiftsmuseum Aschaffenburg) perhaps relates the cult myth. On the left side are carved a thunderbolt, a tree and a shield (scutum). The thunderbolt is a standard attribute of Jupiter; however, the tree and the shield are not.  Temples  The temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus Dolichenus at Porolissum, Dacia. The temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus Dolichenus at Vetoniana, Rhaetia. A temple to Jupiter Dolichenus is known as a dolichenum, a modern term invented by archaeologists. No specific term seems to have existed as the devotees only use the word templum when referring to their shrines (e.g. CIL VIII 2680 = 18221). The function of the temples is far from clear and although 19 (including two since 2000) have been identified or excavated (see below), few details can be securely agreed on. The temples are not in the classical style of a rectangular colonnaded shrine standing on a raised podium with an altar outside in front. However, like most Roman temples, they have a narthex as well as a cella with a central nave that ended at a high altar. There are also some similarities to the so-called mithraea, the temples of the cult to Mithras, as they are windowless and rectangular in plan. The podium benches that are typical of a mithraeum, on which initiates could recline when they took part in their ritual meals, do not seem to have existed in dolichenae. Steinby interprets the podium of the Aventine temple as a \\"long platform, probably for dedications.\\" Archaeological remains of temples or shrines of Jupiter Dolichenus have been found at: *Aventine Hill, Roma (under present-day Via di S.

History  Hospitality has been available on the site since at least 1777, originally it was the 'Swan Inn\\" in Low Harrogate separate from the settlement of High Harrogate. In the late nineteenth century it was extensively redeveloped by the \\"Harrogate Hydropathic Company\\" as a fashionable spa hotel, and included Turkish baths. Its name was \\"The Harrogate Hydro\\" or as the locals called it \\"The Hydro\\". It had its own farm on Penny Pot Lane to provide for the kitchens. It was the first building in Harrogate to have electric light. A vertical steam engine drove a DC generator and also the hotel laundry. The steam engine was re-activated to drive the laundry by Jack Gill of John Redfearn's garage at the hotel in the 1950s until electric motors took over. The fuel was coke from Harrogate Gas Works. In 1939 the hotel was requisitioned at 48 hours' notice by the Ministry of Aircraft Production and cables were laid to a new telephone exchange in the Library Restaurant. Power cables were laid directly from the hotel to the corporation power station beside Jenny Plain passing in a straight line through every private property on the way. It was attacked by an enemy aircraft in 1943 but only the house at the end of Swan Road by Ripon Road was destroyed. By the mid-1950s Harrogate had an image problem. The \\"Bath Chair\\" image of Victorian spa towns was now unfashionable and the Hydro was renamed \\"The Old Swan Hotel\\" \\"famous since 1700\\". It was listed in 1975 as a Grade II listed building. In the early 1980s, the hotel was a focal point of the Harrogate International Festival Of Sound—an annual festival of premium hi-fi equipment. A refurbishment of the Old Swan and its 136 rooms was finalised in 2006.  Agatha Christie's disappearance  In December 1926 the author Agatha Christie suddenly disappeared from her home. She was missing for a total of eleven days, during which the police conducted a major manhunt, and there was speculation that she had committed suicide. The disappearance even drew other crime writers Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Dorothy L. Sayers into the search, Doyle's interest in the occult prompting him to take one of Christie's gloves to a medium. After about ten days (having checked into the Swan Hydropathic Hotel under the assumed name Mrs. Teresa Neele) she was recognised by one of the banjo players at the hotel.

Because its members are drawn from across the United States (and resident aliens from other nations), it is as varied as each individual Marine, but tied together with core values and traditions passed from generation to generation of Marines. As in any military organization, the official and unofficial traditions of the Marine Corps serve to reinforce camaraderie and set the service apart from others. The Corps' embracement of its rich culture and history is cited as a reason for its high esprit de corps. Official traditions and customs Many traditions and customs of the Corps are officially recognized through orders, histories, and ceremonies; some are even embodied within the uniform itself. Core values Card given to recruits bearing the Core values The Marine Corps Core Values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment have gained increased prominence in recent years. As an emphasis on performing morally on and off duty, the concept of core values has infiltrated into many aspects of Marine life, beginning in recruit training and continuing into combat. This \\"warrior ethos\\" provides guidance to Marines in difficult ethical situations and acts as a reminder to provide good order and discipline. Marines' Hymn The Marines' Hymn dates back to 1919 and is the oldest official song in the U.S. Armed Forces. It embraces some of the most important battles of the Corps at that time, including Chapultepec and Derna. Subtle changes and unofficial verses have been added as the history of the Corps grew. Eagle, Globe, and Anchor A rendition of the emblem on the flag of the U.S. Marine Corps The official Marine Corps emblem is the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor, sometimes abbreviated \\"EGA\\". Adopted in its present form in 1868 by Commandant Jacob Zeilin, it derives partially from ornaments worn by the Continental Marines and the British Royal Marines, and is usually topped with a ribbon reading \\"Semper Fidelis\\". The original eagle was a crested eagle found in the Americas, not the bald eagle that appears in the current emblem. The eagle stands on the Western Hemisphere and holds in its beak a scroll bearing the motto \\"Semper Fidelis\\", though the scroll is sometimes omitted from uniform insignia. An anchor fouled with rope stands behind the globe, and while it generally points to the left, it can be found reversed when paired so that the anchors continually face the other. The eagle stands for a proud country, the globe signifies worldwide service, and the fouled anchor signifies naval tradition. The use of the emblem became official when the seal was adopted in 1955. Seal & colors United States Marine Corps seal On 22 June 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed an Executive Order, which approved the design of an official seal for the United States Marine Corps. The new seal had been designed by Felix de Weldon at the request, and with the assistance, of the Commandant Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr. The new seal consisted of the traditional Marine Corps Eagle, Globe, and Anchor emblem in bronze; however, an American bald eagle replaced the crested eagle depicted on the 1868 emblem, and is depicted with wings displayed, standing upon the western hemisphere of the terrestrial globe, and holding in his beak a scroll inscribed with the Marine Corps motto \\"Semper Fidelis\\" with the hemisphere superimposed on a fouled anchor. The seal is displayed on a scarlet background encircled with a Navy blue band edged in a gold rope rim and inscribed \\"Department of the Navy, United States Marine Corps\\" in gold letters. Coincident with the approval of this seal by the President, the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor emblem centered on the seal was adopted in 1955 as the official Marine Corps Emblem. The blue signifies naval ties, while the scarlet and gold are the official Marine Corps colors. They appear ubiquitously in the Marine Corps, particularly on signage. They also form the base colors of the flag of the United States Marine Corps. Motto The Marine motto \\"Semper Fidelis\\" means \\"always faithful\\" in Latin. This motto often appears in the shortened form \\"Semper Fi\\" . It is also the name of the official march of the Corps, composed by John Philip Sousa. It was adopted in 1883 when Commandant Charles McCawley added it to the seal, before which the traditional mottos were \\"Fortitudine\\" (With Fortitude); \\"By Sea and by Land\\", a translation of the Royal Marines' \\"Per Mare, Per Terram\\"; and \\"To the Shores of Tripoli\\", which was later revised to \\"From the Halls of the Montezumas to the Shores of Tripoli\\" and formed the first lines of the Marines' Hymn. The recruiting slogan of \\"A Few Good Men\\" (as opposed to the play and film) derives from a Continental Marines recruiting poster: The modern recruiting slogan is \\"the few, the proud, the Marines.\\" The Rifleman's Creed is a similar concept as the motto, but offers a more modern look at doctrine. It explains to a recruit the importance of his or her weapon but also emphasizes the moral motivations behind using it. Swords Two styles of swords are worn by Marines. The Marine Corps officers' sword is a Mameluke Sword, similar to the Persian shamshir presented to Lt. Presley O'Bannon after the Battle of Derna during the First Barbary War. After its adoption in 1825 and initial distribution in 1826, Mameluke Swords have been worn by Marine officers ever since, except during the period 1859–1875, when they were required to wear the Army's Model 1850-foot officers' sword. Upon returning to the traditional sword, many officers gave their Army swords to their senior noncommissioned officer, creating the basis for the NCO sword. Generally, Marines are the only branch where enlisted members regularly carry a sword (the Army authorizes platoon and first sergeants to carry a Model 1840 sword during some ceremonies, while the Chief of Naval Operations authorized Chief Petty Officers and above to carry an optional ceremonial cutlass with dress uniforms in 2010). Birthday The Marine Corps Birthday is celebrated every year on 10 November, when the Second Continental Congress raised two battalions of Marines. Tun Tavern is regarded as the location of the first Marines to enlist under Commandant Samuel Nicholas. Prior to 1921, Marines celebrated the 11 July 1798 recreation of the Corps (having been disbanded following the end of the Revolutionary War) with little fanfare. Then, Marine Corps Order 47 was published by Commandant John A. Lejeune: The celebrations were formalized by Commandant Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr. in 1952, outlining the cake cutting ceremony, which would enter the Marine Drill Manual in 1956. By tradition, the first slice of cake is given to the oldest Marine present, who in turn hands it off to the youngest Marine present, symbolizing the old and experienced Marines passing their knowledge to the new generation of Marines. Lejeune's message is also republished annually. Drill & ceremonies Close Order Drill is heavily emphasized early on in a Marine's training. Formal ceremonies, such as the Marine Corps Birthday Ball, a change of command, or a retirement, will almost always incorporate some form of close order drill. The Marine Corps uses close order drill to teach discipline by instilling habits of precision and automatic response to orders, increase the confidence of junior officers and noncommissioned officers through the exercise of command and give Marines an opportunity to handle individual weapons. The Mess Night is a borrowed tradition of ceremonial dining. Originally a British Army tradition, it has become an honored tradition of enjoying drink, good food, and fellowship with a Marine's comrades, as well as honoring those who have perished in battle. History Marine at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Marines have a high reverence for their history, indoctrinating recruits and continually expanding the topic in the professional education Marines attend throughout their careers. The History Division, a subunit of the Training and Education Command, records, archives, researches, analyzes, and presents the history of the Corps. Several Marine Corps museums have been established, most notably the National Museum of the Marine Corps at Quantico, Virginia. Additional Marine history can be found at the Flying Leatherneck Aviation Museum, the MCRD San Diego Command Museum, the Marine Corps Air-Ground Museum, the Marine Corps Legacy Museum, the Parris Island Museum, the WWII/Korea LVT Museum, and the Waterhouse Museum. Memorials also serve as a way to preserve history. One of the most iconic memorials is the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery, a statue recreated from the iconic photo Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima. Other memorials to Marines (sometimes including other services) include the two of the many statues named Iron Mike (Belleau, France and Parris Island, South Carolina), the USS Arizona Memorial, Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium at the United States Naval Academy, as well as many period specific military memorial around the country where Marines participated in fighting, such as the National World War II Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Unofficial traditions and customs The Corps has many unofficial traditions, promulgated by many Marines and some Marine-based organizations (such as the Marine Corps League, Marine Corps Association, and Young Marines) or media (such as the Marine Corps Gazette, Leatherneck Magazine, or Marine Corps Times). Marines are not \\"soldiers\\", or \\"sailors.\\" Nicknames A recruiting poster makes use of the \\"Teufel Hunden\\" nickname. Marines have been given many generic nicknames: * Devil Dog is an oft-disputed term. Most Marines learn that the term comes from \\"Teufel Hunden\\", a corrupted version of the German \\"Teufelshunde\\" awarded to Marines after the Battle of Belleau Wood. The German high command classified Marines as stormtrooper- quality elite troops. The bulldog has also been closely associated with the Marine Corps as a result, and some units keep one as a mascot. * Jarhead has several oft-disputed explanations, including how the \\"high and tight\\" haircut allows the head to resemble a jar lid, and pejoratives about empty heads. However, the term \\"jarhead\\" was well established in the 1950s, while the term \\"high and tight\\" did not yet exist; Marines who chose to trim their hair closely on the sides were said to have \\"white sidewalls.\\" Photos of Marines in the World War II era show haircuts that are even longer. * Gyrene has dropped out of popular use, and is speculated to be a portmanteau of GI and Marine. * Leatherneck refers to a leather collar that was formerly part of the Marine uniform during the Revolutionary War period. A bulldog mascot Mottos and battle cries * Oorah is a common battle cry among Marines, being similar in function and purpose to the Army's hooah and the Navy's hooyah cries (to include an affirmative, a display of enthusiasm, and a greeting). Many possible etymologies have been offered for the term. * Semper Fi, Mac was a common form of greeting in times past. * Gung-ho became a common slogan; from Chinese gōnghé, \\"China Marines\\" took it to mean ‘work together’ and used it during World War II. * Improvise, Adapt and Overcome has become an adopted mantra in many units * Semper Gumby is a play on Semper Flexibilis. Purported to mean \\"always flexible\\", the true Latin translation is Semper Flexibilis; \\"Gumby\\" is taken from the cartoon character Gumby. Semper Gumby is also popular among Navy personnel. Veteran Marines The ethos that \\"Once a Marine, Always a Marine\\" has led to the objection to the use of the term \\"ex- Marine\\", leading to a myriad of forms of address for those no longer on active duty: * \\"Veteran Marine\\" or \\"Former Marine\\" can refer to anyone who has been discharged honorably from the Corps. * \\"Retired Marine\\" refers to those who have completed 20 or more years of service and formally retired, or have been medically retired after less than 20 years service. * \\"Sir\\" or \\"Ma'am\\" is appropriate out of respect. * According to one of the \\"Commandant's White letters\\" from General Alfred M. Gray, Jr., referring to a Marine by their last earned rank is appropriate. * Marines that have left service with a less than full honorable discharge might still be considered Marines (depending on the view of the individual), however that title is also in keeping with a stigma; and many will avoid the issue altogether by addressing the individual by name with no other title. Physical fitness and martial arts pull-ups The Marine Corps places a high institutional value on physical readiness, preparing the individual's body for the rigors of combat. Mandatory participation in three hours weekly of physical exercise, termed \\"Physical Training\\" or PT, is considered a minimum starting point; further fitness is rewarded by better evaluation scores, which increase promotability, as well as benefits for winning athletic competitions. In addition, height and weight standards and body fat percentage ensure that Marines are fit and present a good military appearance. Chronic lack of physical fitness can be grounds for administrative punishment, and even discharge in extreme situations. The Physical Fitness Test is performed annually to assess a Marine's fitness, and higher scores weigh in his or her favor for promotions. To encourage physical training, Commandant James T. Conway authorized a new physical training uniform based on a tracksuit and the development of the Combat Fitness Test to better simulate the specific stressors of combat. For decades, Marines learned a variety of martial arts and other methods of hand-to-hand combat, but these were irregular processes that varied greatly from unit to unit and from time to time. Eventually, the Corps solidified its various teachings into the LINE combat system, but its inherent inflexibility was evident. In 2001, the Marine Corps initiated a new program, called Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP). Due to an expectation that urban and police-type peacekeeping missions would become more common in the 21st century, placing Marines in even closer contact with unarmed civilians, MCMAP was implemented to provide Marines with a larger and more versatile set of less-than-lethal options for controlling hostile, but unarmed individuals. It is also a stated aim of the program to instill and maintain the \\"Warrior Ethos\\" within Marines. The Marine Corps Martial Arts program is an eclectic mix of different styles of martial arts melded together and consists of boxing movements, joint locking techniques, opponent weight transfer (Jujitsu), ground grappling (mostly wrestling), bayonet, knife and baton fighting, non-compliance joint manipulations, and blood restriction chokes. Marines begin MCMAP training in boot camp, earning the first of five belts. Marines in the public eye The Marine Corps, like any other branch of the military, is most visible by the public through public affairs organizations and several presentation units. Dedication to proficiency in drill is a hallmark of the Silent Drill Platoon, Marine Band, and the Drum and Bugle Corps. In addition, the Corps released periodic recruiting commercials, often about one annually. The traditional tagline for the commercials is \\"The Few, The Proud, The Marines.\\" While Marines do not have installations across the United States (unlike the Army and Air Force, Marine installations are concentrated in California, North Carolina, and the national capitol region), the direct link for most Americans to the Corps is the Marine recruiter, often recognizable in the Dress Blue uniform. Marines also make popular subjects for works of fiction. The Marine Corps has been depicted on many films, television shows, innumerable books, and even video games. Much of the Marines image is the result of carefully crafted public relations; President Truman said the Marines have \\"a propaganda machine that is almost equal to Stalin's.\\" https://www.nytimes.com/1950/09/06/archives/truman-likens-propaganda-of- marines-to-stalin-setup-president.html Since 2001, Gallup polls have asked \\"Which of the four major branches of the armed forces are the most prestigious?.\\" Every year of the Gallup poll showed that the American public regards the Corps as the most prestigious of the four branches of the armed forces of the Department of Defense. However, when ranked by importance, it did not score well until it tied the Army and Air Force in 2004, with the increase being attributed to the Iraq War.

As a term, both phrases are used in contemporary 21st-century political analysis in the media and elsewhere to refer to the shift representing a move toward more progressive economic policies and coinciding with a parallel trend of democratization of Latin America following decades of inequality. The Latin American countries viewed as part of this ideological trend have been referred to as pink tide nations,\\"COHA Statement on the Ongoing Stress in Venezuela\\" . with the term post-neoliberalism being used to describe the movement as well. Some pink tide governments such as those of Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela have been varyingly characterized as being anti-American, populist\\"The many stripes of anti-Americanism\\". Boston Globe. Retrieved 30 October 2018.\\"South America's leftward sweep\\". BBC News. Retrieved 30 October 2018.\\"Latin America's 'pragmatic' pink tide\\" Pittsburgh Tribune-Herald. and authoritarian- leaning. The pink tide was followed by the conservative wave, a political phenomenon that emerged in the mid-2010s in South America as a direct reaction to the pink tide. However, the pink tide saw a resurgence in 2018–19 after successive electoral victories of left-wing and centre-left candidates in Mexico, Panama, and Argentina.  Background  Raúl Castro of Cuba and Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, the man who was the key figure for the to Pink Tide During the Cold War, a series of left-leaning governments were elected in Latin America. These governments faced coups sponsored by the United States government as part of its geostrategic interest in the region.\\"Los secretos de la guerra sucia continental de la dictadura\\" (The secrets of the continental dirty war of the dictators), Clarin, 24 March 2006 .Greg Grandin (2011). The Last Colonial Massacre: Latin America in the Cold War. University of Chicago Press. p. 75. .Walter L. Hixson (2009). The Myth of American Diplomacy: National Identity and U.S. Foreign Policy. Yale University Press. p. 223. . Among these were the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état, 1964 Brazilian coup d'état, 1973 Chilean coup d'état and 1976 Argentine coup d'état. All of these coups were followed by United States-backed and sponsored right-wing military dictatorships as part of the United States government's Operation Condor. These authoritarian regimes committed several human rights violations including illegal detentions of political opponents, suspects of be one and/or their families, tortures, disappearances and child trafficking. As these regimes started to decline due to international pressure, internal outcry in the United States from the population due to the involvement in the atrocities forced Washington to relinquish its support for them. New democratic processes began during the late 1970s and up to the early 1990s. With the exception of Costa Rica, virtually all Latin American countries had at least one experience with a United States-supported dictator: Fulgencio Batista in Cuba, Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, the Somoza family in Nicaragua, Tiburcio Carias Andino in Honduras, Carlos Castillo Armas in Guatemala, Hugo Banzer in Bolivia, Juan María Bordaberry in Uruguay, Jorge Rafael Videla in Argentina, Augusto Pinochet in Chile, Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay, François Duvalier in Haiti, Artur da Costa e Silva and his successor Emílio Garrastazu Médici in Brazil and Marcos Pérez Jiménez in Venezuela, which caused a strong anti- American sentiment in wide sectors of the population.  History   Rise of the left: 1990s and 2000s  Following the third wave of democratization in the 1980s, the institutionalization of electoral competition in Latin America opened up the possibility for the left to ascend to power. For much of the region's history, formal electoral contestation excluded leftist movements, first through limited suffrage and later through military intervention and repression during the second half of the 20th century.Levitsky, Steven; Roberts, Kenneth. \\"The Resurgence of the Latin American Left\\" (PDF). Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. The collapse of the Soviet Union changed the geopolitical environment as many revolutionary movements vanished and the left embraced the core tenets of capitalism. As a result, the United States no longer perceived leftist governments as a security threat, creating a political opening for the left.Levitsky, Ibid. In the 1990s, the left exploited this opportunity to solidify their base, run for local offices and gain experience governing on the local level. At the end of the 1990s and early 2000s, the region's initial unsuccessful attempts with the neoliberal policies of privatization, cuts in social spending and foreign investment left countries with high levels of unemployment, inflation and rising inequality.Rodriguez, Robert G. (2014). \\"Re-Assessing the Rise of the Latin American Left\\" (PDF). The Midsouth Political Science Review. Arkansas Political Science Association. 15 (1): 59. ISSN 2330-6882. This period saw increasing numbers of people working in the informal economy and suffering material insecurity, and ties between the working classes and the traditional political parties weakening, resulting in a growth of mass protest against the negative social effects of these policies, such as the piqueteros in Argentina, and in Bolivia indigenous and peasant movements rooted among small coca farmers, or cocaleros, whose activism culminated in the Bolivian gas conflict of the early-to-mid 2000s. The left's social platforms, which were centered on economic change and redistributive policies, offered an attractive alternative that mobilized large sectors of the population across the region who voted leftist leaders into office.Levitsky, Ibid. ALBA was founded by left-wing populist leaders surch the Nicaraguan revolutionary Daniel Ortega, the Venezuelan paramilitary Hugo Chávez and Bolivian president Evo Morales. The pink tide was led by Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, who was elected into the presidency in 1998. According to Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, a pink tide president herself, Chávez of Venezuela (inaugurated 1999), Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil (inaugurated 2003) and Evo Morales of Bolivia (inaugurated 2006) were \\"the three musketeers\\" of the left in South America. National policies among the left in Latin America are divided between the styles of Chávez and Lula as the latter not only focused on those affected by inequality, but also catered to private enterprises and global capital. = Commodities boom and growth = With the difficulties facing emerging markets across the world at the time, Latin Americans turned away from liberal economics and elected leftist leaders who had recently turned toward more democratic processes. The popularity of such leftist governments relied upon by their ability to use the 2000s commodities boom to initiate populist policies, such as those used by the Bolivarian government in Venezuela. According to Daniel Lansberg, this resulted in \\"high public expectations in regard to continuing economic growth, subsidies, and social services\\". With China becoming a more industrialized nation at the same time and requiring resources for its growing economy, it took advantage of the strained relations with the United States and partnered with the leftist governments in Latin America. South America in particular initially saw a drop in inequality and a growth in its economy as a result of Chinese commodity trade. As the prices of commodities lowered into the 2010s, coupled with overspending with little savings by pink tide governments, policies became unsustainable and supporters became disenchanted, eventually leading to the rejection of leftist governments. Analysts state that such unsustainable policies were more apparent in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela, who received Chinese funds without any oversight. As a result, some scholars have stated that the pink tide's rise and fall was \\"a byproduct of the commodity cycle's acceleration and decadence\\".  End of commodity boom and decline: 2010s  impeachment of Dilma Rousseff gave rise to the Conservative wave in late 2010s Chávez, who was seen as having \\"dreams of continental domination\\", was determined to be a threat to his own people according to Michael Reid in American magazine, Foreign Affairs, with his influence reaching a peak in 2007. The interest in Chávez waned after his dependence on oil revenue led Venezuela into an economic crisis and as he grew increasingly authoritarian. The death of Chávez in 2013 left the most radical wing without a clear leader as Nicolás Maduro did not have the international influence of his predecessor. By the mid-2010s, Chinese investment in Latin America had also begun to decline, especially following the 2015–2016 Chinese stock market crash. In 2015, the shift away from the left became more pronounced in Latin America, with The Economist saying the pink tide had ebbed and Vice News stating that 2015 was \\"The Year the 'Pink Tide' Turned\\". In that year's Argentine general election, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's favoured candidate for the presidency Daniel Scioli was comfortably defeated by his centre-right opponent Mauricio Macri, against a background of rising inflation, reductions in GDP, and declining prices for soybeans - a key export for the country, leading to falls in public revenues and social spending. Shortly afterwards the impeachment of Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff began, culminating in her removal from office. In Ecuador, retiring president Rafael Correa's successor was his vice-president, Lenín Moreno, who took a narrow victory in the 2017 Ecuadorian general election, a win which received a negative reaction from the business community at home and abroad: however, after his election Moreno shifted his positions rightwards, resulting in Correa branding his former deputy as \\"a traitor\\" and \\"a wolf in sheep's clothing\\". By 2016, the decline of the pink tide saw an emergence of a \\"new right\\" in Latin America, with The New York Times stating \\"Latin America's leftist ramparts appear to be crumbling because of widespread corruption, a slowdown in China's economy and poor economic choices\\", with the newspaper elaborating that leftist leaders did not diversify economies, had unsustainable welfare policies and disregarded democratic behaviors. In mid-2016, the Harvard International Review stated that \\"South America, a historical bastion of populism, has always had a penchant for the left, but the continent's predilection for unsustainable welfarism might be approaching a dramatic end\\". = International policies = Some pink tide governments, such as Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, allegedly ignored international sanctions against Iran, allowing the Iranian government access to funds bypassing sanctions as well as resources such as uranium for the Iranian nuclear program. = Corruption = On 12 July 2017, former Brazilian President Lula was convicted of money laundering and passive corruption, defined in Brazilian criminal law as the receipt of a bribe by a civil servant or government official. He was sentenced to nine years and six months in prison by judge Sérgio Moro. Investigations later revealed that Lula pressured Odebrecht to pay millions of dollars toward the presidential campaign of the leftist Peruvian President Ollanta Humala. On 7 April 2018, Lula turned himself in and began serving his jail sentence. On 9 June 2019, The Intercept released a trove of documents that showed Judge Sergio Moro acted politically in his ruling. Jair Bolsonaro later appointed him The Minister of Justice and Public Security. In December 2017, Ecuadorian Vice President Jorge Glas was removed from office and sentenced to six years in prison after being involved with receiving over $13.5 million in bribes during the Odebrecht scandal. = Economy and social development = The pink tide governments aimed to improve the welfare of the constituencies that brought them to power, which they attempted through measures intended to increase wages, such as raising minimum wages, and softening the effects of neoliberal economic policies through expanding welfare spending, such as subsidising basic services and providing cash transfers to vulnerable groups such as the unemployed, mothers outside of formal employment and the precariat. Morales's government was praised internationally for its reduction of poverty, economic growth and the improvement of indigenous, women and LGBTI rights in the very traditionally- minded Bolivian society. During his first five years in office, Bolivia's Gini coefficient saw an unusually sharp reduction from .6 to .47, indicating a significant drop in income inequality. Before Lula's election, Brazil suffered from one of the highest rates of poverty in the Americas, with the infamous favelas known internationally for its levels of extreme poverty, malnutrition and health problems. Extreme poverty was also a problem in rural areas. During Lula's presidency several social programs like Zero Hunger (Fome Zero) were praised internationally for reducing hunger in Brazil, poverty and inequality while also improving the health and education of the population. Around 29 million people became middle class during Lula's eight years tenure. During Lula's government, Brazil became an economic power and member of BRICS. Lula ended his tenure with 80% approval ratings. In Argentina, the administrations of Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner restored sectoral collective bargaining, strengthening trade unions: unionisation increased from 20 percent of the workforce in the 1990s to 30 percent in the 2010s, and wages rose for an increasing proportion of the working class. Universal allocation per child, a conditional cash transfer programme, was introduced in 2009 for families without formal employment and earning less than the minimum wage who ensured their children attended school, received vaccines and underwent health checks: by 2013 it covered over two million poor families, and by 2015 it covered 29 percent of all Argentinian children. A 2015 analysis by staff at Argentina's National Scientific and Technical Research Council estimated that the programme had increased school attendance for children between the ages of 15 to 17 by 3.9 percent. The Kirchners also increased social spending significantly: upon Fernández de Kirchner leaving office in 2015, Argentina had the second highest level of social spending as a percentage of GDP in Latin America, behind only Chile. Their administrations also achieved a drop of 20 percentage points in the proportion of the population living on three US dollars a day or less. As a result Argentina also became one of the most equal countries in the region according to its Gini coefficient. In Venezuela, as well as increasing spending on social welfare, housing and local infrastructures, Chávez established the Bolivarian missions, decentralised programmes which delivered free services in fields such as healthcare and education as well as subsidised food distribution. Economist from the University of Illinois Rafael Correa was elected as President of Ecuador in the 2006 presidential election following the harsh economic crisis and social turmoil that caused right-wing Lucio Gutiérrez resignation as President. Correa, a practicing Catholic influenced by liberation theology, was pragmatic in his economical approach in a similar manner to Morales in Bolivia and Ecuador soon experienced a non-precedent economic growth that bolstered Correa's popularity to the point that he was the most popular president of the Americas' for several years in a row, with an approval rate between 60 and 85%. Lugo's government was praised for its social reforms, including investments in low-income housing,\\"Paraguay\\" (PDF). the introduction of free treatment in public hospitals,\\"Chap 10\\". the introduction of cash transfers for Paraguay's most impoverished citizens and indigenous rights. Some of the initial results after the first pink tide governments were elected in Latin America included a reduction in the income gap, unemployment, extreme poverty, malnutrition and hunger and rapid increase in literacy. The decrease in these indicators during the same period of time happened faster than in non-Pink Tide governments. Countries like Ecuador, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica experienced notable economic growth during this period whilst Bolivia and El Salvador both saw a notable reduction in poverty according to the World Bank. Economic hardships occurred in countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela as oil and commodity prices declined and according to analysts because of their unsustainable policies. In regard to the economic situation, President of Inter-American Dialogue Michael Shifter stated: \\"The United States–Cuban Thaw occurred with Cuba reapproaching the United States when Cuba's main international partner, Venezuela, began experiencing economic hardships\\".  Political outcome  Following the initiation of the pink tide's policies, the relationship between both left-leaning and right-leaning governments and the public changed. As leftist governments took power in the region, rising commodity prices funded their welfare policies, which lowered inequality and assisted indigenous rights. The overspending of leftist governments in the 2000s resulted in the election of more liberal governments in the 2010s by citizens in the region seeking a sustainable economy, which required potential progressive politicians to reevaluate their policies. However, such advancements changed the location of Latin America's center of the political spectrum, forcing right-wing candidates and succeeding governments to adopt more socially-conscious administrations. Under the Obama administration, which held a less interventionist approach to the region after recognizing that interference would only boost the popularity of populist pink tide leaders like Chávez, Latin American approval of the United States began to improve as well. By the mid-2010s, \\"negative views of China were widespread\\" due to the substandard conditions of Chinese goods, unjust professional actions, cultural differences, damage to the Latin American environment and perceptions of Chinese interventionism.  Resurgence  During 2018 and 2019, two new countries entered the Pink Tide, Mexico with the electoral victory of Andrés Manuel López Obrador in the 2018 Mexican general election and Laurentino Cortizo in the 2019 Panamanian general election, whilst incumbent right-wing president Mauricio Macri of Argentina lost against left-wing Peronist Alberto Fernández alongside Cristina Fernández de Kirchner as running mate in the 2019 Argentine general election and in Colombia the ruling right-wing party of President Iván Duque and Alvaro Uribe faced a notorious defeat at the 2019 regional elections. A series of very violent protests against austerity measures and income inequality scattered throughout Latin America including the 2019 Chilean protests, 2018–19 Haitian protests and the 2019 Ecuadorian protests, whilst in Honduras, anti-government protest requesting the resignation of Juan Orlando Hernández for the accusations of narcotics connections against him also spread.  Term  As a term, the pink tide had become prominent in contemporary discussion of Latin American politics in the early 21st century. Origins of the term may be linked to a statement by Larry Rohter, a New York Times reporter in Montevideo who characterized the 2004 presidential election of Tabaré Vázquez as leader of Uruguay as \\"not so much a red tide [...] as a pink one\\". The term seems to be a play on words based on red tide (a biological phenomenon rather than a political one) with red – a color long associated with communism – being replaced with the lighter tone of pink to indicate the more moderate socialist ideas that gained strength. Institute for Policy Studies: Latin America's Pink Tide? Despite the presence of a number of Latin American governments which professed to embracing a leftist ideology, it is difficult to categorize Latin American states \\"according to dominant political tendencies, like a red-blue post-electoral map of the United States\\". According to the Institute for Policy Studies, a leftist think-tank based in Washington, D.C.: :While this political shift was difficult to quantify, its effects were widely noticed. According to the Institute for Policy Studies, 2006 meetings of the South American Summit of Nations and the Social Forum for the Integration of Peoples demonstrated that certain discussions that used to take place on the margins of the dominant discourse of neoliberalism, now moved to the center of public debate. In the 2011 book The Paradox of Democracy in Latin America: Ten Country Studies of Division and Resilience, Isbester states:  Reception  López Obrador with Pedro Sánchez in January 2019 In 2006, The Arizona Republic recognized the growing pink tide, stating: \\"A couple of decades ago, the region, long considered part of the United States' backyard, was basking in a resurgence of democracy, sending military despots back to their barracks\\", further recognizing the \\"disfavor\\" with the United States and the concerns of \\"a wave of nationalist, leftist leaders washing across Latin America in a 'pink tide'\\" among United States officials. A 2007 report from the Inter Press Service news agency said how \\"elections results in Latin America appear to have confirmed a left-wing populist and anti-U.S. trend – the so-called \\"pink tide\\" – which [...] poses serious threats to Washington's multibillion-dollar anti-drug effort in the Andes\\".\\"Challenges 2006–2007: A Bad Year for Empire\\". . Inter Press Service. In 2014, Albrecht Koschützke and Hajo Lanz, directors of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation for Central America, discussed the \\"hope for greater social justice and a more participatory democracy\\" following the election of leftist leaders, though the foundation recognized that such elections \\"still do not mean a shift to the left\\", but that they are \\"the result of an ostensible loss of prestige from the right- wing parties that have traditionally ruled\\".

RAF West Beckham opened in 1938 and closed in 1958. The station included a transmitter site, receiver site, generator site, underground reserves as well as two separate camps.  History  During the Second World War, several WAAFs were stationed here and B Site 'Marl Pit WAAF camp' located in nearby Lower Bodham is well known to the local population. The other accommodation site was known as C Site, home to Royal Norfolk Regiment in 1940, followed by Military Police and then RAF Regiment. The radar site itself located at West Beckham was known as A Site. The station Commander during World War II was famous dance band leader Marius B. Winter (1898–1956). Due to his background in the entertainment industry he was able to get good people in to entertain the people at the camp. Every Sunday night, a dance would be held at B Site which was popular with the RAF, Army and locals alike. Winter was at West Beckham from 1942 until 1946. Other Commanding Officers included F/L Gardner and F/L Ingham before Winter assumed command. During the 1950s the Commanding Officers were F/L J.H.W Griffith, F/L T.Bradford, F/L R.W Chaston, F/L C.A Brown, F/L Keith Yexley followed by F/L William R. Jones. Sometime during the late 1940s there was a F/L Melville in charge. F/L Turpin an Australian and former Lancaster pilot was a radar officer at the station and sometimes acting CO. In the 1950s very few dances were held at the station, maybe the number was in single figures. However each Friday night an event known as the Bodham Hop was held in Bodham village hall and was very popular with airmen and local girls alike. During the war shift changes at RAF West Beckham were at 8 am, 1 pm and 6 pm. During the 1950s radar at West Beckham was done on a dawn til dusk basis apart from during the odd exercise when 24 hours coverage was often provided. After the Second World War, C Site went into care and maintenance. A Site closed in 1956 shortly followed by B Site in 1958. B Site lasted longer as it was also used by personnel from RAF Bard Hill. The station had close links with the local fighter station RAF Matlaske. RAF West Beckham reported to the filter room at RAF Watnall which was the HQ to No. 12 Group RAF during its life. Originally RAF West Beckham was parented to RAF Bircham Newton, then RAF Wittering and finally RAF Coltishall. The distance to Bircham Newton and especially Wittering proved a major disadvantage with daily trips to Coltishall needed for supplies. There were four metal transmitter pylons which were high and four wooden receiver pylons which were high. The wooden masts were blown up in the summer of 1957, the metal masts were taken down in late 1957 and early 1958. Remains The station fence lasted until the early 1980s by when it had almost rusted away. Today the station is in private ownership with many of the buildings still in existence.

(1998) \\"Jerry Kennedy\\". In The Encyclopedia of Country Music. Paul Kingsbury, ed. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 277–278. is an American record producer, songwriter and guitar player. Early years Kennedy was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. As a child, he recalls \\"beating on broomsticks and other things\\" as his initial forays into music-making. His first guitar was a Silvertone, which his parents bought for him when he was \\"eight or nine.\\" He began taking lessons from a local guitar legend, Tillman Franks. Kennedy attended various shows around the Shreveport area as a boy, including the legendary Louisiana Hayride. One show he particularly remembers attending is Hank Williams's last show at the Shreveport Municipal Auditorium saying, \\"I was a kid sittin' on the front row.\\" In 1954, Elvis Presley performed on Louisiana Hayride, and Kennedy was in attendance with a friend. He recalls their frustration with the young girls who screamed incessantly, preventing his friend and him from hearing Scotty Moore, Presley's guitar player, clearly during the performance. \\"[W]e got mad at all of the girls screamin', because we couldn't hear Scotty when Elvis was doin' his shakin'. It upset us that we couldn't hear the guitar.\\" Career Kennedy signed a recording contract with RCA Records at age 11. He subsequently recorded several singles, several of which included contributions by Chet Atkins. Thereafter Kennedy became something of a teen idol at his high school. Though he never became a star as a vocalist, he sang background vocals for several Mercury Records artists as a teenager. After working in recording sessions around Shreveport for several years, he was convinced to move to Nashville by Irving Green, the president of Mercury Records. Kennedy arrived in Nashville just as the country music boom of the 1960s was getting under way. Soon after his arrival, he was asked to work as a talent scout for Mercury's country subsidiary, Smash Records, and to begin producing and also playing in recording sessions. Kennedy and Tommy Tomlinson, a Louisiana Hayride star from Minden, Louisiana, developed four instrumental albums for Mercury Records in 1960. The albums entitled \\"Tom & Jerry\\", cover all genres of music, also included Hank Garland, Boots Randolph, Bob Moore, and Harold Bradley. Jerry Kennedy Orchestra participate to the complete sessions recording for Johnny Hallyday in 1962. Five discs were issued from these sessions: Johnny Sings America's Rockin' Hits; The 1962 Nashville Sessions, Vol. 2: The French Recordings, reissued on CD as Nashville Session 62, in 1990; a CD 5 titles of the Club Dial \\"C'est fini miss Molly\\" and a CD include in Johnny Hallyday: Le Livre.

Kennedy played on or produced nearly all of the country music records of Jerry Lee Lewis.CMT Profile of Kennedy In 1968, Shelby Singleton, who had served something of a mentor to Kennedy, left Smash. Kennedy took the reins, and ran Smash Records until 1970, when Mercury shut down that label and appointed him as the head of its country music division. His time at Mercury produced memorable hits from country music artists such as Roger Miller, Reba McEntire, The Statler Brothers, Johnny Rodriguez, and Tom T. Hall.Bio of Bryan Kennedy, Jerry Kennedy's son . Hall, speaking in 1974, credited Kennedy with getting him started in the business. \\"I had a lot of good songs I couldn't get recorded. Jerry Kennedy of Mercury Records asked me to record them, so I did.\\" After receiving this encouragement from Kennedy, Hall went on to record nine LPs with Mercury Records from 1968 to 1974, including his famous \\"Harper Valley PTA\\".Sarasota Herald-Tribune, 24 February 1974, \\"Hall Agrees: 'If It Sounds Country, It's Country.'\\", retrieved, 1 January 2010. Kennedy himself left Mercury in 1984 to start JK Productions, through which he produced recordings by The Statler Brothers, Connie Smith, Mel McDaniel, Reba McEntire and other artists,. In 1987, Kennedy and David Briggs released a cut for Mercury Records credited to Joe Kenyon, which was a cover of Vangelis' \\"Hymne\\". E & J Gallo Winery used this version in its commercials, and it went to number 33 on Hot Country Songs. Kennedy is the father of songwriter, musician and producer Gordon Kennedy.

History The most recognized origin of the term (online) community manager is in the computer games industry with the advent of MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-playing Games) in the mid 1990s. Roles have expanded to include a wide variety of responsibilities and skill-sets including social media management, marketing, product development, PR, and customer support. Game community management often includes supporting open communications between the developer and player community. While the term \\"online community manager\\" may not have been used at the time, the role has also existed since online systems first began offering features and functions that allowed for community creation. These early efforts, in the form of bulletin board systems, had leaders known as system operators or Sysops. The early 1990s saw the growth of mainstream online computer services such as Prodigy, CompuServe and America Online. Prominent features of these services included communities which went by various names; Special Interest Groups, Communities of Interest and so on. And their leaders were often referred to as community managers. General roles Online community managers may serve a variety of roles depending on the nature and purpose of their online community, which may or may not be part of a profit motivated enterprise. Patti Anklam has asserted that \\"Every network has an underlying purpose\\" and motivations for such network creation include; Mission, Business, Idea, Learning or Personal.  pages=4,31,108 She says such leaders hold the collective vision, create and manage relationships and manage collaborative processes. Anklam does not distinguish a fundamental difference for these roles as related to the varying purposes of network, (i.e. community), creation. Professional roles Community managers are involved in the computer games industry, branded online communities, online research communities, corporate blogs, and other social media marketing and research activities. Roles have expanded to include a wide variety of responsibilities and skill-sets including social media management, marketing, product support and development, PR, and customer support. At the core, community management encompasses a little bit of each of these, while retaining its core tenet - ensuring open communications between the developer and community.

It is located in the Gulf of Mexico and is accessible only by boat. The refuge was established in 1904 through executive order of President Theodore Roosevelt and is the second- oldest refuge in the National Wildlife Refuge System. History Theodore Roosevelt at Breton NWR in 1915 In 1904, Roosevelt heard about the destruction of birds and their eggs on Chandeleur and Breton Islands and soon afterward created Breton NWR. He visited in June 1915 after his presidency had ended; it is the only National Wildlife Refuge Roosevelt ever visited. The islands have been the site of a lighthouse station (eventually destroyed by Hurricane Katrina), a quarantine station, a small fishing village and an oil production facility. Those man-made structures were destroyed by nature and only the birds remain. Fishermen, birdwatchers and artists such as Walter Inglis Anderson visit the island. Breton NWR includes Breton Island in Plaquemines Parish and all of the Chandeleur Islands in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. The barrier islands that make up Breton NWR are remnants of the Mississippi River's former St. Bernard Delta, which was active about 2,000 years ago. These barrier islands are dynamic; their sizes and shapes constantly are altered by tropical storms, wind, and tidal action. The area above mean high tide is approximately . Elevations on Breton NWR range from sea level to above mean sea level. Early literature on Breton and the Chandeleur Islands mentions trees and a generally higher elevation than exists today. In 1915, several families and a school were located on Breton Island. Prior to the hurricane of that year, the island was evacuated. The hurricane destroyed the settlement, and it was never rebuilt. All of the federally owned lands, except for North Breton Island, in Breton NWR became part of the National Wilderness Preservation System on January 3, 1975 (Public Law 93-632). North Breton was excluded because an oil facility, owned by Kerr-McGee, Inc., was located on that island. The Breton Wilderness, according to the Clean Air Act, is listed as a Class I Prevention of Significant Deterioration Area. The only visible improvement within the wilderness was the Chandeleur Lighthouse on the north end of the islands; the lighthouse was constructed before the turn of the 20th century. Fauna Breton NWR provides habitat for colonies of nesting wading birds and seabirds, as well as wintering shorebirds and waterfowl. Twenty- three species of seabirds and shorebirds frequently use the refuge, and 13 species nest on the various islands. The most abundant nesters are brown pelicans, laughing gulls, and royal, Caspian, and Sandwich terns. Waterfowl winter near the refuge islands and use the adjacent shallows, marshes, and sounds for feeding and for protection during inclement weather. Redheads and lesser scaup account for the majority of waterfowl use. Other wildlife species found on the refuge include coypu, rabbits, raccoons, and loggerhead sea turtles. Flora The dominant vegetation on Breton NWR are black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), groundsel bush (Baccharis halimifolia), and wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera). Shallow bay waters around the islands support beds of manatee grass (Cymodocea filiformis), shoal grass (Halodule wrightii), turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum), and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima). Storm and hurricane damage containment boom in background. The 2005 storm season was very bad for the pelicans of Breton NWR. In June, Tropical Storm Arlene moved through the Gulf of Mexico. The storm washed over the islands at a time when many juvenile pelicans were unable to escape and many eggs were still in the nests. On top of that, an oil spill washed directly into the nesting areas and many young pelicans were covered with oil. Some of the pelicans were rescued, rehabilitated and returned to the refuge but many more did not survive. Breton NWR also took a direct hit from Hurricane Katrina. There was significant erosion of the islands. Large areas of beach and marsh were destroyed and much of the vegetation that stabilizes the islands and provides habitat for the pelicans and other animals was uprooted or damaged. The Chandeleur Island Lighthouse was destroyed. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is working with their partners to respond to the many problems created by the damage to the islands. It would take many years for the islands to recover naturally (if ever) so they will do what they can to rebuild and re-vegetate the islands. They are also monitoring the brown pelicans and other birds that return to nest on the islands and nearby, less desirable habitat to determine the long- term impact on this endangered species. A wildlife recovery seems to be occurring, however. As many as 2,000 brown pelican nests have been reported on the refuge in 2007. The pelican nests, eggs and chicks remain vulnerable through the hurricane season and until they have fledged and can forage on their own. Oil spill On April 30, 2010, an oil spill from the rig Deepwater Horizon approached the wildlife refuge. The refuge was closed on May 7, 2010 to limit disturbances of nesting seabirds and allow cleanup operations to proceed unimpeded.

History There was a small aerodrome, details of which are not known, at Matlaske before the war started, then the site was approved for requisition by the Air Ministry in August 1939, with construction works beginning in the summer of 1940. RAF Matlaske became operational in October 1940 as a satellite station to RAF Coltishall when Spitfires of No. 72 Squadron were briefly dispersed there. The airfield was grass-covered throughout its life and had two main landing runs, of which one was with the other being .  Luftwaffe attack  Memorial near the site On 29 October 1940 the Luftwaffe attacked the airfield at Matlaske. This attack followed the bombing of RAF Coltishall two days before which had necessitated the re-location of some of the Spitfires of 72 Squadron to Matlaske. Five Dornier aircraft carried out the attack, strafing the base and causing damage to parked aircraft as well as inflicting several casualties to personnel. On 12 May 1941 the Luftwaffe attacked the base again but this time they bombed using Incendiary bombs. The attack had limited success with only minor damage caused and no personnel casualties.  United States Army Air Force  In September 1942, the airfield was allocated to the 8th United States Army Air Forces ostensibly for use as a fighter base by Republic P-47 Thunderbolts of the 56th Fighter Group from RAF Kings Cliffe but nothing is recorded of any use by that unit.  Royal Air Force  From November 1941 to August 1942 the base was host to No. 137 Squadron, one of only two RAF squadrons to fly the unique twin-engine fighter, the Westland Whirlwind, when it was engaged on East coast convoy patrols and anti-shipping tasks. It was supported by the Air Sea Rescue squadron No. 278, Matlaske-based from October 1941 to April 1942. Nos. 56, 195, 245, 266 and 609 Squadrons flying Hawker Typhoons, plus Nos. 19, 222, 229, 453, 602 and 611 Squadrons flying the Supermarine Spitfire, and No. 601 Squadron - the only one flying the Hawker Hurricane from here, were based or detached here at various times between October 1940 to April 1945. From April to May 1943, No. 1489 Flight RAF conducted target towings with Hawker Henleys, Westland Lysanders, M.25 Martinets and M.9 Masters, which were based at RAF Coltishall and RAF Sutton Bridge and detached to Matlaske as required. In August 1943, the airfield was transferred to Care and Maintenance and the facilities improved. Reopened in September 1944 it was used further by 3, 19, 56, 65, 122, 229, 451, 453, 485, 486 and 602 Squadrons at various times until April 1945, the RAF vacating the site in October 1945.

He is best known for his work related to the Pan-American Exposition. Life and work Named after the famous painter, Beck was the oldest of the eight children of J. Augustus Beck, an accomplished artist who designed the bas relief at the foot of the Washington Monument. When Beck was 20, after studying with his father, he traveled to Europe for two years to study in Munich with the famous landscape artist, Paul Weber, and then at the Académie Julian in Paris. After his return to the States, Beck began his first major commissioned work, a series of murals for the capitol building in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Around this time he also settled in Lockport, New York and established a studio in Buffalo. Beck produced a wide variety of artworks including stained glass windows, life size masks, etchings, oils, watercolors, and large murals, including a mural of the opening of the Erie Canal, an oil painting of the pilgrims landing at Plymouth, Massachusetts, and a portrait of General Lafayette among others. Beck maintained his studio in Buffalo for thirty years. He went on to design the logo for the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon. Beck died in 1947 and is buried at the Lockport Glenwood Cemetery.

Each medication will require a specific dose; some may need to be taken at certain times of the day or night, with or without food; and others may induce drowsiness or other side effects. A live-in caregiver can ensure medications are taken correctly, refilled as needed, and monitor the client for signs of adverse reactions. It is important that the client’s healthcare provider educate caregivers about their medication needs to optimize long-term management at home.Ferguson et al, (2015).

In addition to daily care, professional live-in caregivers can be engaged for a few hours a day, or for several days a week, so family members may work part-time, run errands, attend to their own personal needs, or simply relax. Live-in care can also be arranged whenever family caregivers take a vacation or otherwise need to be away from home overnight. Benefits of live-in care Professional live-in caregivers allow their clients to avoid moving to a nursing home, assisted living, or other long-term care facility. This benefits the client by: * Freeing them from strict schedules and regimens imposed by many long-term care facilities. * Allowing the client to retain as much independence as possible. * Ensuring family and friends may visit whenever they like. * Enabling the client to find comfort in familiar surroundings and happy memories. * Ensuring they can retain cherished possessions, pets, or hobbies. * Allowing the client to continue personal habits and favorite routines. * Providing a healthier environment, with less risk of exposure to contagious illnesses that are often present in a clinical setting.

Canada: Live-In Caregiver Program  The Live-In Caregiver Program (LIC) was offered and administered by the government of Canada and was the primary means by which foreign caregivers could come to Canada as eldercare, special needs, and childcare providers. The program ended on November 30, 2014, and a regular work permit has been needed since then.Citizenship and Immigration Canada While such services were offered by Canadian citizens or foreign immigrants with Permanent Residence status (PR), government provisions for a room and board deduction as well as a basic rate of pay that frequently total provincial minimum wage standard allowed for the program to be more affordable for many families. Caregivers who came to Canada through the program are eligible to apply for PR status after working a minimum of two years within four years of their arrival (plus 3 months). For many who would not otherwise qualify for PR status under any other category, this was one of the motivations for participation. Critics contended that as a means of boosting immigration to Canada, the program failed to attract caregivers from a diverse pool of countries. For example, the Philippine nanny is often improperly stereotyped as the program's main market for applicants. While there may be a large and functional industry in the Philippines to produce qualified applicants, individuals from nearly every nation can qualify. Some caregiver placement agencies are substantially broader through their international advertising and the use of immigration legal services. Standard qualifications were regulated federally, though conditions of employment were determined at a provincial level. Requirements included a minimum of 6 months of training or 1 year of compatible employment within the last 3 years - though various exceptions and additional stipulations do apply. Citizenship and Immigration Canada Such regulations and complicating bureaucratic procedures are the driving force behind the creation of Live-In Caregiver (or Nanny) placement agencies, who act as a mediator between families, caregivers, and the government - providing support for documentation and advice on the program. http://action.web.ca/home/narcc/attach/Unskilled%20Labour-%20Canada%5C's%20Live- in%20Caregiver%20Program.pdf References Immigration to Canada ","title":"Live-In Caregiver"},{"id":"18776822","text":"Engraving of Hendrik Hondius portrays three women affected by the plague. Work based on original drawing by Pieter Brueghel, who supposedly witnessed a subsequent outbreak in 1564 in Flanders The dancing plague (or dance epidemic) of 1518 was a case of dancing mania that occurred in Strasbourg, Alsace (now modern-day France), in the Holy Roman Empire in July 1518. Somewhere between 50 and 400 people took to dancing for days.  Events  The outbreak began in July 1518 when a woman began to dance fervently in a street in Strasbourg. Historical documents, including \\"physician notes, cathedral sermons, local and regional chronicles, and even notes issued by the Strasbourg city council\\" are clear that the victims danced. It is not known why. Historical sources agree that there was an outbreak of dancing after a single woman started dancing, a group of mostly young women joined in, and the dancing did not seem to die down. It lasted for such a long time that it attracted the attention of the Strasbourg magistrate and bishop, and some number of doctors ultimately intervened, putting the afflicted in a hospital. Controversy Controversy exists over whether people ultimately danced to their deaths. Some sources claim that, for a period, the plague killed around fifteen people per day; however, the sources of the city of Strasbourg at the time of the events did not mention the number of deaths, or even if there were fatalities. There do not appear to be any sources contemporaneous to the events that make note of any fatalities. The main source for this claim comes from John Waller, who has written several journal articles on the subject and the book A Time to Dance, a Time to Die: The Extraordinary Story of the Dancing Plague of 1518. The sources cited by Waller that mention deaths were all from later retellings of the events. There is also uncertainty around the identity of the initial dancer (either an unnamed woman or \\"Frau Troffea\\") and the number of dancers involved (somewhere between 50 and 400). Modern theories  Food poisoning  Some believe the dancing could have been brought on by food poisoning caused by the toxic and psychoactive chemical products of ergot fungi, which grows commonly on grains (such as rye) used for baking bread. Ergotamine is the main psychoactive product of ergot fungi; it is structurally related to the drug lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25) and is the substance from which LSD-25 was originally synthesized. The same fungus has also been implicated in other major historical anomalies, including the Salem witch trials, although ergot alone would not cause unusual behavior or hallucinations except when combined with opiates. However, John Waller in The Lancet argues that \\"this theory does not seem tenable, since it is unlikely that those poisoned by ergot could have danced for days at a time. Nor would so many people have reacted to its psychotropic chemicals in the same way. The ergotism theory also fails to explain why virtually every outbreak occurred somewhere along the Rhine and Moselle rivers, areas linked by water but with quite different climates and crops\\".  Stress-induced mass hysteria  This could have been a florid example of psychogenic movement disorder happening in mass hysteria or mass psychogenic illness, which involves many individuals suddenly exhibiting the same bizarre behavior. The behavior spreads rapidly and broadly in an epidemic pattern. This kind of comportment could have been caused by elevated levels of psychological stress, caused by the ruthless years (even by the rough standards of the early modern period) the people of Alsace were suffering. Waller speculates that the dancing was \\"stress-induced psychosis\\" on a mass level, since the region where the people danced was riddled with starvation and disease, and the inhabitants tended to be superstitious. Seven other cases of dancing plague were reported in the same region during the medieval era. This psychogenic illness could have created a chorea (from the Greek khoreia meaning \\"to dance\\"), a situation comprising random and intricate unintentional movements that flit from body part to body part. Diverse choreas (St. Vitus' dance, St. John's dance, tarantism) were labeled in the Middle Ages referring to the independent epidemics of \\"dancing mania\\" that happened in central Europe, particularly at the time of the plague.

Its efficacy for reducing maternal deaths due to obstetrical hemorrhage is being researched. Obstetrical hemorrhage is heavy bleeding of a woman during or shortly after a pregnancy. Current estimates suggest over 300,000 women die every year, of which 99% occurs in developing countries, most of which are preventable. Many women in resource-poor settings deliver far from health-care facilities. Once hemorrhage has been identified, many women die before reaching or receiving adequate treatment. The NASG can be used to keep women alive until they can get the treatment they need. Background Every year, an estimated 342,900 women die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth, 99% of these deaths occur in developing countries. Worldwide, for every 100,000 live births, about 251 women die. In some industrialized countries such as the U.S, this is 13 deaths for every 100,000 live babies born with American women having a lifetime risk of 1 in 2,100 of dying from childbirth related complications. However, in some countries, such as Afghanistan up to 1,600 women die for every 100,000 live births and women have a 1 in 11 lifetime risk of maternal death.UNICEF. Information by Country - Statistics - Women's Health. Accessed 29 August 2011. For every woman who dies, there are 30 women who suffer a disability as a result of pregnancy or childbirth related complications (a maternal morbidity) and 10 who experience a 'near miss mortality' (a life- threatening obstetric complication).\\"Beyond the Numbers: Reviewing Maternal Deaths and Complications to Make Preganancy Safer\\". Geneva: WHO; 2004. Morbidities can be serious, lifelong ailments which compromise a woman's health, productivity, quality of life, family health and ability to participate in community life. If a mother dies after childbirth, the newborn is ten times more likely to die before the age of two, other children are more likely to suffer from decreased nutrition and decreased schooling. Many motherless families find it difficult to survive, often with older children having to drop out of school in order to work to help support the family or being sent to live with a relatives intact family. In addition to this, maternal and newborn deaths are estimated to cost the world $15 billion in lost productivity annually, with maternal health proven to support a country's economic growth and cut poverty. Maternal death and disability is a human rights issue. It also means hardships and loss of productivity for families, communities and nations. This is of such great concern that in 2000, world leaders decided that improving maternal health should be one of the 8 Millennium Development Goals for the international community. The leading cause of maternal mortality (deaths from pregnancy and childbirth related complications) is obstetric hemorrhage in which a woman bleeds heavily, most often immediately after giving birth.WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA. \\"Maternal mortality in 2000: Estimates developed by WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA\\"; 2004. A woman dies every 4 minutes from this kind of complication. A woman can bleed to death in two hours or less, and in rural areas, where hospitals may be days away, this leaves little hope for women suffering from hemorrhage.Maine D. Safe Motherhood Programs: Options and Issues. New York: Center for Population and Family Health, Columbia University; 1993. Also, in areas that have limited resources, clinics and hospitals might not have the staff or supplies needed to save a woman's life. Women die waiting for treatment.AMDD. Workbook: Using the UN Process Indicators of Emergency Obstetric Services. Questions and Answers.: The Averting Maternal Death and Disability Program (AMDD); May 2003. There are some emerging technologies which are currently being researched and implemented that seek to prevent these unnecessary deaths. One of these is the NASG which is a low-technology first-aid device that can be placed around the lower body of a woman who has gone into shock from obstetric bleeding. This garment decreases blood loss, recovers women from shock and keeps them alive while they are traveling to a hospital or awaiting treatment. History In the 1900s an inflatable pressure suit was developed by George Crile. It was used to maintain blood pressure during surgery. In the 1940s and after undergoing numerous modifications, the suit was refined for use as an anti- gravity suit (G-suit). Further modification led to its use in the Vietnam War for resuscitating and stabilizing soldiers with traumatic injuries before and during transportation. In the 1970s the G-suit was modified into a half-suit which became known as MAST (Military anti-shock trousers) or PASG (Pneumatic Anti-Shock Garment).Kaplan B, Poole F, Flagg J, inventors; David Clark Company Inc assignee. \\"Medical pneumatic trouser for emergency autotransfusion\\". United States Patent 3933150. USA 02/08/1974. During the 1980s the PASG garment became used more and more by emergency rescue services to stabilize patients with shock due to lower body hemorrhage. During the 1990s the PASG was added to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, making it part of the recommended treatment for use by obstetricians and gynecologists in the USA.ACOS. American College of Surgeons, Committee on Trauma. Advanced Trauma Life Support Manual. Chicago: American College of Surgeons; 1992. However, it was removed from the guidelines later and is no longer on the ACOG guidelines. From the 1970s, NASA/Ames was involved in developing a non-pneumatic version of the anti-shock garment. This was originally used for hemophiliac children, but has since been developed into the garment known as the Non-pneumatic Anti- Shock Garment (NASG).Haggerty J. \\"Anti Shock Garment\\". 1996 The non-pneumatic anti-shock garment is now off-patent and produced in several different locations. The use of the garment for obstetrical hemorrhage in low-resource settings began in 2002 when Dr. Carol Brees and Dr. Paul Hensleigh introduced the garment into a hospital in Pakistan and reported on a case series of its use. Suellen Miller and colleagues in Mexico, Egypt and Nigeria have completed studies of the NASG (also named the LifeWrap) for obstetric hemorrhage in hospitals in these countriesMiller S, Turan JM, Ojengbede A, Ojengbede O, Fathalla MF, Morhason-Bello IO, et al. \\"The pilot study of the non-pneumatic anti-shock garment (NASG) in women with severe obstetric hemorrhage: Combined results from Egypt and Nigeria\\". International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics. 2006; 94(Supplement 2):S154–6. with studies ongoing at primary health care centers in Zambia and Zimbabwe.http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00488462 An implementation program with the NASG as part of a Continuum of Care for Post-Partum Hemorrhage (CCPPH) has been underway since 2008 in India, Nigeria, Tanzania and Peru.http://www.pathfind.org/site/PageServer?pagename=Programs_Nigeria_Stories_NASG08 The NGO Pathfinder International is the lead implementing organization on the CCPPH project. Dr. Suellen Miller has done extensive clinical trials with the device as an obstetric first aid. The U.S. based non-profit organization, Pathfinder International has worked on developing the Continuum of Care model. How it works The non-pneumatic anti-shock garment is a simple neoprene and Velcro device that looks like the bottom half of a wetsuit cut into segments. It can be used to treat shock, resuscitate, stabilize and prevent further bleeding in women with obstetric hemorrhage. When in shock, the brain, heart and lungs are deprived of oxygen because blood accumulates in the lower abdomen and legs. The NASG reverses shock by returning blood to the heart, lungs and brain. This restores the woman's consciousness, pulse and blood pressure. Additionally, the NASG decreases bleeding from the parts of the body compressed under it. Mechanisms of action are based upon laws of physics. Recent research has identified that the pressure applied by the NASG serves to significantly increase the resistive index of the internal iliac artery (which is responsible for supplying the majority of blood flow to the uterus via the uterine arteries). Another recent study has shown the NASG to decrease blood flow in the distal aorta. After a simple training session, anyone can put the garment on a bleeding woman. Once her bleeding is controlled, she can be safely transported to a referral hospital for emergency obstetrical care. The non-pneumatic anti-shock garment is light, flexible and comfortable for the wearer. It has been designed to allow perineal access so that examinations and vaginal procedures can be performed without it being removed. Upon application a patient's vital signs are often quickly restored and consciousness regained. It is extremely important not to remove the NASG before a woman receives IV fluids, blood and before all vital signs are restored. Early removal can be dangerous and even fatal. Research and implementation In Egypt and Nigeria, in separate and combined analyses, findings showed that women treated with the NASG fared much better than women who were not treated with the NASG. Results showed significant reductions in blood loss, rate of emergency hysterectomy and incidence of morbidity and mortality. Analyses examining the use of the NASG on cases of uterine atony, postpartum hemorrhage, and non- atonic etiologies (ante and postpartum) found similar results. Other analyses found that the NASG additionally resulted in a more rapid recovery from shock, helped women overcome treatment delays and had a similarly strong ameliorative effect on women in severe shock. A combined analysis on 1442 women recently published, examined the effect of the NASG on women with obstetric hemorrhage. Despite being in a worse condition at study entry, negative outcomes were significantly reduced in the NASG phase: mean measured blood loss decreased from 444 mL to 240 mL (p<0.001), maternal mortality decreased from 6.3% to 3.5% (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35–0.89), severe morbidities from 3.7% to 0.7% (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08–0.50), and emergency hysterectomy from 8.9% to 4.0% (RR 0.44, 0.23–0.86). In multiple logistic regression, there was a 55% reduced odds of mortality during the NASG phase (aOR 0.45, 0.27–0.77). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent either mortality or severe morbidity was 18 (12–36). Qualitative research in Mexico and Nigeria has examined acceptance of the NASG and found that overall, there were positive reactions to the garment as a relevant technology for saving women's lives. Research is currently ongoing in Zambia and Zimbabwe to investigate whether the NASG is more successful if implemented at primary health care facilities where hemorrhage is first identified. In 2012, the World Health Organization included the NASG in its recommendations for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage.

Kitchener Davies, was a Welsh poet and playwright who wrote mostly in the Welsh language. Davies's work is highly influenced by the industrial landscape of his adopted village of Trealaw in the Rhondda Valley and his own nationalistic beliefs. Biography Born and brought up in Llangeitho in Ceredigion, Davies spent his working life in the newly industrialised coalfields of the Rhondda Valley. The sometimes bleak conditions of his early life, especially as his early adulthood coincided with the economic despair of the depression, is reflected in his plays. Davies was part of the Cadwgan Circle, a literary group of likeminded writers from Rhondda, that centred their image of Wales on the new industrialised society they were brought up in. Members of the Circle included Rhydwen Williams, Pennar Davies and Gareth Alban Davies. His early play Cwm Glo (1934) was seen as controversial because it dealt with the social impact of the depression without the cultural romanticism which was stereotypical of Welsh literature. His verse play Meini Gwagedd (1944) is set in the Tregaron area and again looks at the harshness of the industrialised Wales and the self-destructive nature of people when drawn into a spiral of ill fortune. In 1945, Davies stood in the United Kingdom general election, standing in the Rhondda East constituency as the first member of Plaid Cymru to contest the seat in the Rhondda Valleys. He came last out of three candidates, gaining 2,123 votes (6.1%).Williams (1996), pg. 161 The next election, in 1950 he ran again, this time the Rhondda West constituency seat. He increased his vote to 6.6% and then improved this in the 1951 election when he polled slightly higher with 7.7% of the vote, again in the Rhondda West constituency.Williams (1996), pg. 164 James Kitchener Davies is buried at Trealaw Cemetery in Trealaw.

The first commanding officer was Major Dave Ely, RCA; the operational commanding officer was Major D.W. Blyth, RCA. In England the squadron operated under the overall control of No. 70 Group, RAF Fighter Command; prior to deployment to the European continent, the squadron was transferred to No. 84 Group, Second Tactical Air Force (2 TAF). In January 1945, the squadron was deployed to RAF Penshurst, deploying to the Netherlands in March 1945. The squadron flew its first operational sortie over the enemy front in the Netherlands on March 22, 1945. The principal aircraft flown in action was the Taylorcraft Auster Mk. IV and V. After V-E Day on May 8, 1945, the squadron was tasked with flying mail and passengers for First Canadian Army. The squadron continued flying like duties for the Canadian Army Occupation Force (CAOF) until the spring of 1946. 664 (AOP) Squadron, RCAF, was disbanded at Bad Zwischenahn, Germany, on 31 May 1946. The squadron had no motto or heraldic badge assigned to it. Although the squadron's trained aircrew observers performed yeoman service in aerial action against the enemy, aircrew associations across Canada did not grant membership to AOP observers, as those aircrew were not officially issued with cloth wings during the war.

The museum is housed in the Johanneum at the Neumarkt in Dresden. The Johanneum was built between 1586 and 1590; it is one of the oldest museum buildings in Dresden.Fritz Löffler: Das alte Dresden - Geschichte seiner Bauten. 16th ed. Leipzig: Seemann, 2006,  History  left The history of the Dresden Transport Museum begins on 1 May 1952. On that day, negotiations started between the Hochschule für Verkehrswesen (High School for Transportation) and the Ministry of Transport for the construction of a transport museum in the German Democratic Republic. The museum was mainly intended to house the exhibits of the Saxon Railway Museum that had been evacuated during the Second World War. After Dresden was confirmed as the location, the first vehicles were stabled in a locomotive shed at Dresden's Neustadt station. Six employees began the development of the museum, and by 1953, two small exhibitions were on display. The actual opening in the then still badly damaged Johanneum took place in 1956. The first exhibition showed on the ground floor \\"120 years of Saxon Transport history.\\" The first director was Elfriede Rehbein. On 24 November 1958, the museum was transferred into the ownership of the Ministry of Transport. Renovation of the interior was completed in 1966, and the façade followed in 1968. The roof was not covered in copper, but in Duraluminium in keeping with aircraft construction techniques. Since the inauguration of the aviation exhibition in the 1970s, all means of transport, including railway, cars and bicycles, shipping, and air traffic, have been on display in the museum. Because of the limited space in the Johanneum, not all the exhibits are based here. Numerous locomotives are stationed in the former Deutsche Reichsbahn locomotive depot (Betriebswerk or Bw) at Dresden-Altstadt. 303a Furthermore, several vehicles have been loaned to other museums. The lack of space in the Johanneum prompted several discussions during the 1990s about moving the museum. However, the plan was not realized for financial reasons.  Exhibition areas  Historical aeroplane in the foyer The museum is divided into the following exhibition areas: * Railway * Cars * Trams - no longer displayed in the museum, transferred to Tram Museum Dresden e.V., Trachenberger Str. 38, 01129 Dresden * Bicycles and motorbikes * Air travel * Sea travel The German tourism website www.germany-tourism.de describes a visit to the museum as \\"like stepping into another world. Its unparalleled collection includes historical examples from pre-industrial eras, post-1850 vehicles, and unique exhibits with special historical significance - from delicate miniatures to colossal originals, such as the legendary Saxon \\"Muldenthal\\" locomotive (1861). A sedan chair dating from 1705, the museum's oldest exhibit, and a horse-drawn bus are milestones in the history of public transportation in Dresden. The museum also chronicles the history of aviation from the hot air balloon to the supersonic airliner.\\"www.germany-tourism.de website article on the Dresden Transport Museum The Dresden Transport Museum currently owns 116 different railway vehicles, of which only eight are on display in the Johanneum. A large number are kept at the depot or entrusted to other societies on loan. Examples include locomotive numbers 17 1055,19 017, 58 261, 24 004, V 15 1001, V 240 001, 120 338 and 130 002 as well as a catenary inspection railbus. The road traffic exhibition displays Germany's pioneer automobiles, including a replica of Carl Benz's legendary tricycle of 1886, the predecessor of modern cars. The motorcycle exhibition shows, among others, a petroleum-powered Reitwagen (\\"riding car\\") motorcycle built by Gottlieb Daimler in 1885, the first internal combustion motorcycle. The air traffic area provides visitors with a general overview of the development of civil aviation, with one focus being the Saxon contribution to it, particularly during the period from 1955 to 1961. The inauguration of our new permanent aviation exhibition is scheduled for 5 May 2012, the 60th anniversary of the Dresden Transport Museum. The sea travel exhibition focuses on inland navigation on the Elbe river and maritime navigation on high seas. It also gives an overview of the past and present of sea travel.

The goods they stole are estimated to be worth between £30 million and £80 million. The gang were sentenced to a total of 49 years in prison in August 2008. The gang comprised Ricky Johnson (born 1954), his sons Richard \\"Chad\\" Johnson (born 1975) and Albi Johnson (born 1983), Daniel O'Loughlin (born 1976 and the nephew of Ricky Johnson) and Michael Nicholls (born 1979) the boyfriend of Ricky Johnson's daughter. In addition to the thefts from stately homes the gang were involved in thefts from shops, cash machines and metal merchants. In 2005, the BBC made a documentary about the family called Summer with the Johnsons, in which they spoke about their love of such pursuits as hare coursing and bare-knuckle boxing. They denied having burgled any country homes, but Ricky Johnson said: \\"I would like to make it clear to the people out there, to the police and the rich people ... if I feel the need when I have got to rob a stately home, I will do so. I will rob it and hope I don't get caught. But I will only rob your house if I feel the need and I have got to feed my children and nobody is helping me achieve my goal. I feel I have got the fucking right to rob the lords, the sirs and the ladies.\\" Crimes Waddesdon Manor, where over £5 million of antiques were taken in June 2003 The gang are believed to have been operating for a period of more than 20 years. The most spectacular and lucrative thefts occurred in a period between April 2003 and June 2006. The gang staked out properties for several weeks before the crimes and used 4x4 vehicles to ram heavily bolted gates. Notable thefts include Waddesdon Manor on 10 June 2003, a National Trust property and former Rothschild family residence near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. Goods including 100 antique gold snuff boxes worth around £5 million were stolen. These boxes belonged to a charity that belonged to the Rothschild family. On 24 October 2005 Warneford Place in Sevenhampton, Wiltshire, the home of Formula One motor racing tycoon Paddy McNally, and the former home of James Bond creator Ian Fleming, was burgled and items worth £750,000 were taken. The thieves removed heavy steel bars from the drawing room windows and bypassed the manor's security system. On 1 February 2006 the gang perpetrated their biggest theft when they burgled Ramsbury Manor, the home of Harry Hyams, near Marlborough in Wiltshire. The theft is believed to be the largest domestic burglary in the United Kingdom. Prosecutor Paul Reid said that: \\"This has been described as the most valuable domestic burglary ever committed in this country. The collection is described as priceless. There is a difficulty in putting a value on antiques and antiquities – some of them very precious and very rare – but it is tens of millions of pounds.\\" Investigation and convictions In October 2005 the police forces of Gloucestershire, Thames Valley, Warwickshire and West Mercia pooled their resources under the name \\"Operation Haul\\". The police spent weeks examining CCTV footage, mobile phone records and images from speed cameras as they investigated 116 offences ranging from country house burglaries to cash dispenser thefts. In April 2006, detectives discovered an underground bunker at a field owned by an associate of the Johnsons near Stratford-upon-Avon. Inside were a number of black bins containing straw and porcelain which was linked to the Ramsbury Manor burglary. Police arrested Ricky Johnson and Daniel O'Loughlin in June 2006 for the theft of metals worth £360,000. They were convicted at Bristol along with eight other associates in September 2007. They and the rest of the gang were charged with the other burglaries in October 2006. They were found guilty of conspiracy to commit burglary in August 2008 following a month-long trial at Reading Crown Court. Richard \\"Chad\\" Johnson and Daniel O'Loughlin, were both jailed for 11 years, Michael Nicholls was given 10 years, Albi Johnson, aged 25, was jailed for nine years and Ricky Johnson was given eight years. Despite the convictions, antiques worth tens of millions of pounds have yet to be recovered. Passing sentence, Judge Christopher Critchlow said: \\"Little of the property has been recovered and is no doubt well hidden in the countryside or passed on for disposal.\\" Since the arrests only three items have been recovered: two clocks, including a Benjamin Vulliamy bracket clock which aroused the suspicions of an auctioneer; and a 17th-century portrait by Abraham van Diepenbeck, stolen from Ramsbury, which was found in May 2008. Since the arrests in 2006, Thames Valley Police have seen a 90 per cent reduction in offences attributable to the group, and across all areas there has been a dramatic decrease in country house burglaries, and in cash machine and metal thefts.

Since Buddhism was introduced into Korea, Buddhist traditions have strongly influenced Korean cuisine as well. During the Silla period (57 BC – 935 AD), chalbap (찰밥, a bowl of cooked glutinous rice) yakgwa (약과, a fried dessert) and yumilgwa (a fried and puffed rice snack) were served for Buddhist altars and have been developed into types of hangwa, Korean traditional confectionery. During the Goryeo Dynasty, sangchu ssam (wraps made with lettuce), yaksik, and yakgwa were developed, so spread to China and other countries. Since the Joseon Dynasty, Buddhist cuisine has been established in Korea according to regions and temples. On the other hand, royal court cuisine is closely related to Korean temple cuisine. In the past, when the royal court maids called sanggung, who were assigned to Suragan (hangul: 수라간; hanja: 水剌間; the name of the royal kitchen), where they prepared the king's meals, became old, they had to leave the royal palace. Therefore, many of them entered Buddhist temples to become nuns. As the result, culinary techniques and recipes of the royal cuisine were integrated into Buddhist cuisine. Dishes by region Baek kimchi (white kimchi) to which pine nuts have been added, bossam kimchi (보쌈김치), and gosu kimchi (고수김치, coriander kimchi) are famous in Buddhist temples of Gyeonggi and Chungcheong Province. In Jeolla Province, godeulppagi kimchi (고들빼기김치, kimchi made with Youngia sonchifolia), gat kimchi (갓김치, kimchi made with Brassica juncea var. integrifolia), and juksun kimchi (죽순김치, bamboo shoot kimchi), all of which include deulkkaejuk (perilla congee) as an ingredient, are famous. None of these varieties of kimchi contain garlic, scallions, or jeotgal (salted fermented seafood), as foods in the genus Allium are generally avoided by traditional Buddhist monks and nuns of China, Korea, Vietnam and Japan. Dishes by temple Tongdosa located in Yangsan, South Gyeongsang Province is known for its dureup muchim (두릅무침, sauteed shoots of Aralia elata), pyeogobap (표고밥, shiitake rice), nokdu chalpyeon (녹두찰편, steamed tteok, a rice cake made with mung beans) are well- known dishes as well as kimchi, saengchae (생채, cold salad), twigak (튀각, a fried dish with without coating), and jeon (pancake) made with young shoots of Toona sinensis. The species is called chamjuk, literally meaning \\"true bamboo\\" in Korean because its shoots can be eaten like bamboo shoots. However, the dishes are prefixed with either chanmjuk or \\"gajuk\\" (가죽, literally \\"false bamboo\\") according to region. Haeinsa, located in Hapcheon, South Gyeongsang Province, is not only famous for the Tripitaka Koreana but also specialty of the temple cuisine such as sangchu bulttuk kimchi (상추불뚝김치, lettuce kimchi), gaji jijim (가지지짐, pan-fried sliced eggplant), gosu muchim (고수무침, sauteed coriander leaves), sandongbaekip bugak (산동백잎부각, fried leaves of Lindera obtusiloba), meouitang (머위탕 Petasites japonicus soup), songibap (송이밥, rice dish made with matsutake), solipcha (솔잎차, tea made with leaves of Pinus densiflora).

Wildlife White-tailed deer, small game mammals, songbirds, raptors, waterbirds, reptiles, and amphibians are commonly seen throughout the refuge. Waterfowl are abundant during the winter. Peak waterfowl populations of 75,000 ducks have been recorded. In 1979, the Duck Lake Impoundment was created to provide of waterfowl habitat. Management of the impoundment is to manipulate water levels to promote the growth of aquatic and moist soil vegetation. In 2001, Catahoula NWR was designated a Globally Important Bird Area. Catahoula Lake is recognized as a Wetlands of International Importance (RAMSAR site): a historic concentration area for shorebirds, waterbirds, and migrating/wintering waterfowl.

It is significant as a very well preserved example of a raised Tybee cottage. It is one of few still intact from the \\"golden era\\" of Tybee Island's development during 1910–1939, when Tybee Island became a beach house community for Savannah middle-class families. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 24, 2008. It is the fourth property that is listed as a featured property of the week in a program of the National Park Service that began in July 2008. The cottage is located in the Back River area of Tybee Island; there are also historic cottages preserved in the Strand area of the island. (49 pages including 22 photos, a map, and two diagrams) Cottages of this type were built from the 1920s through the 1940s as summer homes for the middle class. The Dutton–Waller Raised Tybee Cottage was built as a speculative investment by Edward A. Dutton in 1938. It was purchased in 1940 by Blanche S. Waller. The unpainted interior retains the original, rustic heart-pine paneling and bungalow floor plan. The living space is on the upper floor of the two-story building, with servants' quarters and garage space below. The cottage was remodeled extensively in 2006. It has been refurbished to remove non-historic changes made in the 1950s-1970s and replace historic elements that had been removed. The cottage's significance is enhanced by the fact that it is one of the few such cottages remaining, most having been demolished to make way for much bigger homes in recent times of escalating property values. It is listed as a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home, with an additional sleeping porch. There are live oak trees, jasmine, and palm trees surrounding the house.

Upon his return to Sweden Saltza associated himself with the group of artists who formed an artists' association known as Konstnärsförbundet in 1886.

Over the years, it has also remained a popular visitors attraction in Old Delhi area and known for its Sohan Halwa.Ghantewala in Delhi Lonely Planet In July 2015, the shop closed down due to falling sales and legal issues with the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. History Sohan Halwa (top shelf) and other traditional Indian sweets at Ghantewala in Chandni Chowk Emperor Shah Alam II, (r. 1759 - 1806) during whose rule the shop was established and got its name It was founded by Lala Sukh Lal Jain who had arrived in the walled city of Delhi from Amber, India, a few years after Sindhia restored Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II (r. 1759 - 1806). The shop was later run by his descendants for seven generations. There are a couple of theories about how it got its name \\"Ghantewala\\". According to one, it was so named by Mughal Emperor, Shah Alam II himself who asked his servants to get sweets from the ghante ki neeche wali dukaan (Shop below the bell) shop, which in time got shortened to simply Ghantewala. In those days the area was sparsely populated and the Emperor who used to live in the Red Fort could hear the toll of the bell for the school which was located in near the shop. Another theory about how it was named \\"Ghantewala\\" is that the founder, Lala Sukh Lal Jain, used to walk from street from street for selling his sweets while ringing a bell to attract attention. As he grew popular, people started to call him \\"Ghantewala\\" - a Hindi language word for the bell-man. Later when he established a shop, he named it \\"Ghantewala\\". Ghantewala's sweets were already famous before the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (Ghadar). The newspaper, 'Dihli Urdu Akhbar' of 23 August 1857 reported about the rebels from other regions become softened after they discovered the luxuries of the royal capital: > ..The moment they have a round of Chandni Chowk ... enjoy the sweetmeats of > Ghantawala, they lose all urge to fight and kill the enemy.W. Dalrymple, The > Last Mughal, 2006. The Lala began by selling Mishri Mawa, a Rajasthani specialty. In 2015, they had around 40 to 50 different varieties of sweets that they kept changing according to the season or festivals, according to Sushant Jain, who is a seventh generation descendant. The family split a few decades ago and another branch has a shop nearby the fountain. One shop is closed while another shop has changed its name as Ghantewala Confectioners run by a descendant, Nirmal Jain. It is situated close to the Gali Paranthe Wali also in Chandni Chowk. Products According to the owner Sushant Jain, the 'Sohan Halwa' was a favourite of patrons from as far away as the Gulf. Pista Burfi and perennial favourite like 'motichoor ki ladoo', Kalakand, Karachi halwa and snacks like makkan choora were also popular among the patrons. Before closing down, it used to sell traditional Indian snacks, like namkeen, samosa, kachori etc., besides festive sweets like gujiyas around Holi. They also ventured into the e-commerce space by partnering with an online food retailing website www.chandnichowkfood.com, which was however not successful. In popular culture When film producer B.R. Chopra made his comedy Hindi film Chandni Chowk (1954), he made sure that a replica of the shop is included in his set. He said: \\"Chandni Chowk without Ghantewala? Unthinkable.\\" Near the end of the movie, the dramatic finale occurs right in front of Ghantewala counter, with a sign in English and Urdu proclaiming the association of the shop with the Mughal emperors.Chandni Chowk 1954, B.R.

Indian Express stated: \\"Ghantewala, an over 200-year-old sweet shop in Old Delhi’s bustling Chandni Chowk market has finally downed its shutters, evoking shock and a sense of loss among food connosseirs, sweet lovers and other visitors.\\" Landmark 200-year-old sweet shop Ghantewala in Old Delhi shuts down, Press Trust of India,2 July 2015 The Hindu wrote: \\"The scene outside and the disbelief on faces of those watching display units being sold as scrap even as they asked around about what had happened was reminiscent of a funeral service. For heritage lovers as well as fans of the shop, it was the death of one of the icons of the city — a living reminder of the past that still had a connect with the present generation.\\" After 225 years, Delhi's sweet shop shuts down, Jaideep Deo Bhanj, The Hindu, JULY 2, 2015 It was attributed to a change in the tastes (chocolate sales doubled to $857 million between 2008 and 2011 A 225-Year-Old Sweet Shop Is Closing Because People Want to Eat Candy Bars, Liz Dwyer, 25 July 2015) and legal and licensing issues.

It is located in the Smithsonian's Museum Support Center in Suitland, Maryland, and is part of the Department of Anthropology at the National Museum of Natural History. History The National Anthropological Archives (NAA) is the successor to the archives of the Bureau of American Ethnology (BAE), which was founded in 1879 by John Wesley Powell. In 1968, The NAA was established, incorporating the collections of the BAE, which focused on American Indians, as well as the papers of curators in the National Museum of Natural History's Department of Anthropology, who conducted research around the world. The establishment of the NAA was supported by grants from the Wenner-Gren Foundation with the aim of providing a repository of record for personal research materials created by scholars without a home institution (or whose home institution had no archives), in order to promote the preservation of the anthropological record. Collections The NAA is the only archival repository in the United States dedicated exclusively to preserving ethnographic, archaeological, and linguistic fieldnotes, physical anthropological data, photographs, sound recordings and other media created by American anthropologists. The collection includes documents such as fieldnotes, journals, manuscripts, correspondence, photographs, maps, sound recordings, all compiled by prominent researchers from the Smithsonian or other research institutions. Spanning over 150 years of American history and world history, materials held in the archives include nearly 635,000 photographs, 20,000 works of indigenous art, and 11,400 sound recordings. In 2010, the NAA received a Save America's Treasures grant to preserve manuscripts relating to endangered languages. These manuscripts include vocabularies, narratives, and other texts representing approximately 250 American Indian languages. Many photographs and manuscript pages from the NAA collections, including 8,200 pages of Cherokee language materials, have been scanned and are available online for research through SIRIS, the Smithsonian's online catalog.

Struers Chemiske Laboratorium launched in 1944 the polishing machine Micropol, a new principle for electrolytic polishing. Holger F. Struer was a Danish chemist and founder of \\"H. Struers Chemiske Laboratorium\\" (In Danish: \\"Struers Kemiske Laboratorium\\") in 1875 at Skindergade 38, the centre of Copenhagen. Struers introduced in 1943 Micropol, a new principle for electrolytic polishing which made the preparation process within metallography more controlled in order to achieve better preparation results.\\"The History of Struers\\", Structure 36, Struers Journal of Materialography, 2000, p 6. The development of metallography was a continuous struggle to find better and easier methods to prepare metal surfaces for microstructure observation. Struers based his new principle for electrolytic polishing on Count Alois von Beckh Widmanstätten and his early experiments from the beginning of the 19th century that revealed the structure of iron from a meteor which had come down earlier in the century. He noticed that the structure could better be seen on plane, fine polished surfaces. By pouring nitric acid over the surface and letting it react for some time, he actually made a deep etch which developed the macrostructure. Pieces etched this way were used for printing the structure directly on paper. These \\"nature prints\\" turned \\"metallography\\" into lithography. All these experiments did not lead to any evaluation of the microstructure, but were limited to the macrostructure. However, in 1863 Henry Clifton Sorby described in detail how he ground and polished samples in order to examine them under the microscope. He was able to magnify the structure up to 650x. From these observations he drew conclusions regarding the structure of pearlite and ferrite, and he was also able to watch the recrystallization of steel during cold working. For recording the microstructures he used three different methods available at the time: drawings, \\"nature printing\\" and microphotography. Considering that his research in the area of metallography only lasted two years, he discovered and established a wealth of information, and Sorby is considered to be the founder of metallography. Holger F. Struer saw the need for a laboratory making chemical analysis in the strongly developing \\"modern society\\", and in 1895 Struer began importing chemicals and instruments for the Danish market. In 1919 Struer obtained the Danish representation of the Austrian company, Reichert, a specialist in metallographic microscopes. The combination of chemical knowledge and the sale of metallographic microscopes changed the focus of Struer's company to metallography and metallographic analysis. In 1943 H. Struers Chemiske Laboratorium launched Micropol, and a new principle for electrolytic polishing was established. The introduction of Micropol was a technological progress since in this way the materialographic preparation process became more controlled in order to achieve an optimal preparation result in the shortest possible time. Today metallography is a part of materials science in its own right and extends to all fields of application, including ceramics, composites, electronic components and other solid materials. H. Struers Chemiske Laboratorium is still active within metallography but is today just called \\"Struers Aps\\".

Delaney, Strategic Bankruptcy (University of California Press, 1998) for a discussion of this phenomenon by reference to particular cases. Introduction Chapter 11 bankruptcy made it possible for a business to declare bankruptcy without actually being insolvent. It is also strongly weighted toward retaining the existing management through the process of restructuring, on the basis that the existing management would be most familiar with the business and thus best equipped to preserve as much of its value as possible. These two conditions laid the foundations for modern strategic bankruptcy.https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7418&context;=ylj Strategic bankruptcy occurs where bankruptcy is a strategic choice rather than an unavoidable condition. Such a choice might be made to avoid or reduce heavy legal judgements, to sidestep existing contracts, or even as a tool for manipulative debt reduction. Under bankruptcy law, debts are not avoided entirely, but may be significantly reduced to the point where a business owner may consider this option profitable or at least less unprofitable. Existing contracts, collective bargaining agreements, and legal judgements are more likely to be set aside entirely as a result of bankruptcy. These must always be reargued under the different rules applying to bankruptcy proceedings.https://books.google.ca/books?id=5m9yq0Eu- vsC&pg;=PT215&dq;=%22Strategic+bankruptcy%22&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=F4wEUYDoE6T7iwK0p4DwBQ&redir;_esc=y#v=onepage&q;=%22Strategic%20bankruptcy%22&f;=false Strategic debt cutting The debt forgiveness inherent in declaring bankruptcy can be used to manipulate debt management. In 2011, Donald Trump told Newsweek that \\"I do play with the bankruptcy laws – they're very good for me\\" as a tool for trimming debt.\\"https://www.newsweek.com/kurtz-trump- backlash-66503 To Forbes, Trump said that \\"I’ve cut debt -- by the way, this isn’t me personally, it’s a company. ... Basically I’ve used the laws of the country to my advantage and to other people’s advantage just as Leon Black has, Carl Icahn, Henry Kravis has, just as many, many others on top of the business world have.\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2011/04/29/fourth-times-a- charm-how-donald-trump-made-bankruptcy-work-for-him/#5894662f7ffa Altogether, Trump has filed six times for Chapter 11 bankruptcies for his businesses, some of them three times under different corporate structuring and names.https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/21/hillary- clinton/yep-donald-trumps-companies-have-declared-bankrupt/ Breaking contracts A strategic bankruptcy can be used to get away from expensive contracts which would otherwise be unbreakable. The contracts might be with employees or with business partners. When the airlines Sabena and Swissair went bankrupt and were restructured, they also were able to break high salary and expensive pension contracts with pilots and other staff. In 2002 Kmart filed Chapter 11 for protection from creditors. One of the main problems affecting Kmart's cash flow and therefore its liquidity was that Kmart was locked into long-term leases at premium rates with respect to various unprofitable stores. While in chapter 11 reorganization, Kmart was able to renegotiate or rescind those particular leases. Strategic bankruptcy has been used by Donald Trump to attempt to escape lawsuits over never-built condo projects by placing all responsibility onto his business partners.https://www.newsweek.com/kurtz-trump-backlash-66503 The claim is that he was not involved in the actual building of the property. Same name, different company Owners of companies with deep debts will sometimes open a new company before declaring bankruptcy on the previous company. The phoenix company usually buys all the important assets, including the old name, and continues with much smaller debts. The General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization of 2009 resulted in a brand new company, which owned almost all the assets of the old company. Although technically it operates under the new name of NGMCO Inc, which stands for New GM Company, it is still most commonly known as GM, and none of its core branding has changed. However, the old GM stock was removed from the New York Stock exchange in 2009, to be replaced by a new IPO in 2010. This resulted in some initial confusion among investors, some of whom continued to trade in the old shares, which still circulate as Pink Sheets under the symbol MTLQQ. Different name, same company The new company may essentially be the old company under a new name. The renaming may simply be part of the Chapter 11 restructuring, or it may be a dodge to avoid legal action. Some fly-by-night businesses habitually close down one business and open an identical business under a new name to mislead potential customers. After the bankruptcy of the Trump Taj Mahal and The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, in 1991 and 1992 respectively, Trump was held personally liable for some of the debt. He subsequently restructured his resort casinos under the name Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts to protect himself from future personal liability. Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts went Chapter 11 bankrupt in 2004, and was essentially replaced by Trump Entertainment Resorts -- which itself went Chapter 11 bankrupt in 2009.https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/21/hillary- clinton/yep-donald-trumps-companies-have-declared-bankrupt/ Ethics While the strict legality of strategic bankruptcy is not in doubt, opinions differ over the questions of responsibility and ethics. Atlantic City lawyer Michael Viscount places the full responsibility for serial strategic bankruptcies upon the creditors who were willing to keep extending credit, and considers Chapter 11 as the ultimate business transaction forum.https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2011/04/29/fourth-times-a- charm-how-donald-trump-made-bankruptcy-work-for-him/#5894662f7ffa Assuming all parties involved are aware of the possibility of bankruptcy, strategic bankruptcy then becomes a question of moral hazard.https://books.google.ca/books?id=5m9yq0Eu- vsC&pg;=PT215&dq;=%22Strategic+bankruptcy%22&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=F4wEUYDoE6T7iwK0p4DwBQ&redir;_esc=y#v=onepage&q;=%22Strategic%20bankruptcy%22&f;=false In contrast, Icahn lawyer Edward Weisfelner argues that good faith ought to be a requirement in bankruptcy proceedings, and that bankruptcy laws were not designed to avoid obligations and artificially elevate personal equity interests above legitimate creditor claims.https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2011/04/29/fourth-times-a- charm-how-donald-trump-made-bankruptcy-work-for-him/#5894662f7ffa The possibility of strategic bankruptcy also raises the possibility of serial strategic bankruptcy as a form of increasingly standard business negotiation. This kind of negotiation is fairly common in the New York real estate market. Stephen Burbank, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, describes Donald Trump as \\"a serial debt avoider.\\"https://publicintegrity.org/politics/donald-trumps-lawsuits-could- turn-off-conservatives-who-embrace-tort-reform/ The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 may have made it easier for business managers to benefit themselves at the expense of bondholders and share value.https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7418&context;=ylj The original stated intent of the act was to preserve value of assets by keeping them from being scrapped, and thus protect overall business value. However, it also placed more of the power to resolve credit issues directly in the hands of those who may have been involved in creating the insolvency problem in the first place.

Founded in 1962 as a weekly, it is the oldest magazine in English in Belgium and remains one of the oldest English-language publications in Continental Europe. It claims a circulation of 10,000, mostly from the large expatriate community of the European Union's capital. Publication became quarterly in 2012. Regular contributors in the past have included the author and one-time British Labour MP Dick Leonard, who wrote about Belgian politics, and John Palmer, formerly Europe Editor of The Guardian (London) and former Political Director of the European Policy Centre. History \\"From now on, non-Belgian, English-speaking residents have a voice of their own. That voice: The Bulletin. YOUR weekly.\\" - Monique Ackroyd, 1962 On 21 September 1962, Monique Ackroyd successfully completed the first issue of The Bulletin. Created in the basement of her Uccle home, it was 8 pages and cost 5 Belgian francs. The publication was greeted enthusiastically by the English-speaking community: by the second issue, it had grown to 12 pages. Although things were going well with The Bulletin, it wasn't until 1967 with the move of NATO headquarters from Paris to Brussels that readership really took off. With a new office in Uccle, the magazine's circulation grew and the number of pages doubled to 48. By 1969, circulation had grown to 3,000, enabling yet another relocation of The Bulletin office to the Sablon area, above the Vieux St. Martin restaurant. In 1971, one of The Bulletin's freelance writers, Sunday Times journalist John Lambert, encouraged by the then editor, Aislinn Dulanty, decided to launch a campaign to ban traffic in the Grand-Place. A petition resulted in a partial success in March 1971, when drivers were banned from parking, but through traffic was still allowed. The Bulletin kept fighting. The staff organized a protest picnic held on 25 June. \\"Bring your children, your grandmother, your umbrella (just in case),\\" urged the posters. The response was sensational, and hugely successful. Due to such positive campaigns as well as the expansion of the EEC and expatriate community in Brussels, Ackroyd Publications launched What's On, an entertainment guide, in 1975. Three years later, the growing company moved into new offices, located on Avenue Louise. The Bulletin was on a roll in the 1980s. It was a recognized publication, producing serious journalism that reflected the changing urban scene. It had Cleveland Moffett's reflective Rambler columns covering many aspects of urban life, Dick Leonard explaining the nuances of Belgian politics and Geoff Meade's wry stories on living in Belgium with his Meadelets and catlets. By 1986, its cash flow was healthy enough to pay for a smart corner mansion on Avenue Molière. In the 1990s there was a change of editor, from Aislinn Dulanty to her daughter, Brigid Grauman. The Bulletin continued its successful ascent by recruiting new journalists, and launching several titles, including a design magazine called Look and an inflight magazine for the Belgian national airline Sabena. Between 1992 and 1994, The Bulletin reported on a campaign led by expats of differing nationalities against BBC's Radio 4. It was thought that the service was to be stopped, causing outrage amongst its listeners. Even though the true situation came to light as being just a switch from long waves to FM, a protest organization was still founded. North Europe Save Radio 4 sent petitions and faxes until BBC agreed to keep the programme on long wave. In 2007, Ackroyd Publications was acquired by Corelio, the Flemish media group now known as Mediahuis that publishes several Belgian dailies in both Dutch and French. Derek Blyth then became editor-in-chief. In 2011, Deborah Forsyth became acting editor-in-chief, followed later in the year by Tamara Gausi as editor- in-chief. In 2012, The Bulletin announced it was printing its final edition in July. This was stated in a letter to subscribers that offered a refund for those who had signed up to a longer term subscription. The announcement stated that due to changes in the market, including the role played by the internet, The Bulletin would no longer be a printed magazine but would continue as an online publication. This online publication was previously an offshoot of The Bulletin called xpats.com. Since then, The Bulletin has continued to publish a quarterly print edition. The current editor-in-chief of the magazine is Sarah Crew, while Paul McNally acts as editor of the online version. Also published by Ackroyd Publications WAB is a quarterly newsmagazine focusing on issues and events in Wallonia and Brussels. It is published via a contract with the Walloon export and investment agency. Expat Time is a quarterly magazine published for ING Belgium, distributed to the bank's top 25,000 expat clients.

It is a brick Queen Anne-style building constructed in 1886 currently used as offices for the Town of Southeast, of which Brewster is part. The bank itself closed in 1964. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 in recognition of its intact style and its place in the village's history. Building The rectangular one-story brick building rises from a granite foundation to a hipped roof covered with slate tiles and a decorative ridge cap. The main block's fenestration consists of double-mullioned semicircular windows. A small wing on the north facade has hexagonal slate shingles and a Palladian window on its gable face; a chimney rises from its roof. It is complemented by a similarly-faced cross-gable on the south side with louvered oculus. The slope of the irregular triangle the building sits on allows for a basement entrance on this side. A small addition on the west side is sympathetic to the original building. The walls are done in unpainted panelling and the ceilings in unpainted tongue-in-groove. What was the main banking area has a cathedral ceiling and six-branch brass chandelier. History The First National Bank was incorporated in 1875 following rapid post-Civil War growth of the village of Brewster and its neighboring areas. It grew successful enough that by 1886 it could afford the current building, whose Queen Anne stylings also incorporate the rounded windows of the also-popular Richardsonian Romanesque style. The bank was purposely located next to the rail depot, the source of much of the prosperity it had helped to finance. The building was never substantially altered for much of the bank's occupancy, save the addition on the west in 1950. When it closed in 1964, the Town of Southeast, in which Brewster is located, was quick to move in from the old Town Hall down the street. The supervisor and town clerk worked there until the construction of the current Town Hall on NY 22, north of the village. The building, parking, planning and code-enforcement departments are still housed in the old bank.

His land holdings included the area later known as Chavez Ravine. Life Origins and arrival in Los Angeles Julian Antonio Chavez was born in Abiquiu, New Mexico on January 7, 1808, son of Francisco Chavez and Francesca Rosa Verlarde. He is thought to have arrived in Los Angeles in the early 1830s, possibly with one of many trapping parties from New Mexico. The city census of 1836 listed Julian Chavez, aged 27, with a stated occupation of \\"laborer.\\" Land acquisition Around that same time he began to acquire real estate, which could be done by simply petitioning the ayuntamiento (a local body similar to a city council) for permission to take possession of unoccupied tracts. In 1844 he was granted a plot of about 1½ miles north of downtown Los Angeles, which would become known as Chavez Canyon. During local smallpox outbreaks in 1850 and 1880, the canyon housed an isolation hospital to care for the afflicted. Later renamed Chavez Ravine, it is today the location of Dodger Stadium. Political career Chavez's first political office was that of assistant mayor (suplente alcalde) of Los Angeles in 1838. He served also as a \\"judge of waters\\" and later a \\"judge of the plains,\\" as part of the Court of Sessions, which handled legal matters — mostly on water and cattle disputes. During his final term in 1873 as a member of the Los Angeles Common Council he worked closely on issues with Prudent Beaudry, Henry Dockweiler and William H. Workman. Chavez was elected to the first Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in June 1852. Other members were Jefferson Hunt, Francisco P. Temple, Manuel Requena and Samuel Arbuckle. He served on the seventh board in 1858 and the tenth board in 1861. Family and death Chavez was a widower until he married again, to Maria Luisa Machado on November 4, 1865. She was 22 years his junior, and as a daughter of Ygnacio Machado she came from a long-established family of Los Angeles rancheros. Chavez died of a heart attack on July 25, 1879.

He is renowned for the many reforms he initiated and oversaw, and is among the most famous figures in Okinawan history. He edited Chūzan Seifu, a rewrite of Chūzan Seikan by his father Sai Taku. Life and career Sai On was born in Kumemura, the village within the major port city of Naha which served as the chief center of classical Chinese learning in Okinawa, and the source of the vast majority of the scholar-bureaucrats who were raised to serve in the administration of the kingdom. His father had likewise been a scholar- bureaucrat of Kumemura, educated in the Confucian classics, and had served on several tribute missions to China. Sai On's father wrote the Chūzan Seifu by rewriting the Chūzan Seikan in 1701. Unlike Chūzan Seikan, which was written in Japanese Kanbun, Chūzan Seifu is written in Classical Chinese. Sai On edited Chūzan Seifu in 1724, and it is believed that this was to give the work a pro-Chinese point of view.Gregory Smits, presentation at \\"Interpreting Parades and Processions of Edo Japan\\" symposium, University of Hawaii at Manoa, 11 Feb 2013. At the age of 27, Sai On traveled to Guangzhou in China, where he studied economics, geography, and political administration alongside the more traditional Chinese classics.\\"Sai On.\\" Okinawa rekishi jinmei jiten (沖縄歴史人名事典, \\"Encyclopedia of People of Okinawan History\\"). Naha: Okinawa Bunka- sha, 1996. p30.Kerr, George H. (2000). Okinawa: the History of an Island People. (revised ed.) Boston: Tuttle Publishing. p199. Upon returning from China, Sai On was made instructor to the Crown Prince; upon the prince's accession to the throne as King Shō Kei in 1713, Sai On was elevated in position and power, and led the investiture mission to China in 1716. In 1728, he became a member of the Sanshikan, the Council of Three chief royal advisors. Though Sai On was not of royal blood and so could not be named Sessei (a post which historian George Kerr translates as \\"prime minister\\"), reorganizations were undertaken within the government allowing Sai On extensive authority and powers.Kerr. p200. Under his guidance, a number of land reforms were put into place, including the reclamation of land for agriculture, relocation and establishment of settlements, irrigation, flood control, and the planting of trees. In a series of reforms very similar to those implemented in Japan around the same time, strict limitations were placed on farmers moving to the cities, and on the amount of craft work, such as woodworking and metalworking, which farmers were permitted to do. Thus, agricultural production was intensified and made more efficient while artisans were focused in the twin cities of Naha and Shuri.Kerr. pp205–6. Within a few years of the beginning of the implementation of Sai On's economic reforms and construction, reclamation and conservation projects, the kingdom was producing more than ever before. In addition, the anji, hereditary lords of territories throughout the kingdom, were given stipends from the government in the form of rice, beginning in 1723. This tied them closer to the central government and also safeguarded to some extent their economic well-being, as they would no longer need to rely solely on inheritance for their relative wealth. Aristocrats were also encouraged to become artisans, with no loss of court rank or status, and in 1734, taxes upon artisans in the cities were eliminated, further encouraging an expansion of craft production. In addition, various forms of official government recognition for exemplary artisans, artists, and performers were introduced.Kerr. pp206–7. Stele dedicated to Sai On, at the Shiseibyō Confucian temple in Naha. Okinawa's demand for wood outstripped the ability of the forests to renew themselves on their own, naturally, and the combination of deforestation and rainy weather including regular typhoon seasons led to extensive erosion and landslides. Sai On is particularly known for the forestry and soil conservation efforts undertaken under his guidance to combat these problems. Particular trees and sections of forest throughout the islands are still today called \\"Sai On pines\\" (蔡温松, Sai On matsu; 蔡温並木, Sai On namiki), and his essays on the subject of forestry and conservation remained so valued that the post-war United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands translated, published, and distributed them abroad in 1952.Kerr. p207. In addition to these essays, Sai On produced a number of other documents, including a handbook for administrative officials in the provinces entitled Yomui-kan, and Ryokōnin Kokoroe (旅行人心得), or \\"Travelers' Advice\\", a guide for Okinawans abroad in China to help them in obscuring from the Chinese the relationship between Okinawa and Japan's Satsuma Domain.Kerr. pp203,205. A rival government faction rose up against Sai On in 1734, accusing him of being too pro-Chinese, led by a pair of scholar- bureaucrats, Heshikiya Chōbin and Tomoyose Anjō. Before any plots against Sai On could be executed, however, Chōbin and fourteen others were arrested and put to death.Kerr. p208. Sai On retired from his ministerial post in 1752, the year after Shō Kei's death, but remained influential until his own death at the age of 79 in 1761.Kerr. p209.

Plot summary Somewhere in the middle of America dwells Blue Gene Mapother, a trashy, mullet-headed Wal-Mart stockboy-turned-flea marketer who staunchly supports any American war effort without question. Besides patriotism, little enlivens him besides pro wrestling, cigarette breaks, and any instance in which he thinks his masculinity is at stake. Curiously, he is also a member of one of the wealthiest families in the country. His mother, the fanatical Christian socialite Elizabeth Mapother, has a prophetic dream in which she sees Blue Gene’s older brother, the handsome but nervous John Hurstbourne Mapother, becoming an apocalyptic world savior. In order to fulfill his mother’s prophecy—not to mention his father Henry’s lifelong desire for his bloodline to ascend to Washington—John is running for Congress. John soon finds that as a corporate executive he is not popular with his largely working-class constituents, many of whom work for him and his father. Now, after years of estrangement, the Mapothers need Blue Gene’s common man touch in order to cast their family name in a more favorable light with the voters. The Mapothers no longer shun Blue Gene for his embarrassing, low-class ways; they embrace him as political gold. Will Blue Gene allow himself to be used? His family has ignored him the last four years and has only invited him back into the fold as campaign time looms near. But then again, even though the superrich John Hurstbourne Mapother clearly represents the interests of big business, man, he sure does have all the right values. Through dark humor and cinematic story-telling, this small-town epic goes from a flea market to mansions to abandoned Wal-Mart buildings, dramatizing the deranged, absurd relationship between the high and low class of America.

Cambridge University Press. \\"A more complex and intriguing interaction can be seen in Monteverdi's aria, 'Possenti Sprito' from his opera Orfeo (1607)\\" from Act 3 of Claudio Monteverdi's opera L'Orfeo, where Orpheus attempts to persuade Charon to allow him to pass into Hades and find Euridice. At the start of the Act, Hope (Speranza, sop.) has guided Orpheus to the banks of the Styx, where, at the sign 'Abandon all hope, ye who enter', she can go no further. Orpheus' way is barred by Charon, who explains that no living body shall enter his boat. Orpheus (tenor) sings that he is no longer living, for, with his wife dead, he himself no longer has a heart (senza cor). Charon (bass-baritone) is initially unmoved, but when Orpheus continues singing, and then plays his lyre, Charon is lulled to sleep. Orpheus crosses over the Styx in Charon's boat, singing Rendetemi il mio ben, tartarei Numi! (Give me back my love, O gods of Tartarus!). The Chorus of Spirits then sing Nulla impresa per uom si tenta invano, (No enterprise of man is undertaken in vain...) to close the third act. This aria is one of the most important musical documents of early Italian Baroque performance practice. In the original published edition (1607), Monteverdi uniquely includes two separate versions for Orfeo to sing, one simple and one elaborately ornamented. This style of embellishing the otherwise simply notated musical line was presumably expected for much of the music of this time period. References *Gordon, Bonnie (2004).

After the purchase by Bay Area Wetlands LLC, various proposals to develop the marsh were put forward. These included upscale housing, an industrial complex, a mixed use transit village with housing businesses, and a transit center, and expansion of Point Pinole Regional Shoreline, with Breuner Marsh being restored. The latter was the preferred option from the Parchester Village Neighborhood Council which had fought development in the past. Development was also fought by the Sierra Club and the North Richmond Shoreline Open Space Alliance, and by Gayle McLaughlin and the East Bay Regional Parks District.

The payoff of this portfolio is always the same: you will purchase the underlying call at the time of maturity of the compound options. If the underlying call's price at the time of maturity is greater than the strike price, you will exercise your CoC and purchase the underlying call at its strike price. If the underlying call's price at the time of maturity is less than the strike price, the counterparty will exercise its PoC and you will need to purchase the underlying call at its strike price. Thus, there will always be a cash outflow equal to the strike price and you will come into possession of a call option. Suppose there is a second portfolio that consists of a call option with a maturity equal to the maturity of the CoC/PoC above plus the maturity of the underlying call above. Suppose that you also borrow an amount equal to the strike price of the CoC/PoC from the above portfolio discounted at the risk free rate from the CoC/PoC maturity date to today. The payoff of this portfolio is identical to the first portfolio. You will own a call that is identical to the underlying call above and you also will have to repay the loan balance, which will be equal to the strike price above. Therefore, these two portfolios must have the same price. Formulae : \\\\mathit{P(CoC) - P(PoC) = P(Call) - PV(Strike\\\\ Price)} Where P() indicates price of what's inside the parentheses and PV() indicates present value. Similar logic leads to the following: : \\\\mathit{P(CoP) - P(PoP) = P(Put) - PV(Strike\\\\ Price)} References External links *Compound Options *Evaluation of compound options using perturbation approximation *COMPOUND OPTION Calculator Options (finance) ","title":"Compound option"},{"id":"18777735","text":"Living on Video, known in Canada as Message on the Radio, is the first album by Canadian synthpop group Trans-X.

It rises at the northern vertex of the rough triangle traced by the town walls - built by Emperor Aurelian in the 3rd century - in the area of Trastevere an up through the Janiculum. The gate marks the beginning of Via della Lungara and is the only gate, on the right bank of the Tiber (the other ones are Porta Portuensis, no more existing, and Porta San Pancrazio), that rises just in the place where it was built, despite its restorations and rebuildings.  Name  There are several theories about the meaning of the name. An etymology related to its location north of the Temple of Janus (septentrio and Ianus in Latin) looks plausible. The most recent hypotheses take into account the possibility that the name comes from the proximity to a monument of the age of Septimius Severus: maybe it was an arch of the aqueduct bringing water to the thermal baths dedicated to the Emperor; maybe the entrance of the Horti Getae, the gardens owned by the Emperor's son Publius Septimius Geta, the brother of Caracalla and co-Emperor for few months; maybe a real gate giving access to the quarter of Trastevere, within walls that had no military importance at that time. In this case, the gate should be dated back to at least 60 years before the building of the Aurelian walls. During the Middle Ages there was a proliferation of legends: according to one of them, Augustus, before becoming Emperor, had raised seven hymns while making a pilgrimage to the Temple of Janus (”septem Iano laudes”).  History  Porta Settimiana, drawing by Giuseppe Vasi (around 1750). A passage of Livy,”Ab Urbe condita libri”, I, 33. that nonetheless does not mention the gate explicitly, could indicate that it was built during the monarchy; however, at that time there was no wall on the right bank of the Tiber (the first one was built in 87 BC), but just a fortress protecting Pons Sublicius; therefore the citation appears to be totally unreliable. No trace or information about the former architectural structure has survived; maybe it just consisted of a postern or so. The gate has been mentioned (but not with certaintyAppian of Alexandria, Bell. Civ., I, 68.) as the meeting point between Lucius Cornelius Cinna and Gaius Marius with his army during the Social War, and no other antique document mentions it up to a document written in 1123. The important arterial road, running between the river and the Janiculum, that started from Porta Settimiana and led to Porta Santo Spirito and then to St. Peter's Basilica (now Via della Lungara), was formerly called Via Santa (\\"Holy Street\\"), due to its important role for the access of pilgrims. The street and the gate are mentioned in some documents dating back to the end of the 14th century, disposing to keep both of them clean and free of debrises from the flood of the river and to throw no garbage, so that the road were adequate to its name and function. After a restoration by Pope Nicholas V in 1451, in 1498 - due to the remarkable importance that the street had acquired - Pope Alexander VI rebuilt the gate and enlarged it, probably raising it from its former level and giving it the present aspect. On that occasion an inscription, referring to Septimius Severus according to some contemporaries, was lost; it probably was an important clue for the reconstruction of the history of the gate. In 1643, during the building of the Janiculum walls by Pope Urban VIII, almost the entire stretch of Aurelian walls on the right bank of the River was torn down and the gate was included within the new walls, thus losing any military and access function. The last renovation, carried out by Pope Pius VI in 1798, maintained a military aspect - included with the guelph battlements - scarcely justifiable for a gate fully integrated into a city quarter.

Founding The origins of Radio Malta go back to 1935. For many years, transmissions were effected on a cable-radio system which started way back on 11 November 1935 by a British company called Rediffusion.Remig Sacco, Ix-xandir F'Malta, Page 24,Malta 1985. This Rediffusion Cable Radio Service was officially launched on 11 November 1935.Toni Sant, Remembering Rediffusion in Malta, A History Without Future. Malta 2016. Page 50 On 29 September 1962, the same company, officially opened the Malta Television Service, then known as MTV, now Television Malta (TVM).Tony C. Cutajar, Ix-Xandir F'Malta, Page 53, Malta 2001 During the late sixties Rediffusion Malta effected several test transmissions with the aim to set up a radio station. But the radio station never materialised, possibly due to conflict of interest with the cable radio system which the same company was utilising. Regular Wireless radio transmissions in Maltese started on 8 January 1973 by the Malta Broadcasting Authority on 999 kHz Medium Wave (AM). It was called \\"Radju ta' Malta\\".Remig Sacco,Ix-Xandir F'Malta, Page 134,Malta1985, This frequency is still in use by Radio Malta. Norman Hamilton, then Rediffusion's top D.J., left the company and decided to join Radio Malta from its first day of transmission. Norman is no longer involved in radio. Mario Laus was also one of Radio Malta's first D.J.s and today he is still one of its most popular D.J.s and certainly the longest-serving D.J. of this radio station. Another popular D.J. is Brian Micallef who started presenting Rock Programs during the Rediffusion era and is still very active on Radio Malta. In 1975, when Xandir Malta was set up, the Cable Radio system, now no longer belonging to Rediffusion, and Radio Malta, became one entity with a separate identity. Radio Malta started transmitting on 93.7 F.M. when the British Forces Broadcasting Services (BFBS Malta) closed down on 31 March 1979 with the departure of British Services from the Maltese Islands. Development Former Radio Malta logo The cable radio system was officially closed down on 31 January 1989 and its programmes continued on as a wireless service on MW 999 kHz.Toni Sant, Remembering Rediffusion in Malta, A History Without Future. Malta 2016. Page 14 Consequently, many talented and experienced broadcasters were now working solely for Radio Malta. Among these, the late Charles Arrigo, trained by the B.B.C., and considered by many as the Dean of Maltese Broadcasting. The legendary and charismatic broadcaster, the late Charles Abela Mizzi, with his golden voice, also gave a great contribution to Radio Malta. Other veterans, still serving with Radio Malta, are George Peresso and Peter Paul Ciantar. In 1990, Public Broadcasting Services took over the role and responsibility of Xandir Malta.Tony C. Cutajar,Ix-Xandir F'Malta,Page 90,Malta 2001. Its stereophonic transmissions are now also accessible in Malta on DAB+. The year 1991 ushered in an era of broadcast pluralism in Malta.Tony C. Cutajar,Ix-Xandir F'Malta,Page 89,Malta 2001 This phenomenon brought to Radio Malta many a new talent. However, with pluralism, Malta witnessed greater staff mobility within local radio stations which started to mushroom on the Maltese Islands. Joe Dimech,Lilian Maistre, Ray Calleja, Tony Micallef, Albert Storace, Brian Micallef, Eddie Darmanin, are just some of its longest serving broadcasters. Today many new voices are part of Radio Malta's success. Other veterans have also returned to the fold.

A total of 1,100 M10s were converted to Achilles, making it the second most numerous armoured fighting vehicle to carry the 17 pounder gun, behind the Sherman Firefly. The name \\"Achilles\\" was officially a designation applied to both the 3\\" gun and 17 pounder versions (as Achilles I/II and Achilles Ic/IIc respectively) but was little used during the Second World War; at the time, the vehicle was called 17pdr M10, or 17pdr SP M10, or even occasionally, \\"Firefly\\". It has since become identified almost exclusively with the 17 pounder version. Origins In the wake of Germany's successful 1939–41 campaigns, US armour doctrine had incorporated the idea of fast, lightly armoured vehicles carrying high-velocity anti-tank guns as the best way to deal with the fast moving armour spearheads of the German Blitzkrieg. The M10 was based on the chassis of the M4 Sherman but carried thinner although more sloped armour in order to comply with the high speed requirement for the tank. At the same time, the British had been examining the possibility of designing a low-silhouette self-propelled tank destroyer, preferably with a 360-degree traversing turret, with armour that would be able to resist the German 5 cm KwK 39 standard 50 mm gun at 800 yards and mounting the 17 pounder. However, with the arrival of the M10 on the battlefield in late 1942, British plans for a turreted self-propelled gun were cancelled. The armour of the M10 provided good protection against the 50 mm mounted on most German tanks and anti-tank guns. The M10 was first made available to the British in 1943. These vehicles were open-topped and mounted a 3 inch (76.2 mm) M7 American gun, which was significantly more powerful than the Ordnance QF 6 pounder that was mounted on British tanks of the period and was of equal power to the 7.5 cm KwK 40 used by the Panzer IV and Sturmgeschütz III. Design An Achilles 17pdr Self- propelled anti-tank gun crossing the River Savio on a Churchill ARK which was driven into the river, 24 October 1944 The 17 pdr SP Achilles was basically a modified M10, the principal difference being the gun. The main armament of the Achilles was the Ordnance QF 17 pounder, a substantially more powerful gun than the 3 in (76.2 mm) M7 mounted on the standard M10. The single top-mounted .50 calibre M2 Browning heavy machine gun was retained. The 17 pounder mounted on the Achilles was able to penetrate some 140 mm of armour at and 131 mm at using standard Armour Piercing, Capped, Ballistic Capped (APCBC) ammunition impacting at a 30-degree angle. When supplied, Armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) ammunition could penetrate some 209 mm (8 inches) of armour at 500 metres and 192 mm at 1,000 metres at a 30-degree angle, though the accuracy of the APDS round was poor during the war. In comparison, the M7 gun on the standard M10 using the same type of ammunition (APCBC) would penetrate 98 mm of armour at 500 m at a 30-degree angle, and 88 mm of armour at 1,000 metres at a 30-degree angle. Only with High Velocity Armour Piercing (HVAP) ammunition did that gun compare with the 17 pounder, the ammunition being able to penetrate 140 mm at 500 m at a 30-degree angle, and 127 mm at 1,000 m at a 30-degree angle. However, HVAP ammunition was in very short supply, whereas the standard 17 pounder ammunition was available in huge quantities for the British. The 17 pounder required a counterweight fitted behind the muzzle brake on its long barrel. This gave the Achilles a distinctive appearance compared to the comparatively short-barrelled, brakeless, entirely straight barrel of the M10. Once the Germans discovered the effectiveness of the Achilles' gun on the same M10 carriage as the much less powerful M7 gun, attempts were made to disguise the 17 pounder by painting its brake and counterweight. Two other material changes were made to the Achilles: the addition of thick armour plates welded to the front and sides of the M10 to increase armour protection; and the M10's open turret was fitted with a 20 mm thick shield to provide protection from overhead threats. Production German personnel examine an Achilles of 245 Battery, 62nd Regiment, Royal Artillery, knocked out with three penetrating hits to its turret in Normandy, 1944 An Achilles 17-pdr tank destroyer uses a building as cover in Hassum, near Goch in Germany, 20 February 1945 The desire to mount the 17 pounder on the M10 was governed by the degree of difficulty involved in mounting the 17 pounder on the tank itself. Luckily for the British, the initial batches of M10s had an easily modified gun mounting to facilitate the future replacement of the older 3 inch M7 gun with the newer 76 mm gun M1. This gun mounting design allowed for the British to replace the 3 inch gun with the 17 pounder gun. The British took delivery of some 845 vehicles in 1943, but of the second version of the M10, only the T71 mark designed to carry the M1 gun could carry the 17 pounder.Buckley, J. \\"British Armour in the Normandy Campaign\\" Abingdon (2004) p. 171 The British had planned to convert some 1,000 M10s into 17pdr armed variants for Normandy, but for some reason conversions were not started until April 1944. By D-Day, only some 124 M10s had been converted; however, the number of conversions post D-day increased and by the end of the year 816 M10s had been converted, 152 vehicles in November alone. However, the low numbers at D-day meant both that many British units went ashore fielding standard M10s and losses in Achilles units were often replaced by standard 3\\" armed M10s. As a self-propelled anti-tank gun, both Achilles and standard M10s were distributed to and operated by the regiments of the Royal Artillery. Around 1,650 M10s were received by the British during the war, with 1,100 converted to the 17 pdr by its end. Operational use The standard anti-tank gun used in infantry units in the British Army was the 6 pounder, a small, light gun able to defeat the more common German Panzer IV and Sturmgeschütz with regular ammunition but not the heavier Panthers and Tigers. The next generation British gun, the 17 pounder, was able to deal with Tigers and Panthers but had a far longer emplacement time prior to battle than the 6 pounder due to its larger size, often taking a day to fully prepare for action. As a result, the British used the Achilles as a quickly deployable anti-tank gun, able to reinforce a position taken by infantry and engage counter-attacking German forces while the slower towed 17 pounders were pulled up and dug in for a more long-term defensive presence. This had the advantage of mitigating the weak armour protection of the Achilles as being used defensively usually allowed it to fire the vital first shot. This was in line with the original design concept of the vehicle, intended to blunt German \\"blitzkrieg\\" attack tactics. The M10/Achilles turret had an extremely slow manual only turret rotation, a limited tactical disadvantage when the tank was used only in a defensive role. As such, they had an advantage over German Stugs, which had no turret rotation. However, the Stug's low profile and heavy armour were significant assets that allowed it to be successful in its different tactical environment. Usually, the only time the British used the M10 and Achilles offensively was in support of Churchill tank units, which lacked the associated 17 pdr-armed tanks that Sherman and Cromwell tank units had. Achilles went ashore on D-Day, equipping units of the Royal Artillery and Royal Canadian Artillery in Armoured Division or Corps Anti-tank Regiments. A typical A/Tk Regiment would have 4 Batteries, 2 x Towed 17 Pdr Batteries, 1 x Achilles and 1 x M10 Battery. The M10 Battery was replaced by a second Achilles Battery as more vehicles became available. Perhaps the most successful action of the Achilles was conducted by B troop, 245th Battery, 62nd Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery attached to the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry during Operation Charnwood. South of Buron, a counterattack by a mixed force of Panzer IV and Panther tanks of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment was defeated by Achilles and 17-pounder anti tank guns of 245th Battery, 62nd Anti-tank Regiment. Thirteen German tanks were destroyed in one of the most successful antitank engagements of the campaign, for the loss of four self- propelled guns and a further four damaged.Copp (2003), pp. 103–104, 296–297 Surviving examples File:M10 (17pdr) Achilles Ic (35807817713).jpg17pdr SP Achilles on display at The Tank Museum, Bovington UK File:17-pounder Achilles SP Tank Destroyer, 3rd Cav Museum, Fort Hood, Texas (1).jpgAt the 3rd Cavalry Museum, Fort Hood, Texas File:M10 Achilles self-propelled gun outside the Bastogne Historical Centre.jpgDisplayed outside the Bastogne War Museum See also * Archer (tank destroyer) - a 17 pdr gun in a fixed position on a Valentine tank chassis. * M36 tank destroyer - an American 90mm gun upgrade of the M10 References Further reading * British Anti-tank Artillery 1939-45 By Chris Henry, Brian Delf at google books World War II tanks of the United Kingdom Sherman World War II tank destroyers ","title":"17pdr SP Achilles"},{"id":"18777871","text":"Narromine Airport is a small airport in Narromine, New South Wales, Australia.

She was awarded the Padma Shri in 2001 by Government of India for her contribution to spreading literacy among the impoverished adivasi peoples of Odisha. Munda started an informal school in 1964 in Odisha's iron ore mining area to educate children from local adivasi populations, who would otherwise have ended up as child labour in the mines. She had been a child labourer in the mines of Keonjhar herself. Munda is illiterate and has no formal education. She belongs to the Munda ethnic group of adivasis, the collective term in mainland South Asia for indigenous peoples. She is popularly known as \\"Tulasi Apa\\", literally meaning \\"Sister Tulasi\\" in Odia. Early life Munda was born on 15 July 1947 in Kainshi village located in the present-day Keonjhar district in Odisha. Keonjhar is one of the most economically underdeveloped districts in Odisha. As a child, she wished to study but the idea of educating girls and women was largely socially unacceptable at the time. Child labour, poverty and slavery prevented indigenous children from getting an education. When she was 12, she went to Serenda village to live with her sister. There she worked in the mines. Activism In 1961, Munda met social reformers Ramadevi Choudhury, Nirmala Deshpande and Malati Choudhury who advocated for education for women. She joined their efforts happening in different parts of the country. Munda also met Acharya Vinoba Bhave when he visited Odisha in 1963 during the Bhoodan movement. Her social service training and the guidance of social reformers inspired her future efforts. She returned to Serenda in 1964 and started an informal school for children in the veranda of her home. Later, she started the \\"Adivasi Vikas Samiti School\\". As of 2019, the school provides education up to the 10th standard for nearly 500 boy and girl students every year. The school has increased the level of education and standard of living in the area. Since 1964, she has educated more than 20,000 children and helped the government establish 17 schools for primary or secondary education.

The state park lies adjacent to the southwest corner of the much larger Turtle Mountain Provincial Park in Manitoba. A small portion of the lake extends northward into the Rural Municipality of Winchester but is not part of either park. History The name Lake Metigoshe is derived from the Ojibwe phrase mitigoshi-waashegami- zaaga'igan meaning \\"clearwater lake of scrub-oaks.\\" The area was also once home to the Blackfoot, Hidatsa, and Assiniboine peoples. The park was developed by workers with the WPA who arrived at the site beginning in 1934. Their improvements included construction of a lodge, recreation rooms large enough for 200 people, roads, and various out buildings. A stone inscribed \\"WPA 1938\\" found near the park entrance commemorates their work. The park was formally established on February 17, 1937. Activities and amenities The park offers swimming, canoeing, sailing, water-skiing and other water sports, modern and primitive camping areas, and picnicking. Lake Metigoshe has northern pike, walleye, and perch for fishing. Winter activities include snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, skating, sledding, and ice fishing.

Languell, and Mocean Melvin, on the Discovery Channel in which several groups of scientists experiment with radical ideas to slow and/or stop global warming using geoengineering methods.  Projects  The show consists of eight experiments to weigh pros and cons of ideas on how to reduce global warming. The projects are as follows:  Wrapping Greenland  Seeing if glacier melting on Greenland can be prevented by covering them with insulating sheets.  Raining Forests  Led by scientist Mark Hodges, they attempt to reforest areas of bare Earth from helicopters using canisters holding a tree seedling.  Brighter Earth  Led by atmospheric physicist John Latham and engineer Stephen Salter, the team attempted a Cloud reflectivity enhancement experiment. Their goal was to make clouds more reflective to bounce more of the Sun's heat generating rays back into space as a stop-gap against global warming. By changing the size of water droplets within a cloud, they make clouds brighter and reflect the Sun's heat into space. They choose to seed marine stratocumulus clouds because of their commonality around the world and the fact that they are low-lying, making it easier for man-made droplets to reach them. The Project Earth team uses the potassium chloride and sodium chloride from (salt-based) flares to form droplet particles that are one micrometre in diameter, and that can rise to , even in adverse (cloudless) conditions. The experiment proves that man-made droplets can indeed seed stratocumulus clouds. The team is also charged with creating a delivery system for the cloud creation mechanisms that allows for low carbon emission, remote controlled vessels. They employ the concept of the Flettner rotor by fabricating rotors and installing them onto a reinforced/retrofitted trimaran. After a series of computer simulations based on current and rising CO2 levels, Basil determined that without the proposed fleet of ships, the average global temperature would rise 2.9 degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st Century; enough to melt glaciers that are important to the freshwater needs of Asia and Africa and the hydro-electric power needs of Europe. Using a fleet of 1500 cloud enhancing ships employing the recently discovered technologies would reduce that average global temperature change to only 1 degree Celsius by the end of the 21st century. The slower rise in temperature would grant humanity more time to reduce carbon emissions before a major climate related catastrophe was likely to strike. The estimated cost of the fleet of remote- operated cloud enhancing vessels would was valued at $5.8 billion US, a fraction of the $44 trillion US world economy that would be irreparably damaged if climate change were to continue unchecked.  Infinite Winds  Testing of a revolutionary wind turbine led by Inventor and lead engineer Fred Ferguson (Magenn Power) in an attempt to harness the energy of high-altitude winds. The team will test a prototype attached to a blimp over The Appalachians to harness the endless supply of wind.  Hungry Oceans  Dr. Brian von Herzen and the Discovery team join Professors David M Karl (University of Hawaii) and Ricardo M Letelier (Oregon State University) to test wave powered pumps in an effort to bring nutrients from the depths of the oceans to the surface. This nutrient enrichment of the open ocean's well-lit surface layers is needed to enhance photosynthesis and trigger large blooms of phytoplankton that could increase the role of vast oceanic regions in the sequestration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. However, before producing large scale perturbations using these pumps, the scientific team from Hawaii and Oregon wants to better understand the risks and benefits of such large scale perturbations by looking at the effect that the deployment of a few pumps may have in the environment.  Space Sunshield  Attempting to create a sunshade by placing trillions of lenses in space, led by astronomer and professor Roger Angel. Angel has developed a diffraction pattern by etching onto a lens, which will deflect the Sun's rays.  Orbital Power Plant  Former NASA physicist John C. Mankins's vision of launching thousands of satellites into space, gathering solar energy from the Sun and beaming it down to Earth as microwave energy. The energy will then be collected by antennas on the ground, which will convert it into electricity.  Fixing Carbon  Testing to see if the air can be scrubbed clean of its carbon dioxide.

He obtained his PhD (equivalent) from the Czech Technical University in Prague in 1975 then worked for 15 years (1975–1990) as a scientist in the field of cybernetics, general systems theory, science of science, and human environment, specializing in macro-ecology of Man and environmental policy. During this period he was a member of the executive body of the Ecological Section of the Biological Society, Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences (1985–1991), one of the founding members of the first executive body of the Circle of Independent Intelligentsia (1988–1989) and a member of the Club of Rome. He was also one of the founders of the Civic Forum and later of the Civic Movement in Czechoslovakia and a member of their executive bodies.Osobnost:Josef Vavroušek in Neviditelný pes He coordinated (with Bedřich Moldan) the translation of Limits to Growth into Czech. In 1989 Vavroušek was one of the leaders of the Czechoslovakian Velvet Revolution. In April 1990 he became vice-chairman of the State Commission for Scientific and Technical Development (responsible for the environment), and then in June 1990 he became the first (and last) environment Minister of the Federal Government of Czechoslovakia. It was in this role that Vavroušek proposed and organized the first pan-European conference of environment Ministers. Josef Vavroušek formulated his \\"Ten Commandments\\" of values compatible and incompatible with a sustainable way of life in 1993 and considered it a preliminary proposal. He died in spring 1995 and so he could not finish it. As environment Minister he headed the Czechoslovakian delegation to the Rio Summit in 1992, but then political changes and the division of the country brought his ministerial career to a premature end. Returning to science he joined the Institute of Applied Ecology at Charles University and then went on to found and become president of the Society for Sustainable LivingWeb of Society for Sustainable Living (established in October, 1992). Vavroušek’s contribution to European environmental cooperation was to bring the interdisciplinary experience and understanding of how human systems and the environment work into mainstream political parlance across the new Europe at the time of its birth and to emphasize the importance of human values and environmental ethics in the search for sustainable ways of living. Vavroušek was killed with his daughter Petra by an avalanche on March 18, 1995 while they were hiking in the Slovak mountains. Book *Vavroušek, J. (1993).

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Robert McKimson. The cartoon was released on July 12, 1947, and stars Henery Hawk, Sylvester, Foghorn Leghorn and the Barnyard Dawg. This is McKimson's first short to feature Sylvester. Plot Sylvester is sneaking to the doghouse in a bush. He tries to steal the bone, but the Barnyard Dawg grabs the paw and looks inside the bush to see Sylvester with a flower in his mouth and several more flowers on his head. After Sylvester deliberately whacks Barnyard Dawg on the head with his dog food dish, Barnyard Dawg gives chase and chases Sylvester on the wall and jumps over a branch, only to get caught by the leash and hangs from the branch by the leash. Sylvester is about to cut the leash with an axe, but Foghorn grabs the blade and Sylvester whacks too hard and vibrates as he goes by the fire wood, and the branch breaks and Barnyard Dawg gets hit on the head and walks off. When Foghorn is telling Sylvester \\"Let's bury the hat- I say- let's bury the hatchet, but not in anyone's head, boy!\\" while Sylvester is trying to speak, Sylvester angrily yells \\"Ah, SHADDAP!\\" and whacks Foghorn on the head with the bladeless axe and leaves as Foghorn sees stars and still holds the blade. After Henery tells Foghorn that he is a chicken, Foghorn convinces Henery that Sylvester is a chicken. Foghorn sticks Henery in an egg and places it under Sylvester. Sylvester wakes up, thinking he's laid the egg and has become a mother, sings \\"Rock A Bye Baby\\" to it then hides the egg when he sees Foghorn coming and Foghorn congratulates Sylvester for laying the egg, only Sylvester realizes that cats can't lay eggs (\\"Hey, tom cats can't be mothers! Cats don't lay eggs! There's something screwy here!) and Sylvester attempts to detach himself from this egg that suddenly follows him and attaches itself to him and that literally scares Sylvester out of his wits when he thinks the egg is possessed by a ghost. He runs from it and literally does all sorts of things including running into the dog house belonging to the Barnyard Dawg. The dog pulls the cat out and stomps all over him and walks off. Henery, still in the egg, runs into the dog, which causes the dog to trip and fall over. The dog looks at the egg and then at the camera and says to the audience: \\"Look at that! I takes a step and PRESTO! I lays an egg!\\". The scene fades to a mother duck, with her ducklings, who says to herself \\"Presto, and he lays an egg. And to think for fifteen years I've been doing it the hard way\\". The egg/Henery finally discovers Sylvester's hiding spot (a barrel), and he starts to burrow himself into Sylvester's skin, presumably for \\"mock incubation\\" reasons. Reaching a breaking point, Sylvester comes close to literally smashing the egg with a mallet. Just as the egg is about to be smashed, Henery busts out of the egg and yells \\"STOP!\\" to which Sylvester, in a classic \\"wild take\\" scene, literally yanks his head up and down by his ears and grabs his tail and literally yanks on it, causing his head to literally pop up and down on his shoulders because Sylvester thinks he's crazy. Henery, seeing enough, clobbers Sylvester with a mallet and drags him off. Sylvester wakes up and asks \\"Say, what's the big idea?!\\" and Henery warns the \\"chicken\\" to not give him any trouble and Sylvester realizes that he's been part of a trick and he leaps up and shows Henery that the actual chicken, is Foghorn himself. Foghorn replies, insulted by the accusation \\"If I was a roost- I say -if I was a rooster, I hope to be struck by--\\" but gets interrupted when he almost literally gets struck by lightning and decides to \\"put it another way.

Finally, Henery decides the only way to settle the matter is to see who crows at dawn, and they all agree to do so. At dawn, Sylvester appears to be crowing, which leads to Henery dragging Sylvester away. However, it turns out that Foghorn was crowing, and he shows a book on ventriloquism.

The 279 BC invasion of Greece proper was preceded by a series of other military campaigns waged in the southern Balkans and against the kingdom of Macedonia, favoured by the state of confusion ensuing from the disputed succession after Alexander the Great's death. A part of the invasion crossed over to Anatolia and eventually settled in the area that came to be named after them, Galatia.  Settlement of South-Eastern Europe  From the 4th century BC, Celtic groups pushed into the Carpathian region and the Danube basin, coinciding with their movement into Italy. The Boii and Volcae were two large Celtic confederacies who generally cooperated in their campaigns. Splinter groups moved south via two major routes: one following the Danube river, another eastward from Italy. According to legend, 300,000 Celts moved into Italy and Illyria. By the 3rd century, the native inhabitants of Pannonia were almost completely Celticized. La Tène remains are found widely in Pannonia, but finds westward beyond the Tisza river and south beyond the Sava are rather sparse. These finds are deemed to have been locally produced Norican-Pannonian variation of Celtic culture. Nevertheless, features are encountered that suggest ongoing contacts with distant provinces such as Iberia. The fertile lands around the Pannonian rivers enabled the Celts to establish themselves easily, developing their agriculture and pottery, and at the same time exploiting the rich mines of modern Poland. Thus, it appears that the Celts had created a new homeland for themselves in the southern part of Central Europe; in a region stretching from Poland to the river Danube.  Early expeditions  The political situation in the northern Balkans was in constant flux with various tribes dominant over their neighbours at any one time. Within tribes, military expeditions were conducted by \\"an enterprising and mobile warrior class able from time to time to conquer large areas and to exploit their population\\". The political situation in the Balkans during the 4th century BC played to the Celts' advantage. The Illyrians had been waging war against the Greeks, leaving their western flank weak. While Alexander ruled Greece, the Celts dared not to push south near Greece. Therefore, early Celtic expeditions were concentrated against Illyrian tribes. The first Balkan tribe to be defeated by the Celts was the Illyric Autariatae, who, during the 4th century BC, had enjoyed a hegemony over much of the central Balkans, centred on the Morava valley. An account of Celtic tactics is revealed in their attacks on the Ardiaei. In 335 BC, the Celts sent representatives to pay homage to Alexander the Great, while Macedon was engaged in wars against Thracians on its northern border. Some historians suggest that this 'diplomatic' act was actually an evaluation of Macedonian military might. After the death of Alexander the Great, Celtic armies began to bear down on the southern regions, threatening the Greek kingdom of Macedonia and the rest of Greece. In 310 BC, the Celtic general Molistomos attacked deep into Illyrian territory, trying to subdue Dardanians, Paeonians and Triballi. However Molistomos was defeated by the Dardanians. The new Macedonian king Cassander felt compelled to take some of his old Illyrian enemies under his protection even though Illyrians emerged victorious. In 298 BC, the Celts attempted a penetrating attack into Thrace and Macedon, where they suffered a heavy defeat near Haemus Mons at the hands of Cassander. However, another body of Celts led by the general Cambaules marched on Thrace, capturing large areas. The Celtic tribe of the SerdiThe Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC by John Boardman, I. E. S. Edwards, E. Sollberger, and N. G. L. Hammond, , 1992, page 600: „In the place of the vanished Treres and Tilataei we find the Serdi for whom there is no evidence before the first century BC. It has for long being supposed on convincing linguistic and archeological grounds that this tribe was of Celtic origin.“ lived in Thrace and founded the city of Serdica, present day Sofia.  Invasions of Greece   Great expedition of 279 BC  The routes taken by the Gauls The Celtic military pressure toward Greece in the southern Balkans reached its turning point in 281 BC. The collapse of Lysimachus' successor kingdom in Thrace opened the way for the migration. The cause for this is explained by Pausanias as greed for loot, by Justin as a result of overpopulation, and by Memnon as the result of famine. According to Pausanias, an initial probing raid led by Cambaules withdrew when they realized they were too few in numbers. In 280 BC, a great army comprising about 85,000 warriors left Pannonia, split into three divisions, and marched south in a great expeditionThe term is a calque of the parallel French Grande expédition, that indicates, in French scholarly usage, the 279 BC surge of military campaigns on Greece. to Macedon and central Greece. Under the leadership of Cerethrius, 20,000 men moved against the Thracians and Triballi. Another division, led by BrennusBrennus is said to have belonged to an otherwise unknown tribe called the Prausi. See: Strabo, Geography 4:1.13. Not to be confused with the Brennus of the previous century, who sacked Rome in 387 BC. and AcichoriusSome writers suppose that Brennus and Acichorius are the same person, the former being only a title and the latter the real name. Schmidt, \\"De fontibus veterum auctorum in enarrandis expeditionibus a Gallis in Macedoniania susceptis,\\" Berol. 1834 moved against the Paionians, while the third division, headed by Bolgios, aimed for the Macedonians and Illyrians. The Dying Gaul, a Roman copy of a Greek statue commemorating the victory over the Galatians Bolgios inflicted heavy losses on the Macedonians, whose young king, Ptolemy Keraunos, was captured and decapitated. However, Bolgios' contingent was repulsed by the Macedonian nobleman Sosthenes, and satisfied with the loot they had won, Bolgios' contingents turned back. Sosthenes, in turn, was attacked and defeated by Brennus and his division, who were then free to ravage the country. After these expeditions returned home, Brennus urged and persuaded them to mount a third united expedition against central Greece, led by himself and Acichorius. The reported strength of the army of 152,000 infantry and 24,400 cavalry is impossibly large. The actual number of horsemen has to be intended half as big: Pausanias describes how they used a tactic called trimarcisia, where each cavalryman was supported by two mounted servants, who could supply him with a spare horse should he have to be dismounted, or take his place in the battle, should he be killed or wounded.  Battle of Thermopylae (279 BC)  A Greek coalition made up of Aetolians, Boeotians, Athenians, Phocians, and other Greeks north of Corinth took up quarters at the narrow pass of Thermopylae, on the east coast of central Greece. During the initial assault, Brennus' forces suffered heavy losses. Hence he decided to send a large force under Acichorius against Aetolia. The Aetolian detachment, as Brennus hoped, left Thermopylae to defend their homes. The Aetolians joined the defence en masse – the old and women joining the fight. Realizing that the Gallic sword was dangerous only at close quarters, the Aetolians resorted to skirmishing tactics. According to Pausanias, only half the number that had set out for Aetolia returned. Eventually, Brennus found a way around the pass at Thermopylae, but by then the Greeks had escaped by sea.  Attack on Delphi  Delphi Brennus pushed on to Delphi, where he was defeated and forced to retreat, after which he died of wounds sustained in the battle. His army fell back to the river Spercheios, where it was routed by the Thessalians and Malians. Both historians who relate the attack on Delphi, Pausanias and Junianus Justinus, say that the Gauls were defeated and driven off. They were overtaken by a violent thunderstorm, which made it impossible to manoeuvre or even hear their orders. The night that followed was frosty, and in the morning the Greeks attacked them from both sides. Brennus was wounded and the Gauls fell back, killing those of their own wounded who were unable to retreat. That night, a panic fell on the camp, as the Gauls divided into factions and fought amongst themselves. They were joined by Acichorius and the rest of the army, but the Greeks forced them into a full-scale retreat. Brennus took his own life by drinking neat wine according to Pausanias, or by stabbing himself according to Justinus. Pressed by the Aetolians, the Gauls fell back to the Spercheios, where the waiting Thessalians and Malians destroyed them. = Cursed Gold of Delphi = In spite of the Greek accounts about the defeat of the Gauls, the Roman literary tradition preferred a far different version. Strabo reports a story told in his time of a semi-legendary treasure – the aurum Tolosanum, fifteen thousand talents ( 450 metric tonnes/990,000 pounds ) of gold and silver – supposed to have been the cursed gold looted during the sack of Delphi and brought back to Tolosa (modern Toulouse, France) by the Tectosages, who were said to have been part of the invading army. More than a century and a half after the alleged sack, the Romans ruled Gallia Narbonensis. In 105 BC, while marching to Arausio, the Proconsul of Cisalpine Gaul Quintus Servilius Caepio plundered the sanctuaries of the town of Tolosa, whose inhabitants had joined the Cimbri, finding over 50,000 15 lb. bars of gold and 10,000 15 lb. bars of silver. The riches of Tolosa were shipped back to Rome, but only the silver made it: the gold was stolen by a band of marauders, who were believed to have been hired by Caepio himself and to have killed the legion guarding it. The Gold of Tolosa was never found, and was said to have been passed all the way down to the last heir of the Servilii Caepiones, Marcus Junius Brutus. In 105 BC, Caepio refused to co-operate with his superior officer, Gnaeus Mallius Maximus, because he thought of him as a novus homo, deciding by himself to engage in battle against the Cimbri, on the Rhone. There, the Roman army suffered a crushing defeat and complete destruction, in the so-called Battle of Arausio (modern Orange). Upon his return to Rome, Caepio was tried for \\"the loss of his Army\\" and embezzlement. He was convicted and given the harshest sentence allowable; he was stripped of his Roman citizenship, forbidden fire and water within 800 miles of Rome, fined 15,000 talents (about 825,000 lb) of gold, and forbidden from seeing or speaking to his friends or family until he had left for exile. He spent the rest of his life in exile in Smyrna in Asia Minor. His defeat and ensuing ruin were looked upon as a punishment for his sacrilegious theft. Strabo distances himself from this account, arguing that the defeated Gauls were in no position to carry off such spoils, and that, in any case, Delphi had already been despoiled of its treasure by the Phocians during the Third Sacred War in the previous century. However, Brennus' legendary pillage of Delphi is presented as fact by some popular modern historians.As did, for example, Peter Berresford Ellis, in his The Celtic Empire, Constable, 1990, pp. 82–84.  After the Greek campaigns  Ethnogenesis and migrations of the Volcae. Most scholars deem the Greek campaign a disaster for the Celts. Some of the survivors of the Greek campaign, led by Comontoris (one of Brennus' generals) settled in Thrace. In 277 BC, Antigonus II Gonatas defeated the Gauls at the Battle of Lysimachia and the survivors retreated, founding a short-lived city-state named Tyle. Another group of Gauls, who split off from Brennus' army in 281 BC, were transported over to Asia Minor by Nicomedes I to help him defeat his brother and secure the throne of Bithynia. They eventually settled in the region that came to be named after them, Galatia. They were defeated by Antiochus I, and as a result, they were confined to barren highlands in the centre of Anatolia.Cunliffe (1997), p.83 Celtic groups were still the pre-eminent political units in the northern Balkans from the 4th to the 1st century BC. The Boii controlled most of northern Pannonia during the 2nd century BC, and are also mentioned as having occupied the territory of modern Slovakia. We learn of other tribes of the Boian confederation inhabiting Pannonia. There were the Taurisci in the upper Sava valley, west of Sisak, as well as the Anarti, Osi and Cotini in the Carpathian basin. In the lower Sava valley, the Scordisci wielded much power over their neighbours for over a century. The later half of the 1st century BC brought much change to the power relations of barbarian tribes in Pannonia. The defeat of the Boian confederation by the Geto-Dacian king Burebista significantly curtailed Celtic control of the Carpathian basin, and some of the Celticization was reversed. Yet, more Celtic tribes appear in sources. The Hercuniates and Latobici migrated from the northern regions (Germania). Altogether new tribes are encountered, bearing Latin names (such as the Arabiates), possibly representing new creations carved out of the defeated Boian confederation. To further weaken Celtic hegemony in Pannonia, the Romans moved the Pannonian-Illyrian Azali to northern Pannonia. The political dominance previously enjoyed by the Celts was overshadowed by newer barbarian confederations, such the Marcomanni and Iazyges. Their ethnic independence was gradually lost as they were absorbed by the surrounding Dacian, Illyrian and Germanic peoples, although Celtic names survive until the 3rd century AD.

His book, Speechless Brothers, was the first comprehensive study of llama husbandry published in the United States.  Early life  Tillman was born in 1952 and grew up on a ranch in Athena, Oregon. Tillman attended Willamette University, and then the University of Oregon where he majored in literature and philosophy, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1974.Price, David E., \\"Andy Tillman '74\\", Old Oregon, Vol. 57, No.1, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, Fall 1977. After graduation, he worked for a summer at the Oakland Zoo in Oakland, California, where he got a close-up introduction to exotic animals. When he finished his summer job, Tillman returned to his family ranch, joined the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums, and bought his first llamas. He called his business Andes Llamas.\\"Meet Andy\\" , Tillman Llama and Suri Alpacas, www.tillmanllamas.com, Bend, Oregon, 6 August 2008.  Llama breeder  Tillman began raising llamas at his ranch near Athena in 1975. In 1978 he began publishing The Llama Newsletter, the nation's first llama publication. In addition to providing general information on llama ownership, breeding, and health, the newsletter became a forum for sharing scientific research such as the study of camelid blood chemistry used to determine pregnancy, llama taxonomy and evolution, and the bonding effects of bottle feeding young animals. Tillman personally contributed to a number of the studies.Bunch, Thomas D., Warren C. Foote, and Alma Maciulis, \\"Chromosome banding pattern homologies and NORs for the Bactrian camel, guanaco, and llama\\", The Journal of Heredity, American Genetic Association, Newport, Oregon, 1985. As a result, the Agency for International Development invited Tillman to study llamas and alpacas in Peru. In 1980, Tillman completed the project. Based on his comprehensive study of several thousands Peruvian animals, he became known internationally as an expert on llama and alpaca husbandry. In 1981, Tillman used his experience as the basis for his book Speechless Brothers. While the subject of llama ranching was new in North America, the book sold 14,000 copies.\\"Tillman Llamas & Suri Alpacas Celebrating 30 Years with Llamas\\", Llama Banner, Vol. 16, No. 2, Able Press, Manhattan, Kansas, 2005, pp. 10-13.Tillman, Andy, Speechless Brothers, Early Winter Press, Seattle, Washington, 1981. Tillman was a co-founder of the International Llama Association, and was the first president of the association. In 1986 he wrote the halter-class guidelines used by the American Llama Show Association to judge show animals. In 1988, he identified and described 130 physical characteristics of llama, alpaca, guanaco and vicuña. His scientific description of llamas and related species is still the most complete reference available.\\"The Tillman Timeline\\" , Tillman Llama and Suri Alpacas, www.tillmanllamas.com, Bend, Oregon, 6 August 2008. In 1988, Tillman married Dr. Cheryl Lee Blake. Shortly after their marriage, they moved to Bend, Oregon to accommodate Dr. Tillman's veterinary practice. After settling there, Tillman changed the name of his business to Tillman Llamas and Suri Alpacas to reflect a second business area he was developing.  Businessman  Tillman was first to import Bolivian suri alpacasIn 1993, Tillman expanded his business into South America, becoming the exclusive agent for Bolivian suri alpacas exports to the United States the following year. Tillman's South American heards eventually totaled several thousand llamas and alpacas. In 1995, his animals won first, second, and third place in the suri alpaca category at the National Expo-Feria in La Paz, Bolivia. He also won first place in the black huacaya alpaca competition, second place in the white fleece alpaca category, and third place for brown huacaya alpacas. This was the first time a North American breeder had ever won a major South American national show. In 1996, Tillman imported the first huacaya alpacas into the United States along with the largest herd of colored suri alpacas ever brought into the country, a total of 182 animals. Because the animals came from Bolivia, the United States Department of Agriculture required the herd to be quarantined for three months at the Harry S. Truman Animal Import Center in Key West, Florida. Nevertheless, it was a profitable venture for Tillman. The next year, he exported one hundred llamas and alpacas from his ranch in Bend to Canadian buyers. In 2007, Tillman sold his show champion llamas and alpacas and most of his breeding stock at an international auction held at the Indiana State Fair ground in Indianapolis, Indiana.\\"Andy & Dr. Cheryl Tillman Host Life Time Achievement Action at Indiana State Fairgrounds, September 1-2, 2007\\", Tillman Llama and Suri Alpacas, www.tillmanllamas.com, Bend, Oregon, 6 August 2008.

G-Dragon trained for six years, from the age of twelve, at South Korean entertainment label YG Entertainment before debuting in 2006 as the leader of the hip hop boy band Big Bang, which went on to become one of the best-selling boy bands in the world. His first solo album Heartbreaker and its title track of the same name, released in 2009, were commercially successful, becoming the best-selling album by a Korean soloist at the time and earning him Album of the Year at the 2009 Mnet Asian Music Awards. G-Dragon collaborated with Big Bang bandmate T.O.P to release the album GD & TOP in 2010. His first EP One of a Kind (2012), was critically acclaimed and had three singles: \\"One of a Kind\\", \\"Crayon\\", and the chart-topper \\"That XX\\". The EP earned Record of the Year at the 2013 Seoul Music Awards. In 2013, he embarked on his first worldwide tour as a solo artist, making him the first Korean soloist to tour Japanese dome arenas. G-Dragon was awarded Artist of the Year at the 2013 Mnet Asian Music Awards following the success of his second album Coup d'Etat (2013). His 2017 EP, Kwon Ji Yong, yielded the number one single \\"Untitled, 2014\\", and the supporting concert tour Act III: M.O.T.T.E became the largest tour ever conducted by a Korean soloist. Widely recognized for his influence on youth culture, fashion trends, and music in South Korea, G-Dragon was named by Forbes in 2016 as the most influential person under 30 in Asia's entertainment and sports. G-Dragon has written or co-written 23 number one songs on the Gaon Digital Chart (equivalent to the Billboard Hot 100), most of which he has also co-produced.  Life and career  G-Dragon at MTV Fast Forward, Thailand, 2007 1988–2008: Early life and debut with Big Bang Born on August 18, 1988, and raised in Seoul, Kwon Ji-yong began his career at age six as part of the group Little Roo'Ra. After releasing a Christmas album, the group's contract was terminated by their record company, which came as a \\"shock\\" to G-Dragon. Although he vowed to his mother that he \\"wouldn't [try to become a singer] again,\\" he was scouted by SM Entertainment on a ski trip with his family. He was a trainee under the record label for five years (from 8–13 years old), specializing in dance before he left. In third grade, a friend introduced Kwon to the American rap group Wu-Tang Clan. Inspired by their music, he developed an interest in rapping and began taking classes. Under People Crew's tutelage, he participated in the release of the Korean hip-hop album Flex in 2001, becoming the youngest Korean rapper at 13 years old. Although he wrote his own lyrics, he admitted that his English was weak and the story behind the lyrics was just another typical \\"I'm young, but I'm the best\\" story. Additionally, he and future fellow Big Bang member Choi Seung- hyun were \\"neighborhood friend[s] from middle school\\" and would often dance and rap together before Kwon moved away. Catching the interest of Sean of the hip-hop duo Jinusean from YG Entertainment, he recommended Kwon to Sean's record label's CEO Yang Hyun Suk. After signing a contract with the record label, Kwon spent the first year cleaning the studio for the other artists in the record label and fetching water bottles during dance practice. Kwon and another trainee, Dong Young-bae, originally planned to debut as the hip hop duo GDYB. Kwon chose the stage name G-Dragon (\\"Ji\\" is pronounced like \\"G\\", and Yong is Korean for \\"dragon\\"). He featured on other artists' albums and even released several singles with Dong under the name \\"GDYB.\\" After YG Entertainment scrapped the plan and opted for a boy band instead, Kwon contacted Choi, who auditioned in. G-Dragon, Dong (who chose the stage name Taeyang), and Choi (who chose the stage name T.O.P), were paired with three other members (Jang Hyun-seung, Daesung, and Seungri). The formation of the group was documented on television, but prior to their official debut, Jang was dropped. The now-quintet's debut was a moderate success, with their first album selling over 100,000 copies, and included G-Dragon's first solo recording, a cover of the American alternative rock group Maroon 5's single \\"This Love\\". The release of the EP Always in 2007 was a musical departure from their previous materials and saw G-Dragon's increased involvement in its production. Several songs were composed by him, including the lead-single \\"Lies\\" (), which became the group's first number one hit. Their following EPs followed its predecessor's footsteps: Hot Issue yielded \\"Last Farewell\\" () while Stand Up spawned \\"Day by Day\\" (); both singles, composed by him, were chart-toppers. Having produced the majority of Big Bang's materials, G-Dragon became involved with the production of Taeyang's debut extended play Hot (2008), after which he subsequently recorded a \\"Part Two\\" to the EP's lead single \\"Only Look at Me\\" (). 2009–2011: Solo career development, Heartbreaker, and GD & TOP In 2009, G-Dragon was featured on singer Lexy's song \\"Super Fly\\" for her album Rush alongside Taeyang and T.O.P. He later collaborated with the Japanese boy band W-inds. for their single, \\"Rain Is Fallin'/Hybrid Dream\\". His first solo album, Heartbreaker, was initially scheduled to be released in April that year, but was pushed back to August to coincide with his 21st (Korean years: 22nd) birthday. Featuring collaborations with several artists, including Teddy of 1TYM, Taeyang, Kush, CL of 2NE1, and Sandara Park of 2NE1, the album marked a change in G-Dragon's appearance as he dyed his hair blonde to match its concept. Propelled by its lead-single of the same name, an electronic pop song that sold nearly five million downloads, the album surpassed 300,000 copies sold and went on to win Album of the Year from the 2009 Mnet Asian Music Awards. Shortly after Heartbreaker's release, G-Dragon was accused of plagiarism by Sony Music when his tracks \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Butterfly\\" were alleged to be similar to Flo Rida's \\"Right Round\\" and Oasis's \\"She's Electric\\", respectively. However, EMI, the record label that distributed \\"Right Round\\" said that they saw no similarities between these two songs. On March 6, 2010, YG Entertainment announced that they personally contacted Flo Rida's representatives requesting that he feature in G-Dragon's live album, Shine a Light, to which Flo Rida accepted. In support of his album, G-Dragon staged his first solo concert at Olympic Gymnastics Arena in December 2009. The name of the concert, Shine a Light, was derived from the lyrics to his song \\"A Boy\\". The concert subsequently sparked controversy following complaints of obscenity and suggestive content. The Korean Ministry of Health, Welfare and Family Affairs later asked the government prosecutors to investigate if G-Dragon or YG Entertainment violated laws on obscene performances in his concert. He was found innocent and was cleared of all charges on March 15, 2010. 250px In November 2010, G-Dragon and T.O.P released their collaboration album GD & TOP. Preceding the release of the album, the duo held a worldwide premiere showcase for their album at Times Square in Yeongdeungpo of Seoul, which was also broadcast live on YouTube. To promote their album, the duo released three singles: \\"High High\\", \\"Oh Yeah\\", and \\"Knock Out\\" (Korean: 뻑이가요; Revised Romanization: Ppeogigayo). All three singles preceded the release of the album and achieved commercial success: \\"High High\\" scored number one on several music programs while \\"Oh Yeah\\" peaked at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart. The album was released on Christmas Eve, and debuted at number one on the Gaon Album Chart with pre-orders of 200,000 copies. G-Dragon also formed a duo with Park Myung Soo for the Infinite Challenge Seohae Ahn Highway Song Festival 2011. They released their song \\"Having an Affair ()\\" featuring Park Bom from 2NE1 on June 2, 2011. The song later became the second most downloaded song on the Gaon Music Chart for the year 2011. Promotional activities halted after G-Dragon tested positive for marijuana. Though a urine test back in August came back negative, a weak positive for marijuana was detected from testing the content of his hair in October. Since it was his first recorded offense with a minuscule amount of the drug, it resulted in an indictment and he was not charged. He later claimed to have accepted a cigarette offered by a fan in Japan during a party back in May, but after realizing it was not a normal cigarette, threw it away. He made his first public appearance after the scandal at the 2011 MTV EMAs with his group. 2012–2013: One of a Kind, world tour, and Coup d'Etat Alive Galaxy Tour in September 2012190px While working on new solo materials, G-Dragon made an appearance in the Japanese version of Pixie Lott's album Young Foolish Happy, along with T.O.P. His first extended play One of a Kind was released on September 15, 2012, drawing positive reviews, placing first on the Billboard World Album Chart and entering the Billboard 200 Chart at 161. Three singles were released to support the album: the top-five hit \\"One of a Kind,\\" which earned him the Best Hip Hop and Rap Song of the Year awards from the Korean Music Awards and the Rhythmer Awards respectively; the number one \\"That XX\\" (Korean: 그 XX; Revised Romanization: Geu XX); and the top-three hit \\"Crayon\\" that was ranked by Spin Magazine as the best K-Pop single of the year. The album sold over 200,000 copies, making it the highest selling solo album in Korea since the release of his debut album Heartbreaker in 2009. He won \\"Best Male Solo Artist\\" at the 14th Mnet Asian Music Awards and \\"Record of the Year\\" for One of a Kind at the 22nd Seoul Music Awards. G-Dragon also embarked on the One of a Kind World Tour in 2013, becoming the first Korean solo artist to hold a four-dome tour in Japan and the second Korean solo artist to have a world tour (the first being Rain). The production of the tour cost $3.5 million, making it the largest scale in Korean history at the time. The tour was held in 8 countries, visited 13 cities for a total of 27 concerts gathering 570,000 fans. G-Dragon performed \\"Shake The World\\" as an intro to \\"One Of A Kind,\\" \\"Feat.

He later took home the World's Best Entertainer and World's Best Album at the World Music Awards.

The duo teamed up with ZE:A's Hwang Kwanghee and released the single \\"Mapsosa\\", which peaked at No. 2 on the Gaon Digital Chart, and sold 1.1 million copies by the end of the year, making it one of the best-selling songs of 2015. He appeared on the same show again the following year, for the Muhan Company special, in which he acted for the first time.

After the promotional activities with his band wrapped up, G-Dragon began preparing for the release of his new album, along with a solo concert tour. The single \\"Bullshit\\" was set to serve as the lead single to precede the release of his second self-titled EP. Due to bandmate T.O.P's marijuana scandal, and the single's provocative name, \\"Untitled, 2014\\" was released to radio instead to avoid further controversy for the artist's record label. Forgoing the traditional method of releasing music on CDs, Kwon Ji Yong was released in USB flash drive format on June 8, drawing criticism from Gaon, which refused to regard it as an official album. Gaon reversed its decision later that year, acknowledging the unconventional format as legitimate. The release saw him topping iTunes charts in 46 countries, the most by any Korean album, including the US iTunes chart. Kwon Ji Yong also topped the iTunes worldwide album and European iTunes charts making him the first Korean soloist to do so.

A behind-the-scenes documentary look at the tour was released by YouTube Premium in September 2018. G-Dragon began his two-year mandatory military service on February 27, 2018, by entering the 3rd Infantry Division’s boot camp in Gangwon province as an active duty soldier, where he was set to be discharged on October 26, 2019, after completing the requirements. On May 17, 2018, G-Dragon was reported to have undergone surgery to his right ankle due to previous injuries. He returned to his military base a few days later. However, on June 25, 2018, South Korean media outlet, Dispatch, reported that the artist was receiving special treatment in Yangzhou Armed Forces Hospital during his stay. He was said to be resting in a hospital room dedicated to Colonels although he is only a Private First Class. Later on, his music label, YG Entertainment, as well as the Ministry of Defense released statements claiming that the allegations were false and that he was not receiving any special treatments. In the midst of the rumors, a petition has been set up in the government's website to shut down Dispatch due to the belief that the company was releasing fabricated articles in attempts to entertain people without any regards to the validity of the news as well as how the news would affect the person or people involved. On October 26, 2019, G-Dragon was officially discharged from the military. Shortly after his discharge, G-Dragon collaborated with Nike in November 2019 for the Nike Air Force 1 Para-Noise, being the first Korean singer to do so. G-Dragon signed a contract to model a famous beverage brand called \\"Chapai\\" in China's Nongpushan.  Artistry   Music  Inspired by the music of Wu-Tang Clan and citing American singer Pharrell Williams as his \\"musical hero\\", G-Dragon's production discography is predominately hip hop. He has also listed Jinusean, Fabolous and Kanye West as influences. At the age of 12, he participated in the annual hip hop Flex album in an attempt jumpstart his career as a hip hop artist. When Big Bang debuted, G-Dragon produced mainly hip hop songs for their albums before the quintet branched out and experimented with electronic music, setting it as the new music trend in Korea. While the band continues to incorporate a diverse range of genre into their materials, G-Dragon focuses mainly on hip hop for his solo efforts and the two sub-units he is a part of (GD & TOP, GD X Taeyang) to contrast Big Bang's sound. His first album Heartbreaker was a mix of dance, hip-hop, and R&B; while acoustic, hip hop and electronic music influenced GD & TOP. The song \\"Crayon\\" from the EP One of a Kind is a mix between hip-hop and electronic music whereas \\"One of a Kind\\" is hip hop and pop-rap song. G-Dragon's second album, Coup d'Etat, is noted for being an eclectic mix of hip-hop, dubstep, rock, electro, and pop, with Jessica Oak from Billboard magazine describing the album's title track, which was co-produced by American DJs Diplo and Baauer, as a slow tempo trap influenced song. The song also samples Gil Scott-Heron's \\"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.\\" Meanwhile, \\"Crooked\\" was described as a \\"synthed-up, deliriously catchy pop-punk\\" with a \\"neon-bright\\" sound, fusing \\"heavy drumbeats and metal guitar riffs\\" and featuring a \\"heavy bass line and fully amplified sound at the chorus.\\" In the track, G-Dragon also mixes rap with singing. \\"Niliria\\" was noted for sounding ethnic and surrealist. Kwon Ji Yong continues to feature songs under the hip-hop and R&B; genre, with the exception of its lead single, \\"Untitled, 2014\\", which is a ballad. Despite primarily being a rapper, the latter also has G-Dragon only singing over a \\"single piano accompaniment,\\" with Jeff Benjamin of Fuse comparing the song to Adele's \\"Someone like You\\" for its simplicity. The intro, \\"Middle Fingers-Up\\", features a piano riff with an underlying trap beat. Act I. or \\"Bullshit\\" is a multi-layered hip-hop track characterized by a pulsating chorus and sudden beat and rhythm changes. Act II. or \\"Super Star\\" is a slow jam fused with trap, filled with brassy drums, Middle-Eastern horns, lilting synths, and a backing chorus. The outro, \\"Divina Commedia\\", is an experimental alt-R&B; track which samples \\"Veridis Quo\\" from Daft Punk's 2001 album Discovery.  Lyrics and themes  G-Dragon writes the majority of his lyrics, explaining that \\"each feeling [in creating the music] is different\\", using his emotions to direct the lyrical content and the composition of his songs. Preferring to pen lyrics that \\"sound like an actual story,\\" G-Dragon has said he injects throughout his songwriting process \\"a sense of eeriness\\" writing songs that resemble horror films, like \\"She's Gone\\", \\"Window\\" and \\"That XX\\". Spin magazine wrote that G-Dragon's music is \\"daring by K-pop standards, wildly innovative by any standard\\" and that the rapper seems \\"unafraid of constantly pushing forward.\\" The Guardian noted that his songs stand out for \\"more in- depth themes including self-destruction and narcissism.\\" The lyrics in his song \\"A Boy\\" was in response to the negative criticisms surrounding his 2009 plagiarism controversy, with the artist refusing to give up on his career despite the setbacks. \\"Crooked\\" was created to express his natural punk attitude by describing a man \\"full of angst and despair\\" that demands to be left alone as he spends the night \\"like a 'crooked-minded person,' because in the end, he's alone and doesn't need anyone's 'sugarcoated sympathy.'\\" His use of explicit languages in \\"That XX\\" drew controversy for the artist, and the song was deemed unsuitable for listeners below 19 years of age, and compromised words were replaced by beeps in the music video. Discussing \\"cheeky\\" themes such as money and fame, \\"One of a Kind\\" from the EP of the same name is often view as one of his best work, with Ize magazine listing it as one of the most memorable songs written by G-Dragon, commenting that it raised his status as a hip-hop musician. \\"Middle Fingers Up\\" from Kwon Ji-Yong discusses the diminishing number of his personal relationships and his ever- decreasing social circle while \\"Bullshit\\"'s lyrics are self-referential, referencing \\"Crayon\\" by name while the canine onomatopoeia recalls the title track to his last album Coup d'Etat. He takes on a more remorseful approach in \\"Untitled, 2014\\", with the rapper apologizing for \\"his past actions, asking for forgiveness and the chance to see his ex again even if it's just one more time or in his dreams\\" in what has been described as \\"a letter to a past lover\\" He also explored other themes as a producer for Big Bang: \\"If You\\" was inspired during a time when the artist was in love, \\"Bae Bae\\" was inspired by the work of British artist Francis Bacon and the eroticism in his paintings, while \\"Loser\\" was written in an attempt to humanize the group. To distinguish himself from other artists and composers, G-Dragon admits to \\"giving twist and turn at every corner and evoking [a] different story\\" with each part of his music, acknowledging that although the chorus is the catchiest part of the song, he wants all the parts to his song to be remembered. Aside from producing songs for his own band, G-Dragon has also produced for other artists, including bandmates Taeyang's, Seungri's and Daesung's solo careers, and YG Entertainment label-mates iKon and 2NE1. He is often described as a \\"perfectionist\\" who's very critical during recording sessions.

Billboard K-Town describes his productions as large-scale, dramatic and infused with his personality, often incorporating a live band alongside professional dancers, various costumes changes, manipulation of stage lights, and the use of pyrotechnics. The singer-rapper's stage outfits have also garnered attention, with Dazed magazine noting that G-Dragon has the \\"rare ability to play loose and wild with his sartorial choices\\" to put together outfits that make the \\"ridiculous become sublime, [and] the impractical into the necessary.\\" G-Dragon explains that while his \\"[s]tage outfits are loud, outspoken, glamorous, [and] fancy\\", they are very different from his \\"normal day to day clothing\\", preferring to wear \\"loud and outspoken\\" clothes when performing compare to a more casual style off-stage. While promoting his EP Kwon Ji Yong, G-Dragon revealed that he originally created the alter ego G-Dragon to keep his stage persona separated from who he really is. Seoul Beats have described G-Dragon as \\"glamorous, cocky, [and] energetic\\", compared to his real-life \\"humble [and] understated\\" personality. In a 2017 interview with Elle, he described G-Dragon as someone who is \\"full of self-confidence\\" and is \\"a fancier and stronger person\\" while Kwon Ji-yong is an \\"introvert[ed] guy\\" with \\"many thoughts in his mind.\\" After the release of Kwon Ji Yong and while touring for Act III: M.O.T.T.E, G-Dragon expressed a desire to distance himself from his alter ego, explaining to his fans that for the past few years he has been \\"living as G-Dragon, but now I want to live as Kwon Ji Yong.\\" Rolling Stone India noted how during the third act of the concerts, fans were able to witness \\"the rather menacing G-Dragon melt away into the shy Ji Yong.\\"  Public image  G-Dragon maintains tight control over his career, publicly opposing the idea of singers as \\"products\\" of the entertainment industry and criticizing agencies who do not give their artists creative control. Known for reinventing his image and style throughout the years, the singer-rapper is often described as the \\"most fashionable\\" member in Big Bang. While promoting Heartbreaker, his change in hairstyle by dyeing it blonde gained popularity among his fans and became one of the top hairstyles of the year. He has consistently altered his hair throughout the years, ranging from various shades of colors to different cuts.

Vogue Magazine stated how his androgynous or gender-bending appearance defies a \\"society that maintains traditional, patriarchal values and a noted adherence to manufactured beauty ideals.\\" When he collaborated with Italian footwear designer Giuseppe Zanotti to launch a limited-edition collection of men's and women's shoes, he stated that \\"it's not just girls or women who get excited and worked up over pretty shoes. [...] [G]uys can feel that way, too.\\" G-Dragon's fashion has been described as \\"quirky and experimental\\" by Rushali Pawar of the International Business Times while Taylor Glasby from the British Magazine Dazed and Confused characterized his style as \\"fluid and far- reaching,\\" calling him a \\"natural style chameleon.\\" Monica Kim from Vogue Magazine admired his \\"uncanny knack for larger-than-life style that remains wearably cool.\\" Joe Coscarelli from The New York Times calls him \\"a style icon, a chameleon who often makes peak-era Lady Gaga seem staid\\". He has covered various issues of W, Dazed, Hypebeast, Elle, Vogue, and landed editorials in Harper’s Bazaar, Esquire, among other Asian magazines. G-Dragon stated that he was initially self-conscious of his role as a musician, noting how he had \\"changed many things including the tone of my voice because I was conscious about my job when I was in front of others.\\" Aware that his public image is important when promoting his materials, G-Dragon notes that \\"what the public perceives of [me] is my doing so it's my fault if I give off the wrong intention.\\" In recent years, he has become more relaxed, stating that now he doesn't \\"do music or dress up in order to impress people around me. I don't try to be conscious [about music and fashion]\\".

The magazine was first published in September 1978, changed its name from Disco News to Dance Music Report in 1979, and folded in 1992, when it merged with its Canadian counterpart, Streetsound. The owner of the magazine and its copyright was Disco News, Inc., based in New York City. The magazine was started as a tip sheet by Tom Silverman (who later founded Tommy Boy Records) and two of his college friends, Scott Anderson and Steve Singer, who all lived together in an apartment/office. The magazine was sold mostly through subscriptions, but in its later years was sold in bulk through record stores. The first editors were Silverman and Anderson, followed by Stephanie Shepherd for the last 10 years of its run. DMR content included North American regional reporting on local music and happenings, retail and radio reports from around the U.S., record pool news, industry updates, an annual readers' poll, and year-end charts with BPMs. Two of DMR's writers continued in the industry: Cliff Sheppard, columnist for \\"On The Rap Tip,\\" and as a recording artist - mainly using the moniker Shep-Dog -, writer and producer on the now- defunct indie, Rockaway Records and Gary Hayslett, founder of a magazine called Remix Service Authority, specializing in reviews of releases by remix services. After DMR folded, Hayslett's magazine was renamed to Dance Music Authority and its coverage was expanded to include the same kind of content as DMR. The annual New Music Seminar was launched in 1980 as a joint venture between Dance Music Report and Rockpool magazines.

The stone tablet, dated 15 February 1409, was installed by the Chinese admiral Zheng He in Galle during his grand voyages. The text concerns offerings made by him and others to the mountain Adam's Peak in Sri Lanka. The Chinese inscription mentions offerings to Buddha, the Persian in Arabic script to Allah and the Tamil inscription mentions offering to Tenavarai Nayanar (Hindu god Vishnu). The admiral invoked the blessings of Hindu deities here for a peaceful world built on trade.Robert D. Kaplan. (2010) Monsoon: The Indian Ocean and the Future of American Power The stele was discovered in Galle in 1911 and is now preserved in the Colombo National Museum. On his third voyage, Zheng He sailed from China in 1409, and carried with him the trilingual tablet which he planned to erect in Sri Lanka. The date equates to 15 February 1409, indicating that it was inscribed in Nanjing before the fleet set out. The Chinese portion gives praise to the Buddha and records lavish offerings in his honour. The tablet was found by an engineer, S. H. Thomlin, in 1911 in Galle. It can now be seen in the national museum in Sri Lanka. A modern replica of the stele has been installed in the Treasure Boat Shipyard Park in Nanjing, along with copies of other steles associated with the voyages of Zheng He. Offerings 1,000 pieces of gold; 5,000 pieces of silver; 50 rolls of embroidered silk in many colours; 50 rolls of silk taffeta, in many colours; 4 pairs of jewelled banners, gold embroidered and of variegated silk, 2 pairs of the same picked in red, one pair of the same in yellow, one pair in black; 5 antique brass incense burners; 5 pairs of antique brass flower vases picked in gold on lacquer, with gold stands; 5 yellow brass lamps picked in gold on lacquer with gold stands; 5 incense vessels in vermilion red, gold picked on lacquer, with gold stands; 6 pairs of golden lotus flowers; 2,500 catties of scented oil; 10 pairs of wax candles; 10 sticks of fragrant incense. Date The date of 15 February 1409 on the Galle Trilingual Inscription possibly refers to when the trilingual inscription was erected in Galle, indicating that it was put up during the homeward journey of the second voyage. If not, the inscription could have been prepared in China and erected between 1410 when the fleet arrived at Galle to 1411 during the third voyage. J. J. L. Duyvendak (1939) states that the inscription must have been prepared in China on 15 February 1409 and erected during the third expedition (1409-1411), because he thinks that the 15 February 1409 date is connected to the dates for the conference of honors to two deities, Tianfei (天妃) on 21 January 1409 and Nanhaishen (南海神) on 15 February 1409.

It was also released under the title John Travis: Solar Survivor. This film was also written and produced by Ronald L. Marchini, and executive-produced by his wife, Jo Anne Marchini. Omega Cop was followed by a sequel, Karate Cop. Plot In the year 1999 the world is in the midst of an environmental holocaust, the result of a series of solar flares which have scorched the Earth for the last 30 years. Exposure to the flares results in a radiation poisoning which causes the affected to degenerate into psychotic killers. The vast majority of the world's population is dead, the world is desolate and arid, and in the United States the government and military now only control New York City and Washington DC. Otherwise, what is left of humanity is divided between militarised encampments protecting pockets of the unaffected survivors, and roving groups of slavers and scavengers. Unradiated water, gasoline and women have become precious resources which the surviving groups hoard jealously and are willing to kill to obtain. John Travis (Ron Marchini) is the leader of a security patrol for one of the compounds led by Prescott (Adam West) when he and his squad are sent to investigate reports of a slaver auction of female captives. Suspecting that notorious bandit leader Wraith is there, he is ordered to break up the auction and kill Wraith if possible. The raid goes badly, however, as the group are forced to open fire, resulting in the deaths of all of Travis' comrades along with several dozen slavers and scavengers. Calling for backup, Travis is told that due to solar flare activity he is not only alone but he cannot be allowed back into the safety of his home compound. Wraith, learning of the identity of his attacker, conducts a ritual sacrifice of a woman and swears before his men that the next sacrifice will be of Travis. Abandoned in a small urban area, Travis ends up freeing three women, who he takes back to an abandoned local baseball stadium which he apparently uses as a part-time hide-out. Realizing that the third of the women is sick and needs medical attention, he takes the group to a clinic run by a friend, Dr. Latimer (Stuart Whitman). While there, he is led into a trap by a boy working for Wraith who steals weapons from his car. Although he escapes, the three women flee the clinic when the doctor reveals that he has been infected by the most recent flare. When Travis returns he finds the clinic abandoned save for Dr. Latimer, who he is forced to shoot. Reuniting with the three women at the baseball field, Travis makes the decision to return to the compound and demand medical aid from his erstwhile employers. Upon return he finds that Wraith's men already have the bunker under siege, and any chance of saving those inside has passed. Despite making an attempt at buying some time for the survivors inside, Prescott reports that Wraith's men have breached the bunker, ransacked its armory and are overrunning it, killing everyone inside. Left with no other option, Prescott tells Travis that his one chance to kill Wraith is to use the store's explosives to detonate the bunker, killing everyone inside. Travis reluctantly agrees, and aided by his female companions he clears the exterior of the compound, liberates the explosives and levels the facility. From there, he and his companions cross the country to live around the untainted mountain lakes of Montana.

History Bauker as a dwelling originates from the Middle Ages; however, as the Black Death plague spread across Norway in middle 14th century it became disused and eventually it was taken over by the church.Gudbrandsdalens historielags skrifter 1: Skibskaptein Hans Torgersen Kraabøls (1757-1833) optegnelser om Slegter og gaarder i Gausdal 1820-1824. Published by G.F.Gunnersen, Lillehammer, Norway 1922 In 1791, the mansion Bauker was built for the Gausdal Military Company and became the residence for their captain. The main house was enlarged in 1822 by Captain Peter Christian Ring. The manor ceased to be the Captain's residence in 1864, when the Norwegian state sold it to vicar Bernt Anker Leigh Knudtssøn, married to Anna Coucheron. From 1876 to 1960 Bauker was run as a tourist inn, at some time part-owned by Liv Coucheron-Torp Heyerdahl Rockefeller and run by Pella Knudtssøn.Videreføring av Kraabølsboka, Gausdal Historielag 2006, Slegter og Gaarder i Gausdal. Bind 1 Østre Gausdal The main building was renovated in 1887 to include 6 guestrooms, the annexes \\"Grande\\" and \\"Arken\\" were later raised and Bauker could eventually accommodate 70 guests. (\\"Grande\\" was originally the first elementary school for the local neighborhood, built in 1848, known as \\"Myra Skole\\", later sold in 1896 for kr. 500,- to Jacob Knudsøn, taken down and rebuilt at Bauker around 1900.) The property also includes two stabbur, one dating from 1756, the other from 1865. In 1960, the farming and tourist businesses were separated. Bauker's main building has been listed as National Heritage by the Norwegian state as early as 1923. Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson (famous Norwegian poet and Nobel prize winner) used Bauker as a \\"relief housing\\" for both guests and family that visited his mansion Aulestad, a few kilometers down the road. His present to Bauker for this was a wonderful chandelier, which unfortunately followed a later owner to Sweden. Many years later, Benedicte and Harald Thiis started here Norway's headquarters for humanistic and transpersonal psychology (Mandala Centre), a centre for \\"Unity and Inner Growth\\", using this splendid place as a \\"university\\" for teaching alternative forms of treatment and new spirituality. Psychodrama, massage, alternative medicine, yoga and dance were some of the teaching topics. Then Bauker became the spiritual centre for the Norwegian Baháʼí Faith movement. The Thiis family sold the estate in 1993. The new owner and the Commune of Gausdal used the buildings as housing for political refugees for several years. After a fire burnt down the building \\"Arken\\" in 2003, the inhabitants had to move and the historical buildings were once more used for overnight stays and exclusive arrangements. In 2005 the manor was sold again. Significance in art Bauker was used as an artist's colony before World War II. Known Norwegian artists such as Oluf Wold-Thorne, Thorvald Erichsen, Per Deberitz, Einar Sandberg, Severin Grande, Henrik Sørensen, Alf Lundeby, Arnstein Arneberg, Clara Tschudi and Sigurd Hoel stayed there from time to time. Bauker is located in the middle of the \\"Spiritual Hamlet\\" (free translation of \\"Åndsreppen\\") where many artists had been living in the early 20th century. The poet Inge Krokann, the composer Sparre Olsen, the painter Hallvard Blekastad and the writer Milada Blekastad, who all settled in this hamlet, are the originators of the \\"Spiritual Hamlet\\". It is said that the writer Jonas Lie used Bauker as the setting for his most famous novel, \\"The family at Gilje\\", released 1883 (translated to English 1920).Ivar B.

He was born on 5 July 1896, son of Samuel Morris and Lily Reubens. Samuel, a tailor, lived at 110 Wilson Street, Middlesbrough.Kehilat Middlesbrough Newsletter No 10 April 2001 His first stage appearance was on 10 December 1908 at the Oxford Playhouse, Middlesbrough and his first London appearance in 1913 at the London Shoreditch. He started with a juvenile troupe, then as a blackface comic. He was called up into the Army in World War 1 and resumed his stage career in 1918, touring constantly in variety and revue. He lived in the Blackpool area from the early 1930s in 1940 began a thirteen-year run in the resort's summer season shows, starting at the North Pier, as a northern comic in his famous straw hat and very thick glasses. He had extremely bad eyesight as a result of having been gassed in the trenches in World War I and thus was not conscripted for the Second World War. After nine years, he refused to go on playing matinees and transferred to a long run at the Blackpool Palace for George and Alfred Black. He worked as a sketch comic also doing some stand-up material. In 1950 Joe Gladwin joined him as a 'feed' and stayed with him for twelve years. In 1948, he toured with 'Paradise on Parade' after a summer season at the South Pier, Blackpool. In January 1950, he was resident comedian of the BBC North Country variety feature, 'Variety Fanfare.' The radio series Club Night was launched in the BBC Home Service north region on 7 November 1950 where it ran for 52 editions until 6 June 1955. The programme was set in a fictitious workingmen's club 'oop north.' With his trademark cigar, straw hat and glasses, Dave Morris was the somewhat loudmouthed 'know all' club treasurer, ably assisted by comedy actor Joe Gladwin as Cedric and by Liverpool comedian Fred Ferris as 'The Wacker' whose primary ambition seemed to be to scrounge a drink. He moved to television for six programmes of the sitcom The Artful Dodger from 28 September to 2 November 1959. The show was based on Club Night and used the character he developed there. It also featured Joe Gladwin as his comic foil.

It was published by Headline Review in Britain, on 23 August 2007, and by Harmony Books in the United States, where it was titled Wonderful Tonight: George Harrison, Eric Clapton, and Me. Beginning with her childhood in Kenya, the book covers Boyd's modelling career in London during the 1960s, her marriage to and divorce from Beatle George Harrison and later marriage and divorce of Harrison's best friend, Eric Clapton. The book's title is in reference to Clapton's 1977 song \\"Wonderful Tonight\\", which he wrote about Boyd. Reception Reviewing Wonderful Today for The Daily Telegraph, Lynn Barber described it as \\"absolutely gripping\\" and a memoir that \\"gives more insight into the weirdness of rock-star life than anything I have ever read\\". Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly gave the book a B+ rating and wrote: \\"Boyd pads her pages with a few too many humdrum memories, but her detailed chronicle of her legendary exes' slides into infidelity and substance abuse will thrill classic-rock buffs with a taste for scandal.\\" In her review for The Austin Chronicle, Margaret Moser described it as \\"a sweet, sad memoir that rings true\\", with the best chapters dedicated to Boyd's life in the 1960s through to the end of her marriage with Clapton, after which she \\"turns the mirror inward, and the book becomes SFF – strictly for fans\\".

They are hardy and have fur that is described as soft \\"with a beautiful polished look to it\\". While more timid than some larger breeds of rabbit, they are still considered an excellent pet. The Silver Marten is playful, enjoys romping around, and likes playthings it can toss around its cage. History Early breeders of Chinchilla rabbits, a breed listed as critical on the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy Conservation Priority List,American Livestock Breeds Conservancy attempted to improve Chinchilla rabbits' color and pattern by introducing black and tan bloodlines. These genes later manifested as black \\"sports\\" described as \\"strange little black rabbits\\" as well as similar silver rabbits among standard Chinchilla rabbit litters. These oddities bred true and were named as a separate breed, the \\"Silver Marten\\", in 1924.Silver Marten Rabbit Club In 1927, a working standard for black and chocolate varieties was established by the American Rabbit Breeders' Association and the first Silver Marten Club was chartered. A blue variety of this breed was accepted in 1933. The sable variety, the last to be approved, was accepted in 1993. Varieties *Black Silver Marten is the most popular variety of the breed. Specimens should be jet black color, its fur being black as far down the hair as possible, with contrasting silver markings that are shape and defined. A Black Silver Marten should have dark brown eyes and an underside of dark slate blue. *Blue Silver Marten is the second most popular breed. Their color should be an even dark \\"blue\\" everywhere. Their eyes should be bluish gray. Sharp markings in the blue variety are often slower to fully develop than in the Blue Silver Marten. *Chocolate Silver Martens should be a rich, dark brown color \\"like semi-sweet rather than milk chocolate candy\\" and brown eyes. Their bellies are the same color but lighter, with pigment only at the tips of the fur. Breeders say that their fur has a tendency to fade over time, especially if given much sunlight. *Sable Silver Martens, the last variety of the breed to be approved, are the least common. They should be medium sepia brown \\"on the saddle, shading evenly down the sides to a lighter color\\". The rabbit's ears, face, tail, outside of the feet, and lower legs should be very dark sepia brown, nearly black, that provides a distinct contrast to the color of the body. Correctly colored sables must be a silvery color at birth, but as they age they take on a blotchy appearance. The coat typically darkens throughout the rabbit's lifetime, each successive molt reducing the contrast with the points.

It is set in the Mirror Universe, and offers an explanation of its more violent culture. Plot In Dark Mirror, the Mirror-Spock left the Enterprise and rose through the ranks and spearheaded an effort to reform the Empire. However, the Mirror- Kirk framed him for treason, which resulted in Spock's execution. Soon afterwards Mirror-Sarek was assassinated by another Vulcan seeking his job. As a result, Spock's attempted reforms died with him and the Empire is still alive and powerful. The Klingons are a conquered race who were forced into slavery by the Empire after their defeat. The Romulans have also been defeated by the Empire, but committed suicide en masse rather than submit to Terran rule. Dark Mirror tells how Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the Enterprise-D are forced to deal with their counterparts. Like the Original Series episode Mirror, Mirror, their counterparts are brutal and savage. For example, the Mirror-Captain Picard had murdered the Mirror-Jack Crusher so as to claim his wife, Beverly Crusher, for himself. Crusher is further forced to build biologically-based weaponry. The Mirror-Deanna Troi is a security officer who freely uses torture. The missions of the crew of the Mirror- Enterprise-D's are filled with brutality and even genocidal activities. Personal communicators are intentionally not used in the mirror Starfleet; due to the prevalence of assassinations, they make crewmembers too easy to track down and kill. When the Enterprise-D crew meet with their alternates, they discover that the Empire is planning to cross into and invade the Federation's universe. The first step of the plan is to capture that universe's Enterprise, kill the crew, and use the vessel as an infiltrator. However, the crew of the Enterprise is able to foil their plans, and find a means to prevent the Empire from invading the Federation. Captain Picard found that the Mirror Universe Empire had almost reached the limits of what it was presently capable of expanding to. Picard comes to believe they plan to invade the 'main' universe, simply because they have no other choice. He also finds that the seeds of the Mirror Universe's brutality lie in Khan Noonien Singh winning the Eugenics Wars. Toward the book's end, Picard speaks to Mirror-Worf and explains that soon the Empire will be too far spread to maintain control over the worlds it controls that it will collapse, and Worf should inform his people so they can be ready when this day comes.

Range B. minima is endemic to Nosy Be, an island located just off the northwest coast of Madagascar, but has extralimital distribution to Manongarivo Reserve on Madagascar's northwest coast. Description left B. minima is the second-smallest lizard ever described. The species has the independently rotating eyes and prehensile tail characteristic of all chameleons. It is coloured light grey on the head, back and tail, although the tail becomes orange then yellowish towards the tip. The sides of the body are brown, occasionally interrupted by dark brown spots, and the limbs are almost entirely dark brown. Spotted patterning appears to be a stress colouration, and unstressed individuals have a more or less uniform dark brown body, apart from a beige area in front of the eyes (1). The B. minima adult has a flattened head and an orbital crest with large scales forming triangular plates above its eyes. Along its back are two rows of granular protrusions. B. minima specimens sometimes have lateral yellow stripes over their basic drab grayish-brown color. The maximum total length is 3.4 cm (1.3 in) for females and 2.8 cm (1.1 in) for males. Males are also slenderer than females, and exhibit a hemipenial bulge at the base of their tails. Habitat B. minima is native to the rain forests of its native island. It has a relatively active habit for a chameleon and likes moving around in the low branches and leaf litter of its native rain forests. Though they are moderately aggressive toward one another, population and densities in the wild may approach one animal per square meter. Reproduction It is not known how frequently B. minima reproduces, but a typical clutch contains two eggs. Similar species B. minima has been characterized as belonging to a species group with other Madagascan dwarf chameleons such as B. dentata, B. tuberculata, B. peyrierasi and other new or unidentified species such as a recently described chameleon from Tsingy de Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve.Scherz, M.

Wassergeflügel: Gänse und Enten. Oertel + Spörer. French: L'oie de Poméranie Pomeranian, Toulouse or Emden goose eggs), also known as the Rügener goose, is a breed of domestic goose. Although only an officially recognized breed since 1912, this fowl was developed by Northern German farmers of Pomerania as early as 1500. Ashton, Chris. 1999. Domestic Geese. The Crowned Press, LTD. Ramsbury, England. While it is popular as a market goose throughout Europe FeatherSite: Pomeranian Geese – especially in (Germany), Poland and in German and Slavic communities around the Baltic region – today \\"there are few breeders of the Historical Pomeranian goose.\\" Society for the Preservation of Poultry Antiquities Bulletin 2004, \\"Preserve the Pomeranian Goose\\" Description The Pomeranian is the only descendant of the Greylag goose specifically bred for a single-lobed paunch. In North America, these geese often have two lobes nonetheless due to genetic variation and inbreeding. The American Livestock Breeds Conservancy Pomeranian Geese average 16 pounds in weight and lay about 70 eggs a season although some varieties may produce less. They have flattened heads, stout necks, prominent breasts, rounded bodies and what has been described as an \\"arrogant\\" bearing. Batty, J. 1985. Domesticated Ducks and Geese. Nimrod Book Services. Liss, England. They make good watch birds as they tend to greet visitors noisily. Pomeranian Geese \\"are a good all-around breed for a colorful home flock\\". Breeders should look for plump birds that look heart-shaped when viewed from above. Breeders should also seek stock with good markings as these are a variable trait and breeding geese with clearly defined markings is a challenge. Pomeranian Geese usually have white feathers around the base of their bills but solid-colored heads are more preferred. A Pomeranian goose should have blue eyes, a pinkish red bill, and reddish orange legs and feet. Holderread, Dave. 1981. The Book of Geese: a Complete Guide to Raising the Home Flock. Hen House Publications. Corvallis, Oregon The indication of knobs at the base of a goose's bill is viewed negatively and is considered indicative of inbreeding. Likewise, Pomeranian Geese with such undesirable traits as dark feathers in the wings, dewlaps, excessively white heads, orange bills, orange feet, and undersized bodies should be avoided as breeding stock. According to an expert: > This breed descended from the Eastern Graylag, which is why true Pomeranians > have pinkish red beak, legs and feet. The Pomeranian is believed to have > developed in the Pomorze region between the Rivers Odes and Vistula. It is > an ancient breed that has stood the intrusion of foreign and modern breeds > into its home turf and contributed to the development of numerous breeds and > varieties, and proven itself competitive where ever tried.

SPPA Bulletin, 2003 Varieties White Pomeranian geese In their native Germany, Pomeranian Geese are a \\"utilitarian goose breed\\" represented white, gray, saddleback buff, and saddleback gray varieties. Pommerngans (in German) The American Saddleback Pomeranian which is almost the sole representative of this breed in the United States is recognized by the American Poultry Association.American Poultry Association, Inc. (APA): The American Standard of Perfection. Mendon, Massachusetts, 2001. Its head, back, and flanks are light gray or beige. The bird has an all-white body with the colored feathers on its tail edged in near-white. It is uncommon enough that the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy regards its status as \\"critical\\". Pomeranian varieties and related breeds are also raised in the United Kingdom. Categorizing geese can be a complex matter as indicated by this 2004 letter in the bulletin of the Society for the Preservation of Poultry Antiquities Bulletin: > Toulouse x Embden cross is what gave us the English Greybacks and Buff Backs > and the American Saddlebacks.

Since May 2015, the principal has been Micaela Varela. History Hornedo Middle School is named for Manuel Diaz Hornedo, an El Paso educator, physician, public health administrator, and cancer researcher. Its original location was constructed from 1992 to 1993 to house Franklin High School's freshmen. It opened in August 1993. In 1994 Franklin moved to a larger building on the same property and Hornedo was opened for the 1994-1995 school year housing sixth, seventh, and eighth graders. In early 2007, the El Paso Independent School District decided to make Hornedo an eighth and ninth grade school, and for the 2007–2008 school year Franklin housed tenth to twelfth grade students, and Hornedo sixth and seventh grade students attended the newly built Brown Middle School, located approximately two and a half miles northwest of Hornedo. In 2008, construction began on the new Hornedo Middle School facility, which opened in 2010. The district also constructed three elementary schools at the same time.

Currently no regularly scheduled passenger fights serve the airport. The current owner, the Temora Shire Council do not charge landing fees for aircraft to use the facility, encouraging a wide variety of general aviation uses, including skydiving, gliding, flight training, kit aircraft assembly and aircraft maintenance. It is also the home of the Temora Aviation Museum and hosts regularly flying displays and events. History Due to the Temora area's favourable climate and geography, following the outbreak of World War II the airport was controlled by the Royal Australian Air Force and in 1941 No. 10 Elementary Flying Training School (TENEFTS) was established to provide initial flight training for pilot graduates. During the unit's operation, the airfield was extended significantly, processing some 2527 graduates. At its peak in 1944, 97 de Havilland Tiger Moth aircraft were based at the school. After World War II, the airfield was handed to the Department of Civil Aviation. Following the war, in 1946 local veterans and pilots founded the Temora Aero Club, utilising a Bellman Hangar as a club house. This hangar is still maintained by the club. Club members have been instrumental in the improvement and development of the airport facilities, such as David Lowy, 1998 Australian Aerobatics Champion, who later founded the Temora Aviation Museum. A 1991 reunion of TENEFTS personnel saw 71 de Havilland Tiger Moths flown to Temora to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the unit's establishment. Many of these aircraft had been based with the school In November 2004, the Temora Shire Council completed a $3.8 million upgrade to the airport, opening the new runway 05/23. The new runway allows the airport to handle aircraft as large as a Boeing 737-800 narrow-body jet and provides more flexibility for aircraft operations at night and in variable wind conditions. An official ceremony was attended by Prime Minister John Howard on 16 September 2006 to open the runway and acknowledge the achievements of the Temora Aviation Museum.

Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines Official Website. Retrieved on 2011-11-26. History The Diocese of Virac in the islands of Catanduanes was canonically established on August 27, 1974 with the Most Rev. Jose Crisologo Sorra, from Virac, as the first Bishop. At the start, there were 16 parishes (11 town parishes and 5 barrio parishes) and around 25 priests in the active ministry assigned in the different parishes, diocesan commissions and offices, and in the seminary. The Minor Seminary and Pre-College Seminary The Immaculate Conception Minor Seminary, located at the Fiat Compound in Cavinitan, was opened in 1976. The first batch of first year high school seminarians stayed at a dormitory located at the Immaculate Conception Seminary Academy (formerly Immaculate Conception Academy) in downtown Virac, where they also went for their academic studies. In the school year 1976-77, these seminarians were transferred to the Nazareth Homes (west wing) until the seminary was ready to house them. They used the present study hall as their dormitory while the seminary dorm was on its final finishing. The seminary dormitory was finished and used in the school year 1978-1979. The Minor Seminary attracted many young boys, and many parents, and served as a seedbed for young vocations to the priesthood until the year 1984 when, together with the Immaculate Conception Seminary Academy (ICSA), it had to close due to financial constraints. The closure the Minor Seminary and ICSA was a great loss indeed. In June 1986, the seminary reopened as a Pre-College Seminary. Those who wish to enter the College Seminary (Philosophy) undergo a one-year training formation at the Pre-College Seminary. This has become an alternative to the Minor Seminary and instead of spending four years of high school studies in the seminary before proceeding to College Seminary, one can opt to study high school outside the seminary and then enter the Pre-College Seminary for one year before proceeding to the College Seminary. In school year 2005-2006, the diocese opened a Minor Seminary again, together with the revival of the Immaculate Conception Seminary Academy (ICSA), the former Immaculate Conception Academy (ICA), now called Immaculate Conception Academy Students and Alumni School (ICASAS), occupying the Stella Maris building and compound, in Concepcion, downtown Virac. The revived ICA/ICSA is now under the administration of ICA/ICSA Alumni, with the blessing of the Bishop of Virac. The first batch of first year high school seminarians go to this school for their academic training. The Bishop’s Palace and Other Buildings at the Fiat Compound The Bishop’s Palace was built adjacent to the seminary. The Nazareth Homes, located at the back of the seminary, were originally constructed as quarters for priests which they could use during their monthly clergy meetings, diocesan affairs, and every time they come to Virac. The Nazareth Homes also served as sleeping quarters for retreatants, Marriage Encounterers, Youth Encounterers and visitors. To facilitate retreats, recollections and meetings, an Octagon Hall was constructed between the seminary and Nazareth Homes. Other buildings followed. Beside the seminary, the Fiat Printing Press. And at the back of the Nazareth Homes, the Rattan Shop. These two establishments catered to the out-of-school youth who were employed at the Press and the Rattan Shop. The Rattan Shop closed in 1993. The Fiat Press continues to function until today. The Episcopate Jose Sorra, first Bishop of Virac, served the diocese until 1993 when he was transferred to the Diocese of Legaspi. The diocese was vacant [sede vacante] for almost a year until September 12, 1994 when a new Bishop of Virac was installed: the Most Rev. Manolo Alarcon de los Santos, from the Archdiocese of Caceres. The First Diocesan Synod On the occasion of the silver jubilee of the Diocese of Virac, Bishop de los Santos convoked the First Diocesan Synod held on August 28 to September 8, 1999. The synod was a very opportune event in the diocese to see and evaluate what has become of the diocese after 25 years of existence, and thus set a new direction and vision for the diocese, if necessary. The greatest achievement of the synod is the launching and implementation of the diocesan thrust called the New Evangelization Pastorale (NEP), authored by the Rt. Rev. Msgr. Jose Borja Molina, PA, Moderator Curiae, Finance Administrator, Vicar General, and Parish Priest of the Cathedral Parish of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, Virac. During the synod, he presented the Main Working Paper on Christian Life titled: “Renewing the Christian Life: Agenda for the Third Millennium”. As the main document of the synod, we have adopted it as the Principle of the Diocesan Pastoral Plan. The NEP would be the soul of the Diocesan Pastoral Plan which the synod primarily envisioned to make in order to give a common goal and direction to all pastoral activities in the entire diocese as expressed in the Diocesan Vision made during the synod. As a diocesan thrust, the NEP would be implemented in all Parishes and Mission Churches in the diocese. The First Diocesan Pastoral Assembly Five years after the First Diocesan Synod, another milestone marked the history of the diocese: on August 24–27, 2004 Bishop de los Santos called for a Diocesan Pastoral Assembly to see and evaluate the pastoral work of the Local Church and address some relevant issues affecting the Church, in line with the Diocesan Vision and the diocesan thrust of the New Evangelization Pastorale. Once again, the Pastoral Assembly emphasized the urgent implementation of the NEP in all Parishes and Mission Churches, and the immediate creation of the Diocesan Pastoral Plan. In that Pastoral Assembly, the major diocesan commissions at work presented their statutes, locating and aligning all their existing and future programs and activities with the stages, principles and structures of the NEP. The Diocesan Pastoral Plan Since the First Diocesan Synod, the Diocesan Pastoral Council (DPC) has been created and tasked to draft the Diocesan Pastoral Plan. Hence, various discussions, consultations and deliberations had been done in the parish, vicarial, diocesan, and commission levels under the supervision of the DPC. After some years of patient waiting, the diocese is now ready to launch and implement the 2005 Diocesan Pastoral Plan of the Diocese of Virac. Ordinaries *José C.

John L. Sullivan. Charles Watson \\"Charley\\" Mitchell (24 November 1861-3 April 1918) was an English world heavyweight boxing title contender and lightweight champion. Professional career Mitchell was born on 24 November, 1861 in the city of Birmingham, England. Mitchell had exceptional ability at using London Prize Ring Rules to his advantage. During his career, he engaged in over 100 fights with both gloves and bare-knuckles, using the London Prize Ring Rules as well as the Queensberry Rules. He often fought men who outweighed him by 30 to 40 pounds. Mitchell took on all comers in London, often fighting as many as four bouts in one night. In 1880 he became the boxing instructor for the International Athletic Club at the \\"White Rose\\" in London, and opened a boxing school at the \\"Palais Rubens\\" in Antwerp, Belgium. In 1882 Billy Madden, the former tutor and backer of John L Sullivan, put on an openweight boxing tournament in England, in order to find a challenger for John L Sullivan. This was a professional tournament, held under amateur rules, consisting of 3 3 minute rounds, with an extra 2 minute round being fought in the case of draws, A number of prominent boxers including Jem Goode and Jack Knifton entered. Despite being both the youngest and lightest of the 21 competitors, Mitchell won the tournament. \\"Mr. Madden's Championship of England Boxing Competition\\" Sporting Life, 23 December 1882, page 3\\"Mr. Madden's Championship of England Boxing Competition\\" Sporting Life, 26 December 1882 Mitchell toured the United States and Canada with Jake Kilrain, and later Frank \\"Paddy\\" Slavin, putting on exhibitions, sometimes daily and sometimes on the same day as one of his fights. Mitchell was in Kilrain's corner on 8 July 1889 when he fought John L. Sullivan for the world heavyweight boxing championship. Mitchell came from Birmingham, England and fought John L. Sullivan in 1883, knocking him down in the first round. Their second[Sullivan and Mitchell had a scheduled rematch 30 June 1884 in New York City but Sullivan declined to fight because it was reported he was \\"too sick\\" Wichita Daily Eagle 1 July 1884.] meeting took place in 1888 on the grounds of a chateau at Chantilly, France in driving rain. It went on for more than two hours, at the end of which both men were unrecognisable and had suffered much loss of blood; neither could lift his arms to punch and the contest was considered a draw. The local gendarmerie arrived at this point and managed to arrest Mitchell, who spent the next few days in a cell and was later fined by the local magistrate, boxing being illegal in France at that time. Sullivan managed to evade the law, swathed in bandages, and was taken back across the English Channel to spend the next few weeks convalescing in Liverpool. Mitchell acted as Sullivan's corner man for many years after. In 1894 Mitchell fought in his most noteworthy bout, against James J Corbett for the world heavyweight championship. Corbett won by KO in the 3rd round, winning $20,000. Death Mitchell died on 3 April 1918 in Hove at age 56.

By 2003 he was a finalist for the Broyles Award, which recognizes the nation’s top assistant coaches. His impact as a defensive coordinator was immediately felt as he led the 2001 Golden Eagle defense, which had lost 7 starters from the previous season, to rankings of 8th in the nation in scoring defense and 11th in the nation in total defense. In his first three years as defensive coordinator at USM, Coach Nix’s defenses stayed in the top 15 nationally in scoring defense.

It is used extensively in mesh networking algorithms. History Douglas S.J. De Couto was the first to describe ETX in his 2004 doctoral dissertation at MIT. Subsequently, it has been implemented in RoofNet/Meraki and OLSR mesh networking protocols, among others. In the context of the OLSR protocol , a bidirectional link ETX was defined. Details ETX is the number of expected transmissions of a packet necessary for it to be received without error at its destination. This number varies from one to infinity. An ETX of one indicates a perfect transmission medium, where an ETX of infinity represents a completely non-functional link. Note that ETX is an expected transmission count for a future event, as opposed to an actual count of a past event. It is hence a real number, and not an integer. For example, if it took 1898 transmissions to transfer 1024 packets without error, the ETX on the link is 1898/1024, or approximately 1.85. Due to varying characteristics of the transmission medium, the number may vary widely. It is often useful to convert between ETX and the packet error probability e_{pt}: \\\\mathrm{ETX} = \\\\frac{1}{1 - e_{pt}} An equivalent relation is used for bidirectional links in the context of the OLSR protocol: ETX = 1/(NLQ * LQ) where NLQ is the Neighbor Link Quality of the link and LQ is its link quality. Thus, e_{pt} = 1-NLQ * LQ.

Aerators can simply be screwed onto the faucet head, creating a non-splashing stream and often delivering a mixture of water and air. Function An aerator can: * Prevent splashing * Shape the water stream coming out of the faucet spout, to produce a straight and evenly pressured stream * Conserve water and reduce energy costs * Reduce faucet noise * Increase perceived water pressure (often used in homes with low water pressure); sometimes described as a pressure regulator or flow regulator * Provide slight filtration of debris due to a small sieve plate Splash prevention When a single stream of water hits a surface the water must go somewhere, and because the stream is uniform the water will tend to go mostly in the same direction. If a single stream hits a surface which is curved, then the stream will conform to the shape and be easily redirected with the force of the volume of water falling. Adding the aerator does two things: it reduces the volume of falling water which reduces the splash distance, and it creates multiple \\"mini-streams\\" within the main stream. Each mini-stream, if it were falling by itself, would splash or flow in a unique and different way when it hit the surface, as compared to the other mini- streams. Because they are all falling at the same time, the streams will splash in their own way but end up hitting other splash streams. The resulting interference cancels out the majority of the splashing effect. Conservation and energy reduction Because the aerator limits the water flow through the faucet, water usage is reduced compared to the same duration of flow without an aerator. In the case of hot water, because less water is used, less heat energy is used. Perceived water pressure The perception of water pressure is actually the speed of the water as it hits a surface, (the hands, in the case of hand washing). When an aerator is added to the faucet (or fluid stream), there is a region of high pressure created behind the aerator. Because of the higher pressure behind the aerator and the low pressure in front of it (outside the faucet), due to Bernoulli's Principle there is an increase in velocity of the fluid flow. Process Aerator assembly diagram Aeration occurs in two basic steps: # Air is drawn into the water stream, breaking the stream into a flow of tiny droplets mixed with air. # The mixture of air and water passes through a screen, further mixing the air and water and evenly spreading out the resulting stream. Design and features Three major components of an aerator are: housing, insert and rubber washer. A faucet aerator can be classified on the basis of its flow rate and the type of water stream (aerated, non-aerated, spray) it produces. In general, standard-sized aerators are available with female (M22x1) or male threading (M24x1). Bathtub spouts often have a bigger diameter with a male M28x1 thread. The United States use different thread sizes: 15/16\\"-27 for standard-sized male and 55/64\\"-27 for standard-sized female threads. Using faucet aerators may help meet local regulations and construction standards such as ASME A112.18.1, U.S. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications or WELS (Australia/New Zealand). In Europe, European standard EN246 \\"Sanitary tapware - General specifications for flow rate regulators\\" defines the flow rate and noise reduction requirements.

Its headwaters are Panuke Lake. The river has been exploited for water power. There were water mills in the nineteenth centuryNova Scotia Museum, \\"Mill On The St. Croix River From The Bridge\\" , (1817) and in the 1930s three hydroelectric dams were built; they still operate. The lower reaches of the St. Croix are tidal. There is a wide flood plain where the river has cut through limestone bedrock now exposed as white cliffs. The calcareous soil harbours the rare Rams Head Lady Slipper.Nova Scotia Nature Trust The Nova Scotia Government estimates that the number of people living within the St. Croix watershed numbered 19,233 in 2011. History The river and Panuke Lake were used as an important portage route first by the Mi'kmaq and later by European explorers and settlers. There is an unpopulated Indian reserve (St Croix Indian Reserve) on the lake. Meandering lower tidal reaches of the St. Croix European settlement began with the Acadians (who named the river, calling the region Pisiguit).Acadian-Cajun Genealogy Pisiguit (with map) The Battle at St Croix (1750) The Battle at St. Croix happened between New England Rangers and the Mi'kmaq. To capture the Acadians involved in the British defeat at the Fort Logis, Grand Pre the previous year, Cornwallis sent John Gorham (military officer) to Piziquid to construct Fort Edward (Nova Scotia) and imprison the Acadians. After two days of marching from Fort Sackville (present day Bedford), they come to the St Croix River. At the river a battle broke out with the Mi'kmaq. Gorham took over a saw mill and two local Acadian homes for protection. The Mi'kmaq numbers continued to grow, therefore Gorham sent a messenger to Fort Sackville for reinforcements, which ended the battle. After the Expulsion of the Acadians, New England Planters settled the area. Extensive land grants were let by the Nova Scotia colonial government beginning in 1761.James Harvie Today, the St. Croix is a popular river for canoe and kayaking enthusiasts.Canoe Kayak Nova Scotia Description of Valley canoe routes The lower floodplains are dyked and farmed.
