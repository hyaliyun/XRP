He played rugby league for his province and he was also an accomplished cricketer. Born in Bluff (then known as Campbelltown) 19 January 1883, Hamilton was educated at Southland Boys' High School where he was a member of the 1st XV between 1897 and 1898. He was also an excellent rower and a member of the Awarua Boating Club which won the New Zealand Championship four. A chemist, Hamilton was for many years in charge of the UFS dispensary in Bluff, leaving in 1920 to set up business in Auckland.  Rugby union career  Out of the Pirates club in Invercargill, Hamilton played for the Southland province for three consecutive seasons. It was in his last year, 1908, that he would become an All Black. After playing in the tour game for Southland against the Anglo-Welsh, Hamilton was in the South Island team that played the North that year. He was then chosen for the national side in the second test match against the touring Anglo-Welsh at Athletic Park in 1908. Hamilton was one of the principal players, along with fellow All Black Ned Hughes, in the saga of petty officialdom which marred both the Southland and eventually New Zealand unions in 1908‚Äì09. In 1908, when he was captain of the Pirates club, he was suspended by the Southland Rugby Union for striking along with the rest of his team and the opposition, Hughes' Britannia club, when they refused to play a match due to ground conditions and the weather with Invercargill being hit by a blizzard. However, whilst suspended the teams played a benefit match under the new Northern Union (rugby league) rules. Then, in 1909, the New Zealand Rugby Union decreed that any player who had played any game under the \\"Northern\\" rules was to be regarded as a professional and was to be expelled. Hamilton never played another game of rugby union.  Rugby league career  Hamilton turned to rugby league and was part of the first ever provincial game of rugby league in the South Island when he played for Southland in a home and away series against Otago in 1908.John Haynes From All Blacks to All Golds: Rugby League's Pioneers, Christchurch, Ryan and Haynes, 1996.  Cricket career  His other sporting success came in cricket, although he only appeared in one first-class cricket match, for Southland against Otago in 1920. In the 1910-11 season Southland became the first Hawke Cup winners after Hamilton led the team by scoring 110 runs. He was one of three players nominated by the Southland Cricket Association for the New Zealand team to tour Australia in 1913-14, but he did not earn national honours.  Personal and death  His younger brother, Archibald, appeared in five first-class matches for Southland where he scored 82 runs with a high score of 25. He moved to Auckland, where he worked as a pharmacist. In April 1925, after a period in which he had had trouble sleeping, he took an accidental overdose of morphine and died.

Adolph Scherrer designed the group's Maennerchor Hall. Similar Maennerchor clubs were founded in other cities in the United States. History Eduard Longerich, Gottfried and Herbert Lecker, and A. Schnellschmidt were among a group of Germans who immigrated to Indianapolis in 1848. Living together in an apartment at 75 E. Washington Street, they started singing German songs. Their first public performance was on May 28, 1855 at the Washington Hall. As their popularity and membership grew, they rented the old City Hall at 337 E. Washington Street. In 1906, the group laid the cornerstone for the Maennerchor Hall at the corner of Illinois and Michigan streets. However, during World War I, they renamed the building as the Academy of Music in response to the anti-German sentiment. For many years the Maennerchor was sponsored by John P. Frenzel, president of the city's Merchants National Bank. However, upon his death in 1933, the group lost their financial backing and were forced to leave their building and take up residence in the Athen√¶um. The Meannerchor's membership reached a high of 125 in the 1950s, but then declined due to changes in public tastes in entertainment. By 2018, the group had only 16 members, six of whom were in their eighties. On February 8 of that year, they announced that the final concert would be held on April 14, with their final performance at Victory Field on May 30.

In the CCP Koen Vanmechelen cross-breeds chicken breeds from different countries. His ultimate goal is the creation of a Cosmopolitan Chicken carrying the genes of all the planet's chicken breeds. Much more than a mere domesticated animal, the chicken is art in itself. It serves as a metaphor for the human animal and its relationship with the biological and cultural diversity of the planet. While the native breeds that descended from the original chicken (the Red Junglefowl) are evolutionary dead-ends (being shaped to reflect the typical cultural characteristics of its community), Vanmechelen's hybrids are solutions. Many years of crossbreeding have proven that each successive generation of hybrids is ‚Äòbetter‚Äô. It is more resilient, it lives longer, is less susceptible to diseases, and it exhibits less aggressive behavior. Genetic diversity is essential, proves the Cosmopolitan Chicken Research Programme (CC¬ÆP), which studies the various CCP hybrids. Central to Koen Vanmechelen's oeuvre is the chicken. More specifically: the interbreeding of domesticated chickens from different countries and the expected creation of a cosmopolitan hybrid. Vanmechelen uses the animal, which has been co-evolving with the human animal for more than 7.000 years, as a metaphor for the global cultural and genetic mix that diversity and hybridisation create. His work also questions the position of the human animal on the planet. In the millennium year 2.000, he presented his first ‚Äòcrossing‚Äô, the Mechelse Bresse, a hybrid born out of the Belgian species Mechelse Koekoek and the French Poulet de Bresse. At this moment the 17th hybrid species, the Mechelse Styrian, is a fact. Eighteen countries have been included in the CCP. The chicken, its egg and cage, are powerful symbols that allow Vanmechelen to make links between scientific, political, philosophical and ethical issues. The intrinsic philosophical system he thus developed are meant to be the subject of debates, discussions and lectures. To secure the future of the project, the genetic material of all the Mechelse hybrids is stored. The artist is working on sculptures based on the chickens‚Äô DNA and is considering dedomestication or the release of his birds into the wild.

It was one of the most widespread and successful of all the gentry families of Devon, and as remarked upon by Swete (died 1821), exceptionally most of the expansion was performed by younger sons, who by the custom of primogeniture were expected to make their own fortunes.Gray, Todd & Rowe, Margery (Eds.), Travels in Georgian Devon: The Illustrated Journals of The Reverend John Swete, 1789-1800, 4 vols., Tiverton, 1999, vol.2, p.107 Career Few records concerning his career have survived, and even his principal biographer John Prince (died 1723) remarked:Prince, p.651 :\\"What the particular vertues and accidents of his life were it is pitty history hath not handed down to posterity; but the extraordinary parts and accomplishments of this gentleman, with his eminent skill and learning in the law, may be inferr'd if from nothing else, from his raising a family in this county, both for title and estate, much greater than most of his ancestors\\".

It is known however that as a younger son he chose as his career the Law and for that purpose entered the Inner Temple in London. In 1598 he was appointed Autumn Reader and in 1608 became Treasurer. In 1615 he was Double Reader, the next step to the degree of Serjeant-at-Law.

The chief tenets of Marxist historiography are the centrality of social class and economic constraints in determining historical outcomes. While Marxist historians all follow the tenets of dialectical and historical materialism, the way Marxist historiography has developed in different regional and political contexts has varied. In particular, Marxist historiography has had unique trajectories of development in the West, in the Soviet Union, and in India, as well as in the Pan-Africanist and African American traditions, adapting to these specific regional and political conditions in different ways. Marxist historiography has made contributions to the history of the working class, oppressed nationalities, and the methodology of history from below. The chief problematic aspect of some aspects of Marxist historiography has been an argument on the nature of history as determined or dialectical; this can also be stated as the relative importance of subjective and objective factors in creating outcomes. Marxist historians have also made this critique, particularly social historians who emphasize the need for a more humanist, historically contingent, Marxism. Marxist history is sometimes criticized as deterministic: with some practitioners positing a direction of history: towards an end state of history as classless human society. Marxist historiography, that is, the writing of Marxist history in line with the given historiographical principles, is often seen as a tool. Its aim is to bring those oppressed by history to self-consciousness, and to arm them with tactics and strategies from history: it is both a historical and a liberatory project. Historians who use Marxist methodology, but disagree with the mainstream of Marxism, often describe themselves as marxist historians (with a lowercase M). Methods from Marxist historiography, such as class analysis, can be divorced from the liberatory intent of Marxist historiography; such practitioners often refer to their work as marxian or Marxian. Marx and Engels Friedrich Engels' most important historical contribution was Der deutsche Bauernkrieg (The German Peasants' War), which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. The German Peasants' War indicate the Marxist interest in history from below and class analysis, and attempts a dialectical analysis. Marx's most important works on social and political history include The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, The Communist Manifesto, The German Ideology, and those chapters of Das Kapital dealing with the historical emergence of capitalists and proletarians from pre-industrial English society. Engels' short treatise The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 (1870s) was salient in creating the socialist impetus in British politics. Marx and labor Key to understanding Marxist historiography is his view of labor. For Marx \\"historical reality is none other than objectified labor, and all conditions of labor given by nature, including the organic bodies of people, are merely preconditions and 'disappearing moments' of the labor process.\\"Andrey Maidansky. \\"The Logic of Marx's History,\\" Russian Studies in Philosophy, vol. 51, no. 2 (Fall 2012): 45. This emphasis on the physical as the determining factor in history represents a break from virtually all previous historians. Until Marx developed his theory of historical materialism, the overarching determining factor in the direction of history was some sort of divine agency. In Marx's view of history \\"God became a mere projection of human imagination\\" and more importantly \\"a tool of oppression\\".Ernst Breisach. Historiography: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, 3rd Ed. (Chicago, Il: University of Chicago Press, 2007), p. 320. There was no more sense of divine direction to be seen. History moved by the sheer force of human labor, and all theories of divine nature were a concoction of the ruling powers to keep the working people in check. For Marx, \\"The first historical act is... the production of material life itself.\\"Fritz Stern. The Varieties of History: From Voltaire to the Present. Vintage Books Edition (New York: Random House: 1973), 150. As one might expect, Marxist history not only begins with labor, it ends in production: \\"history does not end by being resolved into \\"self-consciousness\\" as \\"spirit of the spirit,\\" but that in it at each stage there is found a material result: a sum of productive forces, a historically created relation of individuals to nature and to one another, which is handed down to each generation from its predecessor...\\"Fritz Stern. The Varieties of History: From Voltaire to the Present. Vintage Books Edition (New York: Random House: 1973), 156‚Äì57. For further, and much more comprehensive, information on this topic, see historical materialism. \\"Western\\" Historiography A circle of historians inside the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) formed in 1946. They shared a common interest in \\"history from below\\" and class structure in early capitalist society. While some members of the group (most notably Christopher Hill and E. P. Thompson) left the CPGB after the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. They placed a great emphasis on the subjective determination of history. E. P. Thompson famously engaged Althusser in The Poverty of Theory, arguing that Althusser's theory overdetermined history, and left no space for historical revolt by the oppressed. Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class is one of the works commonly associated with this group. Thompson's work is commonly considered the most influential work of history in the twentieth century and a crucial catalyst for social history and from social history to gender history and other studies of marginalized peoples.Scott,Joan. Gender and the Politics of History. New York: Columbia University Press, 1988; Revised edition, 1999 His essay, \\"Time, Work, Discipline, and Industrial Capitalism\\" is also hugely influential and argues that industrial capitalism fundamentally altered (and accelerated) humans' relationship to time. Perhaps the most famous of the Communist Historians was E.B. Hobsbawm, who might be the most famous and widely read historian of the 20th century. Hobsbawm is credited for establishing many of the basic historical arguments of current historiography and synthesizing huge amounts of modern historical data across time and space ‚Äì most famously in his trilogy: The Age of Revolutions, The Age of Empires, and The Age of Extremes.Robin, Corey. \\"Eric Hobsbawm, The Communist Who Explained History\\" The New Yorker, May 9, 2019. Eric Hobsbawm's Bandits is another example of this group's work. C. L. R. James was also a great pioneer of the 'history from below' approach. Living in Britain when he wrote his most notable work The Black Jacobins (1938), he was an anti-Stalinist Marxist and so outside of the CPGB. The Black Jacobins was the first professional historical account of the greatest and only successful slave revolt in colonial American history, the Haitian Revolution. James's history is still touted as a remarkable work of history nearly a century after publication, an immense work of historical investigation, story-telling, and creativity.Dubois, Laurent. The Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2005. In the United States, Marxist historiography greatly influenced the history of slavery and labor history. Marxist historiography also greatly influenced French historians, including France's most famous and enduring historian Fernand Braudel, as well as Italian historians, most famously the Autonomous Marxist and micro-history fields. In the Soviet Union Marxist historiography suffered in the Soviet Union, as the government requested overdetermined historical writing. Soviet historians tended to avoid contemporary history (history after 1905) where possible and effort was predominantly directed at premodern history. As history was considered to be a politicised academic discipline, historians limited their creative output to avoid prosecution. Notable histories include the Short Course History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolshevik), published in the 1930s, which was written in order to justify the nature of Bolshevik party life under Joseph Stalin.  In India  In India, D. D. Kosambi is considered the founding father of Marxist historiography. He was apologetic of Marxist revolution of Mao and thought of Socialist leader and Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru's policies as Pro Capitalism, He was although a mathematician but viewed Indian History from a Marxist view point. The senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are R. S. Sharma, Romila Thapar, Irfan Habib, D. N. Jha and K. N. Panikkar.Bottomore, T. B. 1983. A Dictionary of Marxist thought. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. One debate in Indian history that relates to a historical materialist schema is on the nature of feudalism in India. D. D. Kosambi in the 1960s outlined the idea of \\"feudalism from below\\" and \\"feudalism from above\\". R. S. Sharma largely agrees with Kosambi in his various books.R S Sharma, Indian Feudalism (book), 2005R S Sharma, Early Medieval Indian Society: A Study in Feudalisation, Orient Longman, Kolkata, 2001, pp. 177‚Äì85R S Sharma, India's Ancient Past, Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 2005D N Jha, The Feudal Order: State Society and Ideology in Early Medieval India, Manohar Publishers, New Delhi, 2002 Most Indian Marxists argue that the economic origins of communalism are feudal remnants and the economic insecurities caused by slow development under a \\"world capitalist system.\\" A number of historians have also debated Marxist historians and critically examined their analysis of history of India.Many have alleged that marxist historians used negationist tactics to deliberately whitewash atrocities committed by medieval Muslim rulers. Since the late 1990s, Hindu nationalist scholars especially have polemicized against the Marxist tradition in India for neglecting what they believe to be the country's 'illustrious past.' Marxists are held responsible for aiding and supporting Muslim extremists, who figure in Hindu nationalist discourse as the enemy within.

History The faction was originally named the Equal Rights Party, and was created in New York City as a protest against that city's regular Democratic organization (\\"Tammany Hall\\"). It contained a mixture of anti-Tammany Democrats and labor union veterans of the Working Men's Party, the latter of which had existed from 1828 to 1830. They were vigorous advocates of laissez-faire and opponents of monopoly. Their leading intellectual was editorial writer William Leggett. The name \\"Locofoco\\" derives from \\"locofoco, a kind of friction match\\". It originated when a group of New York Jacksonians used such matches to light candles to continue a political meeting after Tammany men tried to break up the meeting by turning off the gaslights.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica History & Society: Locofoco Party The Locofocos were involved in the Flour Riot of 1837. \\"Never a national party, the Locofocos reached their peak in 1840, when President Martin Van Buren and Congress passed the Independent Treasury Act, which fulfilled a primary Locofoco aim: complete separation of the federal government from banking.\\" In the 1840 election, the term \\"Locofoco\\" was applied to the entire Democratic Party by its Whig opponents, both because Democratic President Martin Van Buren had incorporated many Locofoco ideas into his economic policy, and because Whigs considered the term to be derogatory. In general, Locofocos supported Andrew Jackson and Van Buren, and were for free trade, greater circulation of specie, legal protections for labor unions and against paper money, financial speculation, and state banks. Among the prominent members of the faction were William Leggett, William Cullen Bryant, Alexander Ming Jr., John Commerford, Levi D. Slamm, Abram D. Smith, Henry K. Smith, Isaac S. Smith, Moses Jacques, Gorham Parks, and Walt Whitman (then a newspaper editor). Ralph Waldo Emerson said of the Locofocos: \\"The new race is stiff, heady, and rebellious; they are fanatics in freedom; they hate tolls, taxes, turnpikes, banks, hierarchies, governors, yea, almost all laws.\\" Origin of name The name Loco-foco was originally used by John Marck for a self-igniting cigar, which he had patented in April 1834. Marck, an immigrant, invented his name from a combination of the Latin prefix loco-, which as part of the word \\"locomotive\\" had recently entered general public use, and was usually misinterpreted to mean \\"self\\", and a misspelling of the Italian word fuoco for \\"fire\\". Therefore, Marck's name for his product was originally meant in the sense of \\"self-firing\\". It appears that Marck's term was quickly genericized to mean any self-igniting match, and it was this usage from which the faction derived its name. The Whigs quickly seized upon the name, applying an alternate derivation of \\"Loco Foco\\", from the combination of the Spanish word loco, meaning mad or crack-brained, and \\"foco\\", from focus or fuego 'fire'. Their meaning then was that the faction and later the entire Democratic party, was the \\"focus of folly\\". The use of \\"Locofoco\\" as a derogatory name for the Democratic party continued well into the 1850s, even following the dissolution of the Whig Party and the formation of the Republican Party by former urban Workingmen Locofocos, anti-slavery Know Nothings, Free Soilers, Conscience Whigs, and Temperance Whigs. In popular culture * The Locofocos are mentioned in Charles Dickens' novel Martin Chuzzlewit when the title character visits the United States. \\" ... Here's all the New York papers! Here's full particulars of the patriotic locofoco movement yesterday, in which the whigs was so chawed up; ...\\" [Chapter 16] \\"'I shot him down, sir,' pursued Chollop, 'for asserting in the Spartan Portico, a tri-weekly journal, that the ancient Athenians went a-head of the present Locofoco Ticket.'\\" [Chapter 33] * Fleshies recorded on Kill The Dreamer's Dream (2001) \\"Locofoco Motherfucker\\" which, according to vocalist Johnny NoMoniker, \\"Locofocos were a 19th Century. reactionary labor movement.

Inspired by European reform movements of the 1830s (such as Junges Deutschland, Young Italy and Young Hegelians), the American group was formed as a political organization in 1845 by Edwin de Leon and George Henry Evans. It advocated free trade, social reform, expansion southward into the territories, and support for republican, anti-aristocratic movements abroad. It became a faction in the Democratic Party in the 1850s. Senator Stephen A. Douglas promoted its nationalistic program in an unsuccessful effort to compromise sectional differences. John L. O'Sullivan described the general purpose of the Young America Movement in an 1837 editorial for the Democratic Review: Historian Edward L. Widmer has largely placed O'Sullivan and the Democratic Review in New York City at the center of the Young America Movement. In that sense, the movement can be considered mostly urban and middle class, but with a strong emphasis on socio-political reform for all Americans, especially given the burgeoning European immigrant population (particularly Irish Catholics) in New York in the 1840s. Politics John L. O'Sullivan (1874) Historian Yonatan Eyal argues that the 1840s and 1850s were the heyday of the faction of young Democrats that called itself \\"Young America\\". Led by Stephen Douglas, James K. Polk and Franklin Pierce, and New York financier August Belmont, this faction broke with the agrarian and strict constructionist orthodoxies of the past and embraced commerce, technology, regulation, reform, and internationalism.Yonatan Eyal, The Young America Movement and the Transformation of the Democratic Party, 1828‚Äì1861, (2007) In economic policy Young America saw the necessity of a modern infrastructure of railroads, canals, telegraphs, turnpikes, and harbors; they endorsed the \\"Market Revolution\\" and promoted capitalism. They called for Congressional land grants to the states, which allowed Democrats to claim that internal improvements were locally rather than federally sponsored. Young America claimed that modernization would perpetuate the agrarian vision of Jeffersonian Democracy by allowing yeomen farmers to sell their products and therefore to prosper. They tied internal improvements to free trade, while accepting moderate tariffs as a necessary source of government revenue. They supported the Independent Treasury (the Jacksonian alternative to the Second Bank of the United States), not as a scheme to quash the special privilege of the Whiggish moneyed elite, but as a device to spread prosperity to all Americans.Eyal, The Young America Movement and the Transformation of the Democratic Party, 1828‚Äì1861, p. 79 The movement's decline by 1856 was due to unsuccessful challenges to \\"old fogy\\" leaders like James Buchanan, to Douglas' failure to win the presidential nomination in 1852, to an inability to deal with the slavery issue, and to rising isolationism and disenchantment with reform in America.David B. Danbom, \\"The Young America Movement,\\" Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society, Sept 1974, Vol. 67 Issue 3, pp. 294‚Äì306 Manifest Destiny When O'Sullivan coined the term \\"Manifest Destiny\\" in an 1845 article for the Democratic Review, he did not necessarily intend for American democracy to expand across the continent by force. In effect, the American democratic principle was to spread on its own, self-evident merits. The American exceptionalism often attached to O'Sullivan's \\"Manifest Destiny\\" was an 1850s perversion that can be attributed to what Widmer called \\"Young America II\\".Widmer, p. 189. O'Sullivan even contended that American \\"democracy needed to expand in order to contain its ideological opponent (aristocracy)\\".Widmer, p. 217. Unlike Europe, America had no aristocratic system or nobility against which Young America could define itself. Culture Aside from Young America's promotion of Jacksonian Democracy in the Democratic Review, the movement also had a literary side. It attracted a circle of outstanding writers, including William Cullen Bryant, George Bancroft, Herman Melville, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. They sought independence from European standards of high culture and wanted to demonstrate the excellence and \\"exceptionalism\\" of America's own literary tradition. Other writers of the movement included Evert Augustus Duyckinck, Cornelius Mathews,Duberman, Martin (1966). James Russell Lowell. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. p. 50. . It was Mathews that adopted the name for the movement. In a speech delivered June 30, 1845, he said: One of Young America's intellectual vehicles was the literary journal Arcturus. Herman Melville in his book Mardi (1849) refers to it by naming a ship in the book Arcturion and observing that it was \\"exceedingly dull\\", and that its crew had a low literary level.Andrew Delbanco, Melville, His World and Work. (2005) p. 93. The North American Review referred to the movement as \\"at war with good taste\\".Widmer, p. 110. Hudson River School The Course of Empire: The Savage State by Thomas Cole (1836) Apart from literature, there was a distinct element of art associated with the Young America Movement. In the 1820s and 1830s, American artists such as Asher B. Durand and Thomas Cole began to emerge. They were heavily influenced by romanticism, which resulted in numerous paintings involving the physical landscape. But it was William Sidney Mount who had connections to the writers of the Democratic Review. And as a contemporary of the Hudson River School, he sought to use art in the promotion of the American democratic principle. O'Sullivan's cohort at the Review, E. A. Duyckinck, was particularly \\"eager to launch an ancillary artistic movement\\" that supplemented Young America.Widmer, p. 126. Many elements of the Hudson River School were closely aligned with the Whig party as well. And while some Hudson River School artists celebrated the use of property and the upward trajectory of civilization, others, like Thomas Cole had concern over the course of democracy. See, e.g., Alfred L. Brophy, Property and Progress; Antebellum Landscape Art and Property Law, McGeorge Law Review 40 (2009): 601. Young America II In late 1851, the Democratic Review was acquired by George Nicholas Sanders. Similar to O'Sullivan, Sanders believed in the inherent value of a literary-political relationship, whereby literature and politics could be combined and used as an instrument for socio-political progress. And although he \\"brought O'Sullivan back into the fold as an editor,\\" the periodical's \\"jingoism achieved an even higher pitch than O'Sullivan's [original] dog-whistle stridency\\".Widmer, p. 189. Even Democratic Representative John C. Breckinridge remarked in 1852: The change in tone and partisanship in the Democratic Review that Breckinridge referred to was mostly a reaction by the increasingly divided Democratic Party to the growth of the Free Soil movement, which threatened to dissolve any semblance of Democratic unity that remained. Rise of Labor Republicanism By the mid-1850s, Free Soil Democrats (those who followed David Wilmot and his Proviso) and anti- slavery Whigs had combined to form the Republican Party. Young America's New York Democrats who opposed slavery saw an opportunity to express their abolitionist sentiments. As a result, Horace Greeley's New York Tribune began to replace the Democratic Review as the central outlet for Young America's ever-evolving politics. In fact, Greeley's Tribune became a major advocate of not only abolition, but also of land and labor reform.Lause, pp. 118‚Äì19. The combined cause of land and labor reform was perhaps best exemplified by George Henry Evans' National Reform Association (NRA). In 1846, Evans stated: Eventually, former members of the radical Locofoco faction in the Democratic Party recognized the potential for reorganizing New York City's labor system around principles such as the common good.Lause, p. 119. In contrast to the Europe in the days of the 1848 revolutions, America had no aristocratic establishment against which Young America could define itself in protest.

Its motto, \\"The best government is that which governs least\\", was famously paraphrased by Henry David Thoreau in \\"Resistance to Civil Government\\", better known as Civil DisobedienceRespectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations. 1989, Bartleby.com, accessed 20 January 2013, and is often erroneously attributed to Thomas Jefferson.http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/government-best- which-governs-least-quotation History In 1837, O'Sullivan co-founded and served as editor for The United States Magazine and Democratic Review (generally called the Democratic Review). It was a highly regarded journal meant to champion Jacksonian Democracy, a movement which had usually been disparaged in the more conservative North American Review. The magazine featured political essays, many of them penned by O'Sullivan himself, extolling the virtues of Jacksonian democracy and criticizing what Democrats regarded as the aristocratic pretensions of their opponents. The journal supported Martin Van Buren in the 1840 presidential election (who lost) and James K. Polk in the 1844 election (who won). As a leading organizer for the Democratic Party, Van Buren paid close attention to party communication media such as newspapers and magazines. They received subsidies in the form of government printing contracts. At an intellectual level, his administration was strongly supported by The United States Magazine and Democratic Review. Its editorials and articles provided the arguments that partisan needed to discuss Democratic Party positions on the Mexican War, slavery, states' rights, and Indian removal.Robert J, Scholnick, \\"Extermination and Democracy: O'Sullivan, the Democratic Review, and Empire, 1837‚Äî1840.\\" American Periodicals (2005) 15#2: 123-141.online The Democratic Review was also (perhaps even primarily) a literary magazine, promoting the development of American literature. Some of its regular contributors were Nathaniel Hawthorne and John Greenleaf Whittier, with occasional contributions by William Cullen Bryant and James Fenimore Cooper. The Review also published some of the early work of Walt Whitman, James Russell Lowell, and Henry David Thoreau.Widmer, Edward L. Young America: The Flowering of Democracy in New York City. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999: 66. . Hawthorne and O'Sullivan became close friends, and Hawthorne had more pieces published in O'Sullivan's magazine than in any other periodical. The Democratic Review was always in financial difficulties since it accepted no advertising and relied on subscriptions and donations to survive. O'Sullivan relinquished his editorial duties for a short time to practice law but continued to write for the magazine. The magazine is also responsible for coining the term \\"manifest destiny\\", referring to the combination of rapid growth of civilization and open space to grow in North America.

It failed because of intense opposition from the aristocracy, who slaughtered up to 100,000 of the 300,000 poorly armed peasants and farmers. The survivors were fined and achieved few, if any, of their goals. Like the preceding Bundschuh movement and the Hussite Wars, the war consisted of a series of both economic and religious revolts in which peasants and farmers, often supported by Anabaptist clergy, took the lead. The German Peasants' War was Europe's largest and most widespread popular uprising prior to the French Revolution of 1789. The fighting was at its height in the middle of 1525. The war began with separate insurrections, beginning in the southwestern part of what is now Germany and Alsace, and spread in subsequent insurrections to the central and eastern areas of Germany and present-day Austria. After the uprising in Germany was suppressed, it flared briefly in several Swiss cantons. In mounting their insurrection, peasants faced insurmountable obstacles. The democratic nature of their movement left them without a command structure and they lacked artillery and cavalry. Most of them had little, if any, military experience. Their opposition had experienced military leaders, well-equipped and disciplined armies, and ample funding. The revolt incorporated some principles and rhetoric from the emerging Protestant Reformation, through which the peasants sought influence and freedom. Radical Reformers and Anabaptists, most famously Thomas M√ºntzer, instigated and supported the revolt. In contrast, Martin Luther and other Magisterial Reformers condemned it and clearly sided with the nobles. In Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants, Luther condemned the violence as the devil's work and called for the nobles to put down the rebels like mad dogs.Jaroslav J. Pelikan, Hilton C. Oswald, Luther's Works, 55 vols. (St. Louis and Philadelphia: Concordia Pub. House and Fortress Press, 1955‚Äì1986), 46: 50‚Äì51. Historians have interpreted the economic aspects of the German Peasants' War differently, and social and cultural historians continue to disagree on its causes and nature. Background In the sixteenth century, many parts of Europe had common political links within the Holy Roman Empire, a decentralized entity in which the Holy Roman Emperor himself had little authority outside of his own dynastic lands, which covered only a small fraction of the whole. At the time of the Peasants' War, Charles V, King of Spain, held the position of Holy Roman Emperor (elected in 1519). Aristocratic dynasties ruled hundreds of largely independent territories (both secular and ecclesiastical) within the framework of the empire, and several dozen others operated as semi-independent city-states. The princes of these dynasties were taxed by the Roman Catholic church. The princes stood to gain economically if they broke away from the Roman church and established a German church under their own control, which would then not be able to tax them as the Roman church did. Most German princes broke with Rome using the nationalistic slogan of \\"German money for a German church\\". Roman civil law Princes often attempted to force their freer peasants into serfdom by increasing taxes and introducing Roman civil law. Roman civil law advantaged princes who sought to consolidate their power because it brought all land into their personal ownership and eliminated the feudal concept of the land as a trust between lord and peasant that conferred rights as well as obligations on the latter. By maintaining the remnants of the ancient law which legitimized their own rule, they not only elevated their wealth and position in the empire through the confiscation of all property and revenues, but increased their power over their peasant subjects. During the Knights' Revolt the \\"knights\\", the lesser landholders of the Rhineland in western Germany, rose up in rebellion in 1522‚Äì1523. Their rhetoric was religious, and several leaders expressed Luther's ideas on the split with Rome and the new German church. However, the Knights' Revolt was not fundamentally religious. It was conservative in nature and sought to preserve the feudal order. The knights revolted against the new money order, which was squeezing them out of existence. Luther and M√ºntzer Twelve Articles of the Peasants pamphlet of 1525 Martin Luther, the dominant leader of the Reformation in Germany, initially took a middle course in the Peasants' War, by criticizing both the injustices imposed on the peasants, and the rashness of the peasants in fighting back. He also tended to support the centralization and urbanization of the economy. This position alienated the lesser nobles, but shored up his position with the burghers. Luther argued that work was the chief duty on earth; the duty of the peasants was farm labor and the duty of the ruling classes was upholding the peace. He could not support the Peasant War because it broke the peace, an evil he thought greater than the evils the peasants were rebelling against. At the peak of the insurrection in 1525, his position shifted completely to support of the rulers of the secular principalities and their Roman Catholic allies. In Against the Robbing Murderous Hordes of Peasants he encouraged the nobility to swiftly and violently eliminate the rebelling peasants, stating,\\"[the peasants] must be sliced, choked, stabbed, secretly and publicly, by those who can, like one must kill a rabid dog.\\" After the conclusion of the Peasants War, he was criticized for his writings in support of the violent actions taken by the ruling class. He responded by writing an open letter to Caspar Muller, defending his position. However, he also stated that the nobles were too severe in suppression of the insurrection, despite having called for severe violence in his previous work. Luther has often been sharply criticized for his position. Thomas M√ºntzer was the most prominent radical reforming preacher who supported the demands of the peasantry, including political and legal rights. M√ºntzer's theology had been developed against a background of social upheaval and widespread religious doubt, and his call for a new world order fused with the political and social demands of the peasantry. In the final weeks of 1524 and the beginning of 1525, M√ºntzer travelled into south- west Germany, where the peasant armies were gathering; here he would have had contact with some of their leaders, and it is argued that he also influenced the formulation of their demands. He spent several weeks in the Klettgau area, and there is some evidence to suggest that he helped the peasants to formulate their grievances. While the famous Twelve Articles of the Swabian peasants were certainly not composed by M√ºntzer, at least one important supporting document, the Constitutional Draft, may well have originated with him. Returning to Saxony and Thuringia in early 1525, he assisted in the organisation of the various rebel groups there and ultimately led the rebel army in the ill-fated Battle of Frankenhausen on 15 May 1525. M√ºntzer's role in the Peasant War has been the subject of considerable controversy, some arguing that he had no influence at all, others that he was the sole inspirer of the uprising. To judge from his writings of 1523 and 1524, it was by no means inevitable that M√ºntzer would take the road of social revolution. However, it was precisely on this same theological foundation that M√ºntzer's ideas briefly coincided with the aspirations of the peasants and plebeians of 1525: viewing the uprising as an apocalyptic act of God, he stepped up as 'God's Servant against the Godless' and took his position as leader of the rebels. Luther and M√ºntzer took every opportunity to attack each other's ideas and actions. Luther himself declared against the moderate demands of the peasantry embodied in the twelve articles. His article Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants appeared in May 1525 just as the rebels were being defeated on the fields of battle. Social classes in the 16th century Holy Roman Empire Flyer from the time of the Peasants' War In this era of rapid change, modernizing princes tended to align with clergy burghers against the lesser nobility and peasants. =Princes= Many rulers of Germany's various principalities functioned as autocratic rulers who recognized no other authority within their territories. Princes had the right to levy taxes and borrow money as they saw fit. The growing costs of administration and military upkeep impelled them to keep raising demands on their subjects. The princes also worked to centralize power in the towns and estates. Accordingly, princes tended to gain economically from the ruination of the lesser nobility, by acquiring their estates. This ignited the Knights' Revolt that occurred from 1522 through 1523 in the Rhineland. The revolt was \\"suppressed by both Catholic and Lutheran princes who were satisfied to cooperate against a common danger\\". To the degree that other classes, such as the bourgeoisie, might gain from the centralization of the economy and the elimination of the lesser nobles' territorial controls on manufacture and trade, the princes might unite with the burghers on the issue. =Lesser nobility= The innovations in military technology of the Late Medieval period began to render the lesser nobility (the knights) militarily obsolete. The introduction of military science and the growing importance of gunpowder and infantry lessened the importance of heavy cavalry and of castles. Their luxurious lifestyle drained what little income they had as prices kept rising. They exercised their ancient rights in order to wring income from their territories. In the north of Germany many of the lesser nobles had already been subordinated to secular and ecclesiastical lords. Thus, their dominance over serfs was more restricted. However, in the south of Germany their powers were more intact. Accordingly, the harshness of the lesser nobles' treatment of the peasantry provided the immediate cause of the uprising. The fact that this treatment was worse in the south than in the north was the reason that the war began in the south. The knights became embittered as their status and income fell and they came increasingly under the jurisdiction of the princes, putting the two groups in constant conflict. The knights also regarded the clergy as arrogant and superfluous, while envying their privileges and wealth. In addition, the knights' relationships with the patricians in the towns was strained by the debts owed by the knights. At odds with other classes in Germany, the lesser nobility was the least disposed to the changes. They and the clergy paid no taxes and often supported their local prince. =Clergy= The clergy in 1525 were the intellectuals of their time. Not only were they literate, but in the Middle Ages they had produced most books. Some clergy were supported by the nobility and the rich, while others appealed to the masses. However, the clergy was beginning to lose its overwhelming intellectual authority. The progress of printing (especially of the Bible) and the expansion of commerce, as well as the spread of renaissance humanism, raised literacy rates, according to Engels. Engels held that the Catholic monopoly on higher education was accordingly reduced. However, despite the secular nature of nineteenth century humanism, three centuries earlier Renaissance humanism had still been strongly connected with the Church: its proponents had attended Church schools. Over time, some Catholic institutions had slipped into corruption. Clerical ignorance and the abuses of simony and pluralism (holding several offices at once) were rampant. Some bishops, archbishops, abbots and priors were as ruthless in exploiting their subjects as the regional princes. In addition to the sale of indulgences, they set up prayer houses and directly taxed the people. Increased indignation over church corruption had led the monk Martin Luther to post his 95 Theses on the doors of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany, in 1517, as well as impelling other reformers to radically re-think church doctrine and organization. ,\\" New York, 1918, p. 514 Ennen, pp. 291‚Äì313. The clergy who did not follow Luther tended to be the aristocratic clergy, who opposed all change, including any break with the Roman Church. The poorer clergy, rural and urban itinerant preachers who were not well positioned in the church, were more likely to join the Reformation. Some of the poorer clergy sought to extend Luther's equalizing ideas to society at large. =Patricians= Many towns had privileges that exempted them from taxes, so that the bulk of taxation fell on the peasants. As the guilds grew and urban populations rose, the town patricians faced increasing opposition. The patricians consisted of wealthy families who sat alone in the town councils and held all the administrative offices. Like the princes, they sought to secure revenues from their peasants by any possible means. Arbitrary road, bridge, and gate tolls were instituted at will. They gradually usurped the common lands and made it illegal for peasants to fish or to log wood from these lands. Guild taxes were exacted. No revenues collected were subject to formal administration, and civic accounts were neglected. Thus embezzlement and fraud became common, and the patrician class, bound by family ties, became wealthier and more powerful. =Burghers= The town patricians were increasingly criticized by the growing burgher class, which consisted of well- to-do middle-class citizens who held administrative guild positions or worked as merchants. They demanded town assemblies made up of both patricians and burghers, or at least a restriction on simony and the allocation of council seats to burghers. The burghers also opposed the clergy, whom they felt had overstepped and failed to uphold their principles. They demanded an end to the clergy's special privileges such as their exemption from taxation, as well as a reduction in their numbers. The burgher-master (guild master, or artisan) now owned both his workshop and its tools, which he allowed his apprentices to use, and provided the materials that his workers needed. F. Engels cites: \\"To the call of Luther of rebellion against the Church, two political uprisings responded, first, the one of lower nobility, headed by Franz von Sickingen in 1523, and then, the great peasant's war, in 1525; both were crushed, because, mainly, of the indecisiveness of the party having most interest in the fight, the urban bourgeoisie\\". (Foreword to the English edition of: 'From Utopy Socialism to Scientific Socialism', 1892) =Plebeians= The plebeians comprised the new class of urban workers, journeymen, and peddlers. Ruined burghers also joined their ranks. Although technically potential burghers, most journeymen were barred from higher positions by the wealthy families who ran the guilds. Thus their \\"temporary\\" position devoid of civic rights tended to become permanent. The plebeians did not have property like ruined burghers or peasants. =Peasants= The heavily taxed peasantry continued to occupy the lowest stratum of society. In the early 16th century, no peasant could hunt, fish, or chop wood freely, as they previously had, because the lords had recently taken control of common lands. The lord had the right to use his peasants' land as he wished; the peasant could do nothing but watch as his crops were destroyed by wild game and by nobles galloping across his fields in the course of chivalric hunts. When a peasant wished to marry, he not only needed the lord's permission but had to pay a tax. When the peasant died, the lord was entitled to his best cattle, his best garments and his best tools. The justice system, operated by the clergy or wealthy burgher and patrician jurists, gave the peasant no redress. Generations of traditional servitude and the autonomous nature of the provinces limited peasant insurrections to local areas. Military organizations =Army of the Swabian League= Bauernj√∂rg, Georg, Truchsess von Waldburg, the Scourge of the Peasants The Swabian League fielded an army commanded by Georg, Truchsess von Waldburg, later known as \\"Bauernj√∂rg\\" for his role in the suppression of the revolt. He was also known as the \\"Scourge of the Peasants\\". Born in Waldsee (25 January 1488 ‚Äì 29 May 1531), the son of Johann II von Waldburg-Wolfegg (‚Ä† 19. October 1511) and of Helena von Hohenzollern, he married Appolonia von Waldburg- Sonnenberg in 1509; and, secondly, Maria von Oettingen (11 April 1498 ‚Äì 18 August 1555). ) The league headquarters was in Ulm, and command was exercised through a war council which decided the troop contingents to be levied from each member. Depending on their capability, members contributed a specific number of mounted knights and foot soldiers, called a contingent, to the league's army. The Bishop of Augsburg, for example, had to contribute 10 horse (mounted) and 62 foot soldiers, which would be the equivalent of a half- company. At the beginning of the revolt the league members had trouble recruiting soldiers from among their own populations (particularly among peasant class) due to fear of them joining the rebels. As the rebellion expanded many nobles had trouble sending troops to the league armies because they had to combat rebel groups in their own lands. Another common problem regarding raising armies was that while nobles were obligated to provide troops to a member of the league, they also had other obligations to other lords. These conditions created problems and confusion for the nobles as they tried to gather together forces large enough to put down the revolts. Foot soldiers were drawn from the ranks of the landsknechte. These were mercenaries, usually paid a monthly wage of four guilders, and organized into regiments (haufen) and companies (f√§hnlein or little flag) of 120‚Äì300 men, which distinguished it from others. Each company, in turn, was composed of smaller units of 10 to 12 men, known as rotte. The landsknechte clothed, armed and fed themselves, and were accompanied by a sizable train of sutlers, bakers, washerwomen, prostitutes and sundry individuals with occupations needed to sustain the force. Trains (tross) were sometimes larger than the fighting force, but they required organization and discipline. Each landsknecht maintained its own structure, called the gemein, or community assembly, which was symbolized by a ring. The gemein had its own leader (schultheiss), and a provost officer who policed the ranks and maintained order. The use of the landsknechte in the German Peasants' War reflects a period of change between traditional noble roles or responsibilities towards warfare and practice of buying mercenary armies, which became the norm throughout the 16th century. The league relied on the armored cavalry of the nobility for the bulk of its strength; the league had both heavy cavalry and light cavalry, (rennfahne), which served as a vanguard. Typically, the rehnnfahne were the second and third sons of poor knights, the lower and sometimes impoverished nobility with small land-holdings, or, in the case of second and third sons, no inheritance or social role. These men could often be found roaming the countryside looking for work or engaging in highway robbery. To be effective the cavalry needed to be mobile, and to avoid hostile forces armed with pikes. =Peasant armies= Wandering bands of insurgents during the German Peasants' War The peasant armies were organized in bands ('), similar to the landsknecht. Each haufen was organized into unterhaufen, or f√§hnlein and rotten. The bands varied in size, depending on the number of insurgents available in the locality. Peasant haufen divided along territorial lines, whereas those of the landsknecht drew men from a variety of territories. Some bands could number about 4,000; others, such as the peasant force at Frankenhausen, could gather 8,000. The Alsatian peasants who took to the field at the Battle of Zabern (now Saverne) numbered 18,000. Haufen were formed from companies, typically 500 men per company, subdivided into platoons of 10 to 15 peasants each. Like the landsknechts, the peasant bands used similar titles: Oberster feldhauptmann, or supreme commander, similar to a colonel, and lieutenants, or leutinger. Each company was commanded by a captain and had its own f√§hnrich, or ensign, who carried the company's standard (its ensign). The companies also had a sergeant or feldweibel, and squadron leaders called rottmeister, or masters of the rotte. Officers were usually elected, particularly the supreme commander and the leutinger. The peasant army was governed by a so-called ring, in which peasants gathered in a circle to debate tactics, troop movements, alliances, and the distribution of spoils. The ring was the decision-making body. In addition to this democratic construct, each band had a hierarchy of leaders including a supreme commander and a marshal (schultheiss), who maintained law and order. Other roles included lieutenants, captains, standard-bearers, master gunner, wagon-fort master, train master, four watch-masters, four sergeant-majors to arrange the order of battle, a weibel (sergeant) for each company, two quartermasters, farriers, quartermasters for the horses, a communications officer and a pillage master. =Peasant resources= Coat of arms of the Swabian League, with a flag of St. George. Two putti support a red cross in a white field; the motto: What God has joined let man not separate; coloured woodcut by Hans Burgkmair, 1522. The peasants possessed an important resource, the skills to build and maintain field works. They used the wagon fort effectively, a tactic that had been mastered in the Hussite Wars of the previous century. Wagons were chained together in a suitable defensive location, with cavalry and draft animals placed in the center. Peasants dug ditches around the outer edge of the fort and used timber to close gaps between and underneath the wagons. In the Hussite Wars, artillery was usually placed in the center on raised mounds of earth that allowed them to fire over the wagons. Wagon forts could be erected and dismantled quickly. They were quite mobile, but they also had drawbacks: they required a fairly large area of flat terrain and they were not ideal for offense. Since their earlier use, artillery had increased in range and power. Peasants served in rotation, sometimes for one week in four, and returned to their villages after service. While the men served, others absorbed their workload. This sometimes meant producing supplies for their opponents, such as in the Archbishopric of Salzburg, where men worked to extract silver, which was used to hire fresh contingents of landsknechts for the Swabian League. However, the peasants lacked the Swabian League's cavalry, having few horses and little armour. They seem to have used their mounted men for reconnaissance. The lack of cavalry with which to protect their flanks, and with which to penetrate massed landsknecht squares, proved to be a long- term tactical and strategic problem. Causes Historians disagree on the nature of the revolt and its causes, whether it grew out of the emerging religious controversy centered on Luther; whether a wealthy tier of peasants saw their own wealth and rights slipping away, and sought to weave them into the legal, social and religious fabric of society; or whether peasants objected to the emergence of a modernizing, centralizing nation state. Threat to prosperity One view is that the origins of the German Peasants' War lay partly in the unusual power dynamic caused by the agricultural and economic dynamism of the previous decades. Labor shortages in the last half of the 14th century had allowed peasants to sell their labor for a higher price; food and goods shortages had allowed them to sell their products for a higher price as well. Consequently, some peasants, particularly those who had limited allodial requirements, were able to accrue significant economic, social, and legal advantages. Peasants were more concerned to protect the social, economic and legal gains they had made than about seeking further gains. Serfdom Their attempt to break new ground was primarily seeking to increase their liberty by changing their status from serfs, such as the infamous moment when the peasants of M√ºhlhausen refused to collect snail shells around which their lady could wind her thread. The renewal of the signeurial system had weakened in the previous half century, and peasants were unwilling to see it restored. Luther's Reformation Rebellious peasants surrounding a knight. People in all layers of the social hierarchy‚Äîserfs or city dwellers, guildsmen or farmers, knights and aristocrats‚Äîstarted to question the established hierarchy. The so-called Book of One Hundred Chapters, for example, written between 1501 and 1513, promoted religious and economic freedom, attacking the governing establishment and displaying pride in the virtuous peasant. The Bundschuh revolts of the first 20 years of the century offered another avenue for the expression of anti-authoritarian ideas, and for the spread of these ideas from one geographic region to another. Luther's revolution may have added intensity to these movements, but did not create them; the two events, Luther's Protestant Reformation and the German Peasants' War, were separate, sharing the same years but occurring independently. However, Luther's doctrine of the \\"priesthood of all believers\\" could be interpreted as proposing greater social equality than Luther intended. Luther vehemently opposed the revolts, writing the pamphlet Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants, in which he remarks \\"Let everyone who can, smite, slay, and stab, secretly or openly ... nothing can be more poisonous, hurtful, or devilish than a rebel. It is just as one must kill a mad dog; if you do not strike him he will strike you.\\" Historian Roland Bainton saw the revolt as a struggle that began as an upheaval immersed in the rhetoric of Luther's Protestant Reformation against the Catholic Church but which really was impelled far beyond the narrow religious confines by the underlying economic tensions of the time. Class struggle Friedrich Engels interpreted the war as a case in which an emerging proletariat (the urban class) failed to assert a sense of its own autonomy in the face of princely power and left the rural classes to their fate. Outbreak in the southwest During the 1524 harvest, in St√ºhlingen, south of the Black Forest, the Countess of Lupfen ordered serfs to collect snail shells for use as thread spools after a series of difficult harvests. Within days, 1,200 peasants had gathered, created a list of grievances, elected officers, and raised a banner. Within a few weeks most of southwestern Germany was in open revolt. The uprising stretched from the Black Forest, along the Rhine river, to Lake Constance, into the Swabian highlands, along the upper Danube river, and into Bavaria and the Tyrol.Hannes Obermair, \\"Logiche sociali della rivolta tradizionalista. Bolzano e l‚Äôimpatto della \\"Guerra dei contadini\\" del 1515,\\" Studi Trentini. Storia, 92#1 (2013), pp. 185‚Äì194. Insurgency expands On 16 February 1525, 25 villages belonging to the city of Memmingen rebelled, demanding of the magistrates (city council) improvements in their economic condition and the general political situation. They complained of peonage, land use, easements on the woods and the commons, as well as ecclesiastical requirements of service and payment. The city set up a committee of villagers to discuss their issues, expecting to see a checklist of specific and trivial demands. Unexpectedly, the peasants delivered a uniform declaration that struck at the pillars of the peasant-magisterial relationship. Twelve articles clearly and consistently outlined their grievances. The council rejected many of the demands. Historians have generally concluded that the articles of Memmingen became the basis for the Twelve Articles agreed on by the Upper Swabian Peasants Confederation of 20 March 1525. A single Swabian contingent, close to 200 horse and 1,000-foot soldiers, however, could not deal with the size of the disturbance. By 1525, the uprisings in the Black Forest, the Breisgau, Hegau, Sundgau, and Alsace alone required a substantial muster of 3,000-foot and 300 horse soldiers. Twelve Articles (statement of principles) The title page of the 12 Articles. On browned paper, an illustration shows men seated in a circle talking. On 6 March 1525, some 50 representatives of the Upper Swabian Peasants Haufen (troops)‚Äîthe Baltringer Haufen, the Allg√§uer Haufen, and the Lake Constance Haufen (Seehaufen)‚Äîmet in Memmingen to agree to a common cause against the Swabian League. One day later, after difficult negotiations, they proclaimed the establishment of the Christian Association, an Upper Swabian Peasants' Confederation. The peasants met again on 15 and 20 March in Memmingen and, after some additional deliberation, adopted the Twelve Articles and the Federal Order (Bundesordnung). Their banner, the Bundschuh, or a laced boot, served as the emblem of their agreement. The Twelve Articles were printed over 25,000 times in the next two months, and quickly spread throughout Germany, an example of how modernization came to the aid of the rebels. The Twelve Articles demanded the right for communities to elect and depose clergymen and demanded the utilization of the \\"great tithe\\" for public purposes after subtraction of a reasonable pastor's salary. (The \\"great tithe\\" was assessed by the Catholic Church against the peasant's wheat crop and the peasant's vine crops. The great tithe often amounted to more than 10% of the peasant's income.) The Twelve Articles also demanded the abolition of the \\"small tithe\\" which was assessed against the peasant's other crops. Other demands of the Twelve Articles included the abolition of serfdom, death tolls, and the exclusion from fishing and hunting rights; restoration of the forests, pastures, and privileges withdrawn from the community and individual peasants by the nobility; and a restriction on excessive statute labor, taxes and rents. Finally, the Twelve Articles demanded an end to arbitrary justice and administration. Course of the war Kempten Insurrection A finely detailed drawing of an old city, with church towers, thick defensive walls, moats, and many houses. The Iller river divided the Free Imperial City of Kempten and Kempten Abbey. Kempten im Allg√§u was an important city in the Allg√§u, a region in what became Bavaria, near the borders with W√ºrttemberg and Austria. In the early eighth century, Celtic monks established a monastery there, Kempten Abbey. In 1213, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II declared the abbots members of the Reichsstand, or imperial estate, and granted the abbot the title of duke. In 1289, King Rudolf of Habsburg granted special privileges to the urban settlement in the river valley, making it a free imperial city. In 1525 the last property rights of the abbots in the Imperial City were sold in the so-called \\"Great Purchase\\", marking the start of the co-existence of two independent cities bearing the same name next to each other. In this multi-layered authority, during the Peasants' War, the abbey-peasants revolted, plundering the abbey and moving on the town.More conflict arose after the Imperial City converted to Protestantism in direct opposition to the Catholic monastery (and Free City) in 1527. Battle of Leipheim On 4 April 1525, 5,000 peasants, the Leipheimer Haufen (literally: the Leipheim Bunch), gathered near Leipheim to rise against the city of Ulm. A band of five companies, plus approximately 25 citizens of Leipheim, assumed positions west of the town. League reconnaissance reported to the Truchsess that the peasants were well-armed. They had cannons with powder and shot and they numbered 3,000‚Äì4,000. They took an advantageous position on the east bank of the Biber. On the left stood a wood, and on their right, a stream and marshland; behind them, they had erected a wagon fortress, and they were armed with arquebuses and some light artillery pieces. As he had done in earlier encounters with the peasants, the Truchsess negotiated while he continued to move his troops into advantageous positions. Keeping the bulk of his army facing Leipheim, he dispatched detachments of horse from Hesse and Ulm across the Danube to Elchingen. The detached troops encountered a separate group of 1,200 peasants engaged in local requisitions, and entered into combat, dispersing them and taking 250 prisoners. At the same time, the Truchsess broke off his negotiations, and received a volley of fire from the main group of peasants. He dispatched a guard of light horse and a small group of foot soldiers against the fortified peasant position. This was followed by his main force; when the peasants saw the size of his main force‚Äîhis entire force was 1,500 horse, 7,000-foot, and 18 field guns‚Äîthey began an orderly retreat. Of the 4,000 or so peasants who had manned the fortified position, 2,000 were able to reach the town of Leipheim itself, taking their wounded with them in carts. Others sought to escape across the Danube, and 400 drowned there. The Truchsess' horse units cut down an additional 500. This was the first important battle of the war.In 1994, a mass grave was discovered near Leipheim; linked by coins to the time period, archaeologists discovered that most of the occupants had died of head wounds . Weinsberg Massacre Illustration of the castle at Weinsberg, surrounded by vineyards. At Weinsberg, the peasants overwhelmed the castle, and slaughtered the aristocratic landlords. An element of the conflict drew on resentment toward some of the nobility. The peasants of Odenwald had already taken the Cistercian Monastery at Sch√∂ntal, and were joined by peasant bands from Limpurg (near Schw√§bisch Hall) and Hohenlohe. A large band of peasants from the Neckar valley, under the leadership of Jakob Rohrbach, joined them and from Neckarsulm, this expanded band, called the \\"Bright Band\\" (in German, Heller Haufen), marched to the town of Weinsberg, where the Count of Helfenstein, then the Austrian Governor of W√ºrttemberg, was present.The count, much despised by his subjects, was the son-in-law of the previous Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian. Here, the peasants achieved a major victory. The peasants assaulted and captured the castle of Weinsberg; most of its own soldiers were on duty in Italy, and it had little protection. Having taken the count as their prisoner, the peasants took their revenge a step further: They forced him, and approximately 70 other nobles who had taken refuge with him, to run the gauntlet of pikes, a popular form of execution among the landsknechts. Rohrbach ordered the band's piper to play during the running of the gauntlet. This was too much for many of the peasant leaders of other bands; they repudiated Rohrbach's actions. He was deposed and replaced by a knight, G√∂tz von Berlichingen, who was subsequently elected as supreme commander of the band. At the end of April, the band marched to Amorbach, joined on the way by some radical Odenwald peasants out for Berlichingen's blood. Berlichingen had been involved in the suppression of the Poor Conrad uprising 10 years earlier, and these peasants sought vengeance. In the course of their march, they burned down the Wildenburg castle, a contravention of the Articles of War to which the band had agreed. The massacre at Weinsberg was also too much for Luther; this is the deed that drew his ire in Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants in which he castigated peasants for unspeakable crimes, not only for the murder of the nobles at Weinsberg, but also for the impertinence of their revolt. Massacre at Frankenhausen : The burning of Little Jack (Jacklein) Rohrbach, a leader of the peasants during the war, in Neckargartach. On 29 April the peasant protests in Thuringia culminated in open revolt. Large sections of the town populations joined the uprising. Together they marched around the countryside and stormed the castle of the Counts of Schwarzburg. In the following days, a larger number of insurgents gathered in the fields around the town. When M√ºntzer arrived with 300 fighters from M√ºhlhausen on 11 May, several thousand more peasants of the surrounding estates camped on the fields and pastures: the final strength of the peasant and town force was estimated at 6,000. The Landgrave, Philip of Hesse and Duke George of Saxony were on M√ºntzer's trail and directed their Landsknecht troops toward Frankenhausen. On 15 May joint troops of Landgraf Philipp I of Hesse and George, Duke of Saxony defeated the peasants under M√ºntzer near Frankenhausen in the County of Schwarzburg. The Princes' troops included close to 6,000 mercenaries, the Landsknechte. As such they were experienced, well- equipped, well-trained and of good morale. The peasants, on the other hand, had poor, if any, equipment, and many had neither experience nor training. Many of the peasants disagreed over whether to fight or negotiate. On 14 May, they warded off smaller feints of the Hesse and Brunswick troops, but failed to reap the benefits from their success. Instead the insurgents arranged a ceasefire and withdrew into a wagon fort. The next day Philip's troops united with the Saxon army of Duke George and immediately broke the truce, starting a heavy combined infantry, cavalry and artillery attack. The peasants were caught off-guard and fled in panic to the town, followed and continuously attacked by the public forces. Most of the insurgents were slain in what turned out to be a massacre. Casualty figures are unreliable but estimates range from 3,000 to 10,000 while the Landsknecht casualties were as few as six (two of whom were only wounded). M√ºntzer was captured, tortured and executed at M√ºhlhausen on 27 May. Battle of B√∂blingen The Battle of B√∂blingen (12 May 1525) perhaps resulted in the greatest casualties of the war. When the peasants learned that the Truchsess (Seneschal) of Waldburg had pitched camp at Rottenburg, they marched towards him and took the city of Herrenberg on 10 May. Avoiding the advances of the Swabian League to retake Herrenberg, the W√ºrttemberg band set up three camps between B√∂blingen and Sindelfingen. There they formed four units, standing upon the slopes between the cities. Their 18 artillery pieces stood on a hill called Galgenberg, facing the hostile armies. The peasants were overtaken by the League's horse, which encircled and pursued them for kilometres. While the W√ºrttemberg band lost approximately 3,000 peasants (estimates range from 2,000 to 9,000), the League lost no more than 40 soldiers. Battle of K√∂nigshofen At K√∂nigshofen, on 2 June, peasant commanders Wendel Hipfler and Georg Metzler had set camp outside of town. Upon identifying two squadrons of League and Alliance horse approaching on each flank, now recognized as a dangerous Truchsess strategy, they redeployed the wagon-fort and guns to the hill above the town. Having learned how to protect themselves from a mounted assault, peasants assembled in four massed ranks behind their cannon, but in front of their wagon-fort, intended to protect them from a rear attack. The peasant gunnery fired a salvo at the League advanced horse, which attacked them on the left. The Truchsess' infantry made a frontal assault, but without waiting for his foot soldiers to engage, he also ordered an attack on the peasants from the rear. As the knights hit the rear ranks, panic erupted among the peasants. Hipler and Metzler fled with the master gunners. Two thousand reached the nearby woods, where they re-assembled and mounted some resistance. In the chaos that followed, the peasants and the mounted knights and infantry conducted a pitched battle. By nightfall only 600 peasants remained. The Truchsess ordered his army to search the battlefield, and the soldiers discovered approximately 500 peasants who had feigned death. The battle is also called the Battle of the Turmberg, for a watch-tower on the field. Siege of Freiburg im Breisgau Freiburg, which was a Habsburg territory, had considerable trouble raising enough conscripts to fight the peasants, and when the city did manage to put a column together and march out to meet them, the peasants simply melted into the forest. After the refusal by the Duke of Baden, Margrave Ernst, to accept the 12 Articles, peasants attacked abbeys in the Black Forest. The Knights Hospitallers at Heitersheim fell to them on 2 May; Haufen to the north also sacked abbeys at Tennenbach and Ettenheimm√ºnster. In early May, Hans M√ºller arrived with over 8,000 men at Kirzenach, near Freiburg. Several other bands arrived, bringing the total to 18,000, and within a matter of days, the city was encircled and the peasants made plans to lay a siege. Second Battle of W√ºrzburg (1525) After the peasants took control of Freiburg in Breisgau, Hans M√ºller took some of the group to assist in the siege at Radolfzell. The rest of the peasants returned to their farms. On 4 June, near W√ºrzburg, M√ºller and his small group of peasant-soldiers joined with the Franconian farmers of the Hellen Lichten Haufen. Despite this union, the strength of their force was relatively small. At Waldburg-Zeil near W√ºrzburg they met the army of G√∂tz von Berlichingen (\\"G√∂tz of the Iron Hand\\"). An imperial knight and experienced soldier, although he had a relatively small force himself, he easily defeated the peasants. In approximately two hours, more than 8,000 peasants were killed.  Closing stages  Several smaller uprisings were also put down. For example, on 23/24 June 1525 in the Battle of Pfeddersheim the rebellious haufens in the Palatine Peasants' War were decisively defeated. By September 1525 all fighting and punitive action had ended. Emperor Charles V and Pope Clemens VII thanked the Swabian League for its intervention. Ultimate failure of the rebellion The peasant movement ultimately failed, with cities and nobles making a separate peace with the princely armies that restored the old order in a frequently harsher form, under the nominal control of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, represented in German affairs by his younger brother Ferdinand. The main causes of the failure of the rebellion was the lack of communication between the peasant bands because of territorial divisions, and because of their military inferiority. While Landsknechts, professional soldiers and knights joined the peasants in their efforts (albeit in fewer numbers), the Swabian League had a better grasp of military technology, strategy and experience. The aftermath of the German Peasants' War led to an overall reduction of rights and freedoms of the peasant class, effectively pushing them out of political life. Certain territories in upper Swabia such as Kempton, Weissenau, and Tyrol saw peasants create territorial assemblies (Landschaft), sit on territorial committees as well as other bodies which dealt with issues that directly affected the peasants like taxation. However the overall goals of change for these peasants, particularly looking through the lens of the Twelve Articles, had failed to come to pass and would remain stagnant, real change coming centuries later. Historiography Marx and Engels Friedrich Engels wrote The Peasant War in Germany (1850), which opened up the issue of the early stages of German capitalism on later bourgeois \\"civil society\\" at the level of peasant economies. Engels' analysis was picked up in the middle 20th century by the French Annales School, and Marxist historians in East Germany and Britain.Eric R. Wolf, \\"The Peasant War in Germany: Friedrich Engels as Social Historian,\\" Science and Society (1987) 51:1 pp82-92. Using Karl Marx's concept of historical materialism, Engels portrayed the events of 1524‚Äì1525 as prefiguring the 1848 Revolution. He wrote, \\"Three centuries have passed and many a thing has changed; still the Peasant War is not so impossibly far removed from our present struggle, and the opponents who have to be fought are essentially the same. We shall see the classes and fractions of classes which everywhere betrayed 1848 and 1849 in the role of traitors, though on a lower level of development, already in 1525.\\" Engels ascribed the failure of the revolt to its fundamental conservatism. This led both Marx and Engels to conclude that the communist revolution, when it occurred, would be led not by a peasant army but by an urban proletariat. Later historiography Stamp of Thomas M√ºntzer Historians disagree on the nature of the revolt and its causes, whether it grew out of the emerging religious controversy centered on Martin Luther; whether a wealthy tier of peasants saw their wealth and rights slipping away, and sought to re-inscribe them in the fabric of society; or whether it was peasant resistance to the emergence of a modernizing, centralizing political state. Historians have tended to categorize it either as an expression of economic problems, or as a theological/political statement against the constraints of feudal society. After the 1930s, G√ºnter Franz's work on the peasant war dominated interpretations of the uprising. Franz understood the Peasants' War as a political struggle in which social and economic aspects played a minor role. Key to Franz's interpretation is the understanding that peasants had benefited from the economic recovery of the early 16th century and that their grievances, as expressed in such documents as the Twelve Articles, had little or no economic basis. He interpreted the uprising's causes as essentially political, and secondarily economic: the assertions by princely landlords of control over the peasantry through new taxes and the modification of old ones, and the creation of servitude backed up by princely law. For Franz, the defeat thrust the peasants from view for centuries. The national aspect of the Peasants' Revolt was also utilised by the Nazis. For example, an SS cavalry division (the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer) was named after Florian Geyer, a knight who led a peasant unit known as the Black Company. A new economic interpretation arose in the 1950s and 1960s. This interpretation was informed by economic data on harvests, wages and general financial conditions. It suggested that in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, peasants saw newly achieved economic advantages slipping away, to the benefit of the landed nobility and military groups. The war was thus an effort to wrest these social, economic and political advantages back. Meanwhile, historians in East Germany engaged in major research projects to support the Marxist viewpoint.Tom Scott, \\"The Peasants' War: A Historiographical Review,\\" Historical Journal (1979) 22#3, pp. 693-720 in JSTOR Starting in the 1970s, research benefited from the interest of social and cultural historians. Using sources such as letters, journals, religious tracts, city and town records, demographic information, family and kinship developments, historians challenged long-held assumptions about German peasants and the authoritarian tradition. This view held that peasant resistance took two forms. The first, spontaneous (or popular) and localized revolt drew on traditional liberties and old law for its legitimacy. In this way, it could be explained as a conservative and traditional effort to recover lost ground. The second was an organized inter-regional revolt that claimed its legitimacy from divine law and found its ideological basis in the Reformation. Later historians refuted both Franz's view of the origins of the war, and the Marxist view of the course of the war, and both views on the outcome and consequences. One of the most important was Peter Blickle's emphasis on communalism. Although Blickle sees a crisis of feudalism in the latter Middle Ages in southern Germany, he highlighted political, social and economic features that originated in efforts by peasants and their landlords to cope with long term climate, technological, labor and crop changes, particularly the extended agrarian crisis and its drawn-out recovery. For Blickle, the rebellion required a parliamentary tradition in southwestern Germany and the coincidence of a group with significant political, social and economic interest in agricultural production and distribution. These individuals had a great deal to lose.Peter Blickle, The Revolution of 1525: The German Peasants War from a New Perspective (1981). This view, which asserted that the uprising grew out of the participation of agricultural groups in the economic recovery, was in turn challenged by Scribner, Stalmetz and Bernecke. They claimed that Blickle's analysis was based on a dubious form of the Malthusian principle, and that the peasant economic recovery was significantly limited, both regionally and in its depth, allowing only a few peasants to participate. Blickle and his students later modified their ideas about peasant wealth. A variety of local studies showed that participation was not as broad based as formerly thought.Tom Scott and Robert W. Scribner, eds. The German peasants' war: a history in documents (Humanities Press International, 1991).Govind P. Sreenivasan, \\"The social origins of the Peasants' War of 1525 in Upper Swabia.\\" Past & Present 171 (2001): 30-65. in JSTOR The new studies of localities and social relationships through the lens of gender and class showed that peasants were able to recover, or even in some cases expand, many of their rights and traditional liberties, to negotiate these in writing, and force their lords to guarantee them.Keith Moxey, Peasants, Warriors, and Wives: Popular Imagery in the Reformation (U of Chicago Press, 2004). The course of the war also demonstrated the importance of a congruence of events: the new liberation ideology, the appearance within peasant ranks of charismatic and military-trained men like M√ºntzer and Gaismair, a set of grievances with specific economic and social origins, a challenged set of political relationships and a communal tradition of political and social discourse.

Origins Ibn Saud's family (then known as the Al Muqrin) traced its descent to the tribe of Banu Audi and Hanifa tribes but, despite popular misconceptions, Muhammad ibn Saud was neither a nomadic bedouin nor was he a tribal leader. Rather, he was the chief (emir) of an agricultural settlement near modern-day Riyadh, called Diriyah. Furthermore, he was a competent and ambitious desert warrior. His father was Saud ibn Muhammad ibn Muqrin. Among his siblings were Mishari and Thunayan. Alliance with Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab The initial power base was the town of Ad-Diriyyah where he met Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab, who came to Muhammad ibn Saud for protection. Muhammad ibn Saud granted him entry into Diriyah. They formed an alliance in 1744 or 1745 which was formalized by the wedding of Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab's daughter to Abdulaziz, son and successor of Muhammad bin Saud. Thereafter, the descendants of Muhammad bin Saud and the descendants of Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab, the Al ash-Sheikh, have remained closely linked.

On May 21, 1856, the name of Santa Claus was accepted by the United States Post Office Department, and the first post office was opened with John Specht as its first postmaster. On June 25, 1895, the post office name was changed to the one word Santaclaus. The town's unique name went largely unnoticed until the late 1920s, when Postmaster James Martin began promoting the Santa Claus postmark. The name was changed back to Santa Claus on February 17, 1928. It was then that the Post Office Department decided there would never be another Santa Claus Post Office in the United States, due to the influx of holiday mail and the staffing and logistical problems this caused. The growing volume of holiday mail became so substantial that it caught the attention of Robert Ripley in 1929, who featured the town's post office in his nationally syndicated Ripley's Believe It or Not cartoon strip. The town's name caught the attention of Vincennes, Indiana entrepreneur Milt Harris. He created Santa's Candy Castle, the first tourist attraction in Santa Claus, Indiana, which is also purported to be the first themed attraction in the United States. Santa Claus Town and its rival Santa Claus Town attractions included a red-brick Candy Castle, sponsored by Curtiss Candy and dedicated December 22, 1935, and the Toy Village, a series of miniature fairytale buildings sponsored by prominent national toy manufacturers. Santa Claus Town led to the creation of the town's first newspaper, The Santa Claus Town News, and the Santa Claus Chamber of Commerce. Harris' project caught the attention of a rival entrepreneur, Carl Barrett, the Chicago head of the Illinois Auto Club. Disliking what he called Harris' materialism, Barrett planned his own tourist attraction: Santa Claus Park. On December 25, 1935, Barrett dedicated a 22-foot (6.7 m) tall statue of Santa Claus that was erected on the highest hill in town. The statue was promoted as being solid granite, although it was subsequently revealed to be concrete when cracks formed years later. Years of lawsuits between Harris and Barrett were costly distractions for the two entrepreneurs. The lawsuits centered around land ownership and went all the way to the Indiana Supreme Court. National news media covered the ongoing story of \\"Too Many Santas.\\" Over the years both entrepreneurs' projects became vacant and neglected.

Yuri Andropov headed the campaign in the 1970s when it began to rise. This new persecution was following upon the 1975 amendments to the 1929 anti-religious legislation and the 25th party congress. The CC resolution in 1979 would play a key role in this period as well. The intensification of anti-religious activities had continued since the early 1970s; between 1971 and 1975 over 30 doctoral and 400 magisterial dissertations were defended on the subjects of atheism and criticism of religion.Pospielovsky (1987), pp. 111-112. In 1974 there was a conference in Leningrad dedicated to 'The Topical Problems of the History of Religion and Atheism in the Light of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Scholarship'. This persecution, like other anti-religious campaigns in the USSR's history, was used as a tool to eliminate religion in order to create the ideal atheist society that Marxism‚ÄìLeninism had as a goal.Anderson (1994), p. 3. Criticism of Khrushchev's campaign After Khrushchev left office, the anti-religious campaign led under him was criticized. The same anti-religious periodicals that had participated in the campaign criticized the articles of past contributors. The anti-religious propaganda in those years was criticized for failing to understand that causes of religious of belief as well as similarly failing to understand that religion did not simply survive as a legacy of the past but that it continued to attract new people to it. It was criticized for reducing religion to simply a mass of swindling of credulous fools and failing to acknowledge the notion of faith. It was criticized for misrepresenting religious societies as being composed of evil and immoral people who were working against the Soviet Union. It was also criticized for misrepresenting believers as mentally handicapped enemies who were worthy of all contempt.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 109. It was criticized for being counter- productive, immoral (by telling lies about believers and encouraging hatred for them thereby) and for being false. The propaganda had not adequately explained why people really practiced religion nor had it given an accurate portrayal of what occurred. Many criticized it for having done more harm than good, because rather than eliminating religious belief, it instead simply pushed it underground where the state would have more difficulty trying to control it. The persecution had also attracted popular sympathy for believers, both in the USSR and abroad, as well as to increase interest in religious faith among non-believers. There were calls that atheism should not be forced down upon people, but rather should be accepted voluntarily.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 111. The anti-religious propaganda after Khrushchev employed a more moderate tone. Anti-religious propaganda The official line that believers‚Äô feelings should not be insulted continued to be widely violated in practice. The antireligious propaganda after Khrushchev was still very much influenced by the policy set down by the 21st CPSU congress in 1959.Chumachenko, p. x. The Soviet press began to sound an alarm in 1972 on account of Communist party and Komsomol members who were not only participating in religious rites, but even initiating them. The volume of anti-religious literature grew in the 1970s, partly due to a hardening general line towards religion formed as a result of more people turning to religion. The press and special conferences complained about the insufficiency of atheistic propaganda. The anti-religious education in the school system was accused of laxity. Faculties and departments were created for training atheist lecturers in the regions of Moscow, Leningrad, Lipetsk, Gorky and in the Tatar ASSR; permanent seminars existed for the same purpose in Ukraine, Moldavia and Lithuania. All of the state work, however, was found insufficient to counter the influence of religion, especially among youth, who were believed to be finding the atheistic material unconvincing and of low quality. In some areas, such as Uzbekistan, the quality of the propaganda allegedly declined. The establishment was troubled by the growing indifference and apathy among the youth for atheism as well as anti-religious propaganda.Pospielovsky (1987), pp. 116-117. The church was seen as an increasing threat, especially with regard to its historic claims of developing the Russian nation. At the same time, the anti-religious propaganda came to increasingly distinguish between the supposed loyal majority of believers and the enemies of the state who occupied the fringes of religion. The atheistic journal 'Problems of Scientific Atheism' (Voprosy nauchnogo ateizma) in the late 1970s began to question the explanation that the perseverance of religious beliefs in the USSR was simply a survival of the pre-revolutionary past. This was because the vast majority of believers were born and raised after the October revolution, as well as the fact that religion had showed surprising vitality despite the decades of efforts to stamp it out. The number of believers who were well- educated Soviet citizens (rather than uneducated and backward) was also a challenge for old theories of religion being a result of intellectual ignorance. The journal criticized the old Marxist notion that religion would die away with the disappearance of a class society. In the post-Khrushchev years, the leading anti-religious periodical ‚ÄòScience and Religion‚Äô adopted a new approach wherein it adopted a dialogue with believers by printing portions of letters to the periodical and then responding to them. Typically the periodical preferred to print believers‚Äô letters that contained assertions that were easier to argue against. For example, a believer might write a letter that argued God must have existed because many people believed in Him and they couldn't all have been wrong, and the periodical would then respond by noting that there were many cases in history wherein many people believed something that was discovered to be false, such as a flat Earth or even the pagan religions that came before Christianity.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 110. Among justifications used for not printing everything believers‚Äô wrote included the argument that believers would not print atheist material in their publications, that by doing so it would help disseminate religious propaganda and also because believers wrote things that bordered on criticism of the state. The publications that believers were permitted to print were limited to be far smaller in circulation than the atheistic propaganda, and the material that was permitted to be printed by believers was also often dictated by the state. The atheistic side possessed almost a monopoly on the media and it had relative impunity to tell lies, which believers were not permitted to expose. There continued to be criticisms of the mass of anti-religious propagandists employed by the USSR for being uneducated about religion and failing to produce effective arguments that convinced believers. However, the volume and quality of more serious critical studies of theology, church history and believers greatly increased after Khrushchev, although it retained much bias. Primitive clich√©s, insults and name-calling that had been regurgitated over and over again for decades continued to be the main method of anti-religious propaganda. A critical problem with the more serious studies was that by doing serious critiques of religion, this could be interpreted as admitting religion's respectability, which was not a view that the Ideological Commission of the CPSU Central Committee was willing to tolerate. There was a Marxist hypothesis that prehistoric primitive humans possessed no religion that was advocated as truth. The atheist propaganda argued that people turned to religion as a result of some tragedy in life, loneliness or lack of compassion from others. The anti-religious propaganda was fond of depicting kind, compassionate and good atheists, while contrasting them with believers who were depicted as fanatical, intolerant and heartless (e.g. for breaking up marriages when one partner was a non-believer). They were blamed for counterfeiting miracles and promoting anti-Sovietism. The teachings of Christianity were partly blamed for this by allegations that their teaching of humility deprived people of courage and freedom.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 112. In one instance, a female Christian writing to propagandist Osipov claimed that there was more intolerance and drinking than in previous years, and she blamed the state for provoking this. A growing interest among the Russian population in its national culture and history, including iconography and religious art, growing nationalism coupled with renewed interest in Orthodoxy as \\"Russia's church\\",Daniel. as well as a number of conversions to Christianity that began with interests in these topics, prompted the Soviet media to argue that culture and religion were not linked, and that religion had bastardized Russian art and culture. The media further argued that the religious art of previous ages (including the work of Andrei Rublev or Theopanes the Greek) was simply expressing humanistic and secular concepts through the only way that such things were permitted to be depicted. ‚ÄòScience and Religion‚Äô printed pictures of religious artwork which they interpreted according to secular values. The atheist press also criticized museum guides in religious buildings that had been converted to museums, for giving uncritical theological dimensions to what they presented, such as explaining the theology of icons and their function in the Orthodox church, explaining the theological symbolism of the liturgy, the purpose of monastic life and for uncritically explaining the lives of the saints. The press called on them to explain ‚Äòthe class character‚Äô of religion and give secular explanations of religious art and that they should emphasize the negative aspects of church history and not the positive.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 114. In a similar vein, the atheist press often published stories about episodes in Russian history that portrayed believers and the Church in a negative light in order to emphasize the point that Christian morals are deficient and that the Church is immoral. Scientific means were used to support atheism by placing holy water under a microscope and determining it to be identical to normal water, the corpses of saints were exhumed to show that they did in fact experience deterioration, while exhibits at atheist museums showed Noah's ark to be impossible even in concept due to the fact that the number of different animal species on the earth could not fit within the dimensions in Genesis.Froese (2004), pp. 35-50. The press avoided attacking the Church establishment, but directed the blunt of its attacks against actively evangelizing believers and on banned religions. The anti-religious propaganda tried to depict a connection between religious dissent and foreign intelligence services as well as with anti-communist Russian √©migr√© organizations such as NTS. Caches of religious literature confiscated by Soviet customs officials reportedly were subversive and were alleged to be widely accepted among believers. Marxist ideology held that religion was intrinsically hostile to communism, and therefore believers could not be trusted to be sensitive to the ideological threat posed from the West. They even may have felt affinities for the West, and cooperation between the Vatican or other western Christian establishments with the CIA, or the radio messages by Orthodox priests broadcast through Voice of America, also influenced the interpretation to see believers as untrustworthy. Believers were in this manner depicted as the ‚Äòweak link‚Äô in the Soviet defense line.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 116. The anti-religious propaganda cited cases of conflicts in schools involving religion, which were always blamed on the believers for continuing to hold on to religion (e.g. a schoolchild who committed suicide due to the labeling and contempt against him as a believer in the education system, and the press blamed this on his parents and priest for fostering religion in him, thus incurring the contempt). It also claimed that believers made poorer students and were less successful in academic pursuits than atheists.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 119. Professors at theological schools, and all clergy as well as laity working for the Department of External Ecclesiastical Relations of the Church were taxed similarly to all Soviet employees in recognition of their contribution to a positive Soviet image abroad. P. Kurochkin, one of the leading Soviet religiologists, argued that eliminating religion should be accompanied by a replacement with communist morality, otherwise the deprival of religion will simply be replaced with moral decline, consumerism and lechery. Revived interest in religion Furov, the CRA, vice-chairman wrote a report ca. 1975 (smuggled to the west 1979Altnurme (2002).) wherein he claimed the existence of ‚Äòirrefutable evidence‚Äô of a decline in religion in the USSR. His evidence was a decrease in Orthodox clergy from 8252 in 1961 to 5994 in 1974 (he did not cite the pre-Khrushchev figure of 30,000 in 1958). In his conclusion that this was a natural decline he did not take account for the masses of priests who were de-registered, imprisoned, executed, etc. The CRA had also during this period prevented more clergy from being registered or enrolling at seminaries.Anderson (1991), pp. 689-710. Furov's report provided a great deal of information about the church. He cited cases of people prevented from attending theological institutes including people who would have been greatly embarrassing to the state had they become clergy (e.g. children of highly placed Soviet leaders).Pospielovsky (1988), p. 166. With the slow erosion of the Church's institutional strength, the extinction of the Church as an institution seemed possible.Davis, p. xvii. Only 4% of parents attended church in 1970 and many of them did not bring their children with them. There were rumours in the late 1970s that a comprehensive scientific study was done by Pisarov that blatantly contradicted the official figures of people abandoning religion, but was never published for that reason.Pospielovsky (1987), p. 109. Many Soviet youth turned to religion,Tchepournaya (2003). and concern was expressed over this attraction, which was believed by Soviet authorities to be caused by the art, architecture and music of the Church, as well as that the church's separation from political and material power by the state had removed previously negative associations with religion. This view held that the youth saw the church as preserving a cultural-historical role that had been now purified from its ugly past.Pospielovsky (1987), p. 112. For a long period the Soviet press refused to report on this growth of religion among the youth and claims of it occurring were brushed aside as false. Readers‚Äô letters to atheist journals that stressed the reader's concern over this growth contradicted these claims. In the 1970s a special irregular publication called ‚ÄòThe World of Man‚Äô issued by the Komsomol monthly ‚ÄòThe Young Guard‚Äô (Molodaia guardiia) was created as an answer to this threat. In this journal, religion was compared with Nazism by stressing the religious components of Nazism, and it re-interpreted Russian history through distortions such as claiming that Pushkin was an atheist and claiming such things as that Gogol's mind was harmed by religious influence. It answered letters from young Komsomol who stated things like that they didn't think there was any harm in their Komsomol friends getting married in a church, and in response the publication decried the influence of religion penetrating the lives of Soviet youth. This propaganda alleged that the growing interest among youth was a plan of Western ideological subversion, Western broadcasts and Western religious organizations that smuggled religious literature into the USSR.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 117. At the June 1983 CPSU Central Committee Plenum, General Secretary KU Chernenko declared that the West was trying to cultivate religiosity in the USSR as a method of subversion. A notable example of some of the press campaign directed in response to this phenomenon was the story of Sasha Karpov published in ‚ÄòScience and Religion‚Äô. The story was designed to show that young educated Soviets who became religious were hypocrites looking for fame and distinction in originality in society, without possessing any qualities that would give them the same prestige in normal Soviet life.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 118. Sasha's mother was described as a biology teacher at a rural school, who was cold and had no warmth or interest in her children. Sasha's divorced father was an alcoholic who also did not care for his children. After Sasha's mother retired from teaching she retired to a village with a functioning Orthodox church and became a pious laywoman, telling her children that she had always been a believer, but just never didn't mention it (‚ÄòScience and Religion‚Äô failed to mention that she would have lost her teaching job if she had mentioned it). Sasha, left on his own, then decides he wants to prove himself and he attempts singing, writing poetry, and studying to become a teacher. His artistic skill proves to be poor and the latter career frightens him with its hard work and modest life, and so he instead becomes a singing hippy. He comes across a priest eventually who hires him as a church reader and singer. Six months later he then leaves the priest, but not before he gets the priest's list of acquaintances in Moscow. One of such acquaintances he travels to, and finds a couple of young physicists (husband and wife) with an apartment full of icons and Russian artifacts. They like Sasha and consider him a seeker of Truth, and he adopts their religious habits (e.g. Crossing themselves facing the icons, praying before meals, etc.) Eventually he decides to join a monastery where he is told his voice and musical talent will let him do choral singing as his monastic duty. The article stressed that Sasha wore his cassock whenever he went to visit friends and relatives in Moscow in order to shock and impress them, and that everything in life is turned into a fraud through such choices. Young people, especially if they were educated, were actively persecuted for practicing religion, and especially if they did so openly, or participated in Christian study groups or choirs. People who were part of such groups could be arrested and even placed in \\"psychiatric prisons\\". Placing the religious youth in psychiatric hospitals was based on the principle that any person who had gone through the atheistic education from kindergarten to university and yet remained religious (or even worse, if he converted), could be considered to have a kind of psychological disorder.Pospielovsky (1987), pp. 114-115. The 19th Komsomol congress in 1982 ordered all local committees 'to perfect that atheistic upbringing of the young generation, to profoundly expose the anti-scientific essence of religious ideology and morals'. It also called for a 'fuller use of the cinema, the theatre, institutions of culture and libraries for the scientific-atheistic propaganda' and to 'improve individual atheistic work with children and teenagers, especially with those stemming from religious families; recruit young teachers, pioneer and Komsomol workers for this work... Educate militant atheists, form active atheistic public opinion, do no leave without an exacting reprimand every case of the Komsomol members' participation in religious rites'.Pospielovsky (1987), p. 123. Official journals in 1982 raised more alarm about growing apathy towards Marxism and ideology among Soviet youth. This was blamed on 'bourgeois philosophers' who charged the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist ideology with responsibility for bad science, and who blamed the state for violating freedom of research and academic autonomy.Pospielovsky (1987), p. 124. The journal 'Voprosy filisofi' on the sixtieth anniversary of Lenin's 1922 article 'On the Importance of Militant Materialism' even claimed that the state's antireligious struggle was still quite weak and needed improvement. The state's allowance of expansions to existing seminaries bore fruit, and by the early 1980s, the student population at these institutions had grown to 2300 day and extramural students (it had been 800 in 1964).Pospielovsky (1987), p. 100. Soviet Statistics from the late 1960s claimed that more people were leaving the Orthodox Church to join other sects than vice versa.Lane, p. 47. There were Orthodox Christians who also formed independent communities that were separated from the official hierarchy. Illegal religions Several religions had been completely outlawed and practicing members of them could be arrested if caught. These included Eastern Catholics, Jehovah's Witnesses, Russian Jehovists, Buddhists (Buriats and Kalmuks were permitted to be Buddhists but no one else), Pentecostals and the unofficial or ‚ÄòInitiative‚Äô Baptists (Baptists who had broken from the Baptist community in 1962 because they did not accept state control of their church). Any religion that was not registered with the Soviet government was automatically considered illegal and the state could pursue a policy of open persecution of these groups (for other religions it was a hidden policy using other guises). Lack of registration resulted both from the Soviet government refusing to register certain groups and also as a result of certain groups refusing to be registered as well as to then accept some degree of Communist influence through registration. The Soviet government had an official policy that the Jehovah's Witnesses would not be persecuted if they registered with the state. At the same time Soviet propaganda constantly maligned the group as a subversive organization. A large amount of space in the anti-religious press was devoted to attacking Jehovah's Witnesses and Jehovists during the course of 1983‚Äì1985, which suggests growth in the movement in these years. At least fifteen of their activists were arrested in 1984, of which seven received prison sentences. The Russian Jehovists were a sect similar to the Jehovah's Witnesses, founded by Russian artillery captain, NS Il‚Äôinsky in the 19th century. It was characterized by its radical condemnation of all state power as the kingdom of Satan, which was a message that attracted many people in the USSR, leading to the growth in the movement.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 155. In the early history of the state, Buddhist communities had tried to reform their religion in the face of Communism. Prominent Buddhists proclaimed that Buddha lived in Lenin, and that Buddha in Lenin had founded Communism.Kolarz, p. 455. After Khrushchev, Buddhists were subjected to a wave of attacks after some Eastern bloc intellectuals converted to Buddhism. In 1972 a leading Buddhist and Tibetan scholar in the USSR, Bidia Dandaron, was arrested and sentenced to five years‚Äô hard labour. He was a secret Buddhist monk, lama and teacher and was hated by the regime for converting a number of intellectuals to Buddhism. He was charged in the press for supposedly organizing drunken orgies under the guise of religious meetings, taking bribes, cultivating adoration of himself and corrupting youth. Several of his associates and students were arrested with him. Dandaron had already spent almost twenty years in prison under Stalin, and most of the charges were thrown out in court, however, he was still given his sentence of five years. The judge at his trial claimed \\"If it were in my power I would send all religious believers to Kolyma\\". Four of his students who were active research scholars and teachers were sent to psychiatric institutions and eight other students of his lost their employment.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 156. Hindu groups in Kranoiarsk in Siberia were disbanded in 1981‚Äì1982, and their leader, E. Tretiakov, was sent to prison for ‚Äòparasitism‚Äô.Ramet, pp. 261‚Äì265. Many Soviet intellectuals found their way to Christianity by first experimenting with Eastern religions. One of the leaders of the unofficial Baptists had a campaign of character assassination against him in the press after a supposed adulterous love affair he had in Siberia, which also played upon the conclusion that the underground Baptists as a whole were immoral lechers (the press never mentioned the reason why he was in Siberia, however; he was in an administrative exile). Persecution was stepped up in the 1970s against the Initiative Baptists. The official Baptist church was treated comparatively well, with allowance of genuine debates in its congresses, and allowance to vote against decisions or candidates promoted by the state (even succeeding once in electing their own candidate instead). The official baptists were allowed to open many new churches (exceeding per capita numbers for the Orthodox). This preferential treatment was designed to strike at the baptists who had broken off in order to give them the message that there was no point in remaining in opposition. The Initiative Baptists had a position that they would accept state registration but only if it did not involve control of their religion. The Soviet government refused to accept these terms, and the group was persecuted. Initiative Baptists who tried to give religious instruction to children or organize youth groups were arrested. Eugene Pushkov, an initiative Baptist, was arrested for these and other reason in 1980, and after his release in 1983, he was asked to cooperate with the KGB as an informer, but he refused, which led to his re-arrest shortly thereafter and a sentence of four years, which he appealed, and after hearing his appeal, he was given an eight-year sentence.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 159. Many Baptists were arrested under charges of breaking the laws against performance of religious activities outside of officially recognized church structures. 202 baptists were arrested for this reason in mid-1967, of which 190 were sentenced to imprisonment. The number of initiative Baptists in the camps went from 79 in 1979, to 120 in 1981, to 165 in 1982 and to over 200 in 1984. Many of the buildings they used for prayers were destroyed. In one instance, in Chervotsy in the western Ukraine, a huge tent was raised by Initiative Baptists, which was visited by the militia. The militia forbade people to come to the tent, stating that there were land mines placed in the tent, and the tent was soon after destroyed.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 161. Malicious sadism was present in some of these closures for the Initiative Baptists as it was also present for closures for other religions. For example, in the city of Issyk in Alma-Ata province, the local government suggested to the local initiative Baptist group in 1974 that they should build a permanent house of worship, the community happily did this. In 1976, the authorities then ordered the believers to wreck the building they had constructed, which they refused to do. The state then took the opportunity to arrest the minister for breaking the law and then confiscated the building. The Baptists ran an illegal press called the Khristianin Publishers. One of their presses was found by KGB near Riga in October 1974 and those who ran it were sentenced to long terms of hard labour. Their underground publishing continued, however, and they boasted of having published nearly half a million Gospels in ten years.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 184. Fifty of their members were imprisoned in 1981, and seventy-three in 1982. A total of 165 of their members were in prison and camps by the end of 1982. The Baptists ran illegal children and youth camps for many years. The state made great efforts at trying to eliminate religious instruction to minors. George Vins, the former Council Secretary of the Initiative Baptists was imprisoned and expelled to the United States in 1979. After he left, it was alleged that he was sending instructions from the USA back through the USSR to protest Soviet legislation. P. Rumachik, another Initiative Baptist leader, was released from prison in 1977, and was alleged to have been caught by the KGB in 1980 for running clandestine printing shops. The Initiative Baptists ran underground printing presses, which greatly irritated the state. Rumachik was linked with Vins, and sentenced to five years‚Äô hard labour. This affair was further linked to an Initiative Baptist pastor named Dimitry Miniakov who was arrested in 1978 for supposed collaboration with the Germans in World War II.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 162. Pentecostals had merged with the Baptists in 1945, but when the split in the Baptists occurred in 1961‚Äì62, many Pentecostals left the official church and did not join the initiative Baptists. They became more prominent in the 1960s and 1970s, and in some areas they successfully achieved registration with the CRA, but about half of their community refused to register because of their refusal to accept Soviet bans on spreading religion to youth or children, bans on prayer meetings, as well as bans on preaching, missionary and charity work as well the practice of their key religious rites. The renegades suffered fines and arrests for breaking these rules, and they were also persecuted for refusing to take part in the Soviet military except in engineering or medical corps. They were subject to many raids and their religious literature was confiscated. In 1971 there was an incident in Chernogorsk where they were dispersed with a firehose. A number of people of German background belonged to this sect, and some of them attempted to emigrate, but were persecuted for attempting to do so. A group of such Pentecostal were tried in April 1985 for going on a hunger strike until they were allowed entry to West Germany, and their leader was sentenced to five years in a labour camp.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 163. An extremist religious group broken off from the Ukrainian Rite Catholics called Pukutnyky had appeared in the mid-1950s and was illegal. It was attacked in the press for supposedly counterfeiting signs from God that declared the end of the world, as well as for terrorizing people who left their sect by burning their houses. Eastern Rite Catholics (Uniates) had been outlawed in the USSR since 1946. After they were made illegal at that time, seven of their bishops and two thousand of their priests who refused to discontinue their tradition were sent to concentration camps or imprisoned. These churches continued to exist underground up to the fall of the Soviet Union. The state was officially opposed to these groups because of their strong association with nationalist identities. The state mercilessly persecuted them, and constantly raided their places of worship.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 157. Many eastern-rite catholic clergy were released in the 1950s following Stalin's death. Problems with regard to strong resistance to the state on account national identification with religion were found among Muslims in Central Asia.Anderson (1994), p. 9.Froese (2005). In 1924 at the Fifth Congress of the Seventh Day Adventists in Russia, the leaders of the Adventist community declared Lenin's socialism a blessing and that Lenin was a leader chosen by God; they also proclaimed their full support and dedication to Marxism. After this congress, there was a significant split in the Adventist community when a portion of the community formed what was called the ‚ÄòTrue and Free‚Äô Adventists. This breakdown was further amplified in 1928 at their congress when the leaders of the official Adventists declared it the duty of Adventists to serve in the Red Army and to bear arms. The breakaway group became subject to continual and vicious persecutions down to the fall of communism. Its leader, VA Shelkov served three sentences in prisons totally 23 years prior to his fourth and final sentence in 1979 during, which imprisonment he died. Shelkov was an excellent organizer of his underground community, and the sect continued to survive as well as to print bibles or other religious tracts, despite constant raids and imprisonments. A wave of arrests of this group occurred in 1978‚Äì1979, when the authorities unsuccessfully conducted a national search to find their printing press. The community did not have any religious buildings, but gathered in private quarters for prayers on Saturdays, which allowed this sect to keep itself hidden more easily.Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 158‚Äì159. Muslims Soviet scholars estimated that 10 to 25% of the traditional Muslim minority in the USSR were still active believers, but this was contradicted by Western observers and Soviet Islamic leaders who claimed that almost all of the traditional Muslim minority were active believers.Derwinski. In 1965 an investigation into mosque attendance in the Kazakh SSR revealed that 10% of worshippers were Komsomol members. A further study in 1985 found that 14 percent of the Uzbek Communist Party and 56 percent of the Tajik Communist Party were believing Muslims. A considerable amount of reconciliation existed between Muslims in the USSR and the state. There was support for the Soviet system in the Muslim community for adopting laws dictated by Allah through Muhammad, even though the government were atheists. Circumcisions, like Christian baptisms, were often done in secret. Sufi groups had been outlawed, and the state organized 4 bodies to oversee Islamic activities in the USSR. Three of these were for Sunni Muslims (based in Makhachkala, Tashkent and Ufa) and the fourth was for Shi'ite Muslims (based in Baku). These bodies reported directly to the CRA. A Madrasah in Bukhara as well as an Islamic Institute in Tashkent were permitted to exist and trained Islamic clergy. In great contrast to other faiths in the USSR, the Muslim clergy could leave the country in order to receive training. An example of Soviet perspective on Islam is what is written in a Soviet grammar book that had the following answers to a series of questions on Islamic practices: > Q: What does the Mullah do? A: The Mullah reads the Qur'an and when someone > dies he reads prayers. Q: What does he read about in the Qur'an? A: We do > not know. Q: Does he himself understand what he reads? A: No. Q: Does he > read the prayers for nothing? A: No, he gets money for this. In 1984 there were 1100 mosques functioning in the country, which fell far below the requirements of the population. Like other religions, large amounts of illegal underground activities took place among Muslims who operated underground presses, organized unofficial Islamic communities and pilgrimages to local holy places. The Hajj to Mecca was nearly impossible for most Soviet Muslims, and only a handful (around 60) were officially permitted to go each year and they were tasked beforehand with presenting a positive Soviet image abroad. Problems with regard to strong resistance to the state on account national identification with religion were found among Muslims in Central Asia.Anderson (1994), p. 13. The clear ethnic linkage between Islam and certain ethnic groupings made it difficult for the state to wipe out the religion due to their attacks provoking nationalist feelings among the ethnic groupings. The state tried to showcase its (supposedly) positive treatment of Muslims in propaganda campaigns in the third world in order to gain support for Soviet interests. The events of the revolution in Iran in the late 1970s as well as the growing Islamic opposition to the USSR in the war in Afghanistan, led to the USSR launching a new crackdown on Islam in its last decade, with arrests of Muslims who attempted to disseminate religious literature. Following the collapse of communism, in many Muslim areas the collapse was celebrated and Muslim leaders tried to educate the population about Islam. Orthodox sects Old Believer sects (Orthodox who had split from the Orthodox church in the 17th century) were still treated as anti- social and criminal institutions. Many distortions of them still occurred in the official press after Khrushchev. A sect called Skrytniki (concealers) led by Khristofor Zyrianov was accused of engaging in mass suicides through self- immolation in the woods of Northern Russia in the pre-war period. Zyrianov had been suspected of this at the time and was oddly given a brief sentence of administrative exile in 1932 (which may make the allegations to be probably untrue, since if he really did this, he would have been shot).Pospielovsky (1988), p. 115. A novel was published in ‚ÄòScience and Religion‚Äô supposedly based on a true story that concerned an Old Believer sect called the ‚ÄòTrue Orthodox Wanderers‚Äô. In the story, a young Moscow Komsomol girl comes under the influence of a regular Moscow Orthodox priest who sends her to an underground Siberian skete with a pious woman. There, the girls is taught to do future missionary work and to take secret monastic vows. She is treated to severe fasting, hatred of the world, despotic exploitation, banning of all literature but the bible and some theological tracts, living in a cellar without seeing the sun, absence of smiles or friendliness, and rudeness. This atmosphere was presented as an accurate depiction of life in the Old Believer sects. Eventually the girl is rescued by her Sherlock Holmes-like and heroic Komsomol friends. Often the official propaganda failed to make a distinction between these sects and the regular Orthodox church. This may have been deliberate in order to tie up the Orthodox with the supposed crimes of the sects. The Old believers attempted to have many churches reopened, but they were unsuccessful. There was a Samizdat report in 1969 that an Old Believer priest was murdered by the KGB for refusing to work for them.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 152. Roman Catholics Before the war, Catholic areas in Ukraine and in Belarus stubbornly defended their faith in the 1930s and the anti- religious institutions complained of the great influence that Catholic priests had over the local people.Kolarz, p. 202. Most Roman Catholics in the USSR lived in areas that had been annexed during World War II, which meant that most of them escaped much of the pre-war persecutions. This meant that the Catholic Church had proportionally more functioning churches and seminaries that could be attacked in the post-war persecutions than the Orthodox church. In Lithuania two of the three seminaries were closed, and the clergy was reduced from 1500 to 735 serving 628 churches. Organized persecutions developed against the Roman Catholic Church in Lithuania. Priests were harassed and imprisoned for catechesis to children, since this was considered organized religious instruction to minors (banned in 1918). Lithuanian bishops, Steponavichus and Sladkiavichus were exiled. Teachers could be fired for their religious views, and many catholic churches were demolished. The church of St Kazimir was turned into a museum of atheism, the Vilnius cathedral became an art gallery, the church of the Resurrection in Kaunas became a radio-making factory, and the Jesuit Cathedral in Kaunas became a sports hall. The Klaipeda cathedral, which had been built after many years of petitioning in 1961, was closed and confiscated.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 153. The authorities in Lithuania, as in other parts of the country, also resisted attempts to reverse Khrushchev's acts against religion. A church in the village of ≈Ωalioji, which was closed in 1963, was turned into a flour mill in 1978. The local miller, however, refused to work in it, and the mill was forced to be run only four hours a week. Petitioners failed to achieve results when they asked to re-opened.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 154. The state encountered a major problem in its campaign in Lithuania, however, because like in Poland, there was a strong national identification of the Lithuanians with the Roman Catholic Church and the persecutions received national resistance as well as publicity. Thousands of Lithuanians protested the antireligious campaign in their country. A petition of 148,149 signatures was printed as a book that was sent to Brezhnev.Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 152-153. In 1977, a petition was signed by 554 of the over 700 Roman Catholic priests in Lithuania, and the state reacted very cautiously by arresting and sentencing only a few priests among the signatories. Roman Catholicism in the Western Ukraine also put up a strong resistance to Soviet attempts to curtail it. A lack of such an atmosphere in Russia in defence of the Orthodox church allowed for the regime to pursue less tolerant positions there.Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 152-157. In areas where Catholics were only a small minority such as in Belarus or Moldova, the state found it much easier to attack their community. In Moldova, every catholic church was closed except for a small chapel in Kishinev. The priest in this church was forced to only use German or Polish during the masses, which deprived it of seeking potential converts among the local population. He was also denied permission to visit the rural communities. In the largest of such communities in Rashkovo, the church was wrecked on Christmas Day 1977 by a detachment of militia, and the religious activists who were guarding the church were temporarily arrested. Roman Catholic Bishops in Lithuania were denied the right to visit the Vatican in 1986 and Pope John Paul II was not allowed to visit Lithuania in 1987 on the 600th anniversary of the signing of the treaty of union between Lithuania and Poland which led to Lithuania's conversion.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 189. Jews By the 1980s the number of legally authorized synagogues in the Soviet Union had dropped to 50 and rabbinical training had long been stopped.Religion in Eastern Europe.\\" Department of State Bulletin 86 (1986). Samizdat In order to print their own material, believers often used ‚Äòsamizdat‚Äô (do-it-yourself press), which became increasingly widespread in the later years of the USSR. Samizdat was illegal publishing of works carried out by religious groups, dissidents, and many others who wanted to avoid the official censors. For believers this often took the form of some text from the scriptures, prayers or writings of the church fathers, which were handwritten with an attached instruction to make nine more copies and to send these copies to other addressees, or else God would punish them (and those addressees would then copy and send another nine, and so on). The state employed historical revisionism of its history, and therefore accounts of the state's crimes had to be printed in Samizdat.Haskins (2009). Some of the most popular of samizdat letters contained excerpts from the book of revelations. These letters were known about by the state (who sometimes even produced fake samizdat that was spread among believers in order to sow distrust among them) and they were viciously attacked by the atheist press, for supposedly containing all sorts of evil anti-soviet and hateful writings, as well as for being used in an inhuman manner (e.g. The journal ‚ÄòScience and Religion‚Äô reported many supposed situations where the letters arrived in the middle of a family tragedy wherein they could duplicate the letters but in agony they try to fulfill the instruction out of fear of divine punishment by getting a child to do it, who therefore becomes traumatized by being exposed to religious propaganda). Attempts to import religious literature from the West were treated as anti- Soviet subversion. Jehovah's Witness literature was treated likewise. In April 1982 five young Orthodox Christians were arrested in Moscow for having illegally possessed a Xeroxing machine that they used to print thousands of religious books and brochures, which they allegedly sold for a profit. It was disproved in court that they had made profit from the enterprise, but they were sentenced to 4 and 3 year sentences. Further searches of their associates revealed more caches of religious literature.Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 184-185. Legislative measures Two new decrees issued by the RSFSR Supreme Soviet on 18 March 1966 (219 and 220) assigned penalties of fines for people who organized religious meetings for youth and children or for failing to register a religious community, and also assigned a penalty of imprisonment for people who repeatedly violated this law.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 160. In the late 1960s most of the human rights movements in the Soviet Union developed under the slogan of defence of Soviet legality and demanded that Soviet officials respect their own laws (since the acts used in the persecutions were often technically illegal under Soviet law). Internal instructions were used as a basis for much of the persecutions, however, and they usually trumped Soviet law in practice.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 187. In 1975 the Council for Religious Affairs (CRA) was given an official legal supervision role over the church (prior to this it had unofficial control). Every parish was placed at the disposal of the CRA, which alone had the power to grant registration. It was illegal for a religious community to practice their faith without CRA approval (including public prayers, meeting together, etc.) Until a religious community was registered was the CRA, it could not practice its faith. In order to be registered it needed to submit a petition to the local government which would then send it to the CRA with its own comments and recommendations within a period of no longer than one month. The CRA, however, could take as much time as it chose before it came to the decision of registering a parish. This greatly weakened the church, which earlier had only needed to deal with local government with which it had the power to appeal. The new policy was designed to more greatly strangle the Church. This was accompanied by intimidation, blackmail and threat to the clergy, and as a whole it was meant to demoralize the Church.Pospielovsky (1987), p. 119. This legislation did, however, strengthen the church by admitting the Church's legal status to build and own secular buildings for residence or administrative use, or for the production of articles necessary for the given religious cult. The Soviet Constitution of 1977 was sometimes interpreted by authorities as containing a requirement for parents to raise their children as atheists.Pospielovsky (1987), p. 87. This had been preceded by the new family legislation in 1968 and the laws on national education in 1973. These laws maintained that it was the duty of parents to raise their children as communists and atheists. The family code allowed for courts to deprive parents of their rights over their children if they failed in this task, and the constitution implied this as well.Pospielovsky (1987), p. 117. These legal restrictions were only enforced selectively when the authorities chose to do so. The 1977 constitution in Article 124 also replaced the terminology 'freedom of antireligious propaganda' (from the old constitution) with the new phrase 'freedom of atheistic propaganda'.Ramet, p. 27. This was interpreted as a difference between a negative approach of destroying religion and a positive approach of replacing it with an atheistic culture.Pospielovsky (1987), p. 122. The CPSU Central Committee in 1979 called for the implementation of concrete measures for the escalation of atheistic education, and to 'raise the responsibility of communists and Komsomol members in the struggle against religious superstitions'.Pospielovsky (1987), p. 107. This was seen as signal to intensify anti-religious propaganda by CP organizations, the mass media, higher and secondary schools, as well as institutions of culture and scientific research. The Moscow Patriarchate successfully applied pressure in order to get revision of some of the anti-religious legislation. In January 1981, the clergy were requalified in their tax status from being taxed as a private commercial enterprise (as they were before) to being taxed as equal to that of medical private practice or private educators. This new legislation also gave the clergy equal property and inheritance rights as well as the privileges that were granted to citizens if they were war veterans. The parish lay organization of 20 persons who owned the parish was granted the status of a legal person with its appropriate rights and the ability to make contracts (the church had been deprived of this status by Lenin in 1918). For the first time in many years, religious societies could legally own their houses of worship. There was still some ambiguity left in this legislation, however, which allowed room for re-interpretation if the state wished to halt 'uncontrolled' dissemination of building new churches.Pospielovsky (1987), p. 120. The CC issued another resolution in 1983 that promised for ideological work against religion to be the top priority of party committees on all level.Pospielovsky (1987), p. 125. Religious societies were given control over their own bank accounts in 1985. This legislation in the 1980s marked a new attitude of acceptance towards religion by a state that decided that best it could do was simply to minimize the harmful impact of religion.Pospielovsky (1987), p. 121. While the state tried to intensify persecution during the 1980s, the church came to see this increasingly as merely rearguard attacks by an ideologically bankrupt, but still physically powerful, enemy,. The top party leaders refrained from direct involvement in the new offensive, perhaps due to an uncertainty over their potential success and a desire to have some manoeuvrabality according to a desire to avoid antagonizing believers too much on the eve of the millennial anniversary of Russia's conversion to Christianity. Religious bodies could still be heavily infiltrated by state agents, due to the power of local governments to reject elected parish officials and install their own people in the lay organization that owned the parish, which meant that even if they had ownership over their churches, it was still effectively in the state's hands. The largest gain of this new legislation, however, was that children of ten years of age and over could actively participate in religious ritual (e.g. service as acolytes, psalmists, in choirs) and that children of any age could be present inside a church during services as well as receive communion. Psychiatric abuse Soviet psychiatric practice considered that highly educated people who became religious believers at a mature age, especially if they came from atheist families, suffered from a psychotic disorder. This diagnosis was especially used for monks or nuns as well as for well-educated preachers. This practice allowed for popular monks and nuns (or other believers) who otherwise could not be plausibly charged with any other crime, to be removed and sent to psychiatric facilities.Ramet, p. 261.Letters from Moscow, Gleb Yakunin and Lev Regelson. Since their faith was considered to be a mental disorder, people who were given this treatment were given immediate release if they renounced their faith in God and therefore had become \\"cured\\". Particular cases of this that are known include: The religious nationalist Gennady Shimanov was interred for two and half months in 1962 in a psychiatric hospital that administered insulin shock therapy to cure him of his religious belief. He was interred again in 1969 for a few weeks after which he was released as a result of public attention of his incarceration.Suslov (2009). Fr Iosif Mikhailov of Ufa who was sent to the Kazan psycho-prison in 1972 and remained there for up to at least the last years of communism. Valeria (Makeev), a nun at the same facility from 1978 up to at least the last years of communism. She was initially accused of black-marketing (for selling religious articles to believers), but when the case for this failed to materialize, she was instead diagnosed as psychotic. Fr Lev Konin was sent to psycho-prison several times before he was expelled to the West in 1979. He had contacts with Leningrad students and had spoken at an unofficial religio-philosophic seminar of young Soviet intellectuals in Leningrad. Yurii Belov, a student of history and literature, was sent to the Sychevcka psycho-prison and was told in 1974 by a representative of the central Moscow Serbsky Institute of Forensic Medicine: ‚ÄòIn our view religious convictions are a form of pathology, hence our use of drugs‚Äô.Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 179-180. A 33-year-old doctor, Olga Skrebets with a PhD in medical sciences, was diagnosed with an early stage of schizophrenia and sent to a hospital in Kiev in 1971 after she had withdrawn from CPSU membership for religious reason.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 180. The 44-year-old Baptist, Alexander Yankovich, had engaged in unofficial writing and duplication of religious literature from 1957 to 1976. In 1976 he was arrested and declared insane. Evgenii Martynov, a thirty-five-year-old Pentecostal civil engineer was sent to the Cherniakhovski psycho-prison in 1978. Vasilii Shipilov, an Orthodox layman, was sentenced to ten years‚Äô hard labour in 1939 at the age of 17 for being a student at an underground seminary. In 1949, after his release, he roamed Siberia and proclaimed the Kingdom of God as well as criticized Stalin's abuses. He was soon rearrested and declared insane. He spent most of the period between 1950 and 1979 in psycho-prisons, where he was subject to constant beatings and mockery of his religion. A twenty-year-old history student named Galliamov was baptized when he was eighteen and had spent the summer of 1978 as a pilgrim at the few remaining monasteries. He was diagnosed a ‚Äòpsychopath of mixed type‚Äô and subjected to high doses of neuroleptics, causing him nausea, high fever and heart attacks. He was released after two months and warned by the doctor to stop visiting monasteries or else his condition might evolve into schizophrenia.Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 180-181. One of the most blatant of such cases occurred in 1976 to 25-year-old Moscow intellectual, Alexander Argentov, a neophyte Orthodox Christian from an atheistic family. He had founded the Moscow-based religio-philosophic seminar in 1974, headed by Alexander Ogorodnikov (a graduate student of cinematography that was expelled from the institute along with others for trying to produce a film about religious life among Soviet youth). This seminar declared itself the successor of the religio-philosophic societies of Moscow and Leningrad that had been dispersed in the 1920s. The seminar began to be harassed in earnest in 1976 after it had grown considerably and shown much vitality, as well as established itself in Ufa (Bashkiria), Leningrad, L‚Äôvov (Ukraine), Minsk and Grodno (Belarus). Argentov and others were arrested and locked up in psychiatric institutions. Argentov's religious belief was diagnosed as a psychotic disorder. Powerful neuroleptics were administered to him for two months before he was released after wide publicity and protests of his case which reached outside the USSR. Activities There were no radical revisions of official state policies after Khrushchev (much of his campaign was carried out under secret unpublished instructions anyway). Most of the closed churches would remain closed and none of the closed seminaries or monasteries would be reopened. Believers tried unsuccessfully to reopen many churches. In the late 1970s and into the 1980s the state did begin to allow more churches to be built and reopened. Those convinced of religious crimes in the Soviet Union were given especially harsh treatments and were classed (along with political dissidents) as \\"especially dangerous state criminals\\", which disqualified them from amnesty or leniency. Religious crimes such as circulating a petition or organizing religious classes for children could be punished with strict terms in concentration camps (assault, robbery and rape had lesser sentences in the USSR) and could not be considered for parole without a formal confession. In the entire region of Sakha-Yakutia (about half the size of the continental United States) there was only one functioning church left open after Khrushchev until the fall of communism, which meant that many believers needed to travel up to 2000 kilometres in order to get the nearest church.Davis, p. xi. The following are examples of situations known to history of these activities. In the city of Chernigov, the cathedral was closed in 1973 and only a small wooden church remained. The believers had been petitioning for a new church since 1963, but never received anything until the fall of communism. In the city of Gorky, there were only three small churches remaining to serve an estimated population of 100,000 believers (out of 40 pre-1917, when the population of Gorky was 1/15th what it was in the 1970s). The believers had been petitioning for some churches to reopened since 1967, and the petitioners were subject to professional demotions, and their demands were ignored. In the town of Naro Fominsk in the Moscow Province petitions began in 1968 to open a church. There had been no church in the vicinity of the town since the 1930s. Their petitions were ignored and given negative replies. The local atheist press claimed that no new church could be given since the existing church was going to be transformed into a museum and the press claimed there were not enough practicing Christians in the city to merit it (there were in fact 1443 signatories to the petition). The atheist press also claimed that this petition was being issued by evil people who were trying to heat up religious fanaticism and gain a cushy job at a new church. The believers presented their case in court, but were unsuccessful.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 151. A notorious church closure occurred in 1968 in the rural town of Kolyvan in the vicinity of Novosibirsk. The church of Alexander Nevsky in that town was built in the 18th century and was one of the oldest architectural monuments in the region. The local CRA plenipotentiary, Nikolaev, had been boasting for years that he would turn the church into a museum. The local fire department requested that a special water reservoir should be built next to the church to protect it from fire, and the church council complied with this request, by digging the reservoir. Shortly afterwards, the local militia declared this to be an illegal construction and confiscated the building materials from the church council so that they could not complete building the reservoir. Then the Soviet government declared the church to be unsafe due to a lack of a water reservoir, and ordered the church to be closed. In 1974, the historic church was dismantled and its pieces were sold. The local community tried to continue having services without a priest in the watchman's house in the church yard, but this was met with harassment and short arrests of the organizers. Nikolaeve eventually agreed to give them a twenty square-metre basement to hold services for their congregation of 200.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 147. Another notorious closure occurred in 1979 in the town of Rechitsa in Belarus. The church was too small for the congregation and they requested to enlarge it. They received permission and began to do construction at their own expense. Once they finished the expansion, the building was declared a fire hazard and closed, militia guards were placed in front of it to prevent believers from using it. An 18th-century church in the village of Mshany in Lvov diocese was closed in March 1978 and turned into grain storage. In 1979, believers surrounded the church and tried to physically prevent grain from being stored in the church. The militia was dispatched to disperse them and one woman was arrested. The believers launched unsuccessful petitions on behalf of the church. In the village of Znosychy near Rovno in Volhynia, there was a church that had been deprived of a priest for several years, and which had been taken care of by its congregation who also gathered there for prayers. In 1977 the authorities tried to demolish the church but were stopped by resistance from the local community, and instead they tried to store grain inside the church. In response, the local village went on strike, and the authorities decided to remove the grain. On 25 April 1979 the entire population of Znosychy was ordered to work in an adjacent village, while the children were locked up in school, and during this time the church was demolished. Afterwards, believers began to gather at the site of the former church for prayers and pilgrims would come to the village. The authorities responded by putting up patrols and barriers around the village to prevent visitors. The believers also began to decorate pine trees around the church and pray under them. The authorities responded by cutting down the trees.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 148. In two other villages in Rovno, the local population tried to reopen churches closed under Khrushchev. In one of these in 1973, while the believers were at work, the authorities dismantled the domes and stored grain in the church. The population protested furiously and the grain was removed. In 1978, after years of complaints, an official commission arrived to investigate, but they were told that believers were a tiny minority in the area by the local authorities and the commission left. In the other village, in 1973 the believers made vain appeals to re-open their churches, but they were told in reply to go to another town for services. In the autumn of 1978, a CRA representative came and promised to give them their church back, and in the meantime the local authorities asked the villagers to sign a pledge not to let their pigs roam the village streets. The villagers signed the document without reading it, and it turned out to be pledge that no one wanted a church in the village. The document was then used by the district authorities to justify their refusal to accept any more pleas to reopen the church.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 149. Many more examples beyond these exist. In 1983 at least over 300 of all religions were in some sort of imprisonment solely for practicing their faith. Other estimates are far higher and this figure does not include the masses of believers who were subject to administrative harassment and persecutions from day to day. These figures of course are little in comparison, however, with what occurred earlier in the USSR's history. These persecutions could result from acts of charity (which were still illegal according to the 1929 legislation). Such illegal acts of charity could include bishops who secretly gave money to poorer parishes that could not pay for their repairs, clergy and parish staff who gave money to poor parishioners, giving money to parishioners who suffered loss of homes from fires, or believers giving public dinners to people, including pilgrims.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 164. They could result from group pilgrimages to holy places (which was also still illegal). These pilgrimages were subjected to very brutal attacks by militia and Komsomol voluntary aides leading to physical injuries and the state claimed that they were organized by either fanatic believers or opportunists trying to make income. Persecutions could also result from either worship or performance of religious rites in private dwellings, or doing it in churches without reporting them to the state. There was official pressure against people getting baptism and there were often practical difficulties of obtaining a baptism in areas without churches.Lane, p. 44. Few couples had traditional Christian marriage ceremonies. Religious rites were sometimes done secretly in order to protect believers from harassment at work or in school, since the record books that churches had to keep were regularly inspected by the KGB. The state reported that such activities were done by priests who were trying to earn extra income from unrecorded donations. This paradigm was cited by Feodosii, the former bishop of Poltava in his 1977 letter to Brezhnev where he stated that most adults who converted to Orthodoxy went to retired priests for baptisms, because they could perform baptisms without having to enter the names of the newly baptized into the registry. The provincial CRA official found out about this and demanded that every baptismal candidate be reported, after which CRA agents would attempt to create many problems at the candidate's place of work or study in order to dissuade him from receiving baptism. The Bishop refused to cooperate with this.Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 164-165. The Komsomol was still engaged in vandalism of churches and harassment of believers during this period (as it was during the 1930s when it was also criticized for laxity). Priests and bishops who did not completely subordinate themselves to the state and/or who engaged in religious activities outside of the routine performance of religious rites, were considered to be enemies of the state. Bishops criticized for 'high religious activity' were moved around the country. The Council for Religious Affairs claimed to have gained control of the Patriarch's Synod, which was forced to co-ordinate its sessions and decisions with the CRA.Pospielovsky (1987), p. 113. The widespread persecution of clergy under Khrushchev was replaced with a more selective persecution of simply the most dedicated priests, especially if they attracted young people, or offered pastoral guidance. The CRA had a policy to appoint priests who were not wanted, and the state continued to find means to shut down churches. At the same time, however, the CRA claimed that the church's position was improving under newly passed legislation. The church hierarchy could have no disciplinary powers. While the state allowed for freedom of sermons and homilies, this freedom was limited in that they could only be of an 'exclusively religious character' (in practice this meant that clergymen who preached against atheism and the state ideology were not protected).Pospielovsky (1987), pp. 117-118. All of the anti-religious legislation was designed to make the church as passive as possible. Lukewarm clergy were tolerated while clergy with a missionary zeal could be deregistered. This was in accordance both with Lenin's teaching that immoral or even criminal priests should be preferred over active and popular ones, and it was also in accordance with a secret 1974 CRA resolution ‚ÄòOn the State of Supervision over the Activities of the Theological Educational Establishments of the Russian Orthodox Church‚Äô in which it was resolved to study seminary candidates, to take measures to prevent ‚Äòfanatical‚Äô (i.e. actively religious) people from entering seminaries as teachers or students, to elevate the sense of citizenship among teachers and students, as well as to enhance political education for teachers and students so as to give them ‚Äòprofound patriotic convictions‚Äô. A massive number of cases could be cited of clergy who were persecuted for being dedicated priests. Examples include: Vasilii Boiko, a young Kiev priest, lost his position as the choir director at the Virgin Mary Protection church in Kiev for organizing a youth choir, consisting of recent converts and reverts. The choir was disbanded and he was sent as a reader to a provincial church. Zdriliuk, a young Kiev engineer and convert to Orthodoxy, was privately ordained a priest after passing theological examinations. Three years after his ordination he was de-registered following a police search of his house that revealed a cache of religious literature as well as his distribution of such literature to believers.Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 170-171. Paganism was reported to have re-appeared in areas where the church had been eliminated.Pospielovsky (1987), pp. 115-116. Cases of less preferential treatment occurred in the cases of believers who had greater educational or professional levels. Party members, administrative personnel of the high and middle executive categories, teachers and professors of all types, army officers and personnel of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and other such people would incur direct persecution for baptizing their children. Often they had to find priests who would agree to do perform the sacrament secretly.Pospielovsky (1987), p. 114. Peasants and workers rarely suffered the same degree of consequences for engaging in religious activities. The uneducated and elderly in the post-Khrushchev years were generally left alone. Almost no new clerical ordinations were allowed in Ukraine during this period. There were bans on home-educated candidates as well. Unsuccessful candidates to seminaries anywhere in the country could face all sorts of harassment and persecution. Archbishop Feodosii reported in his account that he refused to cooperate with the local plenipotentiary when the latter wanted to close churches, and after this he was transferred to the north-Russian diocese of Vologda where there was only 17 open churches. The Archbishop listed a number of direct and indirect persecutions employed by the CRA almost daily. Included among such things were methods like him being attacked for sending priests to replace sick priests during a Sunday liturgy without permission, and temporarily depriving the replacement priest of registration. Attempts to replace structures falling into dilapidation with better ones resulted in the new brick structures being torn down by militia and komsomol. The Bishop was criticized for supporting petitions to Moscow. He also cited CRA pressure to raise peace fund contributions and historical monuments contribution, from 36,210 roubles in 1968 to 161,328 roubles in 1976 (while the diocese only received 124,296 roubles in donation). Parishes had to increase their donations in order to meet this, and eventually the diocese fell into debt. This resulted in more parishes being closed for lack of funds.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 170. Harassment of pilgrims and monasteries increased in the early 1980s. Notable atrocities and victims Two priests named Nikolai Eshliman and Gleb Yakunin received worldwide fame after issuing a brave memoranda to the Soviet government and to Patriarch Alexii in 1965, which protested the persecution, the forced closure of churches and the inactivity of the Patriarchs and bishops in defending the church. Shortly afterwards the atheist press conducted a campaign of character assassination. They claimed that Yakunin had become a priest for purely pecuniary reasons. Yakunin and Eshliman had, like many other Christian evangelists in the USSR, attempted to acquire illegal religious publications, including from the west. This fact allowed the state to then brand the men as well laity connected with them as criminals, black-marketeers and even being connected with Western intelligence services (who were allegedly sending religious and theological literature into the USSR for purposes of ideological subversion). On 15 November 1966, the church of the Holy Trinity was demolished in Leningrad. A notable case was reported in Samizdat documents concerning Vladimir Rusak (a.k.a. Vladimir Stepanov), a Russian Orthodox deacon and a graduate of the Moscow Theological Academy who had worked as one of the editors of the Journal of Moscow Patriarchate. In 1980 he complete a manuscript about the history of the Russian church under the Soviet Union, which was critical of the state. His immediate superior, Archbishop Pitirim, discovered this and ordered him to destroy it, but he refused, and he was sent to Vitebsk in Belarus to serve a church there. On 28 March 1982 he gave a sermon at a Passion service on the Passion of Christ and the suffering of the church in the world, and he claimed that a persecuted Church was spiritually stronger and closer to God than a triumphant Church, and in this context he condemned the post-Constantine legacy of national and state churches, and he praised the Bolshevik Revolution for having once again raised persecution against the Church, which therefore purified the Church of all but those who were truly dedicated to it. In the same sermon he discussed the persecutions of the state and condemned the hierarchy for disowning the martyrs, to whom he claimed the Church owed its survival. He told the parishioners not to lose heart in the wake of the atheist persecution, and that one should not expect both an easy life on earth and a reward in heaven. After this sermon, he was de-registered and sent to a monastery, and his superiors said they could do nothing to help because of KGB pressure upon them. He was recommended to get a secular job, because there was no longer any position in the church that would be allowed to him.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 168. Fr Dimitry Dudko was a popular preacher and catechist in Moscow, who prepared hundreds of adults for baptism. He began to hold question-and-answer sessions instead of regular sermons at this church, and this made him very popular among people but very unpopular among the authorities. He was one of the most influential religious dissidents of the time. Under their pressure he was forced to be removed in 1973 to the rural parish of Kabanovo, eighty kilometres outside of Moscow. Foreigners who visited his church in Moscow could not go to that area, but many people began flocking to his new church. In December 1975 the local soviet forced the church council to dismiss Fr. Dimitry from this parish, and thereafter he was transferred to another rural parish in the vicinity of Moscow. At that parish he began to create a well- knit church community and published a mimeographed bulletin (the first time this was used in Russia since the 1920s). In his writings and sermons he attacked atheism and blamed it for moral decline and rising alcoholism. In January 1980 he was arrested and within six months he appeared on state TV with a speech of apology wherein he condemned his past behaviour. The state magnanimously forgave him and allowed him to return to his pastoral duties, and much of his previous following deserted him.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 171. Fr Vasilii Romaniuk of the village of Kosmach in the Carpathians was criticized for organizing illegal carol-singing youth groups and visiting believers‚Äô homes during Christmas-time. The CRA claimed that he was trying to earn extra money through donations. Four years after this, he was arrested and given 10 years in jail, a labour camp and enforced internal exile for appending his signature on behalf of a Ukrainian nationalist named Valentyn Moroz. He has been sentenced in 1944 to ten years of hard labour in Siberia. He attended pastoral courses and was ordained a deacon in 1959, but the local CROCA plenipotentiary refused to allow him ordination to the priesthood. In 1964, he became a priest, and acquired a good reputation among believers as well as a bad reputation among the authorities, the latter of which harassed him continually. He was forced to change six parishes, before being arrested in 1972 for the aforementioned crime involving Moroz.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 172. Fr Pavel Adelgeim was arrested in December 1969 in Kagan in Uzbekistan where he served as rector of the only local Orthodox church. He was accused of having attracted children and teenagers to the church. He was also accused of being a sadist who beat his wife and the young girls who came to his church. He had produced writings that criticized the legal status of religion in the USSR, criticizing the official ideology, and he had also had contacts with Eshliman and Yakunin. He was sentenced to three years hard labour, and he lost one of his legs during his time in the camp. After his release he became priest in the Uzbek town of Fergana. The previous pastor of the church he came to had been expelled by the parishioners for corruption with parish finances, inappropriate observation of religious rituals and other problems. The CRA, however, thought that this priest should remain and the more popular Fr Pavel was deprived of his registration in order to replace him.Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 172-173. Gleb Yakunin, a famous priest who had gathered information on persecutions that he sent to Western journalists and churches in the West, was arrested in 1979 for anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda; he was sentenced to five years in a strict regime labour camp followed by another five years of internal exile. His position on the unofficial committee that was sending these reports was inherited by Fr Vasilii Fonchenkov and Fr Nikolai Gainov, the latter of whom lost his teaching position at the Moscow theological academy and was soon after transferred to a rural parish outside of Moscow, which made his work on the committee impossible. This committee, while organized by Orthodox priests, sent reports on behalf of all Christians in the USSR.Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 173-174. Fr Alexandr Pivovarov, a very popular and dedicated Siberian priest, was arrested in 1983 and given a -year sentence for distributing free religious literature, which he had acquired from secret Christian printers who were also arrested and sentenced.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 174. Fr Pavel (Lysak) was expelled from the Moscow Theological Academy at the Trinity St Sergius Monastery in 1975. He was also deprived of residence rights in Moscow province, where many of his spiritual children lived. Soviet law allowed him to visit Moscow on three-day visits, and he took full advantage of this, but neighbours of the apartment that he lived at in Moscow were intimidated by the KGB to denounce him in such a way that he could be found guilty of breaking the law, and in 1984 he was arrested and sentenced to ten months in a labour camp.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 175. One of the most appalling cases was reported to have occurred in the summer of 1983 in the Caucasus sixty kilometres outside of Sukhumi where an unregistered monastic community was discovered and dispersed. Eighteen of the monks, however, hid themselves in a narrow cave and continued their community. The authorities brought barrels filled with an incendiary mixture, dumped them at the mouth of the cave and set them on fire, so that the eighteen were burned to death. Fr Nikolai Ivasiuk, in the city of Chardzhou in Turkmenistan, was found murdered on 17 December 1978. His hair was torn out, his eyes were removed, his body had been burned and there were knife wounds as well as carvings on him. The previous night believers reported having seen a car pull up with six militiamen leaving the car and entering the house. The murderers were not found in any following investigation.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 178. In Vilnius in Lithuania, a very popular Catholic priest named Bronius Laurinaviƒçius was reportedly thrown by four men onto a thoroughfare where he was killed by an approaching truck. Less than a year later, a lay dissident activist, Valeri Smolkin was told by the KGB to emigrate or else he would share Bronius‚Äô fate. In October 1981 at the Holy Virgin Protection Convent in Kiev, on the patronal feast day when there were masses of pilgrims, there was a police raid.Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 175-176. This convent was often subject to such harassment and administrative fines, and police raids often came to capture overnight pilgrims. The famous Pskov Monastery of the Caves was successfully infiltrated by the KGB when their informer Gavriil became abbot of the monastery after the death of his predecessor. Gavriil then began throwing out pilgrims, harassing revered monks for giving counsel or hearing confession, and he forbade group prayers. The Patriarch received many complaints about him and ordered his removal, but the Soviet Government rescinded the order and insisted he remain in place. Gavriil in 1983 was reported for having conducted violent beatings of the monks and pilgrims.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 177. The Trinity St Sergius Lavra in Zagorsk had forty of their monks expelled between 1975 and 1980. These monks were popular among pilgrims as spiritual advisors and confessors, which led to their expulsion. Of all of the monastic communities, however, the Pochaev Lavra continued to suffer some of the worst persecutions to be reported. The Soviets had granted permits to very few novices to enter this monastery in order to keep down the number of the monks. In 1979 the monastery launched a petition to request the return of the land that had been confiscated under Khrushchev, as well as to let it accept more novices. The confiscated land had been turned into a museum of atheism and a polyclinic. The authorities responded to this petition by launching more searches and expulsions of pilgrims as well as the expulsion of ten novices. The highly revered spiritual father Amvrosii was expelled in 1981, and his library, which contained samizdat and religious literature, was investigated by the KGB. This was followed by the arrest of more monks, one of whom, Archimandrite Alimpi, was beaten to death, and another named Pitirim became mentally ill as a result of beatings.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 176. The aforementioned Argentov seminar continued to be harassed after its leadership was sent to psychiatric institutions. The new chairman Alexander Ogordnikov was forced to resign his janitor's job after it was discovered he had used his janitor's hut for seminar meetings. The authorities prevented him from getting a new job, and in 1979 he was arrested and sentenced to one year's hard labour for parasitism. While he was still at the camp at the end of his term, he was re-tried and accused of anti-Soviet propaganda; he was sentenced to an additional six years‚Äô hard labour followed by another five years of internal exile.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 182. The seminar increased in popularity and numbers, however. It expanded to Kazan, Odessa and Smolensk after Ogordonikov's arrest. In February 1979 there was a joint conference of the Leningrad and Moscow seminars. The regime reacted with various forms of unofficial harassment, including a severe anonymous beating of one of its members. This was followed by numerous KGB warnings, raids, termination of jobs and temporary arrests of the whole membership. Tat‚Äôiana Shchipkova, a professor of French and Latin at the Smolensk Pedagogical Institute and the seminar's representative in Smolensk, lost her teaching position in July 1978 and several who had attended the seminar who were students were expelled. She was deprived of her doctoral degree by the end of August 1978 on political grounds. In January 1980 she was sentenced to three years‚Äô hard labour after she had slapped a Komsomol member on the face during a raid of a seminar meeting. Other notables arrests included Sergei Ermolaev and Igor Poliakov who were sentenced respectively to four and three-and-a-half-years‚Äô hard labour in September 1979 for shouting anti-Soviet slogans. In April 1980, member Viktor Popkov and Vladimir Burtsev were sentenced to eighteen months‚Äô hard labour for allegedly counterfeiting documents. Shortly afterwards, seminar leader Vladimir Proesh was sentenced to five years‚Äô hard labour in strict regime camps followed by three years of internal exile. Just before his term ended, he was given an additional three years‚Äô labour camp in October 1983. This long series of arrests resulted in the seminar being effectively shut down.Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 182-183. The 53-year-old writer and journalist, Zoia Krakhmal‚Äônikova was a former member of the Soviet Union of Writers. She had converted to Orthodoxy as an adult and published religious samizdat. She published excerpts of the writings of the Church Fathers as well as modern Orthodox theologians, articles by converts, excerpts from the lives of the saints, and post-1917 Russian religious writing. There was very little political element in her writing beyond short biographical notes of people who had been killed by the Soviets. She was arrested and tried on 4 August 1982 and put on trial on 1 April 1983 after a long series of investigations. She was sentenced to one year in prison, followed by five years of internal exile under surveillance.Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 185-186. A baptist named Valerii Barinov wrote and recorded a Christian rock opera entitled ‚ÄòThe Trumpet Call‚Äô around 1982. In January 1983, he and his friend Sergei Timokhin sent a petition to be able to give legal religious concerts. In response, the Soviet press launched a campaign of character assassination. In March 1984, the two were detained in Murmansk and accused of trying to cross the border to Scandinavia. Barinov was sentenced to two and a half years‚Äô hard labour. Barinov declared a hunger strike and requested either emigration or to be declared innocent. The authorities force-fed him. He was released in September 1986.Pospielovsky (1988), p. 186. In 1985, 'The Trumpet Call' was translated into English and re-recorded by British bass guitarist Dave Markee under the moniker The Dave Markee Band. The album was released in the U.S. on Fortress Records, a division of the Christian rock label Refuge Records.liner notes, The Trumpet Call by The Dave Markee Band 1985, Fortress Records R84012 As of this writing, clips from that recording are available for listening at YouTube's web site. The millennium In the years leading up to the 1988 millennial anniversary of Russia's conversion to Christianity, the church and the state fought over the meaning of the event and the role of the Church in Russia's history as well as culture. The state returned some of the most valued of religious sites in the country to the Church as a gesture of goodwill (such as the ancient monastery of St Daniel in Moscow that had been used as a juvenile prison, a warehouse and a factory, with the church sanctuaries deliberately used as public lavatories; the church would pay 5 million rubles to rebuild it).Pospielovsky (1987), p. 126. A campaign ran through the media that the Church had no legitimate claim to being the source or champion of Russian culture and the development as well as survival of the Russian nation. This was a painful subject for Soviet propaganda, due to the USSR's own poor historical record as well as its wholesale destruction of cultural monuments, churches, monasteries and other elements of Russia's heritage. The media, however, nevertheless presented the Soviet state as a champion of the preservation of old cultural and historical monuments, and condemned acts of vandalism against them. The media accused the Church of capitalizing on the anniversary in order to attract attention. Soviet writers and academics tried to downplay the old thesis that the Slavs had little culture prior to Christianization, and they tried to promote the pagan culture of the country before Christianization as already developed. The 988 date was also downplayed by claiming that the Christianization of the country occurred over a few centuries and that that date was simply when Prince Vladimir forcibly baptized the Kievites. It was also downplayed by inventing (out of thin air) that the city of Kiev had its 1500th anniversary which was celebrated in 1980‚Äì82.Pospielovsky (1987), p. 127. They blamed Christianity for freezing Russian culture and that Christianity destroyed the cultural heritage of antiquity. The pre-Christian Kievan state was presented as a world power that benefitted little from Byzantium's influences. Ivan the Terrible was presented as inspired by Christian theology. It was denied that Christianity had introduced monogamy. The role of monasticism in Russia's history was belittled and blackened. They blamed the Church for a reactionary role in the development of secular culture. The church was also criticized for an alleged lack of patriotism as well as collaboration with invaders of Russia. Russian history was re-written accordingly in order to fit this argument with regard to the Tatars, Poles and Germans. Good facts in favour of the Church were ignored, while largely only the negative facts were emphasized. The church was accused of misinforming people of the past, and church historians and theologians could be held criminally responsible.Pospielovsky (1987), p. 129. The Church's role in history was admitted to be significant, but only in that it was used to strengthen the oppressing classes by teaching the masses to be docile. It was admitted to be progressive only in that it helped progress the supposedly feudal society of Kievan Russia as long as feudalism was a progressive force.Pospielovsky (1987), pp. 130‚Äì131. Conclusion By 1987 the number of functioning churches in the Soviet Union had fallen to 6893 and the number of functioning monasteries to just 18. The Church and the government remained on unfriendly terms until up to the fall of communism. In practice, the most important aspect of this conflict was that openly religious people could not join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which meant that they could not hold any political office. However, among the general population, large numbers remained religious. In 1987 in the Russian SFSR, between 40% and 50% of newborn babies (depending on the region) were baptized and over 60% of all deceased received Christian funeral services. Arrests and persecution of believers continued under Gorbachev, although some who had been arrested previously were released. The volume of antireligious propaganda did not decrease under Gorbachev in contrast to the general Soviet literary and cultural scene. This received reprimands from the party ideological department as well as a counter-campaign in the antireligious press wherein such writers were criticized. Gorbachev's government reversed the pattern of his predecessors, however, with regard to creating a fund to protect and restore historical monuments including religious monuments and to educate the nation in a spirit of love and respect for its national history and culture. At the chair of this fund, a practicing Christian was placed and he was permitted to defend Christian culture and the positive role of the Church in the nation's history. Historic accounts of the state's many crimes against religious believers were allowed to be openly published in the final years of the USSR. Another breakthrough that occurred in the final years was the allowance of Christians to respond to atheist attacks in the press, and some Christian writers took the opportunity to criticize the atheist propagandists in the national media. In the national media some articles were printed that argued the decline of Soviet society resulted from a loss of the traditional family, which was held together by Christian ethics and traditions.Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 191-192. He also adopted a new religious policy in the last years of the Soviet regime as a result of his own pragmatism, the need for international support and his desire to gain more supporters.

It supports the separation of religion and state. Moreover, secular liberals are usually advocates of liberal democracy and the open society as models for organising stable and peaceful societies. Secular liberalism stands at the other end of the political spectrum from religious authoritarianism, as seen in theocratic states and illiberal democracies. It is often associated with stances in favour of social equality and political freedom.  Description  Being secularists by definition, secular liberals tends to favour secular states over theocracies or states with a state religion. Secular liberals advocate separation of church and state in the formal constitutional and legal sense. Secular liberal views typically see religious ideas about society, and religious arguments from authority drawn from various sacred texts, as having no special status, authority, or purchase in social, political, or ethical debates. It is common for secular liberals to advocate the teaching of religion as a historical and cultural phenomenon, and to oppose religious indoctrination or lessons which promote religion as fact in schools. Among those who have been labelled as secular liberals are prominent atheists like Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Ayaan Hirshi Ali, and Sam Harris. The label of \\"secular liberal\\" can sometimes be confusing as to what it refers to. While the term secular can sometimes be used as an adjective for atheists and non- religious people, chiefly in American usage, in British English it is more likely to refer to people who are secularists, which is to say, people who believe in keeping religion and government apart. The atheist writer Richard Dawkins can be categorised under both definitions, while the British Muslim liberal commentator Maajid Nawaz only meets the latter. In a modern democratic society, a plurality of conflicting doctrines share an uneasy co-existence within the framework of civilization.  Contemporary application   Arab Spring  Secular liberalism is sometimes connected with the Arab Spring protests. One commentator labels it as a \\"secular liberal fantasy\\". Others have labeled the motivations behind it, and the temporary governments created as a result as secular liberalism. Oftentimes, participation in the newly crowned democratic governments by the Muslim clerics are ignored in favor of the protesters' secular liberal ideas. Since 2011, more residents of the Middle East have been demanding a greater say in the running of their governments. They want democracy to appear in a uniquely Muslim fashion rather than through some artificial \\"secular\\" movement.  Criticism  The Vatican and the Moscow Patriarchate are waging a common fight against secular liberalism; claiming that this idea violates the traditional Christian concepts of family and human values by exposing people to medico-biological experiments that are incompatible with their ideas of human dignity. The Primate of the Russian Orthodox Church expressed concern over trends in some Protestant communities towards liberalizing theology and Christian morals; he claims them to be products of secular liberalism. The First Amendment of the United States Constitution, offering freedom of speech, has been criticized in a 2004 political manifesto by David Fergusson entitled Church, state and civil society.

However, it may also include health equality, economic equality and other social securities. Social equality requires the absence of legally enforced social class or caste boundaries and the absence of discrimination motivated by an inalienable part of a person's identity. For example, sex, gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, origin, caste or class, income or property, language, religion, convictions, opinions, health or disability must absolutely not result in unequal treatment under the law and should not reduce opportunities unjustifiably. Equal opportunities is interpreted as being judged by ability, which is compatible with a free market economy. Relevant problems are horizontal inequality ‚àí the inequality of two persons of same origin and ability and differing opportunities given to individuals ‚àí such as in (education) or by inherited capital. Ontological The standard of equality that states everyone is created equal at birth is called ontological equality. This type of equality can be seen in many different places like the United States Declaration of Independence. This early document, which states many of the values of the United States of America, has this idea of equality embedded in it. It clearly states that \\"all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\\". The statement reflects the philosophy of John Locke and his idea that we are all equal in certain natural rights. Although this standard of equality is seen in documents as important as the Declaration of Independence, it is \\"one not often invoked in policy debates these days\\". However this notion of equality is often used to justify inequalities such as material inequality. Dalton Conley claims that ontological equality is used to justify material inequality by putting a spotlight on the fact, legitimated by theology, that \\"the distribution of power and resources here on earth does not matter, because all of us are equally children of God and will have to face our maker upon dying\\". Dalton Conley, the author of You May Ask Yourself, claims that ontological equality can also be used to put forth the notion that poverty is a virtue. Luciano Floridi, author of a book about information, wrote about what he calls the ontological equality principle. His work on information ethics raises the importance of equality when presenting information. Opportunity Another standard of equality is equality of opportunity, \\"the idea that everyone has an equal chance to achieve wealth, social prestige, and power because the rules of the game, so to speak, are the same for everyone\\". This concept can be applied to society by saying that no one has a head start. This means that, for any social equality issue dealing with wealth, social prestige, power, or any of that sort, the equality of opportunity standard can defend the idea that everyone had the same start. This views society almost as a game and any of the differences in equality standards are due to luck and playing the \\"game\\" to one's best ability. Conley gives an example of this standard of equality by using a game of Monopoly to describe society. He claims that \\"Monopoly follows the rules of equality of opportunity\\" by explaining that everyone had an equal chance when starting the game and any differences were a result of the luck of the dice roll and the skill of the player to make choices to benefit their wealth. Comparing this example to society, the standard of equality of opportunity eliminates inequality because the rules of the games in society are still fair and the same for all; therefore making any existing inequalities in society fair. Lesley A. Jacobs, the author of Pursuing Equal Opportunities: The Theory and Practice of Egalitarian Justice, talks about equality of opportunity and its importance relating to egalitarian justice. Jacobs states that: at the core of equality of opportunity... is the concept that in competitive procedures designed for the allocation of scarce resources and the distribution of the benefits and burdens of social life, those procedures should be governed by criteria that are relevant to the particular goods at stake in the competition and not by irrelevant considerations such as race, religion, class, gender, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or other factors that may hinder some of the competitors‚Äô opportunities at success. (Jacobs, 10). This concept points out factors like race, gender, class, etc. that should not be considered when talking about equality through this notion. Conley also mentions that this standard of equality is at the heart of a bourgeois society, such as a modern capitalist society, or \\"a society of commerce in which the maximization of profit is the primary business incentive\\". It was the equal opportunity ideology that civil rights activists adopted in the era of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. This ideology was used by them to argue that Jim Crow laws were incompatible with the standard of equality of opportunity. Condition Another notion of equality introduced by Conley is equality of condition. Through this framework is the idea that everyone should have an equal starting point. Conley goes back to his example of a game of Monopoly to explain this standard. If the game of four started off with two players both having an advantage of $5,000 dollars to start off with and both already owning hotels and other property while the other two players both did not own any property and both started off with a $5,000 dollar deficit, then from a perspective of the standard of equality of condition, one can argue that the rules of the game \\"need to be altered in order to compensate for inequalities in the relative starting positions\\". From this we form policies in order to even equality which in result bring an efficient way to create fairer competition in society. Here is where social engineering comes into play where we change society in order to give an equality of condition to everyone based on race, gender, class, religion etc. when it is made justifiable that the proponents of the society makes it unfair for them. Sharon E. Kahn, author of Academic Freedom and the Inclusive University, talks about equality of condition in their work as well and how it correlates to freedom of individuals. They claim that in order to have individual freedom there needs to be equality of condition \\"which requires much more than the elimination of legal barriers: it requires the creation of a level playing field that eliminates structural barriers to opportunity\\". Her work talks about the academic structure and its problem with equalities and claims that to \\"ensure equity...we need to recognize that the university structure and its organizational culture have traditionally privileged some and marginalized other; we need to go beyond theoretical concepts of equality by eliminating systemic barriers that hinder the equal participation of members of all groups; we need to create and equality of condition, not merely an equality of opportunity\\". \\"Notions of equity, diversity, and inclusiveness begin with a set of premises about individualism, freedom and rights that take as given the existence of deeply rooted inequalities in social structure,\\" therefore in order to have a culture of the inclusive university, it would have to \\"be based on values of equity; that is, equality of condition\\" eliminating all systemic barriers that go against equality. Outcome A fourth standard of equality is equality of outcome, which is \\"a position that argues each player must end up with the same amount regardless of the fairness\\". This ideology is predominately a Marxist philosophy that is concerned with equal distribution of power and resources rather than the rules of society. In this standard of equality, the idea is that \\"everyone contributes to society and to the economy according to what they do best\\". Under this notion of equality, Conley states that \\"nobody will earn more power, prestige, and wealth by working harder\\". When defining equality of outcome in education, \\"the goals should not be the liberal one of equality of access but equality of outcome for the median number of each identifiable non-educationally defined group, i.e. the average women, negro, or proletarian or rural dweller should have the same level of educational attainment as the average male, white, suburbanite\\". The outcome and the benefits from equality from education from this notion of equality promotes that all should have the same outcomes and benefits regardless of race, gender, religion etc. The equality of outcome in Hewitt's point of view is supposed to result in \\"a comparable range of achievements between a specific disadvantaged group ‚Äì such as an ethnic minority, women, lone parents and the disabled ‚Äì and society as a whole\\". Information ethics is impartial and universal because it brings to ultimate completion the process of enlargement of the concept of what may count as a center of a (no matter how minimal) moral claim, which now includes every instance of being understood informationally, no matter whether physically implemented or not. In this respect information ethics holds that every entity as an expression of being, has a dignity constituted by its mode of existence and essence (the collection of all the elementary properties that constitute it for what it is), which deserve to be respected (at least in a minimal and overridable sense), and hence place moral claims on the interacting agent and ought to contribute to the constraint and guidance of his ethical decisions and behavior. Florida goes onto claim that this \\"ontological equality principle means that any form of reality (any instance of information/being), simply for the fact of being what it is, enjoys a minimal, initial, overridable, equal right to exist and develop in a way which is appropriate to its nature.\\" Values in his claims correlate to those shown in the sociological textbook You May Ask Yourself by Dalton Conley. The notion of \\"ontological equality\\" describes equality by saying everything is equal by nature. Everyone is created equal at birth. Everything has an equal right to exist and develop by its nature. References Further reading * Arnold, Mathew (18759). \\"Equality.\\" In: Mixed Essays. New York: Macmillan & Co., pp. 48‚Äì97.

First appointed to the position in October 2003, he tendered his resignation on January 26, 2006, following the defeat of the Fatah party in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, and remained in office in a caretaker capacity until 19 February when he was succeeded by Ismail Haniyeh. During his tenure as prime minister, he has also had responsibility for security matters. He has previously served as speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council and held a variety of significant positions within the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) from the 1970s on. Early political career Qurei was born in Abu Dis (near Jerusalem), Mandatory Palestine, in 1938. He joined the Fatah, the largest of the political and military organizations making up the Palestine Liberation Organization, in 1968. As a banker, he used his expertise during the 1970s as the director of the PLO's foreign investment branch and director-general of the PLO's economic branch, helping to make the organization one of the largest employers in Lebanon. He followed Yasser Arafat to Tunis after the PLO was forced to leave Lebanon. As more senior leaders died, Qurei rose to prominence and was elected to the Fatah Central Committee in August 1989. Qurei was elected as the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council on 7 March 1996 in Gaza. As a member of the Central Committee, Qurei was instrumental in negotiating the Oslo Accords. Later, at Camp David (July 11 to 25, 2000), he took part in the negotiations with Ehud Barak.

Haniyeh became prime minister after Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections of 2006. President Mahmoud Abbas dismissed Haniyeh from office on 14 June 2007 at the height of the Fatah‚ÄìHamas conflict, but Haniyeh did not acknowledge the decree and continued to exercise prime ministerial authority in the Gaza Strip. In September 2016, reports indicated Haniyeh would replace Khaled Meshaal as Chief of Hamas's Political Bureau. He was elected as Hamas political chief on 6 May 2017. Early life and education Haniyeh was born in the Al-Shati refugee camp in the Egyptian- occupied Gaza Strip. His parents became refugees, after they fled their homes near what is now Ashkelon, Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. He attended United Nations-run schools and in 1987, graduated from the Islamic University of Gaza with a degree in Arabic literature. While at university he had become involved with Hamas. From 1985 to 1986 he was head of the students' council representing the Muslim Brotherhood. He also played as a midfielder in the Islamic Association football team. He graduated at about the same time as the First Intifada against the Israeli occupation started in the Gaza Strip. In prison and deporting He participated in protests in First Intifada and was given a short prison sentence by Israeli occupation authorities. He was detained by Israel again in 1988 and imprisoned for six months. In 1989, Later he was imprisoned for three years. Following his release in 1992, Israeli occupation authorities deported him to Lebanon with senior Hamas leaders Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi, Mahmoud Zahhar, Aziz Duwaik and 400 other activists. The activists stayed at Marj al-Zahour in Southern Lebanon for over a year where according to BBC News, Hamas \\"received unprecedented media exposure and became known throughout the world\\". A year later, he returned to Gaza and was appointed as Dean of the Islamic University. Positions in Hamas After Israel released Ahmed Yassin from prison in 1997, Haniyeh was appointed to head his office. His prominence within Hamas grew due to his relationship with Yassin and he was appointed as the representative to the Palestinian Authority. His position within Hamas continued to strengthen during the Second Intifada due to his relationship with Yassin, and because of the assassinations of much of the Hamas leadership by the Israeli security forces. He was targeted by the Israel Defense Forces for his alleged involvement in attacks against Israeli citizens. Following a suicide bombing in Jerusalem in 2003, he was slightly injured on his hand by an Israeli Air Force bomb attack attempting to eliminate the Hamas leadership. In December 2005, Haniyeh was elected to head the Hamas list, which won the Legislative Council elections the following month. Haniyeh will succeed Khaled Meshaal's head leadership of Hamas in the upcoming elections to be held by the end of 2016. Prime minister Haniyeh was nominated as prime minister on 16 February 2006 following the Hamas \\"List of Change and Reform\\" victory 25 January 2006. He was formally presented to Mahmoud Abbas on 20 February and was sworn in on 29 March 2006. Western reaction Israel implemented a series of punitive measures, including economic sanctions, against the Palestinian Authority following the election. Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, announced that Israel would not transfer to the Palestinian Authority an estimated $50 million per month in tax receipts that were collected by Israel on behalf of the Palestinian Authority. Haniyeh dismissed the sanctions, stating that Hamas would neither disarm nor would it recognise Israel. Haniyeh expressed regret that Hamas was subjected to punitive measures, adding that \\"it [Israel] should have responded differently to the democracy expressed by the Palestinian people\\". The United States demanded that $50 million in unexpended foreign aid funds for the Palestinian Authority be returned to the United States, which Palestinian Economic Minister Mazen Sonokrot agreed to do.\\"PNA agrees to return 50-million-dollar fund to US\\" , Xinhua, 19 February 2006 On the loss of foreign aid from the United States and the European Union, Haniyeh commented that: \\"The West is always using its donations to apply pressure on the Palestinian people.\\"\\"Hamas dismisses Israeli sanctions\\", BBC, 20 February 2006 Several months after Hamas' 2006 election victory, Haniyeh sent a letter to US president Bush, in which he called on the \\"American government to have direct negotiations with the elected government\\", offered a longterm truce with Israel, while accepting a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders and urged an end the international boycott, claiming that it would \\"encourage violence and chaos\\". The U.S. government did not respond and maintained its boycott. Disputed dismissal On 14 June 2007, Abbas dismissed Haniyeh and appointed Salam Fayyad in his place. This followed action by Hamas armed forces to take control of Palestinian Authority positions that were under the control of Fatah militias armed and supported by the United States and Israel.David Rose, The Gaza Bombshell, Vanity Fair, April 2008 The appointment of Fayyad to replace Haniyeh has been challenged as illegal, because under the Palestinian Basic Law, the President of the Palestinian Authority may dismiss a sitting prime minister, but may not appoint a replacement without the approval of the Palestinian Legislative Council. According to the law, until a new prime minister is thus appointed, the outgoing prime minister heads a caretaker government. Fayyad's appointment was never placed before, or approved, by the Legislative Council. For this reason, Haniyeh has continued to operate in Gaza, and been recognised by a large number of Palestinians as the legitimate acting prime minister. Anis al-Qasem, the Palestinian constitutional lawyer who drafted the Basic Law, is among those who publicly declared the appointment of Fayyad to be illegal.Opinion of lawyer who drafted Palestinian law, Reuters, 8 July 2007 Dispute with Abbas An agreement with Abbas was to have been reached to stop Abbas's call for new elections. On 20 October 2006, on the eve of this deal to end factional fighting between Fatah and Hamas, Haniyeh's convoy came under gunfire in Gaza and one of the cars was set on fire.\\"Haniya unhurt in convoy shooting\\", BBC, 20 October 2006 Haniyeh was not hurt in the attack. Hamas sources said that this was not an assassination attempt. Palestinian Authority security sources reported that the attackers were the relatives of a Fatah man killed by clashes with Hamas.\\"Haniyeh unhurt by attack on convoy in Gaza\\", Haaretz, 20 October 2006 Denied reentry to Gaza During the simmering Fatah‚ÄìHamas conflict, on 14 December 2006, Haniyeh was denied entry to Gaza from Egypt at the Rafah Border Crossing. The Border Crossing was closed by order of Israeli Minister of Defence, Amir Peretz. Haniyeh was returning to Gaza from his first official trip abroad as prime minister. He was carrying an estimated 30 million USD in cash, intended for Palestinian Authority payments. Israeli authorities later stated that they would allow Haniyeh to cross the border provided he leave the money in Egypt, which would reportedly be transferred to an Arab League bank account. A gun battle between Hamas militants and the Palestinian Presidential Guard was reported at the Rafah border crossing in response to the incident. The EU monitors who operated the crossing were reportedly evacuated safely.\\"Palestinian PM denied Gaza entry\\", BBC, 14 December 2006 When Haniyeh later attempted to cross the border, an exchange of gunfire left one bodyguard dead and Haniyeh's eldest son wounded. Hamas denounced the incident as an attempt by rival Fatah on Haniyeh's life, prompting firefights in the West Bank and Gaza Strip between Hamas and Fatah forces. Haniyeh was quoted as saying that he knew who the alleged perpetrators were, but declined to identify them and appealed for Palestinian unity. Egypt has since offered to mediate the situation.\\"Egypt seeks to ease Gaza tensions\\", BBC, 15 December 2006 Attempt to form unity government He resigned on 15 February 2007 as part of the process to allow a unity government between Hamas and Fatah.\\"Palestinian unity deal under way\\" BBC, 15 February 2007 He formed a new government on 18 March 2007 as head of a new cabinet that included Fatah as well as Hamas politicians. On 14 June 2007, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced the dissolution of the March 2007 unity government and the declaration of a state of emergency. Haniya was dismissed and Abbas ruled Gaza and the West Bank by presidential decree.  Hamas requested return of Haniyeh‚Äôs government to Gaza  On 13 October 2016, the Legal Committee of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) endorsed a request for the return of Haniyeh's government to the Gaza Strip, following its resignation on 2 June 2014. The endorsement was made in response to PLC's review of a study submitted by members of Hamas' parliament, angry about perceived government failings following Haniyeh's resignation. In Hamas' own words, denouncing the consensus government's \\"reneging on the internal accord between Hamas and factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization to form the 2014 consensus government, and replacing a number of ministers with Fatah leaders ‚Äì turning it into a Fatah government.\\" Despite the PLC recommendation and Hamas' plea, both the consensus government and Fatah refused the request, citing in a press release its illegality and risk of further divisions between Hamas-controlled Gaza and the West Bank.  Head of Hamas political bureau  As of November 2016, reports circulated regarding Haniyeh's succession of Khaled Meshaal as head leader of Hamas. Meshaal, Haniyeh and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met in Qatar recently to discuss national reconciliation and the upcoming national elections. This meeting signaled that Haniyeh had been selected over the other two likely candidates, senior Hamas member Moussa Mohammed Abu Marzook and prestigious Hamas leader Mahmoud Zahhar. Haniyeh left Gaza in September to visit a series of Arab and Muslim states in preparation for his new role, and will officially relocate to Qatari capital of Doha, where Meshaal has been residing. It is expected of the head of Hamas' politboro to live outside of the Gaza Strip. In August 2020, Haniyeh called Mahmoud Abbas and rejected the peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, something which Reuters called a \\"rare show of unity\\".  Meeting with Erdoƒüan  In February 2020, Haniyeh met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. U.S. State Department stated: \\"President Erdogan‚Äôs continued outreach to this terrorist organization only serves to isolate Turkey from the international community, harms the interests of the Palestinian people, and undercuts global efforts to prevent terrorist attacks launched from Gaza.\\" Views Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy During the Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy in 2006, Haniyeh strongly objected to the Pope's remarks: \\"In the name of the Palestinian people, we condemn the Pope‚Äôs remarks on Islam. These remarks go against the truth and touch the heart of our faith.\\" He also denounced the Palestinian attacks on churches in the West Bank and Gaza. Views on peace with Israel In August 2006, on his first visit abroad as prime minister to Iran, Haniyeh said: \\"We will never recognize the usurper Zionist government and will continue our jihad-like movement until the liberation of Jerusalem\\". In December 2010, Haniyeh stated at a news conference in Gaza that \\"We accept a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital, the release of Palestinian prisoners, and the resolution of the issue of refugees.\\" In addition, he said that if the Palestinian electorate approves such a peace agreement with Israel, his government will abide by it notwithstanding previous Hamas positions on the issue. In a speech broadcast on Al-Aqsa TV on 23 March 2014 (the tenth anniversary of the assassination of Sheik Ahmad Yassin), Haniyeh stated (as translated by MEMRI): \\"Out of deprivation, we shall establish the balance of terror. Out of the ruins, we shall rock Tel Aviv. [With] our bare hands, we shall dig into the rock and do the impossible.\\"Hamas PM Haniya Extols Martyrdom, Says: We Shall Rock Tel Aviv, MEMRITV, Clip No. 4207 (transcript), 23 March 2014 (video clip available here).

By Asmaa al-Ghoul, Al Monitor, 27 March 2014 Views on Osama bin Laden On 2 May 2011, Haniyeh condemned the killing by American forces of Osama bin Laden, leader of Al Qaida and said that the operation is \\"the continuation of the American oppression and shedding of blood of Muslims and Arabs\\". He stated, \\"We condemn the assassination and the killing of an Arab holy warrior.\\"Abbas government welcomes bin Laden death, Hamas deplores, Reuters 2 May 2011 Political analysts said the remarks were an attempt to cool differences in the Gaza Strip with al Qaeda-inspired Salafi groups, which condemn Hamas as too moderate. The United States government condemned his remarks as \\"outrageous\\".\\"US: Hamas Leader's bin Laden Remarks 'Outrageous'\\" by David Gollust, Voice of America,3 May 2011 Personal life Haniyeh is married and has thirteen children. In 2009, the family lived in Al-Shati refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip. In 2010, Haniyeh purchased a parcel of land in Rimal, a Gaza City beachfront neighborhood. Haniyeh registered the land in the name of his son-in-law. Subsequently, Haniyeh reportedly purchased additional homes and registered them under the names of his children. According to a 2014 Ynet article, Haniyeh is a millionaire, stemming from the 20% tax charged on all items entering though tunnels from Egypt to the Gaza Strip. Haniyeh's eldest son was arrested by Egyptian authorities at the Rafah Border Crossing with a few million dollars, which he intended to take into Gaza. Haniyeh's sisters Kholidia, Laila and Sabah, are Israeli citizens and live in the Bedouin town of Tel as-Sabi in southern Israel. Kholodia moved to Tel as-Sabi first and then her two sisters followed. Kholidia's husband said \\"Our life is normal here and we want it to continue.\\" Laila and Sabah are both widowed but remain in Tel as-Sabi assumingly to retain their Israeli citizenship. Some of the children of the three sisters have served in the Israel Defense Forces. In early 2012, Israeli authorities granted a request to travel to Haniyeh's sister, Suhila Abd el‚ÄëSalam Ahmed Haniyeh, and her critically ill husband for emergency heart treatment that could not be treated by hospitals in Gaza. After successful treatment at the Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, Israel, the couple returned to Gaza. Haniyeh's granddaughter was treated in an Israeli hospital in November 2013 and his mother in law was treated in an Israeli hospital in June 2014. In October 2014, a few months after the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza War, Haniyeh's daughter spent a week in an Israeli hospital in Tel Aviv for emergency treatment after she suffered complications from a routine procedure. In September 2016, Haniyeh left Gaza with his wife and two of his sons for the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, known as the Hajj. This trip, interpreted as a campaign commencement, bolstered reports that Haniyeh was to replace Meshaal.

Biography Early life Higginbotham was born on March 2, 1921 in Amherst, Virginia to Plinkam L Higginbotham and Hester Higginbotham.1930 Federal Census He has a younger brother, Robert, who also became a member of the U.S. military. Military career Higginbotham joined the U.S. military in the summer 1942. He subsequently was accepted into the Tuskegee Army Airfield Class TE-44-K from which he graduated on February 1, 1945 with a commission as a Second Lieutenant. Higginbotham became one of the original members of the Tuskegee Airmen when he was assigned to the 477th Bombardment Group. He served on active duty through the end of World War II; in 1946, he left active duty but continued as a member of the U.S. Army Air Force Reserves. He initially flew fighter aircraft but eventually moved up to flying B-52s. Higginbotham's younger brother Robert also joined the military during World War II two years after his older brother; however, Robert Higginbotham became a pilot for the Navy Air Corps. Arrested African-American officers of the 477th Bombardment Group at Freeman Field, Indiana, await transport to Godman Field, Kentucky, April 1945. Higginbotham was one of 100 black servicemen who were arrested for attempting to enter an officers club reserved for white officers. This event became known as the Freeman Field Mutiny; it is widely seen as a key moment in the path towards full integration of the U.S. Armed Services. Civilian career Following his years of active duty, Higginbotham went to work for the Los Angeles Airport Advisory Committee, working as a registrar at the Pittsburg Airport. He also served as a probation officer for nearly thirty years. Awards Higginbotham and his brother Robert both attended the ceremony in 2007 where the Congressional Gold Medal was collectively awarded to the Tuskegee Airmen for their contributions during World War II.

The Covenant is an ideological paper, written in the early days of the PLO. The first version was adopted on 28 May 1964. In 1968 it was replaced by a comprehensively revised version.The Palestinian National Charter: Resolutions of the Palestine National Council July 1-17, 1968, on Avalon In April 1996, many articles, which were inconsistent with the Oslo Accords, were wholly or partially nullified. History Following a 1963 Draft Constitution the first version of the Charter was written by Ahmad Shukeiri, the first chairman of the PLO, using the slightly different name al-Mithaq al-Qawmi al-Filastini, meant to reflect its origins in Nasser's Pan-Arabism. in The first official English translation rendered al-Mithaq as \\"covenant\\", while later versions have tended to use \\"charter\\". (The word changed in 1968 in the Arabic name is translated as \\"national\\" in either English translation.) The Palestinian National Charter was adopted on 28 May 1964,Helena Cobban, The Palestinian Liberation Organisation(Cambridge University Press, 1984) p.30 establishing the Palestine Liberation Organization, in (east) Jerusalem along with another document, variously known as the Basic Constitution, Basic Law or Fundamental Law of the PLO, based on an earlier Draft Constitution. The Charter is concerned mainly with the aims of the Palestine Liberation Organization, while the Fundamental Law is more concerned with the structure and procedures of the organization. The Charter was extensively amended, with seven new articles, in 1968 in the wake of the Six-Day War and given its current name.The Middle East 1916-2001 : A Documentary Record, The Avalon Project, Yale Law School. Compared to its predecessor, it focused more on the independent national identity and vanguard role of the Palestinian people, led by the PLO, in their \\"liberation of their homeland\\" by armed struggle. Article 7 of the earlier document was changed from \\"Jews of Palestinian origin are considered Palestinians ...\\" to being restricted only to those \\"who had resided in Palestine until the beginning of the Zionist invasion.\\" The final article providing that it can only be amended by a vote of a two-thirds majority of the Palestinian National Council (PNC) at a special session convened for that purpose was left unchanged. The Fundamental Law was also amended, making it more democratic, electing the entire Executive Committee by the PNC, instead of just the Chairman, separating the post of the Speaker of the PNC from the Chairman of the Executive Committee and affirmed the authority of the Executive Committee over the army. Later, (Hirst, 2003, p. 427) a promised Charter amendment based on Fatah doctrine \\"that all Jews [without date restriction] ... were to be entitled to Palestinian citizenship\\" failed due to doctrinal quarrels over the meaning of the precise nature of the proposed Democratic State. The 1968 Charter also removed the 1964 Clause 24 which began, \\"This Organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, on the Gaza Strip or in the Himmah Area.\\" That is to say, the Charter in its original 1964 form made no territorial claims over the West Bank or Gaza. Events before 1998 \\"Palestine, with its boundaries at the time of the British Mandate\\" Israel has always strongly objected to the Charter, which describes the establishment of the state of Israel as \\"entirely illegal\\" (Art. 19), considers Palestine, with its original Mandate borders, as the indivisible homeland of the Arab Palestinian people (1‚Äì2), urges the elimination of Zionism in Palestine (Art. 15), and strongly urges the \\"liberation\\" of Palestine. On 14 December 1988, following an outcry from his 13 December General Assembly speech, Yasser Arafat called a press conference in Geneva to clarify his earlier statement by specifically mentioning the right of all parties concerned in the Middle East conflict to exist in peace and security, including the State of Palestine, Israel, and their neighbours. He also renounced terrorism.Arafat Clarifies Statement to Satisfy U.S. Conditions for Dialogue (December 14, 1988), Jewish Virtual Library. Israel dismissed these statements of moderation from Arafat and the PNC resolution in Algiers, 1988 (which had been sufficient to open a dialogue with the United States) as \\"deceptive propaganda exercises\\" because (among other objections), \\"the PLO Covenant has not changed.\\"Shlaim, p. 466 In May 1989, Arafat, in a statement later criticized by Edward Said as being beyond his authority, and properly a matter for the PNC, told a French TV interviewer \\"C'est caduc\\", meaning that it, the Charter, was null and void.Transcript in Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 19, No. 2 (Winter, 1990), pp. 133‚Äì188 In August 1993, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin insisted on changes to the Charter as part of the Oslo Accords. Following Yasser Arafat's commitment to \\"submit to the Palestinian National Council for formal approval\\" the changes to the Charter confirming that \\"those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to exist, and the provisions of the Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid\\"Israel-PLO Recognition ‚Äì Exchange of Letters between PM Rabin and Chairman Arafat ‚Äì Sept 9- 1993, israel ministry of Foreign Affairs. in the September 9, 1993 letters of mutual recognition, the PNC met in Gaza and voted on 24 April 1996. The decision was adopted by a vote of: 504 in favor, 54 against, and 14 abstentions. The official English translation used by Israel, the PLO and the United States reads: At one time the text of the Charter at the official website of the Palestinian National Authority appended these amendments to the text of the 1968 charter; the redrafting process referred to in the second amendment still remains uncompleted. An earlier version of the above translation is still available on the website of Palestinian American Council. The relevant text reads: This earlier version had appeared on the Palestine Minister of Information's website. Many commentators noted that the text only indicated a decision to amend the charter, not an actual amendment. Official Palestinian websites have since replaced the vague translation with the concrete version quoted above. Yitzhak Rabin said in a speech to the Knesset on 5 October 1995, at the time of the ratification of the Oslo II Interim Agreement: \\"The Palestinian Authority has not up until now honoured its commitment to change the Palestinian Covenant. ... I view these changes as a supreme test of the Palestinian Authority's willingness and ability, and the changes required will be an important and serious touchstone vis-√†-vis the continued implementation of the agreement as a whole\\".Letter dated 27 July 1998 from the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, United Nations General Assembly. When this government was replaced by Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud government, the issue again became even more controversial, with Israel's demand for greater clarity and precision eventually expressed in the Wye River Memorandum. (See below, Events of 1998) Events of 1998 and after Clauses regarding Israel Yasser Arafat wrote letters to President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair in January 1998 explicitly listing the articles of the Charter referred to in the PNC's 1996 vote. While this was seen as progress in some quarters, other Palestinian officials contended that the Charter had not yet been amended, and there were also reportedly discrepancies between the two letters. The operative language of Arafat's letter to Clinton reads: The articles identified by Arafat as nullified call for Palestinian unity in armed struggle, deny the legitimacy of the establishment of Israel, deny the existence of a Jewish people with a historical or religious connection to Palestine, and label Zionism a racist, imperialist, fanatic, fascist, aggressive, colonialist political movement that must be eliminated from the Middle East for the sake of world peace. Observers who had previously been skeptical of Palestinian claims that the Charter had been amended continued to voice doubts. In an attempt to end the confusion, the Wye River Memorandum included the following provision: > The Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the > Palestinian Central Council will reaffirm the letter of 22 January 1998 from > PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat to President Clinton concerning the nullification > of the Palestinian National Charter provisions that are inconsistent with > the letters exchanged between the PLO and the Government of Israel on 9‚Äì10 > September 1993. PLO Chairman Arafat, the Speaker of the Palestine National > Council, and the Speaker of the Palestinian Council will invite the members > of the PNC, as well as the members of the Central Council, the Council, and > the Palestinian Heads of Ministries to a meeting to be addressed by > President Clinton to reaffirm their support for the peace process and the > aforementioned decisions of the Executive Committee and the Central Council. These commitments were kept, leading President Clinton to declare to the assembled Palestinian officials on 14 December 1998 at Gaza: > I thank you for your rejection--fully, finally and forever--of the passages > in the Palestinian Charter calling for the destruction of Israel. For they > were the ideological underpinnings of a struggle renounced at Oslo. By > revoking them once and for all, you have sent, I say again, a powerful > message not to the government, but to the people of Israel. You will touch > people on the street there. You will reach their hearts there. Like President Clinton, Israel and the Likud party now formally agreed that the objectionable clauses of the charter had been abrogated, in official statements and statements by Prime Minister Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Sharon, Defense Minister Mordechai and Trade and Industry Minister Sharansky.Wye River Memorandum: Status of Implementation (February 1, 1999), Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Israeli Reactions to the PNC Vote in Gaza (December 14, 1998), Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Palestinian Authority has yet to honor all of its Wye commitments (December 15, 1998), Likoed Nederland.Press Conf PM Netanyahu and FM Sharon - Erez (15 December 1998), Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Despite President Clinton's optimism, the events of 1998 did not entirely resolve the controversy of the Charter. A June 1999 report by the Palestinian Authority's Ministry of Information on the status of the Charter made no mention of the 1998 events and leading Palestinians continue to state that the Charter has not yet been amended. In 2001 the first draft of a constitution authorized by the PLO's Central Committee, calling for a respect for borders, human and civil rights as defined under international law appeared.The DRAFT Of the Palestinian Constitution (2001), pcpsr.org. Regarding PLO reform In March 2005 representatives of 13 Palestinian factions, including Fatah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, PFLP and DFLP,PFLP and DFLP urge Abbas to preserve the Cairo declaration, honour the call for PLO reform. Maan News Agency, 20 July 2007 adopted a 6 paragraph declaration known as the \\"Cairo Declaration\\".2005 Cairo Declaration. Palestine Media Center2005 Cairo Declaration. Miftah The declaration envisions a reform of the PLO to include all the Palestinian powers and factions. In order to implement these reforms it was decided to form a committee made up of the PNC Chairman, the members of the Executive Committee, the secretaries general of all Palestinian factions and independent national personalities. The PLO-EC Chairman is tasked to convene this committee. In the subsequent years, the agreement was several times reconfirmed, but as of 2015 there have not been taken concrete steps. Israeli views Although the PNC met in Gaza on 24 April 1996, it did not revoke or change the covenant, but only issued a statement saying that it had become aged, and that an undefined part of it would be rewritten at an undetermined date in the future. While the English language press release stated that the PLO Covenant was \\"hereby amended\\", the Arabic version of Yassir Arafat's letter on this declaration stated: The New York Times and others Chiu, Michael.

The PNC is responsible for formulating the policies and programs for the PLO. It serves as the parliament that represents all Palestinians inside and outside the Palestinian territories, and all sectors of the worldwide Palestinian community, including political parties, popular organizations, resistance movements, and independent figures from all sectors of life.PLO vs. PA . Passia, September 2014 The Council formally meets every two years. Resolutions are passed by a simple majority with a quorum of two-thirds. The PNC elects its own Chairman.  Structure  Candidates for the PNC are nominated by a committee consisting of the PLO Executive Committee, the PNC chairman, and the commander in chief of the Palestine Liberation Army. After nomination, PNC candidates are elected by a majority of the entire PNC membership. However, due to the impossibility of holding elections, PNC elections have never been held and most members are appointed by the Executive Committee. In 1996, when the Council had to vote on the revision of the Palestinian National Charter, the total number of PNC members was increased with 400 to about 800. By 2009, some 700 from them had remained.On the Experience of the Palestinian Liberation Organization . Middle East Monitor (MEMO), 20 October 2012 , the PNC chairman was Salim Zanoun and the PNC had 669 members; 88 are from the first Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC), 98 represent the Palestinian population living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and 483 represent the Palestinian diaspora.Palestine National Council.

Rather it is the equivalent of PA's PLC. As of 2012 the main office of the PNC is in Amman and a branch office is located in Ramallah.Palestine National Council - Main Office, Branch Offices  History  The first PNC, composed of 422 representatives, met in Jerusalem in May 1964 and adopted the Palestinian National Covenant (also called Palestinian National Charter). It also established the PLO as the political expression of the Palestinian people and elected Ahmad Al-Shuqeiry as the first chairman of the PLO Executive Committee. At the conference were representatives from Palestinian communities in Jordan, West Bank, the Gaza strip, Syria, Lebanon, Kuwait, Iraq, Egypt, Qatar, Libya, and Algeria. Subsequent sessions were held in Cairo (1965), Gaza (1966), Cairo (1968‚Äì1977), Damascus (1979‚Äì1981), Algiers (1983), Amman (1984), Algiers (1988), Gaza (1996 and 1998), Ramallah (2009).The parliament of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) elected on Thursday six new members to its executive body.PNC Convenes in Ramallah Wednesday to Select PLO Exec. Committee Members At the February 1969 meeting in Cairo, Yasser Arafat was appointed leader of the PLO. He continued to be PLO leader (sometimes called Chairman, sometimes President) until his death in 2004. In a November 1988 meeting in Algiers, the PNC approved the Palestinian Declaration of IndependenceDan Cohn-Sherbok, The Palestinian State: A Jewish Justification, Impress Books, 2012 p.105. by a vote of 253 in favour 46 against and 10 abstentions. After the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, the PNC met in Gaza in April 1996 and voted 504 to 54 to void those parts of the Palestinian National Covenant that denied Israel's right to exist, but the charter itself has not been formally changed or re-drafted. One of its most prominent members, the Palestinian-American scholar and activist Edward Said, left the PNC because he believed that the Oslo Accords sold short the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes in pre-1967 Israel and would not lead to a lasting peace. In December 1998, the PNC met in Gaza at the insistence of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a condition of the continuation of the peace process. In the presence of the US President Clinton, it reaffirmed again the annulling of the parts of the Covenant which denied Israel's right to exist, but it still did not formally change or re-draft the Covenant. For the first time in 22 years, since its last full meeting in 1996, the 700 member PNC met on 30 April 2018 in Ramallah to discuss recent developments, but many groups did not attend, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.

The term applies to the IDP's descendants too.Davis, 1997, p. 49. \\"Children of \\"absentees\\", whether born inside or outside of the State of Israel, are similarly classified as \\"absentees\\".\\" In 1950, 46,000 out of the 156,000 Israeli Arabs in Israel were considered Present absentees. According to 2015 estimates from Palestinian NGO BADIL, there are 384,200 IDPs in Israel and 334,600 IDPs in the Palestinian territories. IDPs are not permitted to live in the homes they formerly lived in, even if they were in the same area, the property still exists, and they can show that they own it. They are regarded as absent by the Israeli government because they were absent from their homes on a particular day, even if they did not intend to leave them for more than a few days, and even if they left involuntarily.Segev, Tom. 1949: The First Israelis, pp. 68-91. IDPs in Israel If the definition is restricted to those displaced in the 1948 war and its immediate aftermath and their descendants, some 274,000 Arab citizens of Israel - or 1 in 4 in Israel - are internally displaced. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre estimated in 2007 that 150,000-420,000 internally displaced persons were living in Israel. The vast majority are Muslim (90%) and some 10% are Christian. There are no Druze among them \\"since no Druze village was destroyed in the 1948 war and no Druze left their settlements permanently.\\" Organizations defending the rights of Arab citizens of Israel also generally include the 110,000 Bedouin forced to move in a closed area under military rule in the Negev in 1949 in their estimates of internally displaced Palestinians. Other internally displaced persons included in these counts are those who were displaced by ongoing home demolitions enacted against unlicensed structures or in unrecognized villages. Estimates based on this broader definition place the total population of IDPs at anywhere between 250,000 - 420,000 people.Kassim and Mansour, 2002, p. 76. Provides an estimate of 250,000. Present absentees In 1950, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) estimated that 46,000 of the 156,000 PalestiniansThe Internally Displaced Refugees who remained inside the borders demarcated as Israel by the 1949 Armistice Agreements were internally displaced refugees. As it was for most other Palestinian refugees, the homes and properties of internally displaced Palestinians were placed under the control of a government body, the Custodian of Absentees' Property via legislation that includes the 1948 Emergency Regulation Concerning Absentee Property (a temporary measure) and the 1950 Absentee Property Law. Unlike Palestinian refugees, the internally displaced Palestinians and others who remained inside what became Israel were made citizens by the Citizenship Law of July 1952. That same year Israel requested that UNRWA transfer responsibility for registering and caring for internally displaced persons to Israel and basic humanitarian assistance was provided to the internally displaced for a time. Military administrative rule (1948‚Äì1966) restricted the movement of Arab citizens of Israel, and it combined with the Absentees' Property Laws to prevent internally displaced citizens from physically returning to their properties to reclaim their homes. According to the Absentees' Property Laws, \\"absentees\\" are non-Jewish residents of Palestine who had left their usual places of residence for any place inside or outside the country after the adoption of the partition of Palestine resolution by the UN. Under these laws, \\"absentee\\" property owners were required to prove their \\"presence\\" in order to gain recognition of their ownership rights by the Israeli government. However, all ownership rights of \\"absentees\\" belong to the government-appointed Custodian of Absentee Property, and any person including the \\"absentee\\" owner himself found occupying, building, or being \\"present\\" on such properties would be violating the law and risk expulsion and demolition. Some villagers like those of Ghassibiya, Bir'im and Iqrit made petitions to the Israeli High Court to have their property rights recognized which were upheld in the 1950s, but they were physically prevented from reclaiming their properties by military administrative authorities who refused to abide by the court rulings and declared the villages closed military zones. Because most internally displaced Arab citizens of Israel were counted as absent, even though present inside the Israeli state, they are also commonly referred to as present absentees. Present-day Today the internally displaced Bedouins and their descendants live in 39-46 unrecognized villages in the Negev and the Galilee, while the remaining internally displaced Arab citizens live in some 80 towns and villages in the Galilee such as Ein Hawd. There is also the village of Ein Rafa near Jerusalem. Half of the populations in the two largest Arab towns in Israel, Nazareth and Umm al-Fahm, are made up of internally displaced persons from neighbouring towns and villages destroyed in 1948. IDPs in Palestine The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre estimated in July 2015 that there are at least 263,500 IDPs in Occupied Palestine.Palestine IDP Figures Analysis Research on the internal refugees A few books focus on Arab internal refugees in Israel and internally displaced Palestinians across the Green Line. In 1991, Israeli writer and peace activist David Grossman conducted several interviews with Palestinian citizens of Israel. These were published in a book called in . The English version was titled Sleeping on a Wire: Conversations with Palestinians in Israel. As Nur Masalha puts it in his introduction: \\"Acquiring the paradoxical title of present absentees, the internally displaced had their property and homes taken by the state, making them refugees and exiles within their own homeland.\\"Catastrophe Remembered: Palestine, Israel and the Internal Refugees, edited by Nur Masalha (London: Zed Books 2005). The book uses oral history and interviews with internal refugees to examine Palestinian identity and memory, indigenous rights, international protection, the right of return, and a just solution in Palestine/Israel.

The defendants, former personal assistants to Nigella Lawson and her ex- husband Charles Saatchi, were accused of specifically without special authorisation, using their credit cards on the account of Saatchi's private company between January 2008 and December 2012.Ian Johnston \\"Charles Saatchi believes his ex-wife Nigella Lawson is a ‚Äòhabitual criminal‚Äô, court hears\\", The Independent, 27 November 2013 In 2013, the sisters plead not guilty to the charges.\\"Nigella Lawson PAs spent '¬£685,000 living the high-life'\\", ITV News, 27 November 2013 The jury found them not guilty. Background Charles Saatchi and Nigella Lawson married in 2003. Lawson was married to the journalist John Diamond until his death in 2001; Lawson and Diamond had two children together. In June 2013, photographs emerged of Saatchi grasping Lawson around the throat at a dinner table outside a Mayfair restaurant. Saatchi accepted a conditional caution for assault from the police over the incident. He announced his intention to divorce Lawson, stating that the couple had \\"become estranged and drifted apart\\".\\"Charles Saatchi and Nigella Lawson to divorce\\", BBC News, 7 July 2013. Lawson made no public comment; however, Lawson filed for divorce citing ongoing unreasonable behaviour. On 31 July 2013, Saatchi and Lawson were granted a decree nisi effectively ending their 10-year marriage with court documents suggesting that the two had already arrived at a private financial settlement. One of the sisters was hired by Lawson as her personal assistant and nanny in 1999, during her marriage to Diamond. Four years later, after Lawson married Saatchi, the couple hired her sister, to serve as an additional personal assistant to a team of four other assistants .As part of their duties, the sisters were expected to make certain purchases on behalf of their employers; they were therefore given Coutts credit cards in their own names on Saatchi's Conarco Partnership company account. The Grillos were accused of misusing the credit cards to make personal purchases worth thousands of pounds. Pre-trial hearings In an unusual move, on 26 November 2013 in a pre-trial hearing the presiding judge, Robin Johnson, lifted an order that had prevented publication of claims made in pre-trial proceedings on 15 November. In a \\"bad character\\" defence relating to Lawson,Gordon Rayner \\"Nigella Lawson allegedly took drugs every day for a decade, court told\\", telegraph.co.uk, 26 November 2013 enabling her to be cross-examined during the trial,Kunal Dutta \\"Nigella Lawson took cocaine, cannabis and prescription drugs every day for 10 years, court hears\\", The Independent, 26 November 2013 the Grillo sisters alleged that Lawson permitted their personal use of the private company credit card resulting in spending the next day of ¬£300,000 between them, Gordon Rayner \\"Nigella Lawson's assistants spent ¬£685,000 on Charles Saatchi's credit cards, court hears\\", telegraph, 27 November 2013 in return for their non-disclosure to Saatchi of Lawson's believed use, for at least ten years, of cocaine and cannabis (Class A and B drugs respectively) nor her unauthorised use of prescription drugs. The defence counsel for , Anthony Metzer, QC, instructed through Janes Solicitors, said that while the arrangement was not verbalised, it amounted to a \\"tacit understanding\\". An email sent by Saatchi to Lawson which was read out in court indicated that he believed the Grillos' assertions and later he said that he was \\"completely astonished by the alleged scale of the drug use set out in the statements\\". Saatchi has stated that he was unaware of this reported situation until a late stage of the couple's marriage. The prosecuting counsel Jane Carpenter described the Grillos' claims about Lawson's drug use as \\"totally scurrilous\\" and Lawson's spokesman declined to comment, \\"as the proceedings are still live\\". Carpenter said that although the sisters had been interviewed on 2 August 2012,Robert Booth \\"Nigella Lawson's personal assistants spent ¬£685,000 in 'greedy free-for- all'\\", 27 November 2013 and charged in March, they had only made allegations against Lawson in October 2013. On 27 November, the defence Anthony Metzer, QC, attempted to have the case thrown out as an abuse of process on the grounds that the two prosecution witnesses, Lawson and Saatchi, could not be \\"witnesses of truth\\". This application was rejected by the judge.Gordon Rayner \\"Nigella Lawson is a 'habitual criminal‚Äô, court hears\\", telegraph.co.uk, 27 November 2013 The trial On 27 November 2013, the trial began.\\"Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi marriage 'secrecy'\\", BBC News, 27 November 2013 Saatchi testified that it had been Lawson's idea to give the Grillos credit cards. He stated that he had not authorized the Grillos' purchases himself, but was unable to say whether Lawson had approved them. He testified that he had never seen Lawson take illegal drugs, but added that the drug accusations against Lawson were \\"pretty compelling\\".http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/29/world/europe/uk-nigella-lawson- court/ Lawson had been \\"very cross\\" when he told her that he had confronted the Grillos over their credit card use, Saatchi stated. Although Saatchi wanted to deal with the matter privately, Lawson suggested involving the police. Saatchi also testified that he was \\"bereft\\" that his email about the drug allegations had been made public. Lawson admitted to taking cocaine and cannabis but denied she was or is addicted, she stated, \\"\\"I found it made an intolerable situation tolerable. It‚Äôs a false friend. I found the answer was in changing the situation and trying to create a tolerable situation for me and my family. Since freeing myself from a brilliant but brutal man, I‚Äôm now totally cannabis-, cocaine- and drug-free.\\"Nigella Lawson facing Scotland Yard drugs investigation Saatchi's finance director Rahul Gajaar testified that, after the couple's former assistants' alleged unauthorised spending had been uncovered, he suggested that they pay off the debt gradually over a long period. However, the Grillos were unhappy with this suggestion, as they felt they would be tied to the Saatchis for the rest of their lives. Sharrine Scholtz, another former employee of Charles Saatchi testified personal versus business spending on the cards were not distinguished. Scholtz allegedly processed credit statements and allocated spending on items like beauty treatments, clothes, hotels, shopping to business accounts. When Scholtz wanted to leave Saatchi's employment she alleges she was threatened over taxi fares she had been allowed to claim and was falsely accused of stealing from petty cash. She testified that, if she did not sign an agreement her employer wanted, she \\"thought perhaps [she] would be standing [accused in court] instead of Lisa and Francesca\\". 'Career suicide' to testify against Charles Saatchi, ex-aide tells court On 12 December, the judge made critical remarks concerning comments made by David Cameron in The Spectator magazine in which Cameron said he was a \\"huge fan\\" of Lawson and a member of \\"Team Nigella\\", her support group on social media. The judge asked the jury to ignore what the Prime Minister had said.Gordon Rayner \\"David Cameron criticised by judge for 'Team Nigella' intervention in trial\\".

The first Bengali rock band in West Bengal and India was Moheener Ghoraguli. In modern times, in this type of music distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, and drums are used, sometimes accompanied with pianos and keyboards. In early times the instruments used in modern times were also accompanied by saxophone, flute, violin and bass violin.  History   Origin (1960s-1970s)  Bengali rock in Kolkata originated when the first band Moheener Ghoraguli was formed in 1975 and played in many concerts. The band was inspired by Bob Dylan and many other western artists. Their music was a mixture of a wide variety of influences, including the Baul and folk traditions of Bengali and rock. Along with them, the Kolkata based English Rock Band called High (formed 1974) consisting of Late Dilip Balakrishnan (who was also part of the Great Bear rock band), Nondon Bagchi, Lew Hilt, Subhendu Chatterjee and Adi Irani started composing and performing Original Songs.A collection of the band's recordings were released on the Saregama label in 2009.  Emergence (1990s)  Most of the Bengali rock bands in Kolkata were formed after the 1990s. The bands in this era started using many types of effects like distortion, wah wah, flanger, phaser, and delay in their music. Krosswindz, a Bengali rock band based in Kolkata, India, was formed in 1990, and have played all over India and abroad, helping to urbanize and popularize the rock music of Bengal. Krosswindz have recorded ten albums, the highest number ever recorded by a Kolkatan rock band. The legendary Bengali rock band Abhilasha was also formed during this period. Their first album, a mixture of delightful rock and melody, was released by the original band members in 1997. Many bands like Bhoomi, Cactus, Parash Pathar, Chandrabindoo, Hip Pocket, Kalpurush, Fossils, and Lakkhichhara were formed later in this era. Fossils and Cactus have also brought Bengali metal into this era. Both Fossils and Cactus are regarded as the best Bengali hard rock bands, and they have toured all over India and abroad. All their albums and singles have been successful.This era also saw emergence of new bands like Udaan, Agantuk and others. In 1994, the opening of Someplace Else (a pub which also hosts live music) changed the rock scene in Kolkata. Now it hosts live music for approximately nine hours every night.  New millennium (2000s)  Many bands formed in the 2000s were influenced by guitar-heavy music. As metal became popular in the 2000s, many bands like Insomnia and Underground Authority started playing heavy metal and alternative music. Chronic Xorn was the first band from Kolkata to record a heavy metal album. Death Destruction Sermon is their latest album, released in 2010, it consists of six tracks, and the full-length version of the album is 25 minutes 45 seconds. As computer technology became more accessible and music software advanced in the 2000s, it became possible to create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer. This resulted in a massive increase in the amount of home-produced electronic music available to the general public via the expanding internet. Many underground metal bands like Nitric Dreams and Crystal and the Witches from Kolkata also started recording and releasing singles on their blogs. To encourage the Bengali rock scene, the Bangla Rock Magazine was started on July 3, 2013, covering exclusively Bengali rock.

Copies of Notre Dame du Bon Succ√®s are to be found across the North East of Scotland. It is believed that the statue in Brussels may have been in Old Aberdeen as early as 1450. References to a statue in a Chapel at the Bridge of Dee in Aberdeen suggest that it may have been placed there by Bishop Gavin Dunbar of Aberdeen (1514‚Äì1531). There is an account of the statue, and the priest who served in the Chapel in William Kennedy, Annals of Aberdeen, from the Reign of King William the Lion, to the End of the Year 1818, (London: [s.n.], 1818). \\" ‚Ä¶ In this age of superstition, according to the custom of the time, the bridge was provided with a chapel, dedicated to the Virgin Marv, erected on the north end, that travellers who passed and re-passed might have an opportunity of exercising solemn acts of devotion at its altar, of which Sir William Rae was chaplain. There belonged to this institution a silver crucifix, chalice of silver, an image of the Virgin over gilt, three embroidered napkins, and other sacred utensils, some of which were preserved at the Reformation, when the chapel was probably demolished ‚Ä¶\\" (pp 417/418) At the beginning of the Scottish Reformation (c. 1559) many religious objects from churches in Aberdeen and the St Machar's Cathedral in Old Aberdeen were given for safe keeping to Catholic sympathisers. It is claimed that the statue was in the hands of a Catholic family, the Gordons of Strathbogie, until 1625. It was then sent to the Low Countries by a William Laing, thought to be the Procurer for the Kings of Spain to the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia in Brussels. There is a reliable history of Notre Dame du Bon Succ√®s in Brussels from that date. In Scotland the Catholic Church celebrates 9 July as Our Lady of Aberdeen Day. There are copies in St Mary's Cathedral, Aberdeen and in the Bishop‚Äôs House, formerly the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Aberdeen. Other copies include one in Buckie and one in St Peter's Church in Aberdeen. For historic details of Notre Dame du Bon Succ√®s and Our Lady of Aberdeen see the papers by Ray McAleese ‚Äì below.

It matched the defending champion Oakland Raiders (12‚Äì2) of the Western Division and the host New York Jets (11‚Äì3) of the Eastern Division, who were slight favorites. The Raiders had hosted a tiebreaker playoff game the week before against the Kansas City Chiefs (12‚Äì2) to determine the Western Division champion, while the Eastern champion Jets were idle. Slightly favored, the Jets defeated the Raiders 27‚Äì23 to win the championship and the chance to play the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. Game summary After Jets quarterback Joe Namath threw an interception that enabled Oakland to take a fourth quarter lead, he led the Jets 68 yards in just 55 seconds to score a go-ahead touchdown pass to Don Maynard with 7:24 left in the game. Then New York's defense stopped Oakland on their three remaining drives to hold on to victory, avenging their regular season loss to the Raiders in the infamous Heidi Game six weeks earlier. A 28-yard punt by Oakland's Mike Eischeid gave New York the ball on the Raiders 44-yard line on their first possession, and they took advantage of the short field with a 4-play scoring drive. Namath completed two 14-yard passes to Maynard on it, the second one a touchdown to give the Jets an early 7‚Äì0 lead. Meanwhile, Raiders quarterback Daryle Lamonica completed just one of his first 13 pass attempts. His first completion was a 36-yard pass to Billy Cannon, but the Raiders ended up with no points on that drive when George Blanda hit the cross bar attempting a 45-yard field goal. New York then drove to a 33-yard field goal by Jim Turner, giving them a 10‚Äì0 lead in the final minutes of the first quarter. After being completely dominated up to this point, the Raiders offense finally got into gear as Lamonica completed passes to Pete Banaszak and Fred Biletnikoff for gains of 11 and 15 yards. Then he hit fullback Hewritt Dixon for a 23-yard gain on the last play of the first quarter. As the second quarter opened up, Lamonica finished the 80-yard drive with a 29-yard touchdown pass to Biletnikoff, making the score 10‚Äì7. The rest of the quarter would result in nothing but field goal attempts, with Turner missing one from 44 yards, but connecting from 35, while Blanda kicked a 26-yard field goal right before halftime to make the score 13‚Äì10. Lamonica opened the third quarter with a 37-yard completion to Biletnikoff. Then his 40-yard pass to receiver Warren Wells gave Oakland a first down on the Jets 6-yard line. However, rush attempts over the next three plays resulted in just 5 yards. Faced with 4th and goal on the 1, coach John Rauch decided to play conservative and had Blanda kick a 9-yard field goal that tied the game at 13. New York responded by driving 80 yards in 14 plays to retake the lead, 20‚Äì13, on Namath's 20-yard touchdown pass to tight end Pete Lammons with one minute left until the 4th quarter. Oakland responded to the touchdown with Lamonica's 57-yard completion to Biletnikoff setting up a 20-yard Blanda field goal, cutting the score to 20‚Äì16. Then Raiders defensive back George Atkinson intercepted a pass from Namath and returned it 32 yards to the Jets 5-yard line. On the next play, Banaszak ran the ball into the end zone, giving Oakland their first lead of the game at 23‚Äì20 with 8:18 remaining on the clock. However, this turned out to be very short lived. After starting out the ensuing drive with a 10-yard completion to George Sauer, Namath completed a 52-yard pass to Maynard at the Raiders 6-yard line. On the next play, he connected with Maynard in the end zone, giving the Jets a 27‚Äì23 lead at the 7:47 mark. Oakland had three more drives with the time remaining, but failed to score each time. Oakland took the ball after Maynard's touchdown and drove to New York's 26-yard line, where they ended up faced with 4th down and 10. Even though more than 5 minutes remained in the game, Rauch decided to try to go for a first down rather than kick a field goal, but this did not pay off as Lamonica was sacked by New York lineman Verlon Biggs on the next play. Following a punt, Oakland drove to the New York 24-yard line, only to lose the ball again when Lamonica's intended swing pass to Charlie Smith sailed behind him, resulting in an accidental fumbled lateral that was recovered by linebacker Ralph Baker. The next time the Raiders got the ball, it was on their own 22-yard line with 42 seconds left in regulation. The Jets defense managed to stop the drive at midfield as time expired to preserve their lead and win the game. Neither quarterback distinguished themselves with passing accuracy. Namath completed 19 of 49 passes for 266 yards and 3 touchdowns, with 1 interception. Lamonica completed 20 of 47 passes for 401 yards and a touchdown. Biletnikoff was the leading receiver of the game with 7 receptions for 190 yards and a touchdown, while Maynard caught 6 passes for 118 yards and a score. Jets running back Matt Snell was the top rusher of the game with 71 yards on 19 carries, along with a 15-yard reception, while Emerson Boozer chipped in 51 rushing yards for New York. In addition to his 32-yard interception return, Atkinson returned 4 kickoffs for 112 yards. Oakland lost despite outgaining the Jets in total yards 443-400.http://fs64sports.blogspot.com/2012/12/1968-jets-defeat-raiders-for- afl.htmlhttp://www.remembertheafl.com/images/JetsDownOakland1968MainCourierExpress.jpg The attendance of 62,627 was a record for an AFL title game. : Officials *Referee: Walt Fitzgerald *Umpire: George Young *Head Linesman: Tony Veteri *Line Judge: Al Sabato *Back Judge: Hugh Gamber *Field Judge: Bob Baur The AFL (and NFL) had six game officials in 1968; the seventh official, the side judge, was added in .

The HYTEC 288 Plus EIA system continues to serve laboratories around the world. The NOVEOS system is the first BIG change in routine allergy testing in over 20 years, capturing the attention of laboratories looking to reduce interference issues that they face with other products, and those looking to improve the patient and clinician experience by reducing the amount of sample needed to perform testing. Currently, HYCOR Biomedical has an estimated 14% market share in allergy testing, second to Thermo Fisher Scientific's ImmunoCAP and Phadia instrumentation. As the NOVEOS System launches across the globe, market share for HYCOR will increase. Products and services Many are familiar with a common method for allergy testing called skin prick testing. However, this method relies on examining a patient's reaction to the exposed allergen, and in some cases, invokes large systemic reactions. With a growing need for testing younger patients without putting them at risk, in vitro testing has become an increasingly more viable alternative.

The game was held on January 4, 1970 at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum between the Western Division champion Oakland Raiders (12‚Äì1‚Äì1) and the division's second-place team, the Kansas City Chiefs (11‚Äì3), who had won divisional playoff games to advance to the championship. Oakland had won the two regular season games between the two teams, were favored by 4 to 5¬Ω points, and had taken seven of the last eight meetings. The Chiefs won 17‚Äì7 on the strength of seventeen unanswered points in the last three quarters and represented the AFL in Super Bowl IV the following week. This was the 616th and final AFL game. Game summary The Chiefs edged out Oakland 17‚Äì7 in a hard fought defensive struggle in which both teams combined for just 440 yards (233 for Oakland, 207 for KC) and each lost four turnovers. It was a very satisfying win for Kansas City, who had been swept by the Raiders during the season and lost 7 of their last 8 meetings, including a crushing 41‚Äì6 loss in the previous year's postseason. The Raiders opened up the scoring with a 66-yard drive, featuring Daryle Lamonica's 24-yard completion to Warren Wells on the Chiefs' 3-yard line. Running back Charlie Smith ran the ball across the goal line on the next play, giving Oakland a 7-0 lead. Both defenses would take over the majority of the rest of the half, but with 3:24 remaining in the second quarter, Kansas City, who had only gained two first downs up to now, drove 75 yards to tie the game. Quarterback Len Dawson started off the drive with a 14-yard completion to Otis Taylor, while Robert Holmes' 8-yard run moved the ball into Raiders territory on their 42 for the first time in the game as the clock ran down to the 2-minute warning. On the next play, Dawson threw a 41-yard completion to receiver Frank Pitts. Then Wendell Hayes scored a 1-yard touchdown run to tie the game at seven at halftime. Oakland seemed primed to respond in the third quarter with a drive to the Chiefs' 33-yard line, but in what turned out to be a crucial play, Lamonica jammed his thumb and fingers when his throwing hand struck the helmet of Chiefs defensive end Aaron Brown, and he had to miss the rest of the drive. Backup George Blanda took over and tried to take the team the rest of the way to the end zone, but a few players later, defensive back Emmitt Thomas made a clutch interception on the Chiefs' 5-yard line. Kansas City then drove 95 yards for a go-ahead score. The key play on the drive with a 35-yard reception by Taylor through triple coverage with the team facing 3rd and 13 from their own 2-yard line. Dawson later completed a 23-yard pass to Holmes on the drive, and defensive back Nemiah Wilson's pass interference penalty eventually gave Kansas City a first down on the Raiders' 7-yard line. Holmes carried the ball three straight times after that, the last a 5-yard touchdown run to put the Chiefs up 14‚Äì7. Lamonica returned to the game in the 4th quarter, but was unable to lead the Raiders to any points, despite numerous opportunities. A promising drive into Kansas City territory was eliminated when Jim Kearney intercepted Lamonica's pass on the Chiefs 18-yard line. Two plays later, defensive end Carlton Oats recovered a fumble from Holmes on the Chiefs' 24. But on the next play, Oakland gave the ball right back with an interception to rookie cornerback Jim Marsalis. Amazingly, Oakland got the ball back on another Holmes fumble, this one recovered by linebacker Dan Conners on the Chiefs' 31. Still, the only result would be another Lamonica interception, this one to Thomas, who returned it 62 yards to the Raiders' 18-yard line, setting up Jan Stenerud's 22-yard field goal that increased Kansas City's lead to 17‚Äì7. Oakland had one last chance to get back in the game when defensive end Ike Lassiter recovered a fumble from Dawson on the Kansas City 13 with two minutes left. But Lamonica threw four straight incompletions and the Chiefs ran out the rest of the clock.http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1970/01/05/page/93/article/minnesotans- beat-browns-27-7-1st-titlehttp://bleacherreport.com/articles/1653179-two- championships-in-one-season-1969-kansas-city-chiefs Neither quarterback had a particularly good day. Dawson completed only 7 of 17 passes for 129 yards, while Lamonica finished 15/39 for 167 yards and three interceptions. Charlie Smith was the sole offensive star of the game, with 31 rushing yards and a touchdown, along with 8 receptions for 86 yards. : Officials *Referee: Jack Vest *Umpire: Paul Trepinski *Head Linesman: Cal Lepore *Line Judge: Aaron Wade *Back Judge: Hugh Gamber *Field Judge: Bob Baur The AFL (and NFL) had six game officials in 1969; the seventh official, the side judge, was added in . Players' shares The Chiefs players each received $7,000 and the Raiders players about $5,000 each. With the win, the Chiefs were guaranteed an additional $7,500 each, the loser's share in the Super Bowl; the Super Bowl winners earned $15,000 each. Aftermath The Chiefs went on to win the Super Bowl against the Minnesota Vikings, in a final showing of the AFL and its strength. Kansas City is the only team in the Super Bowl era to win the title without allowing as much as ten points in any postseason game. The two leagues merged into one after this game, with the ten AFL teams and three NFL teams (Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Colts, and Cleveland Browns) forming the American Football Conference. Super Bowl V was the first game for that conference, which the Colts won. After losing their first two appearances in 1993 and 2018, The Chiefs won the AFC Championship in 2019. Conversely, the Raiders have appeared in eleven, winning four and losing seven; their last appearance (and win) was in 2002.

However, she keeps a dark secret, that when younger and part of a biker gang, she murdered Terry, an unpleasant drug addict and the father of her godson Natty, and covered it up with the aid of her lover Mickey. The novel takes the form of a confession written by Billie when she fears a journalist will expose her past. Critical reaction Most reviewers noted the strong central character and the abundance of depravity, violence and criminality, while differing on its literary merits. The New York Times praised the central character's verve, which they felt made up for the other less well developed characters. Linda Herrick in the New Zealand Herald found it overwritten, with so much crammed in, and a tendency for over-the-top melodramatic passages. Publishers Weekly found it \\"fascinating\\" but hard to read, with a \\"raw power\\".

Often used to refer to architecture and physical culture, the term addresses the combination of Anglo-Saxon and Norman styles prevalent during the period. Architecture In the years before the Conquest, various Saxo-Norman features emerged in English architecture, including \\"long and short\\" stonework, \\"half-roll\\" features on arches and double-splay windows. After the Conquest, Saxo-Norman architecture was typically applied to smaller buildings, and small parts of larger projects. Major ecclesiastical projects, such as cathedrals and abbey churches, were executed in a predominantly Norman style. At Exeter Castle, for example, Anglo-Saxon \\"long and short\\" stonework was used in the gatehouse, alongside arches common to both Norman and Anglo-Saxon styles, and some features borrowed from the Holy Roman Empire. One of the reasons for this would have been the limited number of Norman craftsmen available for projects, and the continuity of local Anglo-Saxon preferences in many locations. The round tower of St Andrew's, Bedingham, is of Saxo-Norman design Some Anglo-Saxon architectural features were never used under the Normans, and, as time went by, some Saxo-Norman features began to fade. Old Anglo-Saxon features such as brick arches in stone buildings were simply eliminated from new designs, and \\"long and short\\" stonework, \\"half-roll\\" features slowly disappeared from use. By the 12th century, parish churches were typically being built in a Norman, rather than Saxo-Norman style. The fusion of surviving Anglo-Saxon elements into the Norman style eventually produced the English Romanesque style of architecture. The phrase has been critiqued by historian John Gage as being \\"the architectural equivalent of a middle-aged spread\\". Physical culture Saxo-Norman pottery began to be made in eastern England, including the towns of Stamford and Thetford, encouraged by contact from France and Scandinavia.

The grape is unique among Vitis vinifera varieties in that it is naturally seedless. Historically Termarina rossa was grown in the provinces of Parma and Reggio Emilia for use in production of jams and saba, a sweet syrup, made from boiling the must but today it is used as a blending variety in some of Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT) wines of the area.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 1047 Allen Lane 2012 History and relationship to other grapes The Emilia-Romagna region where Termarina rossa has been planted since at least the 1840s. The grape was first mentioned under the synonym Uva Passerina in Vincenzo Bertozzi's 1840 treatise on viticulture titled Viti della Provincia di Reggio Emilia. While Bertozzi also mentioned a white berried version of Termarina (and there is a white Passerina grape grown in the Marche region), DNA profiling has shown not relationship between Termarina and other Emilia-Romagna varieties and the grape doesn't appear to be a color mutation of Passerina or any grape that has been known as Termarina bianca. There has been some speculation that Termarina rossa may be related to the seedless Greek wine grape Korinthiaki (known in Italy as Corinto nero) but DNA analysis in 2005 demonstrated that the two varieties are distinct with no known relationship. Viticulture Termarina rossa is unique among vinifera grapes in that it is naturally seedless, producing tiny berries that can get very ripe with high levels of sugars that work well for jam and syrup production as well as for full-bodied wines with high potential alcohol levels. The grapevine itself can be very vigorous and high yielding requiring diligent canopy management and pruning to insure quality wine grapes. Wine regions Concord (pictured), Termarina rossa has been historically used in jam and syrup production. Ampelographers believe that Termarina rossa is native to the Emilia-Romagna region and today this is where most of the vine's plantings can be found, particularly in the provinces of Parma and Reggio Emilia. Though the grape has a history in the region dating back to the 1840s, it was historically used mostly for jam and syrup production and so wasn't officially added to official register of Italian wine grape varieties until 2007. Styles According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Termarina rossa has the potential to make full-bodied red wines with aroma notes of cherries and tar as well as noticeable acidity levels and smooth tannins with a slightly bitter edge. Synonyms Over the years, Termarina rossa has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Oltremarina, Tramarina, Uva di Corinto, Uva Passarina and Uva Passerina.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Termarina Accessed: November 27th, 2013 References Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Termarina rossa"},{"id":"41207918","text":"The Devil's Servants (, ) is a 1970 film produced and distributed by Riga Film Studio.

Additionally, since January 1, 2019, the company is the North American Numbering Plan Administrator, under a contract granted by the Federal Communications Commission. Formerly known as SMS/800, Inc., it was announced at the 2015 Toll-Free User Summit in Orlando, Florida, that the company would be rebranding under the new name, Somos, Inc. On April 4, 2016, the Enhanced SMS/800 platform was launched and made available to Resp Orgs in order to provide additional functionality. Somos, Inc. administers the assignment of toll-free telephone numbers in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP)Company Overview of Somos, Inc. Bloomberg. This company has been designated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to administer the Service Management System (SMS) Database for Responsible Organizations (Resp Orgs) and service control points (SCPs), as defined by the Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs) Part 52 Section 101, and stipulated in 800 Service Management System (SMS/800) Functions Tariff - FCC No. 1.https://portal.somos.com/ResoPDF/PublicDocuments/SMS800FunctionsTariff.pdf Somos operates various web interfaces over a virtual private network for Resp Orgs to register toll-free telephone numbers. Somos admits and registers Resp Orgs according to qualification criteria including a required exam. It provides training materials and education in the U.S. History Toll-free telephone service is a telecommunication service in which subscribers are assigned telephone number in NPAs 800, 888, 877, 866, 855, 833, 844, and 833. Calls to these numbers incur no toll charges for callers. The American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T;) first introduced 800 toll-free service in 1967. When AT&T; was the only Interexchange carrier, local exchange carriers automatically routed all toll-free calls directly to an AT&T; point of presence without performing a translation from the toll-dree number to the terminating telephone number. The LECs routed the calls to AT&T; based on the first three digits (800) of the dialed number. AT&T; then performed all number translations and service area validation screenings. * In 1981, AT&T; introduced its Common Channel Interoffice Signaling (CCIS) network and the Network Services System (NSS) database for providing its own centralized facility for toll-Free number translation and service provisioning. * In 1989, an FCC order (as part of Docket 86-10) found that a national database system for toll-free access would offer both advantages and disadvantages as compared with the NXX Plan access solution. The major advantage of the national database system was that it would enable toll-free number portability and thus facilitate competition since a customer could change carriers without changing numbers. Its drawback was that it would increase access time for toll-free calls until Signaling System 7 (SS7) deployment became more extensive. * Following a review of the petitions for reconsideration and several developments involving SS7 deployment, on August 1, 1991, the FCC adopted a comprehensive order, which mandated the implementation of toll-free database access by March 4, 1993. A subsequent FCC order moved the actual cutover date to May 1, 1993. * On February 10, 1993, the FCC released an order, which declared access to the toll-free database by Responsible Organizations (Resp Orgs) to be a Title II common carrier service and required the BOCs to file a tariff for toll-free database access by March 5, 1993. The effective date of the tariff was May 1, 1993. The order also set forth that any entity that met appropriate financial and technical eligibility requirements could serve as the Resp Org for a toll-free number record at the customer's request. With this provision, users could serve as their own Resp Org or they could use an IC, a LEC, or a third party as a Resp Org. * On May 1, 1993, the management and assignment of toll-free numbers transitioned from the interim 800 NXX Plan to a 10 digit management plan in the national 800 Service Management System (SMS/800). * On January 25, 1995, INC designated the 888 Numbering Plan Area (NPA) code as the next area code for use in providing toll-free service. The INC also reserved the remaining 8YY [sic] (877, 866, ..., 822) area codes for future toll-free services. * On March 1, 1996, the 888 code was opened. * On April 5, 1998, the 877 code was opened. * On July 29, 2000, the 866 code was opened. * On October 10, 2010, the 855 code was opened. * On November 1, 2013, via FCC Order, SMS/800, Inc. assumed tariffing authority and responsibility for the SMS/800 platform services as well as approval for a plan to change its membership and governance structure to be more representative of the community of toll-free users, and to make other changes to the administration of the SMS/800 platform. * On December 7, 2013, the 844 code was opened. * In 2014, SMS/800, Inc. formed a new Board of Directors, ushering in a new chapter for the company, and the toll-free Industry as a whole. * On July 1, 2015, SMS/800, Inc. launched the Texting & Smart Services (TSS) Registry for top- level routing data for toll-free messaging and multimedia services. * On October 27, 2015, SMS/800, Inc. became known as Somos, Inc.

Martin Chautari (henceforth Chautari or MC) began as an informal discussion group in Kathmandu in 1991, allowing development professionals, social activists and academics to meet every two weeks to share insights and experiences related to Nepali development and society. The founders of this discussion group included the Nepali power engineer Bikas Pandey, the Norwegian engineer Odd Hoftun and the Norwegian academic Martin Hoftun. In 1995, the name ‚ÄòMartin Chautari‚Äô was adopted in memory of Martin Hoftun, who was tragically killed in an airplane accident in 1992. After being managed by the Centre for Social Research and Development for six years, in 2002 Chautari became registered as a separate non-government organization (NGO) in Kathmandu, Nepal. Its offices are currently located in Thapathali, Kathmandu. Since its inception, Chautari‚Äôs core objective has been to enhance the quality of public dialogue in Nepal, particularly in matters pertaining to development, democracy, civil liberties and social justice. Even as other activities ‚Äì research, research training, publications and a library open to the public ‚Äì have been taken up, Chautari‚Äôs discussion series continue to be its most-known work. Premised on the democratic potential and practice of having face-to-face interactions, MC currently organizes two scheduled discussions and seminars a week with speakers and topics drawn from a wide social spectrum. Chautari's discussion and seminar series is the oldest, continuously running such series related to Nepal organized by any institution anywhere in the world. In addition to the discussion series, Chautari also conducts and supports research, with its main concentration being on media, gender, environmental justice, education, health, social inclusion and democracy. Since 2009, Chautari has also extended its research to policy issues. By April 2020, 30 policy briefs/briefing papers have been published.http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/collections/journals/mcpb/ In executing its research project, MC has trained a new generation of researchers through a rigorous mentoring program that allows the young researchers to immerse themselves in all aspects of the research enterprise. MC also publishes policy briefs, books and journals (98 books in its Chautari Book Series until mid 2020 and three other books as a co-publisher). MC is the editorial home of two journals. The first is the bi-lingual (English and Nepali) semi-annual journal Studies in Nepali History and Society, established in 1996, and published by Mandala Book Point from Kathmandu. The second is the Nepali language annual journal Samaj Adhyayan which was established in 2006 as Media Adhyayan (its title was changed in 2016). It is published by MC itself. The books published by MC are designated Chautari Book Series. Since 2006, Chautari has opened its reference library and media centre to the public. This has allowed MC to provide access to all of its holdings of reference items to students, journalists, activists and researchers. The library‚Äôs holdings total about 21,000 books, theses and reports. The library also holds a small collection of journals, magazines, newspapers and unpublished seminar papers. A new reading room was opened in 2009 for the benefit of public users. All five components ‚Äì the discussions, research, mentoring, publications and library ‚Äì feed into each other and form an intrinsic part of what MC sees as its three chief strategic interests: promoting open dialogue amongst public intellectuals, journalists, academics, social activists, development practitioners, policy makers, and politicians; promoting collaborations amongst academics in Nepal‚Äôs various colleges, universities and academic NGOs regarding knowledge production; and promoting a new generation of researchers through mentoring and other means.

Life Charles was the son of John Charles, also Physician and Justice of the peace who practised medicine in Stanley, County Durham. His mother was Margaret Dewar. Charles early education was taken at St Bees School, and then the Royal Grammar School in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In 1916, Charles qualified in medicine at Durham University College of Medicine. In 1925 Charles took a Diploma in Public Health at University of Cambridge. In 1947 Charles married Madeleine Frances, who was the eldest daughter of William Errington Hume (1879‚Äì1960), Professor Emeritus of Medicine in the Durham University, and had a son and daughter. Career During World War I, Charles worked in Royal Army Medical Corps, and was promoted to the rank of Captain and 1917, he posted to France, Belgium and later Italy. After the war, Charles worked with the British Army of the Rhine from when it initially established March 1919 to 1924. Charles was appointed Assistant Medical Officer of Health for Newcastle Upon Tyne in 1928, becoming a tuberculosis officer at the City Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Newcastle Upon Tyne. Charles later became an assistant medical officer of health for the county of Wiltshire.Charles returned to Newcastle in City Hospital for Infectious Diseases in 1928, being promoted to medical officer for health in 1932. Charles moved to London in 1944 as Deputy Chief Medical Officer where he assisted with the planning of the National Health Service. Charles was appointed Chief Medical Officer in 1950 and retired in 1960. He devoted considerable attention to the development of the World Health Organization for which he continued to work after his retirement. Contributions When Charles succeeded Jameson in 1950, he became the first CMO to be appointed to the Home Office as well as the Ministry of Health and Department for Education. He encountered a greater range of medical work than his predecessors had experienced, and a much more rapid combined integration of scientific and medical research. It has been suggested that Charles was kept in his post as CMO due to him being content with the Ministry's weak stance on smoking. He should have retired aged 65 in 1958 under civil service rules. Charles had a particular focus on the World Health Organization (WHO) and was Chairman of board during 1957 to 1958. In 1959 he was President of the Twelfth World Health Assembly and Chairman of the Fourth Expert Committee on Public Health Administration in 1960. After Charles finally retired, he was appointed as a senior advisor to the WHO secretariat in Geneva, a position Charles held almost until his death in 1971. While in Geneva, he worked on the preparation and publication of the second and third editions World Health Situation Reports. Honours and awards In 1962 he received the L√©on Bernard Foundation Prize of World Health Organization for his contributions to medicine. In 1970 he was selected as the second Jacques Parisot Foundation Lecturer to the World Health Assembly.

Invention  CTC Global (formerly Composite Technology Corporation) developed the patented technology. The ACCC conductor's composite core is manufactured according to ASTM B987 / B987M - 20 ‚ÄúStandard Specification for Carbon Fiber Thermoset Polymer Matrix Composite Core (CFC) for use in Overhead Electrical Conductors.‚Äù CTC Global manufactures ACCC core in the US and with partners in China and Indonesia. Finished ACCC conductor is produced by more than two dozen conductor manufacturers worldwide under license. As of September 2020, over 100,000 km have been deployed at over 800 projects in 52 countries. Advantages It is able to carry approximately twice as much current as a traditional aluminium-conductor steel-reinforced cable (ACSR) cable of the same size and weight, making it popular for retrofitting an existing electric power transmission line without needing to change the existing towers and insulators. In addition to the labor and materials savings, such an upgrade can be performed as a \\"maintenance and repair\\" operation, without the lengthy permitting process required for new construction. ACSR and composite-core ACCC conductors It does this by replacing the steel core in ACSR cable with a carbon and glass fiber strength member formed by pulltrusion. This composite strength member provides several advantages: * It is lighter. The weight saved can be used for more aluminium conductor. ACCC cable uses trapezoidal strands to fit more aluminium into the same cable diameter. * Softer, fully annealed aluminium can be used for the conductors. ACSR cable uses stronger non- annealed commercially pure aluminium which contributes to the cable's tensile strength and improves sag and pull-out under ice load, but has about 3% less electrical conductivity and limits the maximum operating temperature. * It has a much lower coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) () than ACSR (). This lets the cable be operated at a significantly higher temperature without excessive sag between poles. The first two factors result in roughly 30% greater conductivity than an equivalent ACSR conductor, allowing 14% more current to be carried at equal temperature. For example, diameter ACCC \\"Drake\\" conductor at 75 ¬∞C has an AC resistance of 106 mŒ©/mile, while equivalent ACSR conductor has an AC resistance of 139 mŒ©/mile, 31% higher. Sag Comparison Test Data: temperature vs. sag of various conductor types on a 215' test span. The remaining capacity increase is provided by an increased operating temperature of continuous and emergency, compared to continuous and emergency for ACSR. The manufacturers rate the cable for continuous operation at 180 ¬∞C surface temperature, Operation at these temperatures implies high line losses, which may be uneconomical, but the ability to carry such current contributes to the redundancy of the electric grid (the high overload capacity can stop a potential cascading failure) and thus can be valuable even when rarely used directly. Even at higher operating temperatures, the ACCC conductor's added aluminum content and lower electrical resistance offers reduced line losses compared to other conductors of the same diameter and weight. Disadvantages ACCC-specific conductor dead-end Assembly. This grips only the central strength member. * The primary disadvantage is cost; ACCC costs 2.5-3 times as much as ACSR cable. * Although ACCC has significantly less thermal sag than even other HTLS conductor designs, it has a lower axial stiffness. Therefore, it sags more than other designs under ice load, although an \\"ultra-low-sag\\" (higher modulus) version is available at a cost premium. Also, other aluminium alloys with an increased strength at the expense of electrical conductivity can be used to improve ice load sag. Ice load can also lead to the loosening of outer layer strands because of plastic deformation by the attached weight. * Annealed aluminium is extremely soft and makes the conductor prone to surface damage. * The conductor has a larger minimum bend radius, requiring extra care during installation. * The conductor requires special fittings and stringing equipment that are more expensive.

The oldest and most important examples derive from the Romanesque period. Wheel chandeliers were made for the practical purpose of lighting the great churches and other public areas, but in religion they also had symbolic significance, depicting the Garden of Eden or the Kingdom of God. The wheel, its gates, and its towers, which are usually decorated with Prophets and Apostles or inscribed with their names, symbolise the city walls of the New Jerusalem. The buttresses, towers, and candles number twelve or a multiple of twelve, after the numerology of the Book of Revelation. This symbolism is first found on two wheel chandeliers of Hildesheim Cathedral.Sedlmayr, pp. 125-128 The great wheel chandelier of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was an inspiration.Gallistl, pp. 44-45; 76-79 Romanesque wheel chandeliers In Germany there are four great Romanesque wheel chandeliers. The fact that they are made from fire-gilt copper and not from pure gold has saved them from being melted down. They were decorated with Prophets and angels in silver and with precious gemstones, but for the most part these have been lost. *The Barbarossa chandelier in Aachen Cathedral is attributed to Frederick Barbarossa (1122 - 1190). *Hartwig's chandelier in Comburg, Schw√§bisch Hall, with a 5-metre diameter, from the 12th century (also called Himmlische Jerusalem(Heavenly Jerusalem) with saints and soldiers in the towers. *Hezilo chandelier in Hildesheim Cathedral with a 6-metre diameter, a donation of Bishop Hezilo of Hildesheim (1054‚Äì79). *Azelin chandelier in Hildesheim Cathedral with a donation inscription of Bishop Thietmar of Hildesheim (1038‚Äì44). Gothic wheel chandeliers In the Minster Church of St. Alexander in Einbeck there is a later gothic wheel chandelier of painted brass with a diameter of c. 3.5 metres. The inscription on its bracket dates it to 1420. It was presumably gifted by Degenhard Ree, a canon of the collegiate church. The composition ought to go back to a lost example in P√∂hlde Cloister. Another Gothic example is found in: *The Cathedral of St. Stephan and St. Sixtus, in bronze, in Halberstadt (1516) Neo-Romanesque wheel chandeliers Electric wheel chandelier in St. Elisabeth Bonn In some neo-Romanesque churches there are large wheel chandeliers too.

Anderson, set in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. It is the second book in their Great Schools of Dune prequel trilogy, which itself is a sequel to their Legends of Dune trilogy. Set nearly a century after the events of 2004's Dune: The Battle of Corrin, the novel continues to chronicle the beginnings of the Bene Gesserit, Mentat and Suk Schools, as well as the Spacing Guild, all of whom are threatened by the independent anti-technology forces gaining power in the aftermath of the Butlerian Jihad. The Great Schools of Dune trilogy, first mentioned by Anderson in a 2010 blog post, chronicles the early years of these organizations, which figure prominently in the original Dune novels. Plot summary With anti-technology Butlerian forces of Manford Torondo growing in strength and influence, Prince Roderick Corrino sees a threat to the Imperial power of his brother, Emperor Salvador. Industrialist Josef Venport squares off against Torondo, whose interference thwarts Venport's business interests. Meanwhile, Gilbertus Albans grows increasingly fearful for his Mentat School on Lampadas (and the copy of the thinking machine Erasmus he is hiding there) as Torondo grows bolder. When Gilbertus refuses to force his Mentats to swear an oath to the Butlerians, his school is invaded and his past as a \\"machine sympathizer\\" is revealed. He is executed by Manford, but Anna Corrino escapes with Erasmus. Meanwhile, a riot incited by Torondo results in the death of Roderick's daughter; Salvador seizes the lucrative melange mining operations on Arrakis from Venport, who soon uses the constant danger of giant sandworms to orchestrate the Emperor's assassination. Raquella Berto-Anirul has reestablished her Bene Gesserit school on Wallach IX, thanks to the help of Josef Venport. Valya Harkonnen, now a Reverend Mother, retrieves the hidden computers from Rossak and hopes to succeed the declining Raquella as Mother Superior. Raquella believes that the only hope for the Sisterhood to survive is for the Wallach IX sisters to reconcile with Dorotea's faction on Salusa Secundus; her health failing, she summons Dorotea to the School and forces Dorotea and Valya to put their differences aside and agree to work together for the good of the Sisterhood. Naming them co-leaders, Raquella dies; Valya however, still bitter about Dorotea's betrayal, uses her newly discovered power of Voice to force Dorotea to commit suicide. Valya declares herself to be the sole Mother Superior, and ingratiates herself to the new Emperor Roderick. Vorian Atreides, feeling guilty for the death of Griffin Harkonnen, tries to help his struggling family with a secret infusion of funds to their whaling business on Lankiveil. He next travels to Caladan to meet his descendants; soon tragedy begins to befall the Atreides, and Vorian realizes too late that Griffin and Valya's younger sister Tula has visited Harkonnen vengeance on them.

It was declared a B√© Cultural d'Inter√®s Nacional in 1983. History The monastery was founded in the year 859 by a group of Benedictine monks from St. Mary of Arles from Vallespir, which had been plundered by the Normans. In the year 872, Racimir, the first abbot of the new monastery, obtained from the Frankish king Charles the Bald recognition of a territory, which included possession of the church of Sant Lloren√ß de Mont. Sant Aniol d'Aguja was a small monastery in a secluded area with few resources, making it unable to attract a large religious community. The institution was soon brought under the control of the canons of the cathedral of Girona, already documented in the year 899. In 1003, the monastery of Sant Aniol d'Aguja came under the control of Sant Lloren√ß de Mont. Sant Aniol d'Aguja became a simple parish church dependent on Sant Lloren√ß de Mont, which in turn depended on Sant Feliu de Riu. Pilgrims to the monastery have been replaced by hikers attracted by the natural environment of the valley, which bears the same name. The ancient parish was annexed to Santa Cecilia de Sadernes. Architecture and fittings Fountain in the monastery's wall. The Romanesque building dates from the 11th century. The small structures has a single nave covered with a barrel vault with a low rise. It has a semicircular apse decorated with lesena and blind arches typical of Lombard/Romanesque-style. The roof is pitched. Until 1936, there was an attached structure in the front, with cover and wooden beams, which sank. This space is now a small courtyard, which is accessed by a stone staircase. The facade was rebuilt after 1949 by soldiers guarding the border. A new bell named \\"Coral√≠\\" was placed in the small bell tower in 1962. The interior contains a step ramp which leads to a crypt with an underground chapel carved into the rock, known as the Cave of the Abbot. Its walls have flowing water which contain, according to tradition, healing properties.

She campaigned on communitarianism, currency reform and the women's position. Early life Chappellsmith [n√©e Reynolds], was born in February 1806 in Aldgate, London. Her family was probably upper working class and she had at least three sisters and two brothers. She was a staunch Baptist until her early adulthood, when a friend of her sister's introduced her to the ideas of Robert Owen. Owen's ideas exerted an immediate influence upon her and by 1836 she had begun to write political articles for The Dispatch. These articles reflected her interest in communitarianism, women's position, and also in currency reform ‚Äî a topic to which she had been led by her reading of William Cobbett. She continued to strengthen her ties with the Owenites and by 1839 she was working as a salaried lecturer for the movement. In this capacity she enjoyed huge success. Numerous reports to the Owenite press testified that she was one of the most popular speakers on the socialist circuit, frequently drawing huge crowds to her lectures. She was evidently a speaker of exceptional charisma: The Charter newspaper, for example, spoke of her 'livid and impressive manner'. Her lectures Chappellsmith's lectures during the peak years of the Owenite social reform movement can be classified chronologically as follows: (1) five lectures at the Lambeth Social Institution; (2) lectures in cities other than London; (3) lectures in or near London. She spoke on marriage, the effects of the industrial revolution, the formation and reformation of character, the Protestant Reformation, monetary issues, and women's rights and duties. Writings in New Moral World The most detailed accounts of her many Owenite lectures are found in New Moral World, a journal founded by Robert Owen in 1834. In a letter dated September 23, 1838, Miss Reynolds represented Mr. Owen on the subject of marriage; after the letter was rejected by the London Weekly Dispatch, the editor of New Moral World took \\"much pleasure in giving it insertion,\\" with a hope of \\"being favoured with any future communications of the authoress.\\" This letter appears to be the earliest of Miss Reynold's many writings in New Moral World. On August 27, 1839, she married John Chappellsmith (born John Chappell Smith), and her letters, and reports about her lectures, continued to appear in New Moral World, under her married name, until July 1, 1843. Currency reform Chappellsmith was a fierce defender of Owen's principles and particularly championed the possibilities which his system might herald for the emancipation of women. The ideas of William Cobbett, and in particular his criticism of the government's handling of currency reform, also continued to inform her ideas. In her highly popular lectures on currency reform she argued, with the assistance of an array of graphs and illustrations, that Cobbett's prophecies concerning the disastrous effect of state fiscal policies upon living standards had been fully vindicated. Her passion for this cause was further illustrated when, in 1841, she condensed and edited Cobbett's work Paper Against Gold. Chappellsmith followed the practice of other Owenite lecturers, such as Frances Morrison, in performing secular 'baptisms' or naming ceremonies for babies at the end of her lectures. Public Condemnation As a woman lecturing for the Owenite movement, and on such controversial topics as divorce, Chappellsmith often faced bitter public condemnation. On one occasion, in the town of Paisley, Scotland for example, she was met by a mob of women who stoned and abused her. Similarly, in South Shields she was followed by a violent crowd who shouted, 'Are you her with the seven husbands?' Such accusations were no doubt fuelled by an article in The Antidote, or, The Anti-Socialist Gazette (1841) which alleged that Chappellsmith had left her husband and embarked upon a series of affairs with socialist men. However, her detractors, in particular the editor, John Brindley, were rather disappointed to discover (after fully investigating Chappellsmith's private life) that she had but one man in her life, John Chappellsmith, to whom she had been happily married since 1839. John Chappellsmith fully supported his wife's activities and politics and assisted at her lectures. In 1842 Margaret Chappellsmith, who was also an active member of the Anti-Persecution Union, opened a bookshop in London and appears to have given up lecturing shortly afterwards. Emigration to the USA In 1850 the Chappellsmiths, who apparently had no children, emigrated from Liverpool to Indiana, USA on The Maine, taking only 43 days to travel to \\"the bank of the Mississippi\\". They were accompanied by other members of their family, perhaps to join one of Margaret's sisters who had earlier emigrated there. In America, Chappellsmith returned to journalism, contributing articles on a wide variety of subjects to the Boston Investigator. The move to the United States did not prove to be a great success. The Chappellsmiths were attracted to Indiana by the settlement at New Harmony; the Owenite community there had disbanded in 1827 but its leader, Robert Dale Owen (a son of Robert Owen), among others, continued to be based there. Disillusionment with Robert Dale Owen The Chappellsmiths were disillusioned by the political and religious atmosphere they found at New Harmony. In particular, Margaret Chappellsmith was aggrieved by what she considered to be Owen's conversion to religion and his pragmatic stance on abolition of slavery. The bitter articles and lectures she subsequently wrote on R. D. Owen proved influential among the socialist community in Britain, to the consternation of Owen's family. During Abraham Lincoln's campaign for the 1860 presidential election, the Chappellsmiths, who were outspoken Republicans, exchanged angry letters with Robert Dale Owen and his brother Richard Owen, both influential Democrats, in the New Harmony Advertiser.  Other writings Margaret Reynolds 25 articles in Henry Hetherington's London Dispatch ran from the first issue (September 17, 1836) to the forty-third (July 9, 1837); all were all signed \\"A woman,\\" identified in her obituary in the Evansville Daily Journal (March 7, 1883). Among her articles in the New Harmony Advertiser (1858-1860) are \\"Ancient Roman Civilization\\" and \\"The System of Castes in India.\\" Her writings in the Boston Investigator include 10 articles on the religions in India, with comparisons to Christianity (June 6, 1860 to June 25, 1862), five article on \\"Circumstances and Moral Accountability\\" (May 26, 1862 to June 25, 1862), eight on comparisons of actions of the governments of England and the United States (January 21, 1863 to September 30, 1863), five opposing Robert Dale Owen's articles on spiritualism (March 2, 1864 to April 6, 1864 and September 21 and 28, 1864), eight \\"On the Historical Existence of Jesus (September 6 to November 22, 1871), and 60 \\"On the 'Historical Value' of the Gospels\\" (February 21, 1872 to November 18, 1874).  Mid-life and later life  Margaret Chappellsmith was evidently an obdurate woman of uncompromising and sometimes surprisingly puritanical principles. She was extremely critical of socialist branches which permitted young men and women to waltz together, for example (although the waltz was earlier regarded by many religious leaders as vulgar and sinful, described as an obscene display \\"confined to prostitutes and adulteresses\\" in the Times of London, July 16, 1816). Perhaps more tellingly, she once explained to Robert Owen that she refused to forgive her sister for the way she had behaved towards a potential suitor many years previously until she demonstrated signs of 'self-reproach', hoping that this would induce her to a 'careful examination' of her feelings. (M. Chappellsmith to R. Owen, 15 Aug 1844, Robert Owen Collection) Such inflexibility perhaps helps to explain Chappellsmith's difficulty in finding happiness in a foreign culture. Indeed, accounts of Chappellsmith from the latter part of her life suggest a somewhat embittered and eccentric personality. Nevertheless, she remained at New Harmony until her death there in February 1883.

In 2014, he was featured in \\"The Peak\\" magazine's anniversary publication as one of 30 men and women documenting their success stories - the \\"30/30 ‚Äì The Game Changers\\".  Early life  Sareen was born in Madhya Pradesh in India. He was four, and the youngest of three siblings, when his mother (Amrit Kaur Sareen, born 17 Feb 1938) was paralyzed after being involved in an accident while visiting Africa. His father (Dr Surender Singh Sareen, born 15 March 1933), a civil servant, encouraged him to always be independent, push his limits and chase his dreams. His sister (Jayendra Kaur, born 26 August 1960) currently lives in Dubai, while his brother (Paremendra Singh Sareen, born 29 Nov 1961) died in a road accident in 1989 at the age of 27.  Education  Sareen is an alumnus of Daly College Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India and holds a degree in Statistics from Bhopal University. He is also a decorated and distinguished member of the Indian Army. He joined the Indian Military Academy in 1986 and resigned his commission in 1992 to support his family. He was awarded a SENA MEDAL, a gallantry award for action, by the President of India during his tenure in the Army.  Personal life  In 1994, four years after their marriage, Sareen and his wife Rewa Manmohan Singh Sareen (born 4 Feb 1968) made the decision to relocate to Singapore. In 2009, Sareen took up citizenship in Singapore before launching two tire businesses, including Mindtrac.com, and establishing Omni United in 2003. The couple now lives with their two sons, Hanut (born 22 Nov 1993) who will finish studying at Northeastern University in Boston in the Spring, and Sumer (born 22 Oct 1998) and Sareen's mother in their Bukit Timah home. His father died in 2005.  Prior to Omni United Career Info/Details  Omni United is Sareen's third business venture. Prior to its founding, he was an early entrepreneur in the online e-commerce industry. He launched, managed and subsequently sold mindtrac.com, one of the first B2B online market exchanges in the tire industry, backed by JP Morgan. Sareen launched mindtrac.com having gained previous knowledge of the market through various trading ventures throughout Asia and the USA.  Omni United Pte. Ltd  Under Sareen's direction, Omni United currently sells in excess of 6.5 million units of passenger and light truck tires in 80 countries. Omni United's manufacturing partners are located in the Indonesia, China, India, Thailand and Taiwan. The company currently sells more than two million units of passenger and light truck tires a year in the United States. Sareen purchased Interstate Tire Distributor (ITD), a California-based wholesaler with six locations in four Western states, in October, 2015. In June 2016, Sareen made his second acquisition in 9 months with the purchase of Texas-based A to Z Tire & Battery, Inc. That part of the business has since been renamed Omnisource.  Timberland Tires  Introduced in November, 2014, Timberland Tires were born out of an idea between Sareen and global lifestyle brand Timberland. Timberland Tires is the first brand purposely designed and created with sustainability in mind. The tires feature a rubber formulation that is appropriate for the recycling of the tires at the end of their useful life into outsoles for Timberland shoes. Timberland Tires continues to receive recognition by some of the most influential organizations in the world when it comes to collaboration, innovation and sustainability. In May 2016, Timberland Tires won the WGSN Futures award in the category of Sustainable Design. Timberland Tires were also finalists of the 2016 Guardian Awards and also shortlisted as one of the finalists for the Institute for Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) 2016 Design for Recycling Award.  Commitment to Sustainability - Radar Tires and Timberland Tires  Sareen is highly committed to sustainable business practices. His vision to have all Omni United - Radar Tires products recycled at the end of their lifespans moved one step closer in October 2013 when flagship brand Radar Tires was certified Carbon Neutral. This accomplished a goal set over two years ago with Ernst & Young. This achievement is the result of a comprehensive twelve-month effort to measure the company's Radar Tires brands' global carbon footprint in accordance with certification standards. Omni United has achieved its goal of net zero carbon emissions through supporting wind energy projects, in Germany With his November 2014 launch of the Timberland Tires brand, Sareen announced a take back and recycling program to convert worn Timberland Tires into new outsoles of Timberland footwear. Liberty Tire Recycling will collect worn Timberland Tires after they have been changed out at authorized Timberland locations and sort the tires at its consolidation centers. From there, the used tires will be shipped to a North American tire recycling facility where they will be recycled into crumb rubber and further processed into sheet rubber for use in Timberland¬Æ footwear. The rubber will be mixed into an approved compound for outsoles that will ultimately be incorporated into Timberland¬Æ boots and shoes.  Partnership with The Breast Cancer Research Foundation  Sareen is also an ambassador to The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, based in New York. In 2012, he launched a pink side wall tire designed specifically to support the campaign. The pink side wall highlights the pink color of the fight again breast cancer. So far the company has donated over US$1.2 million to the cause.  Sports Marketing Programs   LPGA Sponsorship  In 2016, the company announced sponsorship of LPGA player Jodi Ewart Shadoff. As part of the agreement with Omni United, English-born Jodi Ewart Shadoff will wear the Radar Tires brand logo on her golf shirt and other apparel at all tournaments. Jodi continued to represent Radar Tires in the 2020 LPGA season.  Motorsports  In 2013, Radar Tires entered into the off-road racing and motorsports world in the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series (LOORRS), SCORE International Desert Series and TORC: The Off Road Championship. In these series, the company participates in short-course off-road desert racing and long course desert racing. Radar‚Äôs inaugural season featured the brand‚Äôs Renegade R5 M/T tire. Radar Tires won the Class 10 at the SCORE International Baja 500.  Rewa Vineyards   The Estate  GS Sareen has always had a love for fine wines and it is his ingenuity and adventurism that led him to Napa Valley to fulfill his desire of owning a vineyard and producing wine . It was in 2012 that he acquired a vineyard in Coombsville AVA and named it after his wife, Rewa. The estate spans over 43 acres and is located in the providential rocky knoll in the volcanic hills of Coombsville which has a geologic history dating back 9 million years.  The Wines  Currently the Vineyard produces two world class wines from the Sauvignon Blanc grapes planted on the lower Eastern slopes where the temperature is a few degrees cooler and perfectly suited for this varietal and a 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from the western slopes which are more gradual and get maximum sun throughout the day. The first vintage of Sauvignon Blanc was 2017 and the first vintage of the Cabernet Sauvignon was 2015. Both varietals have received great reviews from the critics and have been rated very high. In 2018 the team decided to plant some more grape varieties and Merlot and Malbec were planted. The 2020 vintage will be produced using some more varietals.  The Team  Celia Welch is recognized as one of the world‚Äôs finest winemakers. She grew up in Oregon and first learned about wine from her father, a home winemaker and collector. She graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Enology and honed her skills in the Pacific Northwest, New Zealand and Australia before settling in Napa Valley . Rewa Vineyards represents a significant project from perhaps the best terroir in the budding Coombsville AVA. Mike Wolf is a viticulturist who was raised just outside New York City and graduated from Alfred University with a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in history. He was first exposed to agriculture after moving to Ukiah in 1972 to help a friend manage his family farm. He moved to Napa Valley to supervise a large agricultural development in Pope Valley and then accepted a prestigious role with Beckstoffer Vineyards to manage their heralded vineyards, totalling over 500 acres. It was there that he became well respected by the valley‚Äôs top winemakers, laying the groundwork for the launch of Mike Wolf Vineyard Management in 1997. Today, he farms 800 acres for premium wine companies in Napa Valley.  Awards and Recognition  Throughout his career as the founding President and CEO of Omni United, Sareen has received many awards and recognitions. Most recently he was felicitated by the Honourable Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, India, Mr. Chouhan Shivraj on behalf of the state Government for having done pioneering work in his professional field, his achievements and for his contribution to global economy. He is the recipient of the 2017, 2016 and 2015 Singapore Enterprise 50 awards, the 2015 Ethical Corporation's Sixth Annual Responsible Business Awards, 2013 Distinguished Business Leader Award, and the 2013 DBS Insignia Spirit of Vision Prestige Award.

Early life Eliza Sharples was born in 1803 in Bolton, Lancashire into a prosperous middle-class manufacturing family. She was educated at a ladies college until the relatively late age of twenty. Both her home and school life instilled a strong commitment to Christian principles. Shortly after the death of her father, to whom she was very close, in December 1831, Sharples came across \\"The Republican\\" magazine. As a result, she lost her faith and started a correspondence with its editor, Richard Carlile. Personal life Sharples was the second (common-law) wife of Richard Carlile. When the fifteen-year-old Charles Bradlaugh needed somewhere to stay, after being accused of atheism by his pastor, Sharples provided accommodation for him. Writing In 1832, she edited Isis, a London publication. Sharples wrote The Glossary of the Bible, Chiefly Designed for Children (c. 1830). Career Sharples saw Frances Wright as a role model. Sharples first met Richard Carlile and Robert Taylor in Bolton during the Lancashire leg of their 1829 Infidel Mission. Her daughter‚Äôs memoirs provide some insight into how a respectable middle-class woman with a staunch Evangelical upbringing came to cross paths with the most notorious infidels of the day. Theophila Carlile Campbell, one of the four children to be born of the eventual union between Sharples and Carlile, suggests that her mother first became aware of her father in the years before 1829 when he dined at the home of a Liverpool banker, the father of a school friend of Sharples. Although Sharples claims not to have met Carlile on that occasion, it nevertheless sparked her interest, which was soon further heightened when she encountered a relative reading one of his early publications. Offered the use of her cousin‚Äôs library, which contained some of Carlile‚Äôs works, she thereafter sought more publications through a free-thought bookseller in Bolton, known only as Mr Hardie. Carlile‚Äôs philosophies, Sharples later wrote, prompted a deep transformation. She described herself as a ‚Äòbrand snatched from the fire‚Äô; she experienced a ‚Äònew birth‚Ä¶unto righteousness‚Äô‚Äîan intense emotional conversion not unlike that felt by William Knight from his seat in the audience at the Blackfriars Rotunda. Later life Carlile died intestate in 1843, leaving his family destitute. Sharples ran a freethinking coffee house in Hackney, where she met the 15-year-old Charles Bradlaugh and invited him to stay with her and her children. Sharples did not succeed as a businesswoman, and died in 1852, after 20 years of living in poverty.

It is located on Herm, the smallest of the Channel Islands open to the public. The Chapel is currently listed on the Register of Ancient Monuments and Protected Buildings for the States of Guernsey. Stained-glass window in St. Tugual's Chapel Small graveyard attached to St. Tugual's Chapel  History  The chapel, which incorporates an earlier structure, dates from the 11th century; but it has been suggested that the site has been of religious significance from the 6th century. It is uncertain if the chapel was named after Saint Tugual because he visited Herm; or if it was so called by Tugual's followers. The current chapel was built by Norman monks who lived on the island. When the Wood family took over the island's lease in 1949, they re-opened parts of the chapel; and cleared several windows. The Chapel featured on a 1970 stamp.  Restoration work  In 2010 and 2011, the chapel was closed for restoration work, in which there was re- roofing, repointing, re-rendering, and drainage installation. The States of Guernsey are responsible for the chapel's upkeep. The chapel re-opened with a special re-dedication service in May 2011.  Skeletons  During the works; two skeletons were found; that of an adult and that of a child. The skeletons were originally estimated to be between 400 and 500 years old. Soon, three more part skeletons were expected to be excavated; but eventually, within a 15m sq area; 40 skeletons were found, around 50% of which were children. The skeletons were taken to Guernsey by a team led by Philip de Jersey, then were returned to Herm for burial. The earliest bones dated were from the second half of the 10th century.

The first major British air raid took place on 13 September 1941, targeting Mainz Hauptbahnhof (Mainz main station). A total of 22 people died during this attack, which had originally been scheduled for Frankfurt am Main.  1942 to 1943  Ruins in front of the cathedral (1961) More small raids followed until 11 August 1942 when the RAF Bomber Command launched 158 bombers against Mainz. This raid followed the Area Bombing Directive of 5 February 1942, Directive No.4, issued by the British Air Ministry. This directive ordered RAF bombers to attack the German industrial workforce and the morale of the German populace through bombing German cities and their civilian inhabitants. During the following night, 200 tons of bombs were dropped, including white phosphorus bombs. The next night another 133 aircraft attacked the city, dropping approximately 180 tons of bombs, many of which hit the old city center and the Mainz Cathedral, or the Mainzer Dom. Other parts hit included the Neustadt and Mombach,World War II Database whose St. Nikolaus Church was destroyed by incendiary bombs. St. Stephen's Church was heavily damaged, St. John's Church was burnt out completely, and the Invalidenhaus for the disabled was ruined. The Eltzer Hof and the Bauhof burnt down. Hundreds of people died in the flames. Nonetheless, some quarters in the core city remained habitable. On 9 September 1942 Allied bombers bombed Bischofsheim. The air defences of Mainz were aided by an anti- aircraft battery set up on the premises of today's University of Mainz.  1944  In the course of the year 1944 the intensity of the bombing campaign increased. A British emergency drop during the night of 23 to 24 April led to multiple fire in parts of Ginsheim. Through this the evangelic church was destroyed.

History thumb The forum originally launched as Conservative Friends of Russia in 2012, a political interest group for those with an interest in Russian politics, business, history and culture, with the aim of strengthening relations between the British and Russian communities. The group described itself as \\"an organisation created for those with an interest in Russian politics, business, history and culture, with the aim of strengthening relations between the British and Russian communities and informing political decision making within both countries.\\" The group was launched in August 2012 at the Russian Embassy in London. Matthew Elliott was a founding member.T Snyder, The Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America (Penguin Random House 2018) 105. C Cadwalladr, 'Brexit, the ministers, the professor and the spy: how Russia pulls strings in UK' (4 Nov 2017) Guardian. The group's launch gained mixed reviews in the media from proponents and opponents of the conservatives, with some journalists questioning its neutrality whilst others supported its goals of fostering Russia‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations. The group had several notable Parliamentarians on its board, including former Defence and Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind as its Honorary President, and John Whittingdale MP, Andrew Rosindell MP, Nigel Evans MP, and Robert Buckland MP among its Honorary Vice Presidents. Activities of the Conservative Friends of Russia The group hosted events in London and at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham in 2012. It also subsidised its members to attend an event featuring international lawyers discussing the Pussy Riot incident, and hosted a debate on the US Presidential Election and its impact upon the relationship between the two countries. It was active in the campaign calling on the UK Foreign Office to allow British Arctic Veterans of World War Two to receive the Russian Ushakov Medal. On Remembrance Day 2012 it organised a letter signed by thirty two Members of Parliament demanding the veterans be allowed the medal. In December 2012 it claimed victory in its campaign (as the newly formed Westminster Russia Forum http://wrforum.org.uk/ as the Prime Minister David Cameron announced that a new medal would be created. Controversy The group's neutrality and support was questioned by the media, despite the group stating no political links or bias to Russia and made it clear that its funding comes from membership and events, by publishing its financial accounts. It also supplied the Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) with a full report showing financial statements and minutes of meetings to demonstrate that there was no impropriety. Nevertheless, on 23 November 2012, the group publicly attacked the then chairman of the All-party parliamentary group (APPG) on Russia, Labour MP Chris Bryant, through the publication of a press release featuring a 10-year old picture, extracted from a dating website, depicting the MP in underwear. The press release was coincidental with the chair of the All-party parliamentary group on Russia being due for renewal. Shortly afterwards, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, who had served as a minister under Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major, and was then chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, resigned from the group, saying he had been unhappy for some time about the group's behaviour and \\"political direction\\". At the end of November 2012 it emerged that the group's key contact at the Russian Embassy in London was First Secretary Sergey Nalobin, the son of a KGB/FSB general, whose brother also served in the FSB. Nalobin invited the group to hold its launch party in August in the Kensington garden of the Russian ambassador, Alexander Yakovenko. Renaming The group's Board lost all of its Conservative MPs amid allegations of being too close to the Russian authorities and it was rebranded as the Westminster Russia Forum, a non-partisan group, which claims to promote an open platform to debate various issues such as international diplomacy, energy security and internal political systems. The group was officially launched in late 2012 and has since gone on to host numerous events throughout the UK, covering a variety of topics such as LGBT rights in Russia, with guest speakers Peter Tatchell and Claire Harvey. Activities The group successfully campaigned to see British World War II veterans of the Arctic Convoy campaign be awarded their Ushakov Medals by the Russian Government in 2013. The campaign included a letter signed by thirty two Members of Parliament which was submitted to the Honours and Decorations (HD) Committee on Remembrance Day, requesting that the veterans be rewarded with a medal in recognition of the part they played in the vital Arctic Convoy missions throughout the Second World War.

The museum displays changing exhibits that reflect the history of the area, as well as conserving memorabilia from the Lunar Rendezvous festival, an annual celebration of the region's link to space exploration due to the presence of the Johnson Space Center.  History  Originally located on the corners of Houston and Moody Streets in Webster, Texas, the building that is now home to the Bay Area Museum was erected by the Webster Presbyterian Church in 1901 as a replacement for its original sanctuary, which was destroyed by the 1900 Galveston hurricane. In 1936, the church added an annex that included a stage, meeting hall, and kitchen. For many years this was the only church in Webster, and the site of many community events. After Webster Presbyterian Church built more modern facilities, the old building fell into disrepair. In 1979, Maggie Plumb DeNike, founder of the Lunar Rendezvous festival and Chairman of the festival's board, appeared with Chamber of Commerce representatives and local attorneys before the Harris County Commission to request approval to move the historic church building to the park grounds. The building was purchased from the Webster Presbyterian Church and moved to Clear Lake Park, from its original location. When restoration of the church was completed, the museum was formally dedicated on July 17, 1984. Sharon Dillard served as founding president, from 1984 to 1986. Among other artifacts, the museum's collections include mementos of the U.S. space program given by Lady Bird Johnson and other donors.  Administration  Initially, the museum was governed by a President and Board of Trustees. At present, administration and maintenance is handled through the Bay Area Museum Guild, an organization with nearly 200 members. The Guild is dedicated to promoting awareness of the museum, its facilities, functions and needs throughout the community.  Events and programs  The sanctuary and annex are available for small private events such as weddings and Museum Guild meetings and functions, while hosting the annual Lunar Rendezvous festival.

Legends of Dune Legends of Dune is a prequel trilogy of novels written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, set in Frank Herbert's Dune universe. The series takes place over 10,000 years before the events of the 1965 novel Dune, and chronicles the universe-spanning war against thinking machines that would eventually become known as the Butlerian Jihad. It also explores the origins of the families and organizations that populate the distinctive universe in other Dune works. The books in the series are: * The Butlerian Jihad (2002) * The Machine Crusade (2003) * The Battle of Corrin (2004) Plot The series explains that after our own time, humanity had become entirely complacent and dependent upon thinking machines; recognizing this weakness, a group of ambitious, militant humans calling themselves the Titans use this widespread reliance on machine intelligence to seize control of the entire universe. The Titans soon make the transition into cyborgs called cymeks; through the use of specialized interfaces, their brains are installed inside giant, mobile, mechanized \\"bodies.\\" These fearsome, weaponized bodies make the Titans virtually immortal and invincible. Their rule lasts for a century. Then, having mistakenly given one attendant artificial intelligence program too much autonomy, the Titans suddenly find themselves overthrown and enslaved by an AI consciousness calling itself Omnius that seizes control of the entire universe though the interconnected machine network. For over 900 years the Titans live in perpetual servitude to Omnius, cruelly subjugating humanity, quelling human insurrections and secretly plotting their own return to power. At the time of the Legends of Dune series, over 500 planets called the Synchronized Worlds are under complete machine control, their former human populations either enslaved or killed. The relatively few planets of remaining free humans are united under the League of Nobles, a government using what resources it has to defend the League Worlds against machine aggression. A prominent figure in the human rebellion is Serena Butler, the charismatic daughter of the League Viceroy; the murder of her young son at the hands of the independent robot Erasmus finally incites the Butlerian Jihad, with humanity mounting a decisive offense against machine rule. This crusade against the machines lasts for nearly a century, with much loss of human life but ending in human victory at the Battle of Corrin. The Jihad also gives rise to the Bene Gesserit, the Spacing Guild, the Sardaukar army, the Landsraad, and House Corrino, whose Padishah Emperors rule the universe for the next 10,000 years, until the events of Dune and the accession of Paul Atreides. Reception Dune: The Butlerian Jihad rose to No. 7 on The New York Times Best Seller list in its second week of publication. Dune: The Machine Crusade debuted at No. 7 on the list. The third installment, Dune: The Battle of Corrin, reached No. 9 on the New York Times list. Heroes of Dune Heroes of Dune is a planned tetralogy of novels by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson set in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. The potential series was initially referred to as Paul of Dune by the authors as early as 2004. These novels were intended to \\"fill in the story\\" between Frank Herbert's early Dune novels. The books in the series are: * Paul of Dune (2008) * The Winds of Dune (2009) Half of the story of Paul of Dune takes place between Frank Herbert's Dune (1965) and Dune Messiah (1969) as Paul's Jihad rages, Shaddam seeks to regain his throne and Princess Irulan accepts the \\"task of building the legend of Muad'Dib\\". She in turn chronicles Paul's early years (between the 2001 Brian Herbert/Anderson prequel Dune: House Corrino and Dune), which feature \\"his friendship with Duncan and Gurney and Duke Leto's War of Assassins against Grumman\\". The Winds of Dune (originally announced as Jessica of Dune) chronicles events between Frank Herbert's Dune Messiah (1969) and Children of Dune (1976). The final two novels in the series were to be called The Throne of Dune (formerly Irulan of Dune) and Leto of Dune (perhaps The Golden Path of Dune). However, in a July 2010 blog post Anderson announced that these novels had been postponed due to plans by Herbert and Anderson to publish a trilogy (later known as Great Schools of Dune) about \\"the formation of the Bene Gesserit, the Mentats, the Suk Doctors, the Spacing Guild and the Navigators, as well as the solidifying of the Corrino imperium.\\" Plot In Paul of Dune, Paul Atreides's childhood lessons in the political intrigues of the empire are juxtaposed with his current struggle to secure his control over it. His Fremen armies are spread across the universe in attempt to bring rebel worlds to heel, and Paul avoids one assassination attempt only to nearly die in another. In The Winds of Dune, Paul's disappearance into the desert has left a power vacuum, and his closest advisors struggle to determine what path his empire should take. Reception The Winds of Dune rose to No. 15 on The New York Times Best Seller list in its second week of publication. Great Schools of Dune Great Schools of Dune is a prequel trilogy of novels written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, set in Frank Herbert's Dune universe. A sequel to the Legends of Dune trilogy (2002-2004), the series takes place nearly a century after the events of Brian Herbert and Anderson's Dune: The Battle of Corrin (2004), in which the Army of Humanity finally defeats the thinking machine armies of Omnius. Now, the fledgling Bene Gesserit, Mentat and Suk Schools, as well as the Spacing Guild, are threatened by the independent anti-technology forces gaining power in the aftermath of the Butlerian Jihad. The Great Schools of Dune trilogy, first discussed by Anderson in a 2009 interview and later named by him in a 2010 blog post, chronicles the early years of these organizations, which figure prominently in the original Dune novels. Though the third and final novel was originally identified by Anderson as The Swordmasters of Dune in 2009, in 2014 Brian Herbert and Anderson confirmed that its title would be Navigators of Dune. On July 27, 2015, Anderson previewed the cover of Navigators of Dune on Twitter and noted its 2016 release. The books in the series are: * Sisterhood of Dune (2012) * Mentats of Dune (2014) * Navigators of Dune (2016) Plot In Sisterhood of Dune, the anti-technology Butlerian movement is gaining momentum under the leadership of the popular Manford Torondo. He and his forces are scouring the universe to cleanse humanity of its reliance on convenient technologies, destroying any machinery they can find. Torondo's growing power threatens the Corrino Emperor Salvador, as well as the Sisterhood on Rossak and the Mentat School on Lampadas, each of which harbors secret technology. Space travel tycoon Josef Venport also plots to salvage machinery which he believes can be useful in his business empire. Mentats of Dune finds Gilbertus Albans carefully managing his Mentat School under the watchful eye of the fanatical Butlerians, while Raquella Berto-Anirul seeks to rebuild her own Sisterhood School on Wallach IX. To secure his control of interstellar commerce and strike a blow against the Butlerians, Venport places a trade embargo on any planet which embraces Torondo's movement. Reception Sisterhood of Dune debuted at No. 23 on The New York Times Hardcover Fiction Best-Seller List, and Mentats of Dune was released at No. 17 on the same list. Publishers Weekly called Sisterhood a \\"shallow but fun blend of space opera and dynastic soap opera.\\" The Caladan Trilogy In July 2020, Herbert and Anderson announced a new trilogy of prequel novels called The Caladan Trilogy.

She served as √∂verhovm√§starinna in 1633-1634 and foster mother in 1639-1644 to Queen Christina of Sweden. She was also known for her donations to various churches. Early life Ebba Mauritzdotter was born to count Mauritz Stensson Leijonhufvud and Amalia von Hatzfeld: her paternal grandmother was her controversial name sake Ebba Lillieh√∂√∂k, after which her father and herself inherited the County of Raseborg. She married riksr√•d and chancellor count Svante Sture (d. 1616) in 1613, and riksr√•d and general governor Claes Horn of Kanckas (d. 1632) in 1618. As was the custom in the Swedish nobility until the late 18th-century, however, she kept her own name Leijonhufvud after marriage. In 1636, she became closely affiliated with Axel Oxenstierna, leader of the Regency Government of Queen Christina, through the marriage of her daughter (and only child) Anna Margareta Sture (1614-1646) to Johan Oxenstierna. In 1631, she accompanied the queen, Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg, to Germany, where she joined her second spouse Horn who served in the Thirty Years' War. Widowed the following year, she returned to Sweden with the niece of her late spouse, Agneta Horn, to whom she acted as guardian. In the famous memoirs of Agneta Horn, she is described as a \\"cold and heartless\\" foster parent. Court life In 1633, Ebba Leijonhufvud was appointed Mistress of the Robes to the underage monarch, queen Christina, with responsibility for the ladies-in- waiting of the queen. She kept this office for one year and was succeeded by Elisabeth Gyllenstierna. After the death of the queen's foster mother and aunt Catherine of Sweden, Countess Palatine of Kleeburg, the Royal Regency Council under Axel Oxenstierna saw a need to appoint a new foster mother to the underage monarch (her mother being exiled), which resulted in a reorganization of the queen's household. In order to avoid the young queen from being dependent upon a single individual and favorite mother figure, the Royal Council decided to split the office of head lady-in-waiting (responsible for the queen's female courtiers) and the office royal governess (or foster mother) in four, with two women appointed to share each office. Accordingly, in 1639 Ebba Leijonhufvud and Christina Natt och Dag was appointed to share the position of royal governess and foster mother with the title Upptuktelse- F√∂rest√•nderska ('Castigation Mistress'), while Beata Oxenstierna and Ebba Ryning was appointed to share the position of head lady-in-waiting, all four with the formal rank and title of Hovmastarinna.Marie-Louise Rod√©n: Drottning Christina : en biografi (2008) p. 62 This signified a permanent reorganization of the Swedish Royal Household: previously, there had been only one Mistress of the Robes with the title Hovm√§starinna ('Court Mistress'), but now, Beata Oxenstierna was additionally given the newly invented title of √ñverhovm√§starinna ('Chief Court Mistress'), and from the reign of Christina onward, there where to be one or two Hovm√§starinna and one √ñverhovm√§starinna at the Swedish Royal Court. The choice of Ebba Leijonhufvud and Christina Natt och Dag to the office of foster mother was officially motivated by their mutually reputed qualities of \\"honesty and virtue, seriousness and steadfastness\\",Erik Petersson: Maktspelerskan : drottning Kristinas revolt (2011) and in the case of Leijonhufvud in particular, her ideally educated daughter Anna Margareta was noted as an example of the great ability of her mother in raising a child. In reality, however, Ebba Leijonhufvud was the mother-in-law to the son of the Regent of the Guardian Government, Axel Oxenstierna, by that very same daughter, and Beata Oxenstierna and Ebba Ryning was also connected to the Oxenstierna Party, which is believed to have played a part in their appointments. Christina Natt och Dag for her part had good connections at court, her paternal grandmother Karin Gyllenstierna having been the chief lady-in-waiting to queen Catherine Jagiellon and princess Anna Vasa of Sweden. The Royal Council's method of giving queen Christina several foster mothers to avoid her forming an attachment to a single person seems to have been effective: Christina dies not mention her foster mothers directly in her memoirs and does not seem to have formed any attachment to either of them, nor do they seem to have played any part at court after their term in service ended. With some exceptions, such as Ebba Sparre, lady Jane Ruthven and Louise van der Nooth, Christina did not show any interest in any her female courtiers whatsoever, and she generally mentions them in her memoirs only to compare herself favorably toward them by referring to herself as more masculine than them.Marie-Louise Rod√©n: Drottning Christina : en biografi (2008) page 62 In 1639 she mentions her attitude toward her ladies in waiting in regard to Beata Oxenstierna and her daughter, maid of honor M√§rta Ulfsparre: \\"The Mistress of the Robes Lady Beata Oxenstierna and her daughter arrived just now. The more of them that comes here the worse it is\\" [...] \\"I despised everyone in my surroundings, particularly the women of my household, from whom I could not stand the smallest reproach.\\" Eva √ñsterberg, red (1997).

Early life Eliza Wright was born into poverty in York, probably in 1785. Her father died when she was only two, leaving his family destitute. According to her sketchy autobiographical memoirs, Macauley's first career was as an actress. She began by performing in barns in Kent, but by 1805 she had moved to London, where for the next twenty years she went from one low-paid and badly-reviewed theatrical production to another. Eventually a long period of unemployment forced her to depart the stage, leaving in a flurry of tracts denouncing the selfishness of her more illustrious male colleagues and the philistinism of the metropolitan theatre owners. Nothing daunted, she immediately began to turn her performing talents in other directions. The late 1820s found her preaching from the pulpit of a little ‚ÄòJacobinical‚Äô chapel in Grub Street, and from there she moved to the platforms of Owenite co- operation, becoming, in her own words, a ‚Äògood Co-operative woman‚Äô. Involvement in Owenism Owenism in the early 1830s was a vigorous working- class movement, promoting economic self-help through co-operative manufacture and trading, and encouraging the establishment of communities of mutual association. Its ethos was utopian‚Äìsocialist and democratic, and the equality of the sexes was an important theme in its propaganda. All this appears to have been well suited to Macauley's insubordinate temperament, and by 1832 she was deeply involved in London Owenite activities. She served as manager of the largest labour exchange (an Owenite institution where workers exchanged goods and services on the basis of the number of labour hours invested in them), and became a well-known lecturer, delivering lectures on subjects as varied as financial reform, child development, the evils of Christian orthodoxy, and women's right to full social equality. ‚ÄòWomen have too long been considered as playthings, or as slaves‚Äô, she told a London audience in July 1832, ‚Äòbut I hope the time is at hand, when we shall hold a more honourable rank in the scale of creation‚Äô. She also offered acting lessons to her fellow socialists, including to a group of French Saint-Simonians visiting London in the early 1830s. Writing career All these activities were undoubtedly motivated as much by economic necessity as by Owenite socialist conviction. Employment opportunities for single women such as Macauley were few and far between, and the small sums paid by the Owenites to their publicists would have been very welcome. Writing for publication was a more typical resource for such women‚Äîand Macauley also turned her hand to this, penning small volumes of essays on edifying topics, ‚Äòpoetic effusions‚Äô, and other such ladylike potboilers, while at the same time also producing a steady stream of pamphlets denouncing her enemies in the theatre, attacking the magistracy, and defending various patrons against scurrilous detractors‚Äîthe traditional stuff of Grub Street hacks. But ‚Äòliterary pursuits are the most arduous of any ‚Ä¶ and subject to the most mortifications‚Äîparticularly for females‚Äô, as she complained. Debtors' prison By 1835 she was to be found publishing her memoirs (funded by subscription) from a cell in the Marshalsea debtors' prison. She died in York, while on a lecture tour, on 22 February 1837.

Characteristics The country features in Bradbury's novels Rates of Exchange (1983) and Why Come to Slaka? (1986). It is described by its leader Comrade-General I. Vulcani as \\"a nation proud of its socialistik emulations.\\" The first novel relates the misadventures of a visiting British academic, the second is a pastiche guide book to the country. Slaka is also the name of the country's capital; another of the country's major towns is Glit. The country's language is known as Slakan. Slaka was further explored in television, in two mini-series scripted by Bradbury, The Gravy Train, and a sequel The Gravy Train Goes East. Critics have proposed Slaka to be a satire of Romania during the 1980s, or possibly Bulgaria. National opera The country's national opera is Vedontakal Vrop (The Secret Unmasked) by the composer Z. Leblat who also wrote the libretto. The opera is described in Why Come to Slaka? as \\"one of the highest treasures of the great Slakan tradition.\\" The opera, which in Rates of Exchange is said to last about five hours, was originally performed before Bishop 'Wencher' Vlam and his guests at the Bishop's castle, the Cast'ullu Vlam, in the city of Slaka in 1770. The score was then lost for 200 years but was rediscovered, missing only act 3, in 1970. In Rates of Exchange, the restored opera was premiered in 1982 but in Why Come to Slaka?, the premiere was said to have been in 1984. In either case, Bradbury set the event in the Oper Prole'tanuu Slakam, under the baton of Leo Fenycx, in a season which also included works by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek. Bradbury goes on to describe the work to be considered by Slakan scholars to have been an important inspiration for the operas of Mozart and Rossini. The traditions of Leblat are maintained by the annual \\"Z. Leblat Musicology Festivi\\" which is held on a mountain near another Slakan town, Glit. The role of the opera in Bradbury's book is seen by Vinod Gopi as symbolising the 'play with desire' seen by Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer as a characteristic of mass culture. \\"The maximum play of desire is seen in the opera Vedontakal Vrop ... The characters appear on the stage wearing exotic and extravagant costumes. The plot shows a proliferation of characters who have dressed themselves in a way that obscures their identity ... [presenting] a domain of decadence and excess.\\" According to the Slakan writer F. Plitplov, \\"the plot of Vedontakal Vrop is so laughable that no one can fail to take a delight in its immense confusions.\\" Its characters include a magician (in some opinions an apothecary), a student disguised as an old man, a girl disguised as a soldier, a servant who is turned into a bear, servants of a shah and villagers with a large cake. The resolution of the plot is not clearly outlined by Bradbury, one of whose characters explains \\"in the ending all becomes clear, if not in the way those people intend\\", adding that for an opera \\"such confusions are essential.\\" See also *List of fictional countries *List of fictional literature featuring opera Notes Sources  Fantasy worlds Fictional universes Fictional European countries Fictional musical works ","title":"Slaka (fiction)"},{"id":"41209641","text":"The Small Price of a Bicycle is the second studio album by The Icicle Works.

In 2008 she was elected mayor of Ch√©pica, a small commune in Colchagua Province, after running unsuccessfully for the same office four years before. She was re-elected to the office in 2012. In 2013, she was named as one of the 100 Leading Women of Chile by Mujeres Empresarias and the Econom√≠a y Negocios (Economy and Business) section of El Mercurio newspaper. Biography Early life Rebeca Cofr√© Calder√≥n was born on 23 August 1962, to Luis Antonio Cofr√© Far√≠as and Rebeca de las Nieves Calder√≥n Segovia, in Providencia, a district (comuna) of Santiago. In the 1970s Cofr√©'s family moved to Pichilemu, then in Colchagua Province, where she attended the Escuela Doctor D√≠az Lira (currently the Colegio de la Preciosa Sangre) with her sisters Francisca Javiera and Carolina de las Nieves. She attended high school at the Liceo C-25 (currently the Liceo Agust√≠n Ross Edwards), with her class being the first to graduate from the school. Cofr√© married in second nuptials Sergio Gustavo Reinaldo Schlack Harnecker (born 13 February 1928), on 16 February 2002, in Nancagua, Colchagua Province. The couple has resided in Ch√©pica, a city south of Nancagua, ever since. She has three children. Political career According to her biography on the Ch√©pica government website, Cofr√© decided to start her political career in 2000 because of her \\"great motivation for the protection of the people's dignity, mostly of the working women\\". Pichilemu News, an online newspaper from Pichilemu, states that she \\"emulated\\" her husband, farmer Sergio Schlack, who was a National Renewal regional adviser representing Cardenal Caro Province in the 1990s. From left to right: deputy Juan Carlos Latorre, officials from the Library of the National Congress of Chile, deputy Ram√≥n Barros Montero, and Cofr√© during a ceremony at a local school, May 2010. As a member of right-wing party Independent Democrat Union (UDI), she ran as a candidate for mayor of Ch√©pica in 2004, competing against four other candidates: Leonel Arturo Padilla Pe√±a (Humanist Party, PH), Ra√∫l Araya Donoso (independent), Gast√≥n Retamales Fuenzalida (independent), and Miriam del Carmen Rodr√≠guez Cruz (Socialist Party, PS). Rodr√≠guez Cruz won the election, garnering 3,546 votes (47.01%) out of 7,543 votes cast. Cofr√©, in contrast, obtained 3,260 votes (43.22%). Cofr√© ran again as a candidate for mayor of Ch√©pica in 2008, obtaining 4,931 votes (62.71%) out of 7,863, winning against incumbent mayor Rodr√≠guez Cruz, who obtained 2,932 votes (37.29%). Cofr√© took office as mayor of Ch√©pica on 6 December 2008. A February 27, 2010 earthquake destroyed most of the historic centre of Ch√©pica. Among the destroyed buildings were the local church, the Fundaci√≥n las Rosas (Las Rosas Foundation) house, the firefighters' headquarters, and small shops, which according to Cofr√© were close to 200 years old. The local council was forced to hold meetings at an indoor court. Cofr√© aimed to recover \\"whatever it [was] possible\\". In November 2010, the municipality conducted a festival, for the first time, named the Festival de la Esquila, which consisted of sheep shearing, Chilean typical games, a craft, gastronomic and cultural fair, and the performances of Potro Bret√≥n de Monta√±a and the Sonora Juventud from Peumo. On the following year, in July, Cofr√© announced the creation of a commerce promotion office, after a meeting with local businessmen and government authorities. Cofr√© ran for re-election as mayor of Ch√©pica in the 2012 election, running against Miriam del Carmen Rodr√≠guez Cruz, from the Socialist Party, and Antonio Cerpa Plaza, an independent supported by the Humanist Party. Cofr√© won the election, obtaining 4,483 votes (55.9%) to Rodr√≠guez Cruz's 3,161 votes (39.4%) and Cerpa Plaza's 379 votes (4.7%). Rebeca Cofr√© was named one of the 100 Leading Women of Chile in November 2013. In January 2013, it was announced by Cofr√© and the local priest Claudio Fuenzalida that the San Antonio de Padua church, badly damaged by the 2010 earthquake, would be re-constructed. Later that year, in November 2013, Cofr√© was named as one of the 100 Mujeres L√≠deres de Chile (100 Leading Women of Chile) by Mujeres Empresarias and the Econom√≠a y Negocios (Economy and Business) section of the El Mercurio newspaper. She accepted the award at the newspapers' headquarters in Vitacura on November 26, 2013, in a ceremony attended by personalities such as President Sebasti√°n Pi√±era Echenique and First Lady Cecilia Morel Montes, who was also named one of the 100 Leading Women of Chile.

Life  Erika Fromm was born Erika Oppenheimer in Frankfurt, the daughter of physician, Siegfried Oppenheimer, and Clementine Oppenheimer (n√©e Stern) who died weeks after giving birth. She developed an early interest in psychoanalysis and the writings of Sigmund Freud. She decided on an academic career and graduated in 1933 with a PhD from the University of Frankfurt, where she studied with Max Wertheimer, the father of Gestalt theory. In the following years she moved to the Netherlands to escape rising Nazism in Germany, and worked as a research associate and the director of a research laboratory. In 1936, she became engaged to Paul Fromm, a wine merchant, whom she later married; Paul was also a cousin of psychoanalyst Erich Fromm. In 1938, the couple emigrated to the United States. From 1939 to 1940, Fromm was a research assistant in the department of psychiatry at the University of Chicago. From 1943 to 1948, she launched a program for rehabilitation of war veterans. She joined the faculty of the university in 1961. Fromm served as the editor of the International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis and co-editor of The Bulletin of the British Society of Experimental and Clinical Hypnosis. From 1972 to 1973 she was president of the division of psychological hypnosis of the American Psychological Association. From 1971 to 1974 she was the president of the American Board of Psychological Hypnosis, and from 1975 to 1977 she was the president of the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis.  Work  In her early works, Fromm questioned some of Sigmund Freud's discoveries and looked for ways to use hypnosis as a more effective method than psychoanalysis to help people, since she viewed psychoanalysis as rather a treatment for the wealthy. As she matured as a clinical physician, theorist, and researcher, she turned her attention to the nature of human intuition, creativity, dreams, and hypnosis. Erika Fromm studied hypnosis as a path to the unconscious, similar to Freud's dream analysis. When used correctly, hypnosis may be more effective and faster than psychoanalysis when working on problems. Psychoanalysis and hypnosis were previously characterized by mutual distrust, despite Freud's suggestion that the unconscious mind could be accessed through hypnosis. Fromm campaigned against the American Psychoanalytic Association's stance that psychoanalysis required a medical degree and co-founded the Psychologists Interested in the Study of Psychoanalysis which evolved into APA's Division 39.

The parish, which lies about halfway between the towns of Holsworthy and Bideford, is surrounded clockwise from the north by the parishes of Parkham, Buckland Brewer, Bulkworthy, West Putford, and Woolfardisworthy. In 2001 its population was 103, slightly lower than the 125 residents it had in 1901. The western boundary of the parish is formed by the River Torridge and the land rises from the river to over 200 m. near the top of Melbury Hill in the north. Tumuli on the high ground provide evidence for early inhabitants here. The parish church, dedicated to St Philip and St James the Less, was extensively restored in 1882, but has since been de-consecrated and used as a farm building, though by 2004 both the building and its churchyard were overgrown. Two farmhouses in the parish are of interest. Mambury was a freehold estate from its origin in the 12th century, and Winslade, near the top of Melbury Hill, was the home of John Wynslade who was executed for his part in the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549.

Life Wilhelmina Bonde was the daughter of the courtier count Klaes Lewenhaupt and Wilhemina Kristina Beck-Friis. She was introduced to court and served as hovfr√∂ken (maid of honor) to queen Josephine in 1844‚Äì1846. She married the ceremony master of the royal court, baron Carl Jedvard Bonde, in 1846, and settled into his residence in the capital during the winters and Ericsberg Castle during the summers. Bonde is described as a loyal royalist with an elegant and imposing manner, and had a leading role within the Swedish high society life. She exerted charity toward the tenants at her spouse's estate. In 1857, she was appointed to the post of senior lady-in-waiting or hovm√§starinna to the new princess Sophia of Nassau upon her arrival in Sweden. Senior lady-in-waiting to the queen In 1860, she was appointed √∂verhovm√§starinna (Mistress of the Robes) to queen Louise in succession to countess Stefanie Hamilton, the highest rank for a female at the royal Swedish court. This position made her the head of all the female courtiers in the court of the queen with the rank of Excellency, outranking also the majority of males and given superior status with responsibility of all the ladies-in-waiting of the queen's court. She accepted the position out of personal friendship with Louise and the condition that she would be allowed to delegate her tasks to one of the ladies-in- waiting when her private life demanded to, and she normally left the daily affairs to others. Bonde had a good relationship with queen Louise, who counted upon her to rectify those ladies-in-waiting which aroused the queen's jealousy by attracting attention from the king.Rundquist, Angela, Bl√•tt blod och liljevita h√§nder: en etnologisk studie av aristokratiska kvinnor 1850-1900, Carlsson, Diss.

Definition Bhikkhu Bodhi states: :The twofold wieldiness has the characteristic of the subsiding of unwieldiness (akamma√±√±abhƒÅva) in the mental body and consciousness, respectively. Its function is to crush unwieldiness. It is manifested as success of the mental body and consciousness in making something an object. Its proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness. It should be regarded as opposed to the remaining hindrances, which create unwieldiness of the mental body and consciousness. Nina van Gorkom explains: :Kamma√±√±atƒÅ can be translated as wieldiness or workableness. The AtthasƒÅlinƒ´ (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 131) explains that they suppress unwieldiness in cetasikas and citta, and that they should be regarded as ‚Äúbringing faith in objects of faith, and patient application in works of advantage, and are like purity of gold.‚Äù :When there is wieldiness, citta and cetasikas are like gold which has been made workable. The Mula-Tƒ´kƒÅ expresses this as follows: ::Workableness signifies that specific or suitable degree of pliancy or softness which makes the gold, that is, the mind, workable. While the mind is in the flames of passion it is too soft to be workable, as molten gold is. If, on the contrary, the mind is too rigid then it is comparable to untempered gold. :Wieldiness is the opponent of the ‚Äúhindrances‚Äù, such as sensuous desire (kamacchanda) and anger or hate (vyapada), which cause mental unwieldiness.

Plot A Macedonian family from Bitola at the turn of the twentieth century tries to survive, preserve its roots and remain together. Following their father‚Äôs death, two sisters and a brother remain alone: the older and quieter sister ELENI and the younger ANDJA and DUKO ‚Äì the discontented and rather short-tempered twins. Afflicted by her father‚Äôs refusal to let her be with the man she loves ‚Äì the young Turkish cadet, Kemal ‚Äì Eleni has decided to dedicate her life to waiting. Her younger sister, searching for Damjan, her young fianc√© ‚Äì her brother‚Äôs best friend and leader of the insurgents against the Turks ‚Äì falls captive to the murderous and slighted Osman, a renegade from the Sultan‚Äôs authority. Osman becomes enamoured of Andja and murders Damjan, despite or rather precisely because of the fact that Anja trades for Damjan‚Äôs freedom the only valuable thing she has ‚Äì her virginity. Broken and unable to give him again what she has already given him, she spends her days in a harem as the most cared for blossom that has lost its fragrance. Duko becomes obsessed with vengeance, while Osman becomes obsessed with love. In order to get Andja to love him, he would do anything for her. To this end, he also uses his troops and his most loyal ‚Äúwatchdog‚Äù, Rasim, his man for the dirty jobs, the sole person who understands him entirely and who is prepared to lay down even his own life for him. Torn between her love for one Turk and her hatred for another, Eleni sets out to look for Andja. From a passive spinster, she becomes a fighter for women‚Äôs rights, advocating freedom, a more modern society and abolition of harems‚Ä¶. She communicates her ideas to Kemal in her letters that she never stops sending. These are precisely the ideas to which he dedicates his entire life. The eldest sister Eleni remains alone. She sees Kemal only one more time before she surrenders her life to eternal silence. Side plot: Edisse, a French prostitute of the highest class sets out on a journey from Paris to the Sultan who has purchased her and aboard the Orient Express encounters Ikonomo a Macedonian merchant who finances Osman and she falls in love with him. Although he too falls in love with her, he soon realises that these are dangerous times and hands her over to Osman who, in turn, needs to hand her over to the Sultan. There she meets Andja and her sister Eleni. This is also the only time these three women are at the same place. When Edisse finally reaches the Sultan, he is already dead. She returns to Paris as a witness of as many as three unfulfilled Balkan loves that have fallen victim to the relentless course of the new time, which would eventually be characterised, among other things, by the struggle forequality.

Carle was described by Maclean's in 1998 as being so close to Chr√©tien as to be almost a member of the Chr√©tien family. Carle was born in Montreal, Quebec, the son of Robert and Gervaise (n√©e Loignon) and was educated successively at Coll√®ge Jean-de-Br√©beuf, Coll√®ge Andr√©-Grasset and the Universit√© de Montr√©al. Carle served one of the vice-presidents of the Liberal Party in 1983-84, as president of the Quebec wing of the Young Liberals in 1984-85 and as an aide to Chr√©tien between 1984-1986. In 1984, Carle had supported John Turner against Chr√©tien, but when Chr√©tien asked him at a meeting why he had supported an Anglo against a fellow Qu√©b√©cois, leading a guilt-stricken Carle to defect over to the Chr√©tien camp.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 page 199 Chr√©tien soon grew fond of Carle, and hired him on as an assistant. On February 27, 1986, Carle attended the meeting between Chr√©tien and John Turner when Chr√©tien resigned, leading Carle to break down in tears.Jeffrey, Brooke Divided Loyalties: The Liberal Party of Canada, 1984 - 2008, Toronto: University of Toronto Press pages 52-53. Starting in 1986, Carle worked as a public affairs consultant with MediaProfile, and served as the public affairs director for BCP Advertising between 1987-89. When Carle was short of money in the 1980s, Chr√©tien allowed Carle to live rent-free in his basement at his Ottawa house.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 page 199. On 7 October 1989, he married Marie Elizabeth Thorne and has two children. Starting in 1990, Carle resumed his career as Chr√©tien's special executive assistant following his patron's return to politics when he became leader of the Liberal Party. Carle was so close to Chr√©tien that he was widely seen within the Liberal Party as Chr√©tien's \\"surrogate son\\".Jeffrey, Brooke Divided Loyalties: The Liberal Party of Canada, 1984 - 2008, Toronto: University of Toronto Press page 198. When Chr√©tien became prime minister, he appointed Carle to be his director of operations at the Prime Minister's Office, a post that Carle held until he retired from the PMO in February 1998. As the director of operations at the PMO Carle was described as very efficient to the point that one Liberal complained that Carle gave the impression that he was working in a dictatorship rather than a democracy. In 1997, Carle was named Commander of the Victorian Order by Elizabeth II. During his time at the PMO, Carle was responsible for organizing the security for the November 1997 APEC summit in Vancouver that saw the RCMP crush demonstrators protesting against human rights abuses in China and Indonesia. On 7 August 2001, a report was issued by Judge Ted Hughes, which cleared Chr√©tien of wrongdoing at the APEC summit, but stated that Carle had improperly pressured the RCMP to attack the protesters.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 page 328. Judge Hughes accused Carle of \\"throwing his weight around\\" and attempting to interfere with security arrangements.Linda Diebel, \\"Carle a loyal hatchet man\\", Toronto Star, 3 March 2004, A1. Hughes concluded that the RCMP had used excessive force that was in violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms as the purpose of the RCMP actions were to silence the protesters, thereby violating the freedom of speech guaranteed by the Charter. After leaving the PMO in 1998, Carle took up a post as vice-president responsible for corporate affairs at the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDBC). Patrick Lavelle, the chairman of the Business Development Bank, tried to block Carle's appointment on the grounds that he was unsuitable for the post, but after a meeting with Carle's patron Chr√©tien, felt he had \\"no choice\\", but to accept Carle.Martin, Lawrence, Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 page 239. Carle played a role in the Sponsorship scandal. Carle admitted to the Gomery Commission in 2005 that he had created a $125, 000 phoney paper trail to hide a sponsorship deal while at the BDBC. Carle transferred money from the Public Works Department through the BDBC to a Montreal TV producer so that the public would not learn the federal government had spent $125,000 dollars on the TV series Le Canada Millennaire. When Justice John Gomery asked Carle that \\"If this were a drug deal, it would be called money-laundering\\", to which Carle replied \\"You're not wrong\\". Carle argued that his actions were justified because: \\"I felt it was a benefit for the bank to get an extra $125,000 in advertising without having to pay its own money, I did not do this in bad faith. We were kind of a transmission belt.\\" In September 2001, Carle became chief of operations at the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal, which received a doubling of federal sponsorship money by the Public Works ministry headed by Alfonso Gagliano, and then what the journalist Lawrence Martin called a highly unusual retroactive grant of $100,000. In April 2002, Carle left his post at the Just for Laughs festival for \\"personal reasons\\". Besides attracting controversy for his role in the sponsorship scandal, Carle was also involved in the Grand-M√®re Affair. Carle was involved in the firing of Fran√ßois Beaudoin, president of the BDBC, in 1999 after he attempted to call in the loan to the Grand-M√®re Inn. Beaudoin sued for wrongful dismissal following his sacking. In February 2004, Beaudoin won his wrongful dismissal suit against the Business Development Bank of Canada. Justice Andre Denis ruled in favor of Beaudoin's claim that he was fired for political reasons in 1999 for trying to call in the loan on the Grand-M√®re Inn, ruled that Carle was guilty of making false criminal and civil charges of wrongdoing against Beaudoin to discredit him for suing the bank, accused Carle of committing perjury during the trial and declared given the \\"unspeakable injustice\\" Beaudoin had suffered, told the government not to appeal his ruling because they would be wasting taxpayers' money if they did. In March 2004, Carle was named as someone involved in the sponsorship scandal. Charles Guit√© claimed in 2004 that he regularly met with Carle when the latter was chief of operations at the PMO together with Jean Pelletier, Chr√©tien's chief of staff, to discuss what events to spend sponsorship money on, and how much. During the Gomery commission hearings in 2005, Lucienne Robillard testified that she was very surprised that Carle had been put in charge of Treasury Board policies on communication, public opinion polls and advertising, saying such a job was not normally performed by \\"political staff\\" from the PMO such as Carle. In his report on responsibility for the sponsorship scandal, Justice Gomery ruled that Guit√©'s claim that he received his instructions from Pelletier and Carle was indeed the truth, and Carle in 1995 had helped Jean Brault of Groupaction advertising firm get in touch with Guit√©. During the 2008 election, St√©phane Dion told the media that Carle had some sort of role with the Liberal campaign, through he himself was not entirely sure what it was, only to have that statement denied later the same day by one of his aides, Nancy Girard.

In his early racing career he showed consistent form and was placed in several important races, but showed marked improvement in the autumn of 1980. He was considered an unlucky loser when narrowly beaten in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and then traveled to the United States where he won the Washington, D.C. International Stakes. At the end of the year he was officially the best racehorse trained in France. In the following spring he won the Prix d'Harcourt and Prix Ganay but his form deteriorated thereafter and he was beaten in his remaining six races. He made no impact as a sire of winners. Background Argument was a dark-coated bay horse with a white coronet on his right hind foot bred in France by Pierre Ribes. Argument was by far the best horse sired by Kautokeino, who won the Prix Juign√© on his debut before his racing career was ended by injury when finishing third to Sassafras in the 1970 Prix La Force. He was one of at least five winners produced by the mare Arantelle. The colt raced in the colours of his breeders' wife and was sent into training with John Cunnington Jr. at Chantilly. Racing career 1979: two-year-old season After winning a race over 1200 metres on his racecourse debut, Argument was moved up in class and distance for the group Three Prix La Rochette over 1600m at Longchamp Racecourse on 2 September. Ridden by Jean-Claude Desaint, he started the 9/4 second favourite and finished second, beaten a neck by Un Reitre, with the future Grand Crit√©rium winner Dragon two lengths away in third place. Two weeks later he started second favourite for the Prix des Ch√™nes over the same course and distance but finished fourth behind In Fijar. 1980: three-year-old season Argument began his second season by winning the Prix Mary over 1600m at Saint-Cloud Racecourse in April. He was then moved up to Group One class for the first time for the Poule d'Essai des Poulains. Starting at odds of 13/1 he finished fourth behind In Fijar, Moorestyle and Ruscelli, but was promoted to third when Ruscelli was disqualified for causing interference. Argument was moved up in distance for the Prix Lupin over 2100m at Longchamp on 18 May. He started a 21/1 outsider and finished second, beaten half a length by Belgio, with In Fijar in third. In the Prix du Jockey-Club at Chantilly Racecourse on 8 June, Argument produced his worst effort of the season as he finished last of the fourteen runners behind the 54/1 outsider Policeman. On 21 July Argument was sent to Belgium for the Grand Prix Prince Rose over 2200m at Ostend and won the race by two lengths from Dhausli and Strong Gale. He returned to France in August for the Prix de la C√¥te Normande over 2000m in which he was beaten a head by Glenorum, to whom he was conceding nine pounds. He then traveled to Germany for the Grosser Preis von Baden in which he finished fifth behind Nebos: Desaint was fined by the local racecourse stewards for his riding performance in a rough and slowly run race. On 5 October, Argument started a 74/1 outsider in a field of twenty for France's most prestigious race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400m at Longchamp. Desaint employed exaggerated waiting tactics and Argument turned into the straight fifteen lengths behind the leader Ela-Mana-Mou. Under a vigorous ride from Desaint, Argument made rapid progress in the last 400 metres, overtaking horse after horse before catching Ela-Mana-Mou in the final strides to finish second, half a length behind the filly Detroit. In their annual Racechorses of 1980, the independent Timeform organisation described him as an unlucky loser who would have won had he not been given so much ground to make up. After his run in the Arc, Argument was bought privately (for a sum reported to be \\"in excess of $1 million\\"), by the partnership of Bruce McNall and Berry Gordy and was transferred to the stable of Maurice Zilber. His new owners accepted an invitation for the colt to represent France in the Washington, D.C. International at Laurel Park Racecourse on 8 November when he was ridden for the first time by Lester Piggott. Zilber expressed his confidence before the race, describing the colt as \\"a champion ... he has everything\\". Starting the 2.4/1 favourite, Argument raced in mid-division before moving forward approaching the final turn. He accelerated into the lead a furlong from the finish and won by almost two lengths from the American mare The Very One. A protest lodged against the winner by The Very One's rider, Jorge Vel√°squez, was rejected by the racecourse stewards. 1981: four-year-old season Alain Lequeux took over as Argument's jockey in 1981 and rode him to success in his first two races. On his seasonal debut at Longhcamp in April he produced a strong finish to win the 2000m Prix d'Harcourt by a head from Katowice, with Detroit in fourth. Argument started favourite for the Group One Prix Ganay at the same course on 3 May, and produced an impressive performance, sprinting clear of the field and winning by three lengths from Armistice Day and In Fijar. Argument never won again. He failed in two races at Saint-Cloud, being disqualified after finishing third in the Prix Jean de Chaudenay and then sweating up badly before running unplaced behind Akarad in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. On 30 August, Argument was sent to Chicago to represent France in the inaugural running of the Arlington Million, then the world's most valuable horse race, and finished sixth behind John Henry. Argument's final European race came in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on 4 October when he started at odds on 34/1 and made steady progress in the straight to finish sixth in a field of twenty-four runners behind Gold River. For his final two races, Argument competed in North America, finishing fourth behind Open Call in the Canadian International Stakes and seventh to Providential in the Hollywood Turf Cup. Assessment In the official French rating for two-year-olds in 1979, Argument was rated ten pounds inferior to the top-rated Dragon, a colt he had beaten in the Prix la Rochette. In the following year, Timeform rated Argument on 133 (four pounds below the sprinter Moorestyle) and named him the season's best middle-distance horse. In the official International Classification he was rated the best horse trained in France and equal-second among all European racehorses, level with Ela-Mana-Mou and one pound below Moorestyle. In the following year he was given a rating of 129 by Timeform and was rated six pounds behind the top-rated older horse Northjet in the International Classification. Stud record Argument was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in the United States, before later returning to France. He was not a success, siring few winners, none of them in the highest class. His last reported foals were born in 1997.

Fideicommissum is a public artwork by the Swedish artist Ann-Sofi Sid√©n, originally created in 2000 for the Wan√•s Sculpture Park in Sk√•ne, Sweden. The work is an edition of six. History The first edition of Fideicommissum was placed in the Wan√•s Sculpture Park, which is situated at Wan√•s Castle in Sk√•ne. Description Name The title Fideicommissum refers to the former legal institution of the entail, under which estates and other family properties were passed down from one generation to the next, often benefitting the eldest son. In Sweden, a law abolishing entailed estates was implemented in 1964. Sid√©n's sculpture is located on the shore of a pond, with a view of the castle, which was entailed until 1978. The title Fideicommissum and the placement of the sculpture emphasize that the work refers to a staking out of territory. Composition Fideicommissum is a bronze cast of the artist herself squatting down to urinate. The artwork functions as a fountain and makes reference to the fountain motifs of young males urinating. Sid√©n conceived the idea for the sculpture in 1999 during a visit to the Wan√•s Sculpture Park, when she was working on a film and had to retire to the bushes to relieve herself. According to the artist, the urinating narrative echoes to a primitive way to mark a territory. The composition of the artwork has historical references. The sculpture's hair, sandals and folds of clothing are modelled on Roman, Greek and Etruscan sculptures. Editions The first version of Fideicommissum was made for the Wan√•s Sculpture Park. Another is at Ekebergparken Sculpture Park in Oslo, Norway. Sid√©n also documented the installation of the first edition of the sculpture at the sculpture park in Wan√•s.

It was founded in 1877 as a mining camp and later evolved into a town. It was purchased by the Homestake Mining Company and was destroyed in 1982 to make way for a new mine. History In the 1870s, four men-Moses and Fred Manuel, Hank Herney, and Alex Engh-entered the area on the hunt for gold. They each filed a claim in Bobtail Gulch on February 21, 1876. That spring, they discovered a rich lode, and on April 9, 1876, they located it under the name Homestake. The claim was later bought by men from California, who formed the Homestake Mining Company. Used as the first headquarters of the Homestake, Terraville was founded in 1877 and became a home for the miners-and their families-of the local mines, including the Caledonia, Terra, and Deadwood. A tunnel was built by the company to connect Terraville to Lead. This tunnel was used both to carry ore from the Homestake Mine to the smelters in Terraville and also as a path for residents to travel between the towns. In 1880, 775 people lived in the town, making it the fifth-largest town in the Black Hills at that time. During Terraville's golden years, 220 stamp mills were in operation. The town grew to include several stores; bars; churches, the most notable and longest-surviving of which was the Terraville Methodist Church; a schoolhouse; a hospital; boarding houses; and several houses. 280 steps connected various parts of the town and the surrounding area and mines. Water rights were secured for the town by the company. In 1900, approximately 700 people used the town's post office. The Homestake Mining Company later moved its headquarters and mining activities to Lead. By the 1970s, most of the residents of Terraville traveled to Lead for shopping and work. Terraville didn't have a mayor or law enforcement, except for the county sheriff. In the summer of 1982, the post office closed, the town was destroyed, and the 723 residents were forced to move when the Homestake Mining Company decided to create an open cut mine at Terraville. The Homestake called it the Terraville Test Pit Project. Every building, most of them at least 100 years old, was torn down; at 102 years old, the Terraville Methodist Church was the oldest operating church west of the Mississippi River at the time of its demolition, and plans to make it a historical landmark had emerged. Today, only remnants of the roads remain. An annual reunion for the former residents of Terraville has been held every year since at least 2001 in Deadwood. Geography Terraville is located in the Black Hills of Lawrence County, South Dakota. It was built on the peak of a mountain between Lead and Central City, just above the Homestake Mine. Deadwood Gulch and the ghost town of Lincoln are also nearby.

Details of the candidates can be found in this source. It was followed by the 1892 election. The county was divided into numerous single member wards with two councillors elected to represent Cardigan, Lampeter, New Quay and Llandysul, and four to represent the town of Aberystwyth. 37 Liberals, 10 Conservatives and 1 Unionist were returned. Overview of the Result 1889 was one of those landmark years in the history of Welsh Liberalism, a coming of age symbolized by the triumph across Wales of Liberal candidates in the inaugural county council elections. Nowhere was this more striking than in Cardiganshire, where a little over twenty years previously the evictions controversy had been at its most apparent. Welsh historiography has, likewise, emphasised the contests in Cardiganshire, citing particular contests (such as those noted below), as symbolic of what occurred throughout Wales. If 1868 saw the cracking of the ice, wrote one historian, 1889 was the year of the flood. Only three major landowners were returned, namely Lord Lisburne, Herbert Davies-Evans (the Lord Lieutenant of the County) and J.C. Harford of Falcondale. Unopposed Returns There were only nine unopposed returns, all of whom were Liberals with the exception of Lord Lisburne in Strata Florida. Contested Elections There were a large number of contested elections and the majorities were small in most instances. In most cases there were contests between Liberal and Conservative candidates. In some wards, a form of 'primary' election took place to decide upon who should run as the Liberal candidate, although in others Liberal candidates fought each other. There were fewer instances where two Conservatives contested a seat. While many wards were hotly contested and the majorities small, in single figures in some instances, the Liberals could be considered to have scored a landslide victory. Some of the victories have been regarded as an illustration of the social changes that had taken place in the county. At Devil's Bridge, T.J. Waddingham of Hafod was defeated by the local postmaster; in Bow Street, a coal merchant (and grandfather of Elystan Morgan, later the only Labour MP to represent the county) defeated Henry Bonsall of Clarach; while in Troedyraur, Sir Marteine Lloyd, a former Conservative parliamentary candidate was defeated by a local farmer. The local Conservative-inclined newspapers, notably the Aberystwyth Observer emphasised that local authorities were intended to be non-political and that ‚Äòthe best men‚Äô should be elected. A few Conservative candidates, who were usually landlords, scored personal victories against the tide. Most notably the Lord Lieutenant, H. Davies-Evans won by 27 votes in Llanwenog and in neighbouring Lampeter, J.C. Harford of Falcondale had a majority of 14 over the Liberal candidate, local doctor Abel Evans. In Llanfarian two Conservatives faced each other, with Morris Davies holding off the future Liberal MP for the county, Vaughan Davies of Tanybwlch. The contest at Aberystwyth, which led to the return of four Liberal candidates, was considered to be somewhat quiet compared with municipal contests. In Cardigan, nominally the county town, a closely fought contest led to the return of the Conservative candidate, Picton Evans and one of the two Liberals, the former Liberal Unionist Levi James. In some wards, such as Aberaeron and Borth, there was more excitement, with bonfires being lit to celebrate the return of the successful candidates. Summary of Results This section summarises the detailed results which are noted in the following sections. This was the inaugural county election and therefore no comparison can be made with the previous elections. In some cases there is an ambiguity in the sources over the party affiliations and this is explained below where relevant. This table summarises the result of the elections in all wards. 48 councillors were elected. } This table summarises the position following the election of aldermen. Eight were elected from among the elected members and eight from outside the council. This brought the total number of councillors and aldermen to 56. } This table summarises the position following the by-elections for the seats vacated following the election of aldermen. Technically these were new seats, taking the total number of councillors to 64 However, the Liberals defended six seats and the Conservatives two. The Conservatives won the Tregaron seat which was won by a Liberal at the initial election but lost Llanfair Clydogau } Results Aberaeron John Morgan Howell, an ironmonger and already a prominent figure in the public life of the county, and destined to remain so for many years, was returned with a decisive majority over John Griffiths, Nantgwynfynydd, a farmer. It was reported that, following the declaration of the result, the children of Aberarth British School were marched to the town and, in front of Howell's residence and that of the successful candidate at Aberarth (see below) instructed to give each a hearty cheer, which they did. After dark blue balls were sent off and bonfires were lit. Aberarth John Hugh Jones, an Aberaeron draper, defeated T.H. Maddy of Dolaeron, a barrister. Aberbanc Aberystwyth (four seats) The result in Aberystwyth, after a lively contest, led to the return of the four Liberal candidates. C.M. Williams ( a draper), John James (another tradesman) and George Green (owner of the local foundry) were long-standing members of the Aberystwyth Town Council, the first two being aldermen. The fourth candidate, Thomas Levi, was a well-known figure in cultural and religious circles. John Morgan, who finished bottom of the poll, was the owner of the Aberystwyth Observer. Blaenporth Thomas Thomas, a farmer, of Plas, Aberporth, defeated Alexander Jenkins of Penrallt, Aberporth. Borth The return of the local Calvinistic Methodist minister was greeted with considerable enthusiasm. Flags were displayed and, after nightfall, bonfires lighted, fireworks discharged, houses illuminated, and hundreds of people paraded the streets up to a late hour. James and some of his supporters were drawn in an open carriage through the village and, addressing the assembly said that the day was rapidly approach- ing when laws would be made by the people for the people. Bow Street Cardigan Borough (two seats) The contest had been noted for claims by the Conservatives that it should not be based on politics. On the declaration of the result and the return of Picton Evans at the head of the poll the bells of the parish church were rung, the traditional pattern for celebrating a Conservative victory in the town.

Strata Florida Taliesin Talybont Trefeurig Tregaron Troedyraur Ysbyty Ystwyth Election of Aldermen In addition to the 48 councillors the council consisted of 16 county aldermen. Aldermen were elected by the council, and served a six-year term. Following the election of the initial sixteen aldermen, half of the aldermanic bench would be elected every three years following the triennial council election. After the initial elections, there were sixteen Aldermanic vacancies and the following Alderman were appointed by the newly elected council: Elected for six years *C.M. Williams, Liberal (elected councillor at Aberystwyth) *David Jenkins, Maesteg, Glandovey, Liberal (from outside the Council) *Roderick Lloyd, Liberal (elected councillor at Tregaron) *Levi James, Liberal (elected councillor at Cardigan) *William Davies, Liberal (elected councillor at New Quay) *J.T. Morgan, Liberal (elected councillor at Talybont) *David Lloyd, Liberal (defeated candidate at Llandygwydd) *David Davies, Maengwyn, Llanfair Orllwyn, Liberal (from outside the Council) Elected for three years *Earl Of Lisburne, Conservative (elected councillor at Strata Florida) *Rev Llewellyn Edwards, Liberal (defeated candidate at Llanbadarn Fawr) *Jenkin Jenkins (Aeronian), Liberal(elected councillor at Nantcwnlle) *Daniel Jones, Liberal (defeated candidate at Llansantffraed) *Rev John Davies, Liberal (defeated candidate at Llanwnen) *William Jones, Conservative (elected councillor at Llanfair Clydogau) *Major Price Lewes, Conservative (defeated candidate at Cilcennin) *Jenkin Jenkins, Blaenplwyf, Liberal (defeated candidate at Ystrad Aeron) The Liberals consented to their opponents receiving three of the sixteen aldermanic seats, roughly in proportion to their representation on the Council. Of the three Conservatives, Lord Lisburne and William Jones had been elected but Major Price Lewes of Tyglyn Aeron was bottom of the poll at Cilcennin, behind two Liberals. It was suggested that some Liberals had favoured the Lord Lieutenant, Herbert Davies-Evans and Charles Lloyd of Waunifor, defeated at Llandysul, but said to be a good financier, in place of Jones and Lewes, but had been over-ruled. A number of elected Liberals councillors became aldermen, including Levi James of cardigan, a member of Cardigan Town Council for over twenty years; J.T. Morgan of Talybont; William Davies, Cross Inn, New Quay; However the decision to choose eight of the new aldermen from outside of the Council soon tarnished the Liberal triumph. There had already been soundings in the local press in opposition to the move. ‚ÄòWe profoundly regret the decision‚Äô said a Cambrian News editorial, ‚Äòto select outsiders as aldermen wherever that decision has been reached, and believe that a blow has been struck at the new bodies from which they will never recover until that decision is reversed.‚Äô Particular objection was made to the election of aldermen of four candidates defeated at the polls. There were also two Liberal aldermen who did not even seek election. Aldermanic Vacancies 1889-1895 Roderick Lloyd was appointed county surveyor and resigned his aldermanic seat. In May 1892, Rev John Owen was appointed to succeed him. Therefore, the following appointment was made for the remaining three years in May 1892. *Rev John Owen, Liberal (elected councillor for Lledrod) By- elections Eight by-elections were caused by the election of aldermen. In several cases local meetings were held to select a Liberal candidate and avoid a contest. At Talybont, for example, a test election was contested under the supervision of, amongst other, Alderman J.T. Morgan of Maesnewydd and William Morgan of neighbouring Bow Street. The Revd. John Davies defeated Richard Jones by 109 votes to 99 and Jones enthusiastically signed the successful candidate‚Äôs nomination papers. Two Liberal candidates unsuccessful at the first election, namely Rev John Williams in Cardigan and John Watkin Davies at Llanfair Clydogau, were elected unopposed. The only contested elections were at Strata Florida, where a hotly contested poll led to the return of the rector of Ystrad Meurig for the seat vacates by the Earl of Lisburne and in neighbouring Tregaron, where the Conservatives captured the seat. Aberystwyth by-election Following the election of C.M. Williams as an alderman. D.C. Roberts, a member of a prominent Liberal family was returned unopposed. Cardigan Borough by-election Following the election of Levi James as an alderman, the Rev John Williams, defeated at the initial election was returned unopposed. Llanfair Clydogau by-election Following the election of William Jones, a Conservative, as an alderman, John Watkin Davies, the defeated Liberal candidate at the initial election was returned unopposed. Llanllwchaiarn and New Quay by-election Following the election of William Davies as an alderman, a test election took place at which draper John Owen Davies defeated farmer Joshua Jones of Nantypele.

In 2001 its population was 181, compared to 216 in 1901. The eastern and northern boundaries of the parish mostly follow the River Torridge over which is the 13th-century Kismeldon Bridge. Tumuli on the high ground provide evidence for early inhabitants here. The cruciform early 14th-century parish church is dedicated to Saint Stephen. It has a Norman font, and the tower has been dated to around 1500. According to W. G. Hoskins (writing in the early 1950s) the church is clean, well- preserved and it largely avoided the attention of the Victorian restorers, making it \\"a pleasure, not merely to the antiquary, but to all who see it\\". Other notable buildings in the parish include Churston House, near the church, which was built in around 1600 by one of the Prideaux family and retains many original features; and Cory Barton, about half a mile to the north, which dates from the 16th century and was the seat of the Cory family.

It was sold in two versions, strut and cable braced. A single two seat variant was also built. Design and development In 1930 Teichfuss produced the LT.10, a strengthened but otherwise little changed version of the much imitated Z√∂gling. His 1940 Allievo Pavullo was a strengthened Z√∂gling with a plywood skinned nacelle in place of the original exposed, girder supported seat. This nacelle contained the open cockpit, placed just ahead of the wing leading edge and extended up to the wing behind the cockpit and rearwards to enclose the forward cross members of the simple girder fuselage. As on the Z√∂gling these cross members ran in the vertical plane between a horizontal upper beam and a lower beam which sloped upwards to the tail, though their angles were altered so as not to be normal to the top girder. Again like the Z√∂gling, on the wire braced Allievo Pavullo two forward cross members continued above the wing to form a triangular cabane, faired in on the Teichfuss development, to which some wires were attached. This was dispensed with on the strutted variant, which also had an extra frame strut towards the rear and normal to the lower girder. The wing was very similar in plan to that of the Z√∂gling, rectangular apart from clipped aileron tips, though it had a greater span. It was built around two double-T-section spars with diagonal rib reinforcements and mounted on top of the upper girder without dihedral. The wire braced version had steel flying wires from the cabane and from the lower fuselage; the strutted model had faired parallel lift struts on each side from the lower fuselage to the wing. The strutted Allievo Pavullo was heavier but more robust and better suited to winch launching; mostly it was preferred by clubs. The Allievo Pavullo's tail surfaces were all straight edged. Its fin was formed by filling the end of the girder, in Z√∂gling fashion. Its cantilever tailplane, mounted on top of the upper girder, had a sharply swept leading edge and carried elevators with angled tips and a cut-out for rudder movement. The balanced rudder was tapered with a squared tip and reached to the keel. A conventional skid, running from the nose to below the wing trailing edge formed the undercarriage. The Allievo Pavullo first flew in 1940. Thirteen single seaters were built, all but three the strutted type. It could be used to train novice pilots through to their B-certificate. A two- seat variant, called the Allievo Pavullo Biposto (), was also built with two open cockpits in tandem in a longer and more distinct nacelle. The fuselage structure was quite different, with the tail supported on two parallel booms from the wire braced wing to the tips of a rectangular horizontal tail, assisted by a long, wide spread V-strut from the rear of the nacelle. It had a pair of straight tapered vertical tails, set inboard of the tailplane tips.

It was preceded by the inaugural 1889 election and followed by the 1895 election Overview of the result To some extent the euphoria of 1889 had passed three years later and the whole atmosphere was marked by less excitement. The result, however, was virtually identical to that of the inaugural election. Boundary changes One feature was that the multi-member seats, which existed in urban areas in the first elections, were divided so that all councillors were now elected to represent single member wards. Unopposed returns There were far more unopposed returns than three years previously. Retiring aldermen The following aldermen retired at the election: *Earl Of Lisburne, Conservative *Rev Llewellyn Edwards, Liberal *Jenkin Jenkins (Aeronian), Liberal *Daniel Jones, Liberal *Rev John Davies, Liberal *William Jones, Conservative *Major Price Lewes, Conservative *Jenkin Jenkins, Blaenplwyf, Liberal Of the eight retiring aldermen, only Jenkin Jenkins and Llewellyn Edwards, both of whom were made aldermen as defeated candidates in 1889, sought election. Jenkins won at Llanfihangel Ystrad but Edwards was again defeated at Llanbadarn, this time by solicitor Hugh Hughes. Contested elections Most contests were again on party lines although there were several instances of Liberals opposing each other. The Conservatives had a few successes, notably at New Quay where Captain Longcroft of Llanina triumphed following divisions amongst local nonconformists. The New Council Elected Members } Council following the election of aldermen and by-elections Three Conservative / Unionist and five Liberal aldermen were elected, replicating the balance of the retiring aldermen. } The Liberals strengthened their majority by capturing all three seats which became vacant following the election of aldermen. } Ward results Aberaeron  Aberarth  Aberbanc  Aberporth The ward was known as Blaenporth at the previous election but there was no boundary change.

Rowland, Conservative (elected councillor at Llanddewi Brefi) *Dr Jenkin Lewis, Conservative (elected councillor at Cilcennin) In contrast to the initial elections, all eight aldermen selected in 1892 were elected members of the Council. The Conservatives were again allocated three places, although two of those selected had captured their seats from the Liberals at the recent election. Their elevation allowed the defeated Liberal candidates to be returned unopposed at the ensuing by- elections (see below). Aldermanic vacancies, 1892-98 Colonel Davies-Evans decided not to accept a place on the aldermanic bench soon after the election. The Conservatives proposed that their nominee, David Lloyd, should occupy the vacancy but the Liberals were divided on the issue. In the ballot, Lloyd was elected by 19 votes against 18 for T.H.R. Hughes. As a result, the following appointment was made for six years in May 1892. *David Lloyd, Conservative (elected councillor at Lampeter) By-elections Six of the eight vacancies were filled unopposed and there were two contested elections. The Liberals captured all eight sets, including the three held by the Conservative or Unionist aldermen.

His business career has made him expert on the issue of the enforcement of laws against digital piracy, a particular concern of U.S. businesses with respect to Spain. His initial focus, he said, was on issues of international security and thanking Spain for allowing the U.S. to deploy part of its anti-missile shield defense and for hosting U.S. military bases. In September 2013, Costos visited the bases at Rota and Mor√≥n to mark the 60th anniversary of the agreement under which they were established.

Claverie was French but being born in French Algeria meant that he viewed himself as a true Algerian; he was committed to ecumenism and dialogue with the Islamic faith and dreamed of a peaceful co-existence with Muslims in an independent Algeria. He likewise was noted for his studies on Islamic culture and his mastering of classical Arabic which he even taught to those Muslims who understood the common popular language rather than its classical origins. Claverie was also a prolific writer on dialogue which he made the core focus of his episcopal life. Claverie's cause for canonization opened on 31 March 2007 as part of a larger group cause of other religious killed during the course of the Algerian Civil War. Pope Francis confirmed the group's beatification in 2018 and it was celebrated in Oran on 8 December 2018. Life Education and priesthood Pierre-Lucien Claverie was born as a French citizen in 1938 in a working-class European part of Algiers known as Bab-el-Oued at the time of French Algeria. He was the fourth generation of French settlers and had Algeria as his home. He grew up in a nurturing environment that was raised in the faith but not all that pious. It was in 1948 that he joined a group of scouts under the guidance of the Dominicans. Because of the danger, his mother and sister left the department of Alger just prior to independence in 1962 while his father left in February 1963 when he reached retirement. Once he completed his studies and earned his bachelor's degree he travelled to Grenoble in France in order to pursue his college education.

He went on to pursue his studies at Le Saulchoir which was a Dominican institute near Paris where he read the works of the Dominicans Yves Congar and Marie-Dominique Chenu. Meanwhile the war of independence which started in Algeria in 1954 came to an end in 1962 as he underwent his formation and education. Claverie was ordained to the priesthood in 1965. He returned to Algiers from March 1962 to September 1963 in order to finish his mandated time in the armed forces and worked with chaplains and ran a club for enlisted men; he refused to bear arms. He chose to return to Algeria in July 1967 to participate in the rebuilding of his new and independent nation. This idea inspired him and the galvanized Claverie learned Arabic and became a noted reference on Islam. From January 1973 to 1981 he ran the Centre des Glycines in Algiers, an institute for the studies of classical Arabic and Islam; the original idea was for the institute to be a place of study for those religious planning to serve in Algeria, but Algerian independence led many Muslims to come the center, eager to study Islamic culture and intent on learning Classical Arabic since the language of colonization had been French and the language of everyday life had been dialectal Arabic.  Episcopate   Relations with Islam  Pierre Claverie was a man of dialogue and he participated in numerous meetings between Christians and Muslims but was at times critical of formal inter-religious conferences which he felt remained too basic and surface-level. He shunned those meetings since he believed them to be generators of slogans and for the glossing over of theological differences. He had such an excellent knowledge of Islam that the people of Oran called him \\"the Bishop of the Muslims\\" which was a title that must have pleased him since he had dreamed of establishing true dialogue among all believers irrespective of faith or creed. Claverie also believed that the Islamic faith was authentic in practice focusing on people rather than on theories. He said that: \\"dialogue is a work to which we must return without pause: it alone lets us disarm the fanaticism; both our own and that of the other\\". He also said that \\"Islam knows how to be tolerant\\". In 1974 he joined a branch of Cimade which was a French NGO dedicated to aiding the oppressed and minorities.  Work  He was appointed as the Bishop of Oran on 25 May 1981 and was consecrated that October with Cardinal L√©on-Etienne Duval granting him his episcopal consecration. He succeeded Henri Antoine Marie Teissier who had been named as the Archbishop of Algiers. Claverie created libraries and rehabilitation centers for the handicapped as well as educational centers for women. In 1981 he applied for Algerian citizenship. From 1992 onward - after the Algerian Civil War broke out - the small Catholic Church which served foreign workers (for the most part) was threatened. There were those in Europe who advised Church officials to leave the nation so as to remain safe. Claverie refused to do so: even if he was never able to obtain Algerian citizenship he considered himself an Algerian and refused to leave a people to whom his life was linked. During the crisis he also refused to remain silent. Once he deemed it to be necessary, he did not hesitate to publicly criticize the two main opposing forces - the Islamic Salvation Front and the Algerian Government. In 1993 he predicted at a debate that there would be an inevitable trend of migration towards the north in Europe and that \\"the face of Europe is going to change\\". Assassination On 1 August, 1996. a few weeks after the assassination of the Trappist monks of Tibhirine, the Bishop was assassinated, along with his driver and friend Mohamed Bouchikhi (1975-1996), when a bomb exploded at the entrance to the bishopric as the two were entering the building just before midnight. He was returning from a trip to Algiers where he had met with the French Minister of Foreign Affairs Herv√© de Charette to talk about French residents of Algeria and how best to keep them safe from the conflict. It was during his funeral that the Muslim mourners described Claverie as \\"the Bishop of the Muslims\\". Seven people were convicted of the killings and sentenced to death on 23 March 1998 for their involvement in the attack. The Catholic Church of Algeria petitioned to have their death sentences commuted and this was successful. His assassination proved to be a tremendous shock to the French. Festival d'Avignon Pierre & Mohamed is a play that the Dominican Adrien Candiard wrote. It is based on texts that the bishop had written; Francesco Agnello produced it for the Festival d'Avignon in 2011. Beatification The cause for canonization for Claverie - as well as eighteen other religious killed during the war - commenced in Algiers after the diocesan forum was transferred from Oran on 5 July 2006. The official start to the cause came under Pope Benedict XVI on 31 March 2007 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official edict of \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) to the cause thus naming the nineteen as Servants of God. The diocesan phase of investigation spanned from 5 October 2007 until its closure later on 9 July 2012. The C.C.S. validated this diocesan process on 15 February 2013 when the cause came to Rome for additional investigation. The official Positio dossier was sent to the C.C.S. in 2017. The current postulator for this cause is the Trappist priest Thomas Georgeon. On 1 September 2017 the Archbishop of Algiers Paul Jacques Marie Desfarges and the Bishop of Oran Jean-Paul Vesco met with Pope Francis in a private audience to discuss the cause since theologians had approved the cause at that stage. This meant the C.C.S. needed to approve it before it would be taken to Francis for papal approval. The pope encouraged the bishops and encouraged the cause to proceed. Francis later confirmed the beatification on 26 January 2018; it was celebrated in Oran on 8 December 2018 with Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu presiding over the celebration on the pope's behalf.

It contains a single species, Nankangia jiangxiensis. N. jiangxiensis coexisted with at least four other caenagnathoids, including an unnamed oviraptorid, Banji long, Ganzhousaurus nankangensis and Jiangxisaurus ganzhouensis. The relatively short dentary and non-downturned mandibular symphysis of Nankangia suggest that it may have been more herbivorous than carnivorous. Its diet consisting of leaves and seeds. Discovery Scapulocoracoids Nankangia was first described and named by L√º Junchang, Yi Laiping, Zhong Hui and Wei Xuefang in 2013 and the type species is Nankangia jiangxiensis. The generic name honors the Chinese administrative unit Nankang County in Jiangxi Province, and the specific name honors the province where the holotype site in Nankang City is located. Restoration Nankangia is known solely from the holotype GMNH F10003, a partial lower jaw and partial postcranial skeleton from a single individual, housed at the Ganzhou Museum of Natural History, Ganzhou City of Jiangxi Province. Postcranial material includes five complete dorsal vertebrae, one and one-half sacral vertebrae, nine complete and two partial caudal vertebrae, both scapulocoracoids, an incomplete furcula, a nearly complete right humerus, the complete right and most of the left ilia, the complete right and most of the left pubic bones, the complete right and a partial left ischia, both femora, the right tibia, and some dorsal ribs. The holotype was found in 2010 at the town of Longling of Nankang, Ganzhou City, by a local farmer who donated it to the Ganzhou Museum of Natural History. It was collected from the Nanxiong Formation, dating probably to the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous. Description Vertebral column Nankangia is distinguished from all other oviraptorosaurians based on a combination of traits, some of which are autapomorphic (i.e. unique). On the ventral surface near the base of the transverse process of the dorsal vertebrae two infradiapophyseal fossae are present. The sacral vertebrae bear slit-like pneumatic fossae. The neural spines of the anterior caudal vertebrae are wider transversely than anteroposteriorly, forming a large posterior fossa with a rugose central area. These vertebrae possess a large fossa on the anterior surface of the base of the transverse process (infraprezygapophyseal fossa) and as well as an infradiapophyseal fossa on the ventral surface of the transverse process. The femur and tibia of Nankangia are approximately the same length. Its femoral neck extends dorsomedially at about 90¬∞ to the shaft. It has relatively small ratio of height to length of ilium (0.36), which is additionally shorter than the femur as seen in Yulong and Khaan. The ilium of Nankangia is uniquely shaped, and among oviraptorosaurians, resembles the ilia of Chirostenotes, Rinchenia, Heyuannia and Shixinggia, and clearly differs from the ilium of Luoyanggia. Due to the lack of well-preserved corresponding elements between the specimens of Nankangia and Wulatelong, from the Wulansuhai Formation of Inner Mongolia, L√º et al. (2013) could not differentiated between them. Pelvic girdle The rostral end of the mandibular symphyseal region is not downturned in Nankangia, as in caenagnathids, Incisivosaurus, Luoyanggia and Ganzhousaurus. Unlike the V-shaped mandibular symphysis of Luoyanggia, Nankangia and other oviraptorosaurs have a U-shaped mandibular symphysis. Although Nankangia and Jiangxisaurus possess similar lower jaws, the medial margin of the humerus is more curved medially in Nankangia than it is in Jiangxisaurus. Based on its phylogenetic position, Nankangia displays five other possible autapomorphies, including an anteriorly projecting acromion, separated anterior and greater trochanters, dorsoventral extension of the pubic peduncle that is deeper than the ischial peduncle, and the lack of a downturned symphyseal portion of the dentary. The latter trait is shared with the coeval Ganzhousaurus and Jiangxisaurus, suggesting a primarily herbivorous diet, whereas Banji and another unnamed oviraptorid from the same formation may have been more carnivorous, as they bear a downturned mandibular symphysis. Phylogeny leg bones The phylogenetic position of Nankangia was explored by L√º et al. (2013) using the data matrix published with the description of Yulong. The obtained topology was resolved, with the exception of a polytomy between the \\"Ingeniinae\\", Oviraptor, and the rest of the Oviraptorinae. L√º et al. (2013) suggested that Nankangia may form a clade with Gigantoraptor and Chirostenotes, and therefore refrained from including the former two taxa in the Oviraptoridae, even though this was not supported by their phylogenetic analysis. However, Oviraptoridae is currently defined as a stem-based taxon that excludes caenagnathids but includes Oviraptor,Mortimer, Michael: The Theropod Database: Oviraptoridae. Retrieved 2013-NOV-29. and an alternative definition was not suggested by L√º et al. (2013). The cladogram below shows the phylogenetic position of Nankangia following this analysis, as the sister taxon to the clade mislabeled as Oviraptoridae. The phylogenetic analysis of L√º et al. (2017) recovered it as an oviraptorid closely related to Yulong and Nomingia.

It lived during the upper Lower Cambrian, with remains found in Canada (Newfoundland), China (Gansu), The United Kingdom (England), and the Russian Federation (Tuva, Gorno-Altayskaya).  Taxonomy  The Weymouthiid family shows a trend of shortening the occipital ring. In Chelediscus and Tannudiscus the occipital ring is entirely obliterated as in the Agnostina suborder. Tannudiscus has some other characters it shares with the Agnostina, such as a glabella consisting of two lobes, the occipital ring divided into basal glabellar lobes, both the glabella and the pygidial axis isolated from border furrow, and undivided pygidial axis. It is therefore considered likely that the Agnostina descended directly from a species assignable to Tannudiscus. The earliest known Agnostina is Archaeagnostus (Peronopsidae). According to Cotton and Fortey (2005) Tannudiscus is polyphyletic.  Description  Like in all Agnostida the outline of the headshield (or cephalon) and tailshield (or pygidium) of Tannudiscus are nearly identical (or isopygous). Like all other Weymouthiidae it lacks eyes and has a middle part (or thorax) with three segments. In Tannudiscus the central raised area of the cephalon or glabella almost touches the anterior border. It consists of two inflated lobes, the frontal one slightly wider than the rear one, a character that is further developed in the Condylopygidae. The posterior lobe lacks a spine. The occipital ring has been squeezed aside into two basal lateral lobes. The border is convex, moderately wide, more so in front of the glabella and extends back to back of glabella in some species. The axis of the pygidium is conical, has seven or eight rings, and may or may not reach posterior border furrow. The furrows defining the rings are indistinct or obsolete though. The border of the pygidium is almost flat, but similar in width to the cephalic border.  Distribution  * T. tannulaicus is known from the Lower Cambrian of the Russian Federation (Toyonian, Shivelikskaya Suite, Tuva, Shivelik-Khem River, eastern Tannu-Ola Mountains). * T. balanus has been found in the Lower Cambrian of the Russian Federation (Botomian, Sanashtykgolskogo horizon, Shashkunarskaya suite). * T. balanus occurs in the Lower Cambrian of England (Toyonian, Purley Shales, Warwickshire), and Canada (Toyonian, upper Redland Cove member, Brigus Formation, southeastern Newfoundland). * T. conicus has been excavated from the late Lower Cambrian of China (Huocheng Formation, Borohoro district). * T. extensus is present in the Middle Cambrian of Russian Federation (Amgaian, Berikul Formation, Kiya River section, Kuznetsk Alatau).

The first mentions The first public mentions of William Cresswell in relation to the Tichborne case appear in news reports from 1871. Arthur Orton was said to have associated 'with a man well known in the Queanbeyan district' under that name, and that 'the last that was heard of him is that he was sent... to the Gladesville Hospital as a dangerous lunatic'. Further, 'It was said there was always something mysterious about Cresswell, and even his wife was not acquainted with his previous history'. In April 1884, Daniel Smith 'agent for the Tichborne Release association' was reported to have tried to secure the release of William Cresswell from the Paramatta Lunatic Asylum 'in order to take him to England under the supposition that he is the very identical Arthur Orton'. In later reports it emerged that Cresswell was being promoted not as Arthur Orton, but as Tichborne himself: > \\"This person is stated to have a cut over the eye-brow, received on the > Pauline from an albatross, mark of a fishhook through the eyelid, indenture > in the back of the head, and to correspond in age and height to the real Sir > Roger Tichbourne. The person is further described as a Roman Catholic, and > has a sacred relic in his possession when admitted. He has a peculiar > twitching of the eye- brows, odd ears, speaks French, repeatedly talks of > his estates in Hampshire and Dorsetshire.\\" 19th century map showing squatting runs in Gippsland where Cresswell is said to have known Arthur Orton. Cresswell's candidacy was advanced by Sydney lawyer Edward Priestman acting for Rev. Edward Williams, 'a Catholic priest of Sydenmouth, Devonshire (England)'. Priestman found early support in a Victorian Member of Parliament, J.H. Graves, who knew of a detailed story of how Orton and Tichborne (Cresswell) had first met when both working on Gippsland squatting runs. Another source, 'an old resident' Richard Bennison, a Gippsland hotelier, confirmed some of Graves' story in 1895, as he recalled Orton and 'George Smith' newly arrived from Tasmania (and still had hotel records of their visit) and that, around the time Orton assumed the alias Tom Castro, Bennison encountered Smith again, who gave his name as William Cresswell. In 1897, permission was sought from the Supreme Court to examine Cresswell to determine if 'marks on his body' matched Tichborne's. The process was thorough and: > \\"Creswell appeared more intelligent than on the previous occasions when he > was examined, and did everything he was requested without the slightest > demur, though he showed no emotion and did not express any desire to know > the reason for the examination. Photographs were taken of him in eight or > nine different positions, and he submitted to the ordeal with perfect > quietness and indifference.\\" While the evidence was not entirely conclusive, a news report of the time noted that 'Where the famous tattoo mark was, on the left forearm, there is a scar, consistent with theory that it was destroyed by searing'. 1898 Royal Commission The following year, at a Royal Commission 'appointed with reference to the identity of William Cresswell', a witness Bridget Wivas said that while she was a servant at a house in Woollahra, Sydney, a male servant employed there resembled Tichborne, in marks, accent, and details he gave of his life, and she believed that man was still in the city. Walter Lee, a labourer, recalled his own encounter with the man he believed to be Tichborne, when he crewed with him on the 'Osprey' between Adelaide and Geelong in 1854. While an attendant at the asylum from 1869‚Äì1871 gave testimony that Cresswell had once remarked 'I'm like the Prodigal Son; but I'll never return'. Cresswell was questioned by the Royal Commission, and was described as a 'grey, robust looking old man'. At times he 'expressed recognition' of people and places, even stamping his feet 'with anger' when he was displeased, but he also 'talked incoherently to himself' during the proceedings. When commissioner Wilkes mention Cresswell's name, Sir Roger Tichborne and Arthur Orton, asking if they were three separate men, Cresswell responded: 'Don't mix my name up with such people'. Cresswell maintained that he was not Tichborne, and the Commission agreed, with one dissenting opinion, but it did find that he was 'of sufficiently sound mind to warrant his release from the Asylum'. Aftermath While the New South Wales Legislative Assembly supported the Commission's call for Cresswell's release, in 1902, during a visit by a journalist, he was still an inmate at the asylum, and he remained there until his death in 1904. One of those who offered evidence to the Royal Commission into Cresswell's identity, Catholic priest Rev. Father Dunne of Albury, offered a completely different suggestion. He repeated his recollections, first made public in 1895, that he had given the last rites to Sir Roger Tichborne in Geelong, Victoria, in 1854.

Wallace Smith ( December 30, 1888 - January 31, 1937) was a book illustrator, comic artist, reporter, author, and screenwriter. Wallace was one of the finest artists in the newspapers business and switched back and forth between cartooning and writing. He became Washington correspondent for the Chicago American at the age of 20, remaining with that newspaper for over a decade. According to the book The Madhouse on Madison Street, Smith was \\"one of the most colorful reporters who ever worked for the Hearst papers,\\" and was born with the last name of Schmidt, which he changed to Smith during World War I. He was sent to Mexico and did illustrated reporting on several campaigns of Pancho Villa against the Carranza regime. In 1920 he originated the Joe Blow comic panel feature for the Chicago American. In 1921-22 he was assigned to California to cover the Roscoe Arbuckle trials and the William Desmond Taylor murder case. The articles bylined by Smith (for the Chicago American) and Eddie Doherty (for the Chicago Tribune) were so inflammatory that Under- Sheriff Eugene W. Biscailuz, fearing for their safety, offered to provide them each with a bodyguard, but they both declined. In 1923‚Äì1924 he contributed with his illustrations (using the nickname \\"Vulgus\\") for The Chicago Literary Times, a magazine done in the format and style of a tabloid scandal sheet, co founded by Ben Hech and Maxwell Bodenheim with whom he previously collaborated illustrating their books. Smith moved to Hollywood embarking on successful, decade-long, screenplay- writing career. His services were in high demand - he wrote or contributed to twenty-six screenplays, often enhancing them with detailed scene sketches. Smith's work included screen adaptations of his novels The Captain Hates the Sea and The Gay Desperado and also Two Arabian Knights, The Lost Squadron, Friends and Lovers. In 1935, Smith's novel Bessie Cotter about a prostitute's life on the streets of Chicago was judged indecent in England and the publisher fined the equivalent of $1,000. It was published a year earlier in the United States. He died of a heart attack in his home in Hollywood on January 31, 1937, and was survived by his wife, Echo Smith. His archival papers are at the University of Oregon. The papers include Smith's manuscripts and published pieces, minor correspondence, drawings and illustrations, photographs, and miscellaneous documents. Fantazius Mallare censorship and illustration art Fantazius Mallare illustration Returning to Chicago, Smith provided the illustrations for Ben Hecht's controversial novel Fantazius Mallare: a Mysterious Oath, which resulted in a $1,000 fine for obscenity in U.S. District Court for both Hecht and Smith. A novel of decadence and mystic existentialism, Fantazius Mallare is a story of a mad recluse‚Äîa genius sculptor and painter who is at war with reason. Rather than commit suicide, his doting madness dictates that he must revolt against all evidence of life that exists outside himself. He destroys all of his work and then seeks out a woman who will devote herself to his Omnipotence. What follows is a glorious trek into a horrifying enlightening insanity. \\"Neither Hecht nor Smith were much known outside Chicago when they teamed up to produce a book that got them international attention. It was \\"Fantazius Mallare\\", a weird story of a mad man and it was illustrated in full page line drawings that were as fantastic as the story. There is no question that the book was filled with strong writing and stronger pictures, but the strength sometimes ran to the kind that comes from the cesspool. Frankness pranced straight into vulgarity, at times and that got the boys into a jam with the postal authorities. About 1,000 copies that were in the mails were seized and Hecht and Smith had to stand trial. Both were fined.\\" \\"Smith was said by Ronald Clyne to have gone to jail for the Mallare artwork, but apparently this was an exaggeration - he and Hecht were, however, fined $1000 each for \\"obscenity\\"; and $1000 was quite a lot of money in 1924. The particular points it is curious about where were the rest of the Wallace Smith artwork - he could hardly have developed that style in the handful of drawings that have been published; and what happened to the copies of Fantazius Mallare seized by the US government - the book did not seem to be as scarce as would have been expected if they had seized even half of the 2000-copy edition. MacAdams was able to answer this last question to some extent - after the obscenity conviction, the publisher made another 2000 copies and sold them \\"under the counter.\\" Hecht and Smith went to a great deal of trouble to have themselves convicted of obscenity. They had wanted to create a test case of the federal obscenity law and have a show trial in order to turn public opinion against it by ridicule. Hecht also intended to enter a million-dollar civil suit for defamation of character against John Sumner and his infamous Society for the Suppression of Vice if Sumner attacked his book. The famous Clarence Darrow was to have been their attorney. The plan was to send review copies of Fantazius Mallare to all of the literary lights of the time, and then have Darrow call these people as expert witnesses at the trial. Alas, the scheme foundered on the unforeseen pusillanimity of the literary establishment - only H. L. Mencken agreed to appear as a witness. In the end there was no trial because Hecht and Smith entered a plea of nolo contendere. The character Fantazius Mallare is said to be a sort of Hecht alter-ego - he appears again in the sequel, The Kingdom of Evil (illustrated by the much inferior artist Anthony Angarola), and in 1935 Hecht wrote and directed a film, The Scoundrel, in which Noel Coward plays Mallare.\\" In 1926, after moving to Hollywood from Chicago, he presented the silent film star Rod La Rocque with a copy of Fantazius Mallare, a decadent novel written by Ben Hecht, Smith's friend and fellow newspaperman at the Chicago Daily News. But Smith knew Hecht as a decadent novelist, and he knew Fantazius Mallare especially well because he had illustrated Hecht's depraved tale with ten fantastic, Beardleyesque drawings, several of them depicting the sterile orgies of the novel's deluded, reclusive hero. Rod La Rocque must have meant a lot to Wallace Smith, as the inscription he wrote to the star implies: \\"For Rod La Rocque -who has a thousand masks for his face -but, thank Christ, never an one for his heart.\\" As further token of his admiration, Smith hand-colored a number of the drawings in the book he gave to the celebrated screen idol.

Dark and obscure, expressionist and linear, dominated by large black fields they reveal influences of later heritage of Beardsley and Harry Clarke at same time his very distinguishable character. During his assignments in Mexico, Smith closely observed the peasants for whom Pancho Villa waged war. In his 1923 book, The Little Tigress: Tales Out of the Dust of Mexico, he wrote sympathetically about their plight and brought them to life in his trademark stark black-and-white drawings. In the next few years he wrote short stories published in a variety of magazines including Liberty, The American Magazine, and Blue Book Magazine. Pendleton Round-Up Poster Pendleton round-up poster Let 'er buck He was the author of the illustration for Pendleton Round Up Association. Round-Up organizers paid Smith $250 for the drawing, copyrighted it in 1925, and began using it as the event's logo. There's no estimating how many times since then the image has been reproduced or seen. Many decades later, the picture still symbolizes at a glance the essence of rodeo competition. The story behind the image is, in 1924, a young talented author and artist, Wallace Smith, asked for and received permission to gain access to the arena during the rodeo for the purpose of making sketches of bucking horses. After three busy days working in the arena and sitting on the north arena fence, he came up with his answer to the thought of creating a bucking horse that would properly symbolize the round up's slogan, \\"LET 'ER BUCK\\". The life of that vivid frontispiece of his Oregon Sketches had pleased the bronco-busters so much that they have adopted it as the official poster of the annual Pendleton Round-Up. In Oregon Sketches Wallace Smith gives glimpses of the new and glorified West, a West that is a revival of all that tradition has contributed to the term, including cowboys and Indians, guns and war paint‚Ä¶ As a picture of some of the swiftly changing phases of the West the book is of value.

Some of Theresa's earliest memories were of staying with Lady Tichborne. Theresa Mary Doughty Tichborne or Orton (1866‚Äì1939) was the daughter of Arthur Orton, a claimant in the 19th century Tichborne case, who continued her father's claim into the 1920s. Early life Born Agnes, in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia, in 1866,1881 England Census (database on-line). Ancestry Tichborne was the eldest daughter of Arthur Orton. She was nine months old when she traveled to England with her parents after her father was invited to meet with Lady Tichborne, mother of the missing Tichborne heir. Theresa recalled that one of her earliest memories was being called 'Little Miss Tichborne' when she stayed with Lady Tichborne 'on several occasions'. At age five she was included in the 1871 English census as 'Teresa M. Tichborne',1871 England Census (database on-line). Ancestry and used the name Theresa Mary Doughty Tichborne, or Theresa Mary Agnes Doughty Tichborne, in the years that followed. In her professional life, as an actress, she also used the names 'Agnes Tichborne' and the surname 'Alexander'. In 1884, her father, who had been found not to be the missing heir, Sir Roger Tichborne, and sentenced for perjury in 1873, was released, and Theresa acted as his secretary during his mid-1880s lecture tour. Theresa later said she left the secretary's role because of her father's drunkenness and personal conduct. She was also to reveal, in 1924, that it was during this time that her father told her that he was Sir Roger Tichborne, and had shot, and killed, Arthur Orton, in Australia before taking his name. Following her departure from the lecture tour she worked as an actress, and a barmaid. And, for a time, in the late 1880s, socialised with Sir Henry Tichborne, known as Goldie, a grandson of Lady Tichborne, who had succeeded to the Tichborne baronetcy after his father's death, and Arthur Orton's unsuccessful claim. 1913 arrest In June 1913, Theresa was remanded 'on a charge of threatening to murder' Miss Denise Fulke Greville, fianc√©e of the then baronet Sir Joseph Tichborne. The substance of the charge was in a letter she sent to the Earl of Granard: > \\"I have just seen the announcement of the approaching marriage of my cousin, > Joseph Tichborne. I have asked you to use your influence to make them give > me some of the money they stole from us, but you do nothing. It is nothing > to you if I starve, as long as you and your wife can give parties and flaunt > about with people who, if they knew the truth, would be ashamed to know you. > > You cannot hide any more, for I am making you an accessory before the fact > by telling you that I am going to shoot that girl rather than Joseph shall > marry her and they shall live on my money. I am going to do it. Now hide, > and pretend you think I don't mean it.\\" A second letter, in the same handwriting, was also produced which warned 'Colonel Stratton Bates' that 'the ladies of his family' should not attend the wedding and would 'be safer elsewhere'. Bow Street Police Court where Theresa was remanded in 1913. At the remand hearing, held at the Bow Street Police Court in London, Theresa 'protested that she did not intend to do any harm to Miss Grenville' and 'her only motive' in writing to Granard (who was married to wealthy American heiress Beatrice Mills) was 'to attract attention to her case'. The issue of Theresa and her late father's names was the subject of exchanges at the hearing. When the prosecutor stated that 'The defendant represents herself to be the daughter of Arthur Orton', she responded 'I never said so, I said Sir Roger Tichborne'. Similarly, when the arresting officer referred to the arrest warrant being made out in the name of 'Alexander', she explained 'Alexander is my stage name. My correct-name is Theresa Mary Doughty Tichborne'. She was remanded until the following Friday and then granted bail. A second charge of blackmail was added in early July and at trial, later that month, it was revealed that she had 'for years past... annoyed the Tichborne family' and 'to members of which she had sent begging letters' which 'verged on blackmail'. Sir Joseph's father, the late Sir Henry Tichborne, had 'charitably given the accused ¬£25, which she had accepted as an acknowledgement of her connection with the family' and, following this, she had asked Sir Joseph 'to give her ¬£10,000 and she would not worry him any further'. She had also sent another letter accusing Sir Joseph's mother of destroying Sir Henry's will. Theresa was found guilty of blackmail and sentenced to six months imprisonment. The following year, as 'Theresa Alexander', she was successful in her application to the court to have her sister stand surety on her ¬£100 twelve-month good behavior bond. 1924 arrest In September 1923, Theresa appeared at the Clerkenwell Police Court charged with 'publishing a defamatory libel concerning Sir Joseph Tichborne'. She had previously been charged with 'writing a letter threatening to murder Sir George Lewis, the solicitor' and would be, the prosecutor stated, shortly facing 'fresh charges... of demanding money by menace'. Described in a news report as a 'tall woman of dignified appearance', she was said to have sent 'a series of amazing letters' in which she claimed Sir Joseph Tichborne had bribed her to commit suicide. In the earliest letter, sent to the Coroner of Brockenhurst, where she was living, she wrote: > \\"A man named Draper came to see me last Saturday, and told me he was from > Sir Joseph Tichborne. He said he wondered I did not feel suicidal with all > these debts hanging over me. I said I often did. He then told me my cousin, > Sir Joseph, had told him he would pay anything to know I was dead. > > I asked if he thought he would pay my debts if I were dead, and he said, > \\"Rather.\\" I wrote to my cousin, Sir Joseph, last week, and I said I will > accept his offer and take my own life.\\" Theresa Tichbourne served a 12-month sentence in HM Prison Holloway in 1924. After this she wrote to Sir Joseph Tichborne stating that she had 'applied to the Magistrates... to protect me against you' and added 'The suggestion is that I should give up the claim to the Tichborne estates and my name and relationship on the consideration that you give me sufficient income. I am owing in Brocklehurst ¬£3000'. After writing to the solicitors Lewis and Lewis requesting ¬£50, she wrote again to Sir Joseph stating that if the solicitors 'do not come to a settlement' she would go to the Tichborne estate and 'commit suicide, as you suggest I should do'. To George Lewis she wrote 'If I am to shoot some one like you before committing suicide... there wouldn't be much chance of the matter being hushed up again'. While to the actress Gladys Cooper, she referred to an earlier correspondence where she 'warned' Cooper to 'stay away' from Sir Joseph and his wife, before repeating the suicide claim and asking 'would you lend me a few pounds by the morning?'. Theresa was brought to trial in October 1923 and was sentenced to one year in prison for 'writing threatening letters' and attempting to 'extort money from the Tichborne family by threats to kill them'. Upon her release she was given a twelve-month good behavior bond with ¬£300 of her own money and two sureties of ¬£100 each. She was unable to find the sureties and was returned to jail. Later life In October 1924, Theresa gave an interview to the London newspaper The People. In it she said that during her time in HM Prison Holloway she believed herself to be dying and wrote to the Home Office to confide a secret she said her late father had told her in 1885: 'I'm Roger Tichborne. Arthur Orton, whom I'm supposed to be, was my confederate in many exploits in Australia. I shot him dead at Wagga Wagga, during a quarrel, in which he threatened to expose me.' Her late father's visit to find the Orton family in Wapping in 1866 had only been 'carried out for the purpose of discovering if the family had been apprised of the murder'. She added that 'her sister had dissuaded her' when she planned to reveal this 'secret' at her 1913 trial. Theresa maintained in 1924 that she had also 'been a victim of \\"The Case\\"'. She died at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England, aged 73 years, in 1939.England & Wales, Death Index, 1916‚Äì2007 (database on-line).

Loss HMHS Dieppe treated over 100 of Malojas survivors At 1500 hrs Saturday 26 February 1916 Maloja sailed from Tilbury for Bombay carrying 122 passengers (less than a fifth of her capacity) and a general cargo. Her passengers were a mixture of military and government personnel, and civilians including women and children. Following normal P&O; practice, her complement of 301 comprised British officers and Lascar crew. On the morning of Sunday 27 February Maloja approached the Strait of Dover at full speed and overtook a Canadian collier, . Under wartime conditions each ship would have to be examined by a patrol boat before being allowed to proceed. The German Type UC I submarine had recently mined the strait. At about 1030 hrs Maloja was about off Dover when her starboard quarter struck one of UC-6s mines. There was a large explosion, and the bulkheads of the second saloon were blown in. Empress of Fort William was still in sight and immediately went full ahead to assist, but while still astern the collier also struck one of UC-6s mines and began to sink. As a precaution against enemy attack, Maloja was steaming with her lifeboats already swung out on their davits so that they could be lowered more quickly. Her Master, Captain C.D. Irving, RNR, immediately had her engines stopped and then put astern to stop her so that her boats could be lowered. She also sounded her whistle as a signal to prepare to abandon ship. Irving then tried to order her engines be stopped again for the ship to be evacuated, but flooding in her engine room prevented the engines from being stopped and she started to make way astern at about . She also developed a list to starboard which steepened to 75 degrees. Passengers started to board the starboard lifeboats but the ship's speed and list prevented all but three or four of them from being launched. Small vessels headed to assist her including the Port of Dover tugs Lady Brassey and Lady Crundall, trawlers, dredgers and a destroyer. As Maloja steamed astern and unable to stop, the rescue vessels were unable to get alongside to take off survivors. A heavy sea was running and the hundreds who crowded her decks could only don a cork lifejacket, jump overboard and try to swim clear. A number of her rafts either were launched or floated clear, and some of her survivors managed to board them. Maloja sank 24 minutes after being mined, followed by Empress of Fort William which sank about 40 minutes after being mined. Many of the deaths were from hypothermia, either in the water or after being rescued. Most of the people who survived were recovered from the water. Several survivors, including Captain Irving, had been immersed for half an hour. The Second Officer, Lieutenant C Vincent, was in the water for an hour but survived. The small vessels taking part in the rescue took many of the survivors to the hospital ships and . Others were brought ashore and Royal Navy ambulances took them to the Lord Warden Hotel. Survivors were later taken by special train to . At about 1130 hrs vessels started to bring bodies ashore. The chief constable of Kent took charge of the dead and designated the Market Hall below Dover Museum as a temporary mortuary. 45 bodies were recovered but about another 100 people were unaccounted for. Monuments 13 of the dead are buried in the St Mary the Virgin New Cemetery, Dover. They include three servicemen, four women, and four children aged 3, 5, 6 and 8.

He was recalled by the military in 1951 and served in the Far East Air Forces and Strategic Air Command. Biography Tuskegee Airmen - Circa May 1942 to Aug 1943 Early life Harmon was born in Topeka, Kansas on June 26, 1925. Harmon's family subsequently moved to Los Angeles, California, where he grew up.

The parish, which lies about five miles south east of the town of Great Torrington, is surrounded clockwise from the north by the parishes of Little Torrington, Beaford, Dolton, Huish, Petrockstowe and Peters Marland. In 2001 its population was 331, down from the 507 residents it had in 1901. The eastern and northern boundaries of the parish follow the loops of the River Torridge and the other sides are defined by the River Mere. The village forms part of the electoral ward of Clinton. The population at the 2011 census was 1,537. The village is on the A386 road between Meeth and Great Torrington. The parish church, on the west side of the village, is dedicated to All Saints and dates from around 1400. It suffered a heavy Victorian restoration between 1872 and 1875 by R. M. Fulford, but the east window of the north chapel retains many fragments of late medieval stained glass. Speccot, Dunsbear and Potheridge were estates mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. Merton Moor Merton Moor on the border between the parishes of Merton and Petrockstowe, has been the site of ball clay extraction for many years, and the North Devon and Cornwall Junction Light Railway ran through the west of the parish between 1925 and 1982 to serve the ball clay industry. Today the former railway line forms part of the Tarka Trail series of footpaths and cycle tracks. Historic estates Various historic estates are situated within the parish including: *Potheridge, now a farmhouse, long the seat of the Monck family and the birthplace in 1608 of General George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, the main force behind the Restoration of the Monarchy to King Charles II in 1660. General Monck reconstructed the house on a grand scale, presumably after 1660, but much of it was demolished some time after 1734. Surviving features include a late-17th-century grand staircase and part of the great hall with its ornate overmantel. *Speccot, in the mediaeval age the seat of the prominent de Speccot family.

The exhibition was held in Lithuanian spa town Druskininkai, the native town of Lipchitz. Immense sculptures could not be moved into any gallery under the roof, as a result, they were displayed in a picturesque setting between 2 lakes. Special attention of lovers of art and critics was given to Enamored Sailor, Wounded Tiger and King and Queen. He also held exhibitions presenting his nude sculptures which mostly represent the characters of the paintings of Edgar Degas, Amedeo Modigliani, Toulouse- Lautrec, Paul Gauguin. These sculptures were made of chamotte clay. Sergey Evtuhov‚Äôs sculpture is characteristic of unusual geometric plasticity, which is quite rare. This is not cubism of the beginning of the 20th century, but a completely new aesthetics.  Art is not for sale, only the pieces  In 2006 painter Evtuhov draw public attention and criticism when he decided to sell his painting The Firefighters visiting designers, priced over 1 million dollars, by pieces.–ò—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –≤ —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–µ–∑–µ The buyers couldn‚Äôt take an actual piece with them, but their names were published and promoted as sponsors of the art and co-owners of this artistic work. As a result, the painting was kept by the artist. Overall Sergey is known for unwillingness to sell many of his masterpieces.  Continuation of famous Henri Matisse‚Äô series  One of the recent projects of painter Evtuhov is connected with the artistic genius of Henri Matisse. Sergey made up his mind to continue famous works of Matisse ‚Äì The Dance and The Music, kept in the Hermitage Museum. First appeared in The Painting. In the same palette: figures are in red, ground ‚Äì in green, the sky ‚Äì in blue. The size of the canvas is the same as Matisse‚Äô: 2.60 by 3.90 i.e. each painting is almost 4 meters long. But if Matisse deprived his characters of individuality on purpose, so that the depicted would be perceived by the audience as a comprehensive whole, Sergey selected figures for his painting from the numerous sketches of the French painter. The second picture was named The Baithing (or The Meditation) and was taken from an unrealized project. Matisse was planning to paint the third picture, but the customer ‚Äì collector Schukin ‚Äì confined himself only to The Dance and The Music. Sergey didn‚Äôt confine himself‚Ä¶ and so appeared the work The Baithing (or The Meditation).–í–∏–ª—å–Ω—é—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —Ö—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫ –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ï–≤—Ç—É—Ö–æ–≤ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∏–ª —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏–∏ –ú–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Å–∞ - RU.DELFI  Gallery  File:Officer and the ballet dancer.png File:Dubingjai.jpg File:Nude sculpture.jpg File:Haymaking.png File:Voshod solnca.jpg File:Anya.jpg File:Boats_in_Saulkrasty.jpg File:Gladiolus_Still_Life.jpg File:Human,_not_a_machine.jpg File:Swimming_in_the_pelvis.jpg File:I_want_to_go_to_blackboard.jpg File:Still_Life_with_a_Cap.jpg File:The_Sun,_a_Zebra_and_a_Cypress_Tree.jpg File:Autumn_Still_Life.jpg  References  1953 births Living people ","title":"Sergey Evtuhov"},{"id":"41211234","text":"Sanchong High School (SCHS) is a high school in Sanchong District, New Taipei, Taiwan.

The arrests occurred as a result of two separate newspaper investigations, by the Daily Telegraph and the Sun on Sunday, as well as information supplied by the European online gambling watchdog FederBet. On 17 June 2014, a jury at Birmingham Crown Court found Michael Boateng, Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan and Chann Sankaran guilty of conspiracy to commit bribery, while Hakeem Adelakun was cleared of the offence. Sankaran and Ganeshan were sentenced to five years in prison, with Boeteng given an 18-month sentence. At a later trial, Moses Swaibu and Delroy Facey were also found guilty of conspiracy to commit bribery and sentenced to 16 months and 30 months in prison respectively. Sun on Sunday investigation Six people were arrested by the NCA in December 2013 as the result of an investigation into match fixing by the Sun on Sunday. Sam Sodje, a former player for Reading F. C. and Portsmouth F. C., allegedly claimed that he could arrange for footballers in the Football League Championship to get themselves booked in exchange for cash payments. One of the six people arrested was footballer DJ Campbell. Sodje told reporters that in an attempt to receive a red card and ¬£70,000 he had twice punched the Oldham Athletic player Jose Baxter, while playing for Portsmouth in a League One match. Sodje also claimed that he was preparing to fix games at the 2014 FIFA World Cup and that he had organised ¬£30,000 to be paid to a Championship player for receiving a yellow card. Sodje additionally claimed that he could fix Premier League games. The investigation also surrounded claims by Sodje involving his brother, the Tranmere Rovers player Akpo Sodje, and the Oldham player Cristian Monta√±o. Daily Telegraph investigation The NCA said their operation was focused on a \\"suspected international illegal betting syndicate\\", and said they were closely cooperating with the Gambling Commission and the Football Association. A seventh person was later arrested, and two of the initial six people arrested, Chann Sankaran, and Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan, were charged with conspiracy to defraud. Sankaran is a Singaporean national, and Ganeshan a dual UK- Singaporean national. The six men who were arrested included three football players and football agent Delroy Facey, a former Premier League player. The identities of the football teams concerned has not been disclosed as the police operation is still active, but no Premier League football teams are involved. Two of the footballers were charged with conspiracy to defraud. The players charged, Michael Boateng and Hakeem Adelakun, both play for Whitehawk F.C., in the Conference South division. In a series of undercover meetings in Manchester, a Singaporean fixer claimed that he could rig the result of football games and that potential gamblers using betting websites based in Asia would make hundreds of thousands of pounds as a result of the information. The fixer claimed to \\"control\\" teams in other European countries and claimed to \\"buy\\" foreign referees to influence results. The cost of fixing matches in England was \\"very high\\" according to the fixer, who said the cost for players was usually ¬£70,000. The fixer planned to target two football matches in Britain in November, and tell the players how many total goals needed to be scored. The fixer gave an example of a game where four goals needed to be scored, with two goals would be scored in each half. The result was irrelevant as long as the correct number of total goals was scored. The fixer claimed that a player would be paid ¬£5,000 to receive a yellow card at the start of the game as a signal to him that the match result could be manipulated. The fixer accurately predicted how many goals would be scored in a football match during the following day. The fixer asked the Daily Telegraph for ‚Ç¨60,000 so that players could be paid. The fixer claimed to be connected to the convicted match fixer Wilson Raj Perumal, a fellow Singaporean, describing Perumal as \\"the king\\". Perumal is assisting police in Hungary in their own investigations of corruption. NCA investigation & jail terms Chann Sankaran mugshot for 2013 English match fixing scandal Following newspaper reports an investigation was launched by the National Crime Agency, and subsequently jailed two businessmen, Krishna Ganeshan, and Chann Sankaran, and player Michael Boateng, who were all convicted of conspiracy to commit bribery for a failed plot to fix a game between AFC Wimbledon and Dagenham & Redbridge on 26 November. It is believed that the case may be part of wider Singaporean match-fixing syndicate which Europol and other investigations have uncovered. Reaction The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Maria Miller, said that criminal activity had \\"no place\\" in British sport, and said that the actions of the NCA showed that \\"robust\\" measures existed to tackle unlawful activities. The shadow minister for sport, Clive Efford, said that the government had failed to do enough to help the governing bodies of sports address the issue of match fixing. Efford said that the government had voted against his amendments to the Gambling Bill that would have \\"fixed the anomaly that exempts sports spread-betting operators from the requirement to pass on details of suspicious betting activity to sports governing bodies.\\"  References  2012‚Äì13 in English football Fix Organized crime activity Match fixing Association football controversies Sports scandals in England ","title":"2013 English football match-fixing scandal"},{"id":"41211319","text":"A fuel cell auxiliary power unit (FC-APU) is a fuel cell based auxiliary power unit on a vehicle that provides energy for functions other than propulsion.

He chose Gutyn Peris as his Bardic name. Life He was born as the only son of William Williams and his wife Catherine, daughter of Morgan Griffith, at Hafod Oleu in the parish of Llanbeblig, Caernarfonshire, on 2 February 1769. Not long after his birth the family moved to Llwyn Celyn, Llanberis. His father died soon afterwards, and when he had been at school for only a year, he was forced to seek employment as a farm hand. After serving in various farms in Anglesey, he found work in 1790 at the Penrhyn Quarry, and for the next thirty years worked as a quarryman, holding foreman positions as he grew older. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Ellis Jones, on 21 June 1794, and after a few years moved to her home at Braich Talog, Llandygai, where he spent the rest of his life. Griffith Williams died on 18 September 1838 and was buried at Llandygai. Works As Gutyn Peris he won his first triumph as a bard in 1803, when the Gwyneddigion Society awarded him their medal for his ode to the memory of Goronwy Owen. In 1808 he composed for Lady Penrhyn a Welsh elegy on her husband Richard Pennant, 1st Baron Penrhyn. Two years later he won prizes at St Asaph eisteddfod for an ode on the royal jubilee and another in memory of Queen Elizabeth. Some of his poems were printed by Dafydd Ddu Eryri in Corph y Gaine (1810), and in 1816 he self-published a volume of Welsh verse entitled Ffrwyth Awen. In 1811 he again won a prize, for an ode to Agriculture. For the remainder of his life he was less successful: his ode on Belshazzar's Feast was second at Denbigh in 1828, although it was printed with the winner's in the Transactions of the eisteddfod (Chester, 1830). At Beaumaris in 1832 he took second place in the competition for the best ode on the Wreck of the Rothesay Castle. According to J. E.

He also served two terms as the first principal chief of the tribe to be elected under their new constitution after the Civil War. He had to deal with continuing tensions as there were traditionalists who were opposed to assimilation to European-American ways. Checote was also a veteran: most of the Muskogee had allied with the Confederacy during the war. He served as a lieutenant colonel with a Creek mounted unit in Indian Territory. After the war he resumed preaching. Early life and education Checote was born to a Muskogee family in the Chattahoochee Valley near in what is now eastern Alabama. In 1829, he was forced to move with his parents and family to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) as part of Indian Removal. They settled near where the present-day town of Okmulgee developed.Ingrid Westmoreland, \\"Checote, Samuel (1819‚Äì1884)\\", Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Retrieved November 27, 2013. As a child Samuel first attended the Asbury Manual Labor School near Fort Mitchell; the school was named for a Methodist leader. Later, he attended an academy founded by John Harrell, a Methodist missionary. He was very influential, persuading Checote to become a minister to the Creek (Muskogee). Preacher Following removal, the Lower Creek Council, which had earlier been dominated by those who wanted to take up some European-American ways, passed laws in 1832 and 1844 forbidding any tribal member from preaching Christianity. Checote and several other Creek preachers fled for their safety; they remained outside the Creek Nation until they were able to appeal to Chief Roley McIntosh. He overrode the council and repealed the law. In 1852, Checote joined the Indian Mission Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. The national church had split into North and South denominations because of disagreement over slavery. Checote continued preaching until the Civil War began. He enlisted in the Confederate Army as captain of Company B of the First Regiment of Creek Mounted Volunteers on August 13, 1861, and on August 19, 1861, he was commissioned as lieutenant colonel of his regiment. He and his regiment participated in several actions against Union forces, including the 1864 Battle of Cabin Creek and a skirmish at Pryor Creek.Lambert, O. A. \\"Historical Sketch of Col. Samuel Checote, Once Chief of the Creek Nation.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Volume 4, Number 3. September, 1926. Retrieved November 27, 2013. After the end of the Civil War, Checote resumed his career as a Methodist preacher. He served as a circuit rider and as a presiding elder of the Indian Mission. Principal chief Checote was elected as principal chief of the Creek Nation in 1867; he was the first to serve under the new postwar Creek constitution. He was reelected to a second term in 1871. Checote's skills as a political leader were tested by tribal tensions and rivalries, which grew over the next decade. Many of the Creek were traditionalists who opposed assimilation into the white man's way of life. This group, initially led by Locha Harjo, opposed the new constitution. They eventually formed a kind of rival government based in the town of Nuyaka. After the death of Harjo, the group turned to Isparhecher, a former Checote supporter and district judge, as their chief. During this period, Checote remained affiliated with the Methodist Church. The Methodist Church, South, chose Checote as a delegate to the international 1882 Ecumenical Council in London, England. But he was unable to attend because of illness. Troubles continued with rebel opposition in the Nation. In early 1883 Checote called on the Creek Lighthorse, the law enforcement unit, led by Pleasant Porter, to put down the rival movement. In February 1883, Porter's force defeated the Nuyaka rebels in a battle that came to be known as the \\"Peach Orchard War.\\"John Bartlett Meserve. Chronicles of Oklahoma. Vol. 10, No. 1, March 1932. \\"Chief Isparhecher.\\" Retrieved April 24, 2013.Ricky, Donald B. Indians of Oklahoma. \\"Isparhecher.\\" (1999) . The Nuyaka men, accompanied by their families, moved to Anadarko, where they sought refuge among the Kiowa tribe. Isparhecher was not with them because he had gone to meet with some Cherokee, seeking their support. The Federal Government intervened, arrested the fugitives and delivered them to Fort Gibson. A U.S. Government commission came to meet with representatives of both Creek factions at Muskogee, seeking to resolve the dispute. Checote resigned as Principal Chief in mid-1883 and called for a new election. It was a contest between Isparhecher and Joseph Perryman, a member of the Checote party. The election on September 3, 1883, was very close. While Isparhecher believed that he had won and briefly served as principal chief during December 1883, the Secretary of the Interior intervened. That department ruled that Perryman had won the vote count and was rightfully the principal chief. The Perryman government named Isparhecher as its delegate in Washington, D. C. in 1884. It also compensated him for losses of his property and other expenses during the insurrection. Checote died at his home in Okmulgee on September 3, 1884. See also Richey, Russell E., Kenneth E.

History The monastery was founded in 820 by the abbot Deodat and initially was devoted to Saint Medir and Saint Gen√≠s. King Louis the Pious granted an immunity provision to the monastery which was confirmed by Charles the Bald in 844 and in 860. In 949, it moved to a new location within Amer. Rebuilt and consecrated, it was dedicated to St. Mary. The monastery gained in importance and grew in assets in the following centuries. Although he was linked with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Girona, during the 11th and 12th centuries, it remained independent. In the 12th century, it was amended again and the priory church of Santa Maria de C√≥ll was founded. In 1381, the jurisdiction of the Amer religious community was left to the monastery. In 1445, it was associated for a brief period with the monastery of Sant Pere de Galligants. In 1592, by papal order, it was attached to the monastery of Santa Maria de Roses, a union that lasted until the demise of the monastic life. Architecture and fittings Monastery's plaza Built in a basilica plan, the naves include barrel vaults with an apse; two semicircular apses are vaulted with quarter spheres. These are joined together with four arches on each side, and are decorated with Lombard-style pilasters on top. Some columns have been replaced. The bell tower is from 1900 replacing a Romanesque once, which disappeared during the Catalan Revolt. The cloister was destroyed in the earthquake of 1427, the sacristy being the only area preserved.

The van was heading for the entrance of the diplomatic facility, but did not get within ten yards of the building after the driver was shot by a bodyguard of the British ambassador and Lebanese embassy guards and lost control of the vehicle. The vehicle detonated at 11:44 a.m. after striking a parked van. The explosion \\"ripped off the front of the embassy, shredding glass, bending steel bars and destroying cars in a nearby parking lot.\\" The attack killed a total of 24 people (including the suicide bomber). Only two of the dead were American: Chief Warrant Officer Kenneth V. Welch of the U.S. Army and Petty Officer 1st Class Michael Ray Wagner of the U.S. Navy, who were both assigned to the U.S. Defense Attache Office in Beirut. The majority of those killed were Lebanese, \\"either local employees or people seeking visas\\". Of the injured, the U.S. Ambassador, Reginald Bartholomew, was slightly hurt, as well as the British Ambassador, David Miers, who was meeting with Bartholomew at the time of explosion. Responsibility The Islamic Jihad Organization (IJO) claimed responsibility for the attack in a telephone call a few hours after the explosion. The caller said, \\"The operation goes to prove that we will carry out our previous promise not to allow a single American to remain on Lebanese soil.\\" The U.S. government understood that Hezbollah had carried out the attack under the cover name of IJO with the support of Iran. Through satellite reconnaissance, U.S. intelligence discovered that a mock-up of the annex had been created at the Iranian Revolutionary Guard-run Sheikh Abdullah barracks in Baalbek to practice for the attack. Legal cases Under the amended Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, victims of the bombing and their families have filed cases against the Islamic Republic of Iran, holding it responsible for its role in the attack and demanding compensation. * Estate of Doe, et al. v Republic of Iran, et al. (2013) ‚Äì 58 foreign national employees and one American employee that were killed or injured in the 1983 embassy bombing and 1984 embassy annex bombing are awarded $8.4 billion. The judge ruled \\"that the attacks were carried out by the terrorist group Islamic Jihad, known most commonly as Hezbollah, operating with Iranian support and encouragement.\\" * Brewer v. Islamic Republic of Iran (2009) ‚Äì Security guard Richard Brewer and his family are awarded $310 million in damages. Brewer was injured in the bombing. The judge ruled \\"Hezbollah received substantial funds and support from Iran via its Ministry of Information and Security and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.

That year the Bishop of Olivolo began to be styled the Bishop of Castello. Enrico Contarini was the first to hold this title. The Doge Vitale Michiel (1096-1112) held back from participating in the First Crusade until he saw the amount of loot that the Genoese and Pisans were bringing back from Palestine. In 1099 Enrico Contarini was the spiritual leader of the fleet of about 200 ships that Michiel sent to assist in the crusade in the Levant. The fleet sailed to Rhodes, where it wintered. The emperor of Byzantium asked the Venetians not to proceed, but the bishop overcame any who were inclined to listen to this request. In the spring of 1100 the fleet went on to Myra in Asia Minor, where they obtained the remains of Saint Nicholas, his uncle Nicholas and Saint Theodore the Martyr. They went on to the Holy Land, then returned to Venice, which they reached on 6 December 1100. With Saint Nicholas the Bishop obtained a patron saint to rival the Doge's Saint Mark.

The total area of the national park is 244 km2 (94 square miles).Welcome to the National Park of Thy, Danish Forest and Nature Agency The dune and heath landscape of Thy was officially selected on 29 June 2007 to be the first national park in Denmark proper (Northeast Greenland National Park was established in 1974). Other national parks have been established later.Danish National Parks, Danish Ministry of the Environment The governmental Forest and Nature Agency states: Thy National Park is thus not just a simple tourist attraction.  Nature  The landscape comprise windy coasts and dune systems, either bare, covered by heaths, meadows or plantations, with a great number of conifers. Low-nutrient wet hollows (a kind of bog) also occur, and between this varied coastal landscape, small ponds and lakes can be found. Remains from the Stone Age Littorina Sea are visible here, in the form of occasional limestone cliffs along the coast or further inland.The Nature in National Park Thy The Biological Association of Northwest Jutland. On p.11 is a map of the Littorina Sea coastline in Thy. The drifting sands in Thy have plagued the locals for centuries, encroaching on their lands and buildings. But it was not until around the year 1800 that something was done about it and plantings of various grasses and trees was organized. Marram grass and various conifers was the main solution and the dune plantations are here today as living witnesses to the hard struggles against the forces of Nature. The plantations provided not only protection against the unrelenting sand, but also jobs, timber and firewood and with them a whole new fauna could establish in Thy, with red deer and roe deer as the largest animal. Trees and grasses are not the only vegetation in the dunes though. The sandy dune heaths in Thy National Park are a rare habitat in a European context, and they are to be protected by law, so they have been a major contributory factor in establishing the national park. It is a continuous job trying to preserve them from invading flora. The larger animals are grazing excess vegetation, trees are sometimes uprooted and controlled burning is carried out occasionally, to give the sandy heath a chance. The heath vegetation might look simple to the untrained eye, but is in fact very varied, dominated by common heather, sand sedge, marram grass, the edible black crowberry, bell heather and various lichens. The sandy heaths of Thy attract many birds with some very rare breeders (in Denmark), such as crane and wood sandpiper and they form a habitat for a variety of smaller animals like the natterjack toad and many insects. The wet hollows in between support quite different plants such as bog bilberry, bayberry, marsh gentian, cranberry and a variety of sundew.The dune plantations of Sydthy pdf-map and info.

It is an area of about 40 km2, dominated by sandy heath and it is in fact the largest connected sandy heath in Denmark. About 60‚Äì70% of the preserve is open to the public, except from 1 April to 15 July, when the birds are breeding. Hanstholm game preserve is home to many species of birds, some rare or endangered in Denmark, including the European golden plover, which breeds nowhere else in the country.

Cultural history  The cultural history found in Thy National Park is as old as the land itself. At the end of the last Ice Age, when the ice melted and receded, the land began to rise by the process of post-glacial rebound and the virgin grounds were soon settled by Stone Age cultures. Their early presence and activities are still visible in the landscape in the shape of dolmens, burial mounds, kitchen middens and organized flint productions. As the land continued to rise from the sea, human activity increased as well and Thy was a very active spot, with a thriving culture in the Bronze Ages. We have archaeological evidence from their settlements in the area and many barrows from that period can still be seen,Thy has Denmark's highest concentration of Bronze Age barrows. especially in the northern reaches near Hanstholm. An unknown number of the pre-historic remains have been covered by the drifting sands and dunes over the aeons though, so the fact that so many mounds are still visible is an indication of just how active the area was. The human activity continued into the iron Age, the Viking Age and the Middle Ages, with their own individual traces in the national park, often with a strong tie to the harsh North Sea. It was at some point during these times that the formerly lush environment around Thy collapsed. For many years the land had been stressed and over-exploited by excessive grazing and tree cutting. Finally drifting sands got the upper hand and have formed the environment and culture here for several centuries. It was not until around the year 1800 that larger organized efforts to stop the destructive sand drifts was initiated and it took more than a hundred years for them to succeed. From modern times, perhaps the most dramatic evidence of human activities are the German bunkers built here during World War II, when Denmark was occupied. The German Wehrmacht found it important to fortify themselves in Thy and all along the west coast. As part of the Atlantic Wall, Thy was strategically important in dominating the North Sea, limiting the Allied marine forces, as an effective defence against the British air force and for many other reasons. Many of the massive concrete bunkers and fortifications are still around today, some abandoned or ruined and some restored and now functioning as museums and testimonies of that bleak era. In the north part of the park lies the Hanstholm Fortress, as a modern museum of the events that took place here in World War II. In total, five restored bunkers and batteries are spread along the coastline in the national park. File:Dyrh√∏ie Rundh√∏j IMGP6552.JPGDyrh√∏j. One of the many Bronze Age burial mounds in Thy.

It is the earliest medieval civic chronicle and the earliest set of annals composed by a layman. The Annales form a chronological account of the history of Genoa from 1099 until 1294. The first annals were composed by Caffarus, a private citizen, on his own initiative. In 1152, he petitioned the republic to keep a copy in the public archives (comuni cartularium) and thenceforth the annals were continued at public expense. Caffarus, who probably began the work around 1100, continued it himself down to 1163. A series of officials of the chancery continued the Annales between 1169 and 1197, when work was taken over by the scribe and diplomat Ogerius. He worked down to 1216; thereafter, the annalists were anonymous, and at times a committee, until the last entry was added in 1294. The public manuscript of the Annales ianuenses is now kept in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, lat. 10136. The content of the annals is confined to the names of the consuls, the changes to the constitution (the compagniae or sworn association), changes to the coinage and the victories of Genoa over her enemies, particularly Saracens and Pisans.

The aquatorium was designed by George Washington Maher and constructed in 1921.Gary Bathing Beach Bathhouse It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 25, 1994. It has been converted to a museum of flight, honoring Octave Chanute and the Tuskegee Airmen. It was built as a shower/bathroom/changing facility in 1921 and was dubbed the Lakefront Park Bathhouse. It was a major focal point of the Miller Beach community for decades. The building is architecturally significant as one of the earliest examples of pre-cast concrete modular construction. Ninety percent of the building is built with only six basic cast blocks, the most basic being the T-Block, a precursor of today's standard concrete block.Miller Beach Neighborhood Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. By the 1960s the facility was falling into major disrepair. In 1971 the building was closed to the public and boarded up.Miller Community The Aquatorium was rescued from demolition by the Chanute Aquatorium Society in 1991. The Society invented the word Aquatorium meaning \\"place to view the water\\" in order to disassociate the structure with the word bathhouse. Conversion to a museum of flight No longer a place to change or shower, the building now serves as a museum honoring Octave Chanute, the father of flight. Chanute conducted some of the first heavier-than-air glider flights in human history in the high dunes just yards from the structure. His successful experiments and glider designs paved the way for the Wright brothers' powered flight at Kitty Hawk. The building also honors the Tuskegee Airmen, aeronautic pioneers who spearheaded the integration of the armed forces. Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been raised for the building's restoration and revamping. Lee Construction Management of Miller was employed to begin restoration of the facility. In the spring of 1998, they demolished the east showers and began construction of new wing in January 1999. In the spring of 2000 major reconstruction of the second floor waterproofed the first-floor areas so museum space could be constructed below. The cornerstone for The Tuskegee Airmen Wing of the new museum was laid January 17, 1999.

Free Speech For People has expanded its work since its founding and currently engages in efforts related to legal advocacy, corporate charter reform, and anti-corruption. In January 2017, Free Speech For People joined nonprofit RootsAction to launch the Impeach Donald Trump Now campaign to target corruption at the highest level of government. In August, 2018 the organization released the book: The Constitution Demands It: The Case For the Impeachment of Donald Trump, authored by Free Speech For People executive Director, John Bonifaz, Legal Director, Ron Fein, and Board Chair, Ben Clements. The organization also launched the Impeachment Project at this time, a project designed to encompass all of Free Speech For People's anti-corruption related efforts. Background Free Speech For People was founded by Massachusetts-based attorneys John Bonifaz and Jeffrey Clements in January, 2010 in response to the Citizens United v. FEC Supreme Court ruling. Citizens United v. FEC is a U.S. constitutional law case dealing with the regulation of campaign spending by corporations, and was extended to include labor unions and other associations. Free Speech For People supports a proposed 28th Constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United v. FEC ruling, that declares money does not equate to free speech, and corporations do not hold the rights of people. Amendment work Free Speech for People supports the Democracy For All Amendment and the People's Rights Amendment. The Democracy For All Amendment refers to a Senate amendment bill (S.J. Res. 8, 115th Congress) introduced by Senator Tom Udall and an accompanying House amendment bill (H.J. Res. 31, 115th Congress). The Democracy For All Amendment seeks to allow Congress to set limits on campaign spending, as existed prior to Citizens United v. Fec. Free Speech For People also supports the People's Rights Amendment, which includes a Senate amendment bill (S.J. Res. 20, 15th Congress) [and an accompanying House amendment bill (H.J. Res. 88, 115th Congress). The People's Rights Amendment, proposed by House Representative Jim McGovern, seeks to clarify the distinction between the rights of corporations and natural persons. Legal advocacy Free Speech For People also engages in legal advocacy, public education and organizing to challenge the influence of money in politics, unchecked corporate power, and presidential corruption and abuse of power. Legislation Recent legislative efforts include the drafting of a city ordinance, subsequently passed by the city of St. Petersburg, Florida, to abolish super PACs and ban foreign-influenced corporations from spending in local elections. The ordinance was the first of its kind, and was passed by the St. Petersburg city council after a 6‚Äì2 vote on October 5, 2017. The ordinance requires corporations that spend money in St. Petersburg elections to certify they are not foreign-influenced, or owned in whole or a significant part by foreign entities. The ordinance also establishes limits on contributions to political action committees, thereby abolishing super PACs in local elections. Other notable legislative efforts include the Massachusetts No Excuses for Corporate Discrimination Act (Bill H.767), drafted by Free Speech For People and intended to prevent business corporations from claiming religious exemptions from anti-discrimination law. Litigation Some of Free Speech For People's recent and notable litigation include the case Lieu v. Federal Election Commission. On November 4, 2016, Free Speech For People, on behalf of a bipartisan coalition of Members of Congress and 2016 congressional candidates, filed a lawsuit against the Federal Election Commission to abolish super PACs. The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., seeks the reversal of the 2010 federal appeals court ruling in SpeechNow.org v. FEC, which created super PACs. Other key cases have targeted state campaign contribution limits, such as Lair v. Motl, in which Free Speech For People filed an amicus brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, arguing that Montana's campaign contribution limits should be upheld to protect the constitutional promise of political equality for all. Other cases have focused on individual worker's rights, including Elster v. City of Seattle, an amicus brief filed in partnership with Demos, to defend the city against a constitutional challenge to Seattle's \\"democracy voucher\\" program, a nationally-recognized public campaign financing system enacted by voter initiative in 2015 and first used in the city's 2017 election. Corporate Charter Reform After a report from the Mine Safety and Health Administration found that \\"if basic safety measures were in place there would have been no loss of life at the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster\\" which claimed the lives of 29 coal miners, Free Speech For People led efforts with the Rainforest Alliance, Appalachian Voices, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to revoke the corporate charter of the Appalachian coal mining company Massey Energy. Challenging President Trump Impeachment campaign In January 2017, Free Speech For People, joined by nonprofit RootsAction, launched the \\"Impeach Donald Trump Now\\" campaign. The campaign calls upon Congress to open impeachment investigations of Donald Trump. Their petition currently has over 1.4 million signers. The nine grounds proposed are: obstruction of justice; violations of the Foreign Emoluments Clause and Domestic Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution; conspiring with others to: (a) commit crimes against the United States involving the solicitation and intended receipt by the Donald J. Trump campaign of things of value from a foreign government and other foreign nationals; and (b) conceal those violations; advocating illegal violence, giving aid and comfort to white supremacists and neo-Nazis, and undermining constitutional protections of equal protection under the law; abusing the pardon power; recklessly threatening nuclear war against foreign nations, undermining and subverting the essential diplomatic functions and authority of federal agencies, including the United States Department of State, and engaging in other conduct that grossly and wantonly endangers the peace and security of the United States, its people and people of other nations, by heightening the risk of hostilities involving weapons of mass destruction, with reckless disregard for the risk of death and grievous bodily harm; directing or endeavoring to direct law enforcement, including the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to investigate and prosecute political adversaries and others, for improper purposes not justified by any lawful function of his office, thereby eroding the rule of law, undermining the independence of law enforcement from politics, and compromising the constitutional right to due process of law; undermining the freedom of the press; and cruelly and unconstitutionally imprisoning children and their families. The Constitution Demands It: The Case for the Impeachment of Donald Trump On August 15, Free Speech For People released the book The Constitution Demands It: The Case for the Impeachment of Donald Trump. The book was written by Free Speech For People Legal Director Ron Fein, Co-Founder and President John Bonifaz, and Chair of the Board of Directors Ben Clements, with a foreword by The Nation's national affairs correspondent John Nichols. The Constitution Demands It provides the case for impeachment of Donald Trump. The Impeachment Project and other efforts to challenge President Trump On July 10, 2018, Free Speech For People launched a new campaign called the Impeachment Project, encompassing key initiatives launched to challenge corruption. The Impeachment Project includes efforts to: launch impeachment proceedings; to press for an investigation into whether to dissolve the Trump Organization Inc.; to demand that the Federal Election Commission investigate potential coordination between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign: and to advance the Divest Trump Soho Campaign to victory. In December 2016, Free Speech For People, with Campaign for Accountability, filed a complaint before the Federal Election Commission demanding an immediate investigation into whether the Russian Government illegally spent money to influence the 2016 presidential election, in possible coordination with the Trump campaign. In May 2017, they filed an updated complaint before the FEC based on new evidence. The Impeachment Project also encompasses efforts related to Trump's business interests, including a call to the New York Attorney General to revoke the corporate charter of the Trump Organization, Inc. Free Speech For People also led a successful campaign in California and New York, in which it called on the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) and the New York State Comptroller to divest public pension funds from the Trump SoHo Hotel in New York City. After months of pressure, the private equity fund that owns Trump SoHo announced it will buy out the Trump Organization's contract to market and manage the troubled luxury condo/hotel, breaking a chain of illegal payments from state and local pension funds to the President.

History Founding According to the website of the History Committee of the Population Association of America, the PAA was conceived on December 15, 1930 at a meeting in the office of Henry Pratt Fairchild at New York University. It was an offshoot of the American National Committee of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population (IUSSP) which had been formed in 1927 with Raymond Pearl of Johns Hopkins University as its first President. The History Committee identifies the following events in the timeline prior to the founding of PAA that were relevant to founding PAA: * 1922: Scripps sets up the Scripps Foundation for Research in Population Problems. This would later be renamed the Scripps Gerontology Center in 1972. * 1927: The World Population Conference is held in Geneva, leading to the formation of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population (IUSSP). * 1928: Milbank Memorial Fund begins studies in population in New York City. * 1929: Guy Burch founds the Population Reference Bureau in New York City. * December 15, 1930: A small group begins to discuss forming the PAA in New York City Town Hall. * May 7, 1931: The PAA is organized in New York City Town Hall. * April 22‚Äì23, 1932: The PAA holds its first annual meeting in New York City Town Hall. * 1935: Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of then-U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, attends the PAA's Conference on Population Studies in Relation to Social Planning. Frank Lorimer produces the first issue of Population Index using office space at Victor Building, which at the time also hosted the Population Reference Bureau. Journal The flagship journal of the PAA, called Demography, is a bi-monthly journal published by Springer and was founded in 1964. It is one of the world's leading journals on issues related to population and demographic trends. Award The Irene B. Taeuber Award for research achievements of the Population Association of America is named after Irene Barnes Taeuber.Award Criteria and Past Recipients: Irene B. Taeuber Award, Population Association of America, retrieved 2016-07-17. Conferences The PAA holds an annual meeting every March/April where people present research and data on population trends. The PAA held its first annual meeting on April 22‚Äì23, 1932, in New York City. Since then, annual meetings have been held every year except the year 1938 and the years 1943, 1944, and 1945 (the latter three due to the United States' involvement in World War II). Initially, PAA Annual Meetings were held in New York City and nearby East Coast cities, due to the concentration of population researchers and policymakers in that area. The first meeting outside the eastern U.S. time zone was held in Chicago in 1958. Since then, conferences have been held in numerous locations across the United States ranging from Dallas and Miami to Minneapolis, and also in some cities in Canada such as Montreal and Toronto. The Annual Meetings for 2011, 2012, and 2013 were held in Washington D.C., San Francisco, and New Orleans respectively. The annual meeting website is maintained in collaboration with Princeton University. The Pew Research Center is among the many demography- related research groups that sends many papers and posters to this conference. Some of the PAA's Annual Meetings and additional meetings have been held in collaboration with other professional associations such as the American Statistical Association (1933, 1950), American Philosophical Society (1938), National Economic and Social Planning Association (1939), and American Sociology Association (1967). The PAA has also sponsored other population- related conferences, such as the 1935 Conference on Population Estimates that Eleanor Roosevelt attended and the 2013 conference Integrating Genetics and the Social Sciences held at the University of Colorado.

Its mouth is in the municipality of Saint-Mathias-sur-Richelieu in the Rouville Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Mont√©r√©gie, in Quebec, in Canada. Hurons River flows through the Les Maskoutains Regional County Municipality, RCM of La Vall√©e-du-Richelieu Regional County Municipality, then the western part of the MRC Rouville Regional County Municipality. The latter is entirely east of the Richelieu River. Besides the village areas (or hamlets), agriculture is the main economic activity in this small valley. The river surface is generally frozen from mid-December to the end of March. Safe traffic on the ice is generally from late December to early March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation.  Geography  The head of the river watered many streams of the area north-west of Saint- Hyacinthe (sectors La Pr√©sentation, Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu, Sainte-Marie- Madeleine (parish) and Sainte-Madeleine (village)). From its source, the river flows straight south. It cuts Highway 20, passes near Golf Club La Madeleine, cutting the Canadian National Railway tracks and Highway 116 about a mile west of the town of Sainte-Madeleine. In its journey south, the river veers to the southwest to flow over (measured by water) in Saint-Jean-Baptiste where it enters the village. The river then passes between the Mont Rougemont and Mont Saint-Hilaire it bypasses remotely. Then runs almost straight up to the limit of Saint-Mathias-sur-Richelieu, close to the northern part of the former territory of Sainte-Marie-de-Monnoir (merged to Marieville in 2001). Hence, this small river cut Saint-Mathias-sur-Richelieu, diagonally across by water) to enter the Richelieu River, south of the village of Saint-Mathias-sur- Richelieu and north of the city of Richelieu. In its course, especially in agricultural areas, the river is bordered on the east side by Highway 227 (called \\"row South River\\" in the municipality and, of Sainte-Marie-Madeleine). On the other side of the river, the road is named \\"North River Row\\". While in Saint-Mathias-sur-Richelieu, the road \\"Huron River East\\" along the river to its mouth, while the road \\"West Huron River\\" runs a segment on the other side of the river. A designated hamlet \\"Huron River\\" was formed in Saint-Jean- Baptiste, about west of Rougement and southeast of Mont Saint-Hilaire. Coordinates: -73.15527; 45.49528. Another designated hamlet \\"Hameau de Saint- Mathias-sur-Richelieu\\" is located 6 miles northeast of Chambly, on the left bank of the Hurons River.

It course may be navigable by small boats on some segment, especially in the period of seasonal flooding. Several bridges farm spans the little river, especially in the north.  History  In all of the La Vall√©e- du-Richelieu Regional County Municipality as well, this sub-watershed was conducive to hunting, fishing and agriculture in Native American prehistory. For millennia, the area was frequented by indigenous semi-nomadic. European origin pioneers (or their descendants) have begun to colonize the territory from the late 17th century, especially in the vicinity of the Richelieu River.  Toponymy  In October 1673, the first acts of the concessions granted by the Lord of Chambly refer to the river called \\"the Huron\\". In common usage, this potamonyme turned a century later as \\"Hurons River\\". This gazetteer adaptation is mentioned in Acts 1773. At the beginning of the French colony in Canada, many villages Iroquoian (Iroquois and Huron) are established near the Richelieu River (mainly near the mouth of the river), taking advantage of the fur trade with the French authorities and barter with Native American communities. In the history of New France, many indigenous communities came to settle near the French population centers for safety and supply.

Personal life and education Morse was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Mary Louise and Harold Schwartz, who later moved to Arizona. After the couple divorced, Mary Louise married Clifford Morse (Morse would later take his stepfather's surname) and lived in Central Lake, Michigan. H. Gary Morse was first married to Sharon Morse, who died in 1999. Morse and his second wife, Renee, lived together in a house in The Villages worth more than $1 million. Morse had three children ‚Äî Mark Morse, Jennifer Parr and Tracy Morse‚Äî each of whom own and work for the Holding Company of the Villages Ltd. He is known for having had a private life, making little contact with other residents and not giving interviews to the media. Upon his death, his family issued the following statement regarding Morse's life: \\"Dad never sought the limelight. He was content to stay in the background and enjoy seeing Villagers revel in this amazing lifestyle of their adopted hometown. While he was a friend and adviser to captains of industry, presidents and heads of state, he never lost focus on this community and making it the greatest retirement development in the world.\\" He was a close friend of former United States Surgical Corporation CEO Leon C. Hirsch, and is the grandfather of actress Megan Boone. Morse died on October 29, 2014. Career Prior to being a land developer, Morse worked as an advertising executive in Chicago. In 1983, Morse moved to Florida to take over his father's business selling vacant lots to mobile home owners. Morse instead decided to build homes, restaurants, pools, and golf courses, and by 1986 Morse was selling more than 500 homes per year. In 2011, the Holding Company of the Villages Ltd. generated at least $550 million in revenue. Morse also was the proprietor of a bank, an insurance company, a local newspaper and other properties. Morse has been described as owning \\"just about everything\\" in the community. In 2008, Morse settled for $40 million a class-action lawsuit that alleged that he had misused monthly community amenity fees. The IRS investigated the special tax districts Morse used for The Villages on the basis that the bonds sold by the districts did not qualify for tax-exempt status. However, once the IRS learned that the bonds had been fully redeemed, the investigation was closed as moot. Political involvement Morse, his children, and The Villages have donated tens of thousands of dollars to the campaigns of Florida Governor Rick Scott, and served as major fundraisers for George W. Bush and Mitt Romney. In addition, Morse donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican National Committee. Morse also used his 147-foot yacht, the Cracker Bay, for political gatherings. Upon receiving news of his death, Scott and United States Senator Marco Rubio issued separate statements on Morse's vision and ultimate realization of The Villages. Democrats in The Villages have complained about what they see as their marginalization.

In 1867 he sent to the National Exhibition a painting titled ‚ÄúEl mendigo o Peri√≥dico‚Äù (The beggar or Newspaper) awarded a medal of third class. His exhibited in Spain throughout the last third of the 19th century. Thus, he got a medal of second class for his work Le Opere, campi√±a romana in 1871, took part in the Exhibition of Barcelona in 1867, and the International Exhibition of Fine arts of the Town hall of Barcelona in 1886. The Burial of Mariano Fortuny (1874) But, simultaneously, his success in Spain and his foreign contacts allowed him to appear in the international exhibitions such as the one in Naples in 1877, where he won a diploma of honor with Al toque del Ave Mar√≠a, the Universal Exhibition in Vienna in 1876 or the one in Paris in 1878. He was trained and for many years active in Naples painting in oil and watercolor. He mixed Spanish and Italian influences. Once in Italy, he became a close friend of the Spaniard Mariano Fortuny, who influenced him to paint orientalist themes, as well as the views of Rome and its surroundings. However, at the same time, the influence of Domenico Morelli and the group of Neapolitan School of Portici is also observed in his paintings. With time, his artistic ambitions within the canons of the epoch led him to great themes of genre and history. Contadino (Farmer, or Peasant) c.1886 In 1886, he painted five large canvas on Catalan history for the residence of Miguel Boada (Proclamation of the Prince of Viana, Fiveller and Ferdinand of Antequera, Embarcation of Jaime I to Mallorca, Roger de Lluria and the son of the count of Anjou y The Countess of Urgell asking for grace from the Count of Antequera). He was nominated President of the International Artistic Circle of Rome and was asked to paint the official portrait of Maria Cristina for the town hall of Barcelona. He later produced paintings like Despu√©s del Oficio del Pontificado (1888), Joven argelina (1891), Guardia suizo del Vaticano, and La fuga. His paintings were published in most important illustrated magazines of the time and exhibited on International Expositions. The Sala Par√©s of Barcelona dedicated an exposition to his works; he collaborated frequently with the publication ‚ÄúAlbum Sal√≥n‚Äù.Article in Jose de la Mano biography. Among his works are: La fuga interrotta and La conca dell' Ave Maria, exhibited at Naples in 1877. At Turin, in 1880, he exhibited two oils, Il bosco and La laguna; and three watercolors: La befana, Svizzero del Papa, and Toilette.

The series consists of 159 volumes with 72 pages each volume, and was published by Hanoi Fine Arts Publishing House. History Hesman originally is an adaptation of Voltron, a United States cartoon television series with first 4 volumes based on that cartoon. Hesman name is derived from \\"He's man\\" (He is a man, not a robot). The next 155 volumes of the series are H√πng L√¢n's own composition with many events and tens of characters were created.http://www.hunglan.com/?p=1007 Along the storyline, H√πng L√¢n added many elements of the real robot genre such as energy sources for Hesman to function or upgrades that alter Hesman's appearance substantially and his status as a cognitive robot. If Voltron is merely a machine, Hesman grew out of this archetype and has been given a personality, which can be described as serious but occasionally displays cunning and a sense of humor. On the other hand, fantastical elements such as magic, wizards and ghosts were also recurrent. Hesman details an adventure of an intelligent and partially autonomous robot and its human companions. Throughout the series, Hesman and the team travel the Galaxy, fight against various antagonists to defend the universe's peace.

Retrieved February 21, 2018 The extreme metal album examines a number of antisemitic concepts and incidents throughout history. Reception In his review for Allmusic, Thom Jurek notes that \\"Black Shabbis is not for everybody, not even some Saft fans necessarily, but it is a powerful, excellent work that uses the metal genre well ‚Äì expertly even ‚Äì and will convince headbangers of its essential importance as one of the voices out there that stands tall and defiant in the face of much of the anti-Semitism that is promoted by some black and death metal bands. For everyone else, it is an angry howl of both pain and resistance whose anger is carried beautifully as the artist's ultimate weapon: his imagination and creativity to provoke, to give pause and reflection\\". Metal Reviews stated \\"Black Shabbis takes in a range of styles, and taking into account the previous works of its creator it's difficult to know whether Black Shabbis is a serious attempt at making a metal record, or more a pastiche of the genre as a whole ... Black Shabbis has some good ideas, but it's an awkward, bitty album. Saft clearly has talent, but he's effectively crippled by a weird, overly dry production and a steadfast refusal to stick to any one idea. Still, there's hope here, and if Jamie Saft ever raises his game and makes a Black Shabbis II he might be on to a good thing. As it is, Black Shabbis is an interesting idea with a rather messy execution\\".metalreviews.com review. Retrieved February 21, 2018 Keith Kahn- Harris wrote that \\"Black Shabbis is not the product of a metal band rooted in the metal scene, but of a one-off project that sets out to explore a particular aesthetic ... Saft is clearly a genius at wielding and manipulating the musical tools available in the metal armoury. Contrary to the stereotype of metal as a stock of banal clich√©s played by morons, metal has diversified enormously in the last three decades, creating a sophisticated and complex panopoly of sounds and possibilities. Saft shows no loyalty to any one style and the tracks skip radically between influences and sub-genres ...

The company produced sheets of steel, coated with a thin layer of tin. Photographs of the company's plant is part of the archive collections of the University of Indiana.  History  Early years The earliest roots of the company trace back to November 1903 when the American Tin Plate Company and the American Sheet Steel company merged. By the time of the merge a total of seventy one plants were included in the consolidation of the companies. During April 1906 the company started the Sabraton Works plant at Morgantown, West Virginia at a time when the scarcity of steel was affecting the operation of tin plate plants. The company experienced labor unrest in 1919. The company was involved in a U.S. Supreme Court case (1937).  The Morgantown Factory  The American Sheet and Tin Plate Company opened their Morgantown operations in 1906 after purchasing the layout for the failed Morgantown Tin Plate Mill Company from local industrialist George C. Sturgiss. Sturgiss has originally sold the property to the Rolling Mill Company of America who sold to the Morgantown Tin Plate Company in December 1904.The Monongalia County Courthouse, County Clerks Office, Deed Books 67 & 71, p. 318 & 11. However, the Morgantown Tin Plate Company quickly went bankrupt before the factory could be completed, with Sturgiss regaining the land and plans for the factory for a fee of $200,200, after an arduous court battle. Sturgiss then sold the land and the factory to the American Sheet and Tin Plate Company in 1905.The Monongalia County Courthouse, County Clerks Office, Deed Book 84, p. 236-241. Operating for more than a quarter of a century, the completion and operation of the mill greatly enhanced Morgantown‚Äôs industrial capability and led to the construction of an electric street railway to ferry workers to and from work. One of Sabraton‚Äôs earliest industrial centers, the plant originally employed 300 men with the anticipation of eventually employing 800 men and women. Despite labor disputes and shutdowns at other American Sheet and Tin Plate Co. factories, the Sabraton Works rarely featured shutdowns as a result of labor unrest.Pittsburgh Daily Post, Pittsburgh, PA, July 20, 1909 The plant did shutdown occasionally due to droughts, as in September 1908, and steel shortages, like the one in January 1913.The Buffalo Enquirer, Buffalo, NY, September 23, 1908 & The Daily Telegram, Clarksburg, WV, January 25, 1913. The largest shutdown occurred on June 21, 1931 as a result of the Great Depression and had the factory closed until July 24, 1933. This reopening was short lived however, as the company closed the Morgantown facility permanently in 1934. In 1940, the Sterling Faucet Company took over operations at the old American Sheet and Tin Plate Company building employing 22 people, ten years later employing 1,000.

The fifth, a 57-year-old woman, died on 31 December 2016 in the village of Tujure in the north-east of the country.

Retrieved 27 Nov 2013. In the past, the tribe had two subgroups: the Sinabu and Capuibo.Olson 271 Population and \\"the last Pacahuaras\\" The Pacahuara community on the Alto Iv√≥n River began with the efforts of Summer Institute of Linguistics missionaries Guy East and Gilbert Prost to contact the group from 1969 to 1971. The missionaries moved a Pacahuara family, consisting of a man married to two sisters, and their seven children to Puerto Tujur√© in Ch√°cobo territory. Since 1974, multiple reports have referred to this family as \\"the last Pacahuaras.\\" Two children of the family, Bose and Buca married one another but had no children. Several of their siblings married Ch√°cobo spouses and have children as does one sister who married two non-indigenous men and had a child with each. Altogether, 43 individuals are either descendants of the family that was moved to Puerto Tujur√©, including seven who had died as of mid-2016. Many additional people identified as Pacahuara in Bolivia's 2012 Census, in which a total of 161 individuals indicated this ethnicity. Diego Villar attributes this \\"Pacaguara boom\\" to the increased local value of Pacahuara identity in a plurinational Bolivia, among other local factors. He notes several instances of Chacobo relatives of the Pacahuaras, or communities in which they live, now describing themselves as Pacahuaras. In addition, five families of Pacahuaras living in voluntary isolation are believed to be in Pando Department. Language The language of the contacted Pacahuara is a Bolivian Panoan language, which are part of the greater Panoan language family. The language is not written.\\"Pacahuara.\\" Ethnologue. Retrieved 27 Nov 2013. It is not clear if an Arawakan language called Pacaguara was spoken by the Pacahuara people, or if the identical name is a coincidence. There is also a word list collected by Castillo that has not been classified. See Pacahuaras-Castillo. Economy The Pacahuaran economy is agriculture and harvesting-based, with collected chestnut and palm hearts used in trade. Those chestnuts and palm heart not traded are consumed by the collectors or converted into other goods: chestnuts may be processed into homemade soap, while palm hearts are good sources of protein. Agriculture Agriculture is simple, rustic and limited to rice, corn, sugarcane, cassava, and banana bachi. Hunting and fishing are traditional activities and even to this day vital for their livelihoods, along with the harvesting of fruits. Notes References * Olson, James Stuart.

United States, 359 U.S. 187 (1959), is a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. The decision held that the double jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not prohibit the prosecution of a conspiracy in federal court under federal law when that same conspiracy has already resulted in a conviction in state court under state law.. Background Abbate was part of a conspiracy to blow up multiple facilities owned by the Southern Bell Telephone Company. He was convicted in Illinois under a state law making it a crime to conspire to destroy the property of another and sentenced to three months of imprisonment. Thereafter, Abbate was indicted in federal district court for a violation of federal law stemming from the same conspiracy. Decision The question presented in this case had already been decided by the Supreme Court in United States v. Lanza. Abbate asked that the Court overrule its prior decision, which the Court declined to do. The Court reasoned that overruling Lanza would result in serious and undesirable consequences. Particularly, the state conviction here resulted in only three months' imprisonment, while the federal conviction made up to five years of imprisonment available. The Court deemed this potential disparity to be problematic. The only way to ensure that federal law enforcement interests would be vindicated under such a regime would be to displace state power to prosecute actions that also constitute federal crimes, which would be a massive shift in the balance of criminal power as between the states and the federal government. Justice Brennan wrote separately to address an additional argument that the government had presented but that was unnecessary to the resolution of the case. The government contended that the Double Jeopardy Clause should not be construed to bar separate prosecutions for the same acts when those prosecutions are based on different evidence and vindicate different interests. Brennan rejected this argument, noting that it could lead to harassment of defendants by empowering the government to prosecute the same people over and over again using different statutes that protect different interests. The dissenters argued for reversal, relying on two arguments. First, they observed that most civilized countries recognized that a conviction elsewhere barred a conviction in their own jurisdiction. Second, they argued that the Double Jeopardy Clause was intended to represent a national policy against allowing the federal government to prosecute someone who had already been prosecuted in another court for an offense stemming from his actions. Facts This case was decided the same day as Bartkus v. Illinois, a case with similar facts except the order of the convictions was reversed: the state conviction followed the federal conviction. The Supreme Court likewise did not find a double jeopardy violation. This case is also a rare example of the majority opinion's author writing a separate opinion concurring in his own majority opinion.

Openlands has protected and expanded public access to more than 55,000 acres of land for parks, forest preserves, land and water greenway corridors, and urban gardens across the Chicago metropolitan region. It is a member of Chicago Wilderness.  History  The organization was founded in 1963 as the Openlands Project, a project of the Welfare Council of Metropolitan Chicago. MacArthur Foundation has been a large supporter of Openlands. Between 1984 and 2018, MacArthur awarded $4,808,360 in grants to the organization.  Projects  In 1970, the Lake Michigan Federation, now the Alliance for the Great Lakes, was founded as a project of Openlands before becoming an independent organization. In 1980, Friends of the Chicago River was established as a program of Openlands before becoming a separate non-profit organization. In 1982 the Canal Corridor Association was formed by Openlands to create the first National Heritage Corridor along the old Illinois and Michigan Canal. In 1991, Openlands launched TreeKeepers, a program that trains and certifies volunteers to care for trees on some public property in the Chicago region. Program trainers include tree experts, arborist, and Openlands staff. TreeKeepers is part of Openland's Urban Forestry Program which has received $1.5 million from MacArthur Foundation since 2013 to increase the Chicago region's tree canopy and expand community outreach and engagement. Since the program launched, the organization has trained more than 2,000 volunteers. More than 5,000 trees have been planted in Chicago by volunteers of the program since 2013. The Openlands Lakeshore Preserve in Fort Sheridan opened to the public in 2011. It encompasses 77 acres of ravines and bluffs along a mile of the shore of Lake Michigan. In 2012 Hackmatack National Wildlife Refuge was established by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service after seven years of advocacy by Openlands and partners. Hackmatack was the first national wildlife refuge in the Chicago region and will eventually consist of 11,200 acres of protected wildlife habitat.

Popularity  Ciba Cake with Brown Sugar and roasted soybean flour Ciba is mostly popular in southern China areas including Chongqing municipality, Guangdong province, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, Guizhou province, Sichuan province, Hunan province and Hubei province. There is also similar food in Japan, Korea and other countries, but preparation and eating methods are slightly different.

People also eat Ciba during family celebrations to share their joy and delight of festival.Ciba Cake with Brown Sugar and roasted soybean flour  Significance  Ciba is glutinous and sticky, embodying Chinese people's attitude on kinship and friendship to stay close to each other. Some Ciba are round-shaped, meaning reunion in Chinese. During festivals, people usually make many Ciba cakes, which requires the cooperation of many people from a big family or several families. Therefore, Ciba cakes often represent family reunion and good luck in New Year.  Special Activity- Pounding Ciba  Traditionally, people put cooked glutinous rice into a wooden or stone mortar and use large wooden pestles to pound. People use wooden or stone materials because glutinous rice will not stick to them. Usually, two people take turns to use large wooden pestles to pound rice in the mortar for around 30 minutes, and they add some water in mortar occasionally. People will then shape glutinous rice by hand and cook it. In places such as Ciqikou in Chongqing municipality, there are still people pounding Ciba in street shops.

As a Polish-American, educated in the United States, he lived and worked primarily in the United States and France. He was known for his work in optimisation (combinatorial, linear, nonlinear), convex polyhedra, stable matching, and the theory and practice of electoral systems, jury decision, and social choice. He was Directeur de Recherche de classe exceptionnelle (emeritus) of the C.N.R.S. at the √âcole Polytechnique (Paris). He was awarded the John von Neumann Theory Prize by INFORMS in 2013. Michel Louis Balinski died in Bayonne, France. He maintained an active involvement in research and public appearances, his last public engagement took place in January 2019. Early life Michel Balinski was born in Geneva, Switzerland, the grandson of the Polish bacteriologist and founder of UNICEF, Ludwik Rajchman. Brought up by his mother Irena (Rajchman) Balinska and his grandparents, they were living in France when the Nazis invaded in 1940. They fled via Spain and Portugal to the United States. He graduated from the Edgewood School in Greenwich CT in 1950, earned a B.A. degree cum laude in mathematics at Williams College in 1954 and a M.Sc. in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956. He completed a Ph.D. in mathematics at Princeton University in 1959 under the supervision of Albert W. Tucker. Career After completing his Ph.D. Balinski remained at Princeton University as a research associate then lecturer in mathematics. From 1963 to 1965 he was associate professor of economics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He was then appointed to the Graduate School of the City University of New York, first as associate professor then (as of 1969) professor of mathematics. One of his doctoral students at the City University was another noted mathematician, Louis Billera, through whom he has many academic descendants. In 1978 he was appointed professor of organization and management and of administrative sciences at Yale. In parallel with his academic work, Balinski engaged in consulting as of the time he was a graduate student at Princeton. A participant in the beginnings of what became the consulting firm Mathematica, he was a senior consultant with the firm from 1962 to 1974. He also acted as a consultant elsewhere, including the Rand Corporation, Mobil Oil Research, the ORTF (Office de Radiodiffusion-T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise), the Mayor's office of the City of New York (as member of the Operations Research Council), and Econ, Inc. From 1975 to 1977 he was chairman of System and Decision Sciences at IIASA (International Institute for Applied Systems Analyses) at Laxenburg, Austria. In 1980 Balinski settled in France, becoming Directeur de Recherche de classe exceptionnelle of the CNRS (Centre National de Recherche Scientifique) at the Laboratoire d‚ÄôEconom√©trie of the Ecole Polytechnique in 1983. Concurrently he was Leading Professor of Applied Mathematics and Statistics and of Economics at Stony Brook University (1983-1990), where he founded and was the first Director of the Institute for Decision Sciences (that has since become the Center for Game Theory in Economics). Upon becoming director of the Laboratoire d‚ÄôEconom√©trie (1989 to 1999), he co-founded and co-directed the joint Ecole Polytechnique/Universit√© de Paris 1 masters program \\"Mod√©lisation et m√©thodes math√©matiques en √©conomie: optimisation et analyse strat√©giques,\\" and its successor the joint Ecole Polytechnique/Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris 6) masters program \\"Optimisation, jeux et mod√©lisation en √©conomie.\\" He was a visiting professor at other institutions, including the Ecole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (1972-1973), the Universit√© Scientifique et M√©dicale de Grenoble (1974-1975), the Universidad de Chile in Santiago (1994), and INSEAD in Fontainebleau (1997-1998).Michel Balinski receives the 2013 John von Neumann Theory Prize , √âcole Polytechnique, retrieved 2013-11-27. Balinski was the founding Editor- in-Chief of the journal Mathematical Programming in 1971, one of the founders of the Mathematical Optimization Society in 1970, and President of that society from 1986 to 1989.. Research contributions Balinski's Ph.D. thesis concerned the vertex enumeration problem, the algorithmic problem of listing all vertices of a convex polytope or finding all optimal solutions of a linear program, and some of his subsequent work continued to concern polyhedral combinatorics. The thesis includes the fundamental theorem, published in 1961, that the skeletons of polytopes in \\"n\\"-space viewed as graphs are \\"n\\"-connected, meaning that at least \\"n\\" edges must be removed to disconnect the graph of the remaining vertices and edges;. it is known as Balinski's theorem. He also proved the Hirsch conjecture for several different classes of polytopes associated with the transportation problem, showed that the diameter of the skeleton of the assignment polytope viewed as a graph is 2, and found the polytope whose vertices are the stable matchings of the university admissions problem. His contributions to linear and nonlinear optimization include a primal/dual simplex method that incorporates a natural proof of termination and leads to a self-contained, elementary but rigorous, constructive account of the theory and the basic computational tool of linear programming; the use and economic interpretation of dual prices; and a proof that prices in von Neumann's model of an expanding economy are marginal values. His work in integer programming includes the formulation and analysis of the fixed cost transportation problem; one of the first computationally successful practical uses of Gomory's cutting plane algorithm (1968, truck deliveries with cost functions in part concave, in part convex); and an extensive survey paper on integer programming which was awarded INFORM's Lanchester Prize in 1965. Together with Mourad Ba√Øou,http://fc.isima.fr/~baiou/pmwiki-2.2.61/pmwiki.php he developed a new formulation of stable matchings and generalizations in terms of graphs, providing a unified notation and tool leading to new proofs of known results and new results; notably, a characterization of the university admissions polytope, and a generalization of matching opposites (e.g., men and women, students and universities) to matching opposites in real numbers (e.g., time spent together). In 1970, he published one of the earliest papers on the closure problem and its applications to transportation planning..  Electoral systems  Balinski has made important contributions to the theory of electoral systems, namely, representation and apportionment on the one hand, and voting on the other.

Vestal, Fair Representation: Meeting the Ideal of One Man, One Vote --- http://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/fair-representation- meeting-the-ideal-of-one-man-one-vote with H. Peyton Young has had direct practical application in apportioning the seats of assemblies to regions in several countries (including the UK). He conceived and developed with others \\"biproportional apportionment\\" that has been adopted (as of 2014) in five of Switzerland's cantonal elections. His 2010 book with Rida Larakihttps://sites.google.com/site/ridalaraki/ proposes a new theory and method of voting called \\"majority judgment\\" where voters evaluate the merit of each candidate in a well-defined ordinal scale (instead of voting for one or several candidates, or rank-ordering them) and majorities determine society's evaluation of each candidate and thereby its rank-ordering of them all. This, they prove, overcomes the most important drawbacks of the traditional theory of voting (including Arrow's impossibility theorem).

Pulsation reactor technology is a thermal procedure with a special functional principle that results in reaction parameters and a reaction medium, and which ultimately leads to other property parameters in terms of surface, reactivity, homogeneity and particle size of the powder material. The technology has proven particularly effective in the manufacture of ceramic and submicroscale powders, as well as in the production of highly active catalysts. Also, simple oxides such as zirconium oxide with doping elements or mixed oxides like spinel can be produced in the pulsation reactor.  History  250px A British scientist called B. Higgins discovered the phenomenon of the pulsating flame in 1777. The phenomenon was described in specialist literature as the ‚Äúsinging flame‚Äù. However, no suitable application was found until 1930. Paul Schmidt was the first to employ the pulsating flame with the invention of the ARGUS-Schmidt pipe (Figure 1). Pulsating combustion was also used to generate hot gas for heating purposes and to fire boilers. The principle was tested in the eighties at the SKET Institute in Weimar to determine the suitability of pulsating combustion as a unit for performing thermal, material-modifying processes. The unit was already being referred to as a pulsation reactor by the Institute at that time. As well as the process of cement clinker firing, the manufacture of polishing agents from iron oxalate for the optical industry and the manufacture of surface-active catalyst substrates from gibbsite were also investigated. Pulsation reactor technology came to the fore from the nineties through its use in environmental technology, particularly in sludge drying and the regeneration of resin-bonded foundry sands. From 2000 the pulsation reactor was used to produce catalytic powders on an industrial scale. The principle of pulsating combustion was developed over the years by the company IBU-tec advanced materials AG (which emerged from the SKET Institute and still exists today), which finally tested and commissioned another test facility in 2008. Thanks to the continuous optimisation of the reactors, it was now possible to use an oxidising, inert or reducing hot gas atmosphere to treat materials as required. It also emerged that the improved plant was particularly suitable for manufacturing fine particles and catalytic powders. Today pulsation reactor technology has become established in chemical process engineering for manufacturing active particles with microstructural properties.  Structure and functionality  Fundamentally, a pulsation reactor can be described as a periodically transient tube-type reactor that can be used to thermally treat gas-borne matter. The pulsating flow of hot gas is generated within a hot gas generator in the reactor by burning natural gas or hydrogen with ambient air. The hot gas flows through the so-called ‚Äúresonance tube‚Äù into which reactants in powder, liquid or gas form can be added. The reactant is treated by hot gas flowing through the resonance tube and this process ends through suitable cooling. The finished product is separated in a cleanable filter. The product can be removed throughout the ongoing process using a sluice system and collected in barrels or big bags. The risk of the product contaminating the environment can be completely excluded through the vacuum present in the reactor, including the filter. 400px An almost tube-like flow with an almost constant temperature across the pipe diameter is generated in the resonance tube (the treatment area for the reactant) through the pulsating flow of hot gas. This tube-shaped flow results in a narrow residence time distribution. Furthermore, the pulsating hot gas flow results in an increased convective heat and mass transfer to and/or from the particles. Hot gas can be generated in two different ways. Either the hot gas generator works with a high level of excess air (Œª ‚â• 2) or the hot gas atmosphere can be generated with little oxygen or none at all. The hot gas temperatures in the pulsation reactor range from 250¬∞ - 1,350 ¬∞C (expansion to higher temperatures is in progress). However, the actual treatment temperature may differ significantly from these values after the reactant has been added. The necessary treatment temperature can be determined through systematic experiments with temperature variation. In addition to the treatment temperature and the type of hot gas atmosphere, pulsation reactors also provide the option of adjusting the frequency and amplitude of the pulsation (i.e. the spatially oscillating flow of hot gas) according to the material to be treated, without changing the geometry of the plant.  Specific process features  The pulsating flow of hot gas in the pulsation reactor enables very high heating rates and a significantly increased transfer of heat from the hot gas to the particle in the thermal process. This is beneficial for determining a specific particle size, surface condition and phase composition. The use of combustible reactants is not essential with the pulsation reactor. Both combustible and non-combustible reactants can be used in it. The even temperature distribution in the reactor well and the narrow residence time distribution prevents the formation of hard aggregates whilst allowing the homogenous treatment of material. The temperature range covered by the pulsation reactor is considerably higher than in spray dryers, for example, so that gentle drying is only possible to a certain extent but a combination of drying and calcination is feasible.

Dunlap in Sacramento, California. The business was popular in its time and building is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Dunlap built his home in 1906 as a small, 4-room, pink-colored bungalow in the Oak Park neighborhood of Sacramento. As his family grew, he would build additions to the home. Opening the home's dining room as a restaurant in 1930, the business continued until his retirement in 1968. During its run, the restaurant never offered a printed menu. Instead, patrons were able to choose from three entree options: fried chicken, baked ham, and T-bone steak. Despite its quaint approach, the establishment hosted such visitors as Frank Merriam, Earl Warren, and C.K. McClatchy. Renovations In 1997, George Dunlap's daughter, Audrey Dunlap Wilcox, donated the home, now featuring , to the Sacramento Children's Home with the request that it be used to help the families in Oak Park. In 2001, the home had a major renovation project costing $300,000 and turning the home into a family resource center for the county.

The series cast veteran Bollywood actresses Poonam Dhillon and Padmini Kolhapure along with Krystle D'Souza and Karan Sharma. The story, based on a Gujarati play titled Sharda takes on the issue of women's empowerment through education. The show went off air on 25 September 2014. The serial was dubbed in Tamil and aired as Puthu Puthu Arthangal (in English New-New Meanings) on Polimer TV. Plot summary Ek Nayi Pehchaan focuses on the relationship between a mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law in an affluent Indian household. The story begins with a well reputed family: Suresh Modi, the owner of Sharda Textiles, his wife Sharda (Poonam Dhillon), his sons Karan and Chirag and married daughter Latika. Karan's marriage is arranged with Sakshi who enters the Modi family as the daughter-in-law. Sakshi quickly realizes that even though Sharda is a perfect homemaker she lacks self-confidence as she is illiterate. Sharda's husband, Suresh, often finds opportunities to humiliate her as a result of this. Sakshi is deeply hurt on seeing this and decides to help Sharda become literate, independent and confident. She gets Sharda enrolled in an adult education programme. Initially, no one in the family supports Sharda but she is often motivated by Sakshi to carry on. Sharda eventually excels and goes on to start her own small business while still trying to earn her husband's love and respect. Later, it is revealed that Suresh has two other children, Shanaya and Arav born out of wedlock with another woman Pallavi (Padmini Kolhapure). As the truth emerges, Karan leaves the Modi mansion and family business followed by Sharda and Sakshi. Meanwhile, Sharda starts a new factory. Pallavi's daughter, Shanaya, decides to join the company to sabotage it. Pallavi is diagnosed with terminal bone cancer and reveals it to the family when Sharda insists she does so and promises her that she will take care of Pallavi's children as her own. Before she dies, Pallavi manages to make Suresh realise Sharda's value and he comes to finally respect her. On Pallavi's death, her will leaves equal share of her property to all five Modi children. While everyone accepts this, Shanaya is furious and accuses Sharda of having manipulated Pallavi. She goes on to try and create a rift between Sharda and her children but Sakshi and Sharda thwart her plans. In the end, all family members come to understand and accept one another and the show ends on a happy note with Sakshi announcing her pregnancy.

Galecto's team has developed a deep understanding of the galectin family of proteins and the LOXL2 enzyme, and how both influence multiple biological pathways of these complex, often devastating, diseases. Galecto‚Äôs goal is to develop a portfolio of drugs that target biochemical pathways common to the development of fibrosis with the intent of bringing therapeutic benefit to patients suffering from a broad range of fibrotic diseases. The company is developing small molecule fibrosis inhibitors focusing on two targets: galectin-3 and LOXL2. Galectin-3 has been implicated in diseases of the lung, liver, eye and cardiovascular system amongst many others, where it can promote the development of tissue scarring (fibrosis) and inflammation. In addition, galectin expression and activity has been associated with the development and progression of cancer, often with a poor prognosis. LOXL2, a key enzyme involved in the formation of the extracellular matrix during the fibrotic process, has been implicated in multiple fibrotic indications, including myelofibrosis and fibrotic diseases of the lung, liver and kidney.

Tiles have released several albums on Inside Out Music and toured internationally since the release of their first album in 1994.  History  Tiles formed in 1993 and released a self-titled album the following year. This album was an international success, gaining notice in Europe and Japan, and the group signed with Inside Out Music, releasing a second album, Fence the Clear, in 1997. Following the release of their third album, Presents of Mind, in 1999, the group toured Europe as the opening act for Dream Theater. Window Dressing, the band's fourth album, followed in 2004, and the 2008 release Fly Paper included guitar work by Rush's Alex Lifeson. The band's first live album, Off the Floor 01, was released in 2012. Off the Floor 02 was released June 3, 2014 in a limited edition format which includes a bonus disc from the band's 2005 appearance at the Rites of Spring Festival. Tiles' sixth studio album, Pretending 2 Run, was released on April 15, 2016 through Laser's Edge, featuring performances by Mike Portnoy and Ian Anderson, among others.  Tiles  Tiles released their first album in 1994, a self-titled 47 minute album under the Dream Circle label. It is the first and only album with guest bassist Kevin Chown.  Fence the Clear  In 1997 they released their second album Fence The Clear. The album marked the first album with current bassist Jeff Whittle. Like their first album, it sounded similar to very early 1990s Rush. Both albums are noted for being melodic and extensive in structure. Fence the Clear is a slight departure from their first album in terms of heaviness but remains with that hard edge and gap of musical interludes between songs. Both albums were re-released by Inside Out Music with a remastered sound and liner notes detailing each song and what they meant before and during recording.  Presents of Mind  In 1999, they released their third album Presents of Mind. The album gained them increased recognition and still shows excellent musicianship as first displayed on their debut CD. The album features a few instrumental pieces between songs, carrying on the theme from their previous album. During a tour through Europe (opening for Dream Theater), they released a live bootleg album the following year entitled Presence In Europe, featuring songs from their first three albums. Presents of Mind also began an ongoing collaboration with Hugh Syme producing their album cover art.  2004-2008  Tiles would not release another album until 2004, when they issued their fourth album Window Dressing. The album features their longest song ever recorded, clocking in at 17:11 minutes long while the album ran to one hour and 7 minutes long. Continuing with lengthy gaps between releases, they did not release their fifth album until 2008. Titled Fly Paper, this album has only 8 songs (plus one hidden bonus track), but still reaches 53 minutes long. Fly Paper features Alex Lifeson of Rush on one song.  Inactivity  Since their fifth album, Tiles has played just live shows without recording any new material. In 2012, they released their first proper live album, Off The Floor 01, which clocks in at over 77 minutes. A second installment titled Off the Floor 02 was released in 2014. It contains \\"live studio versions\\" of some of their earlier songs. These are full-band, one-take recordings rather than the typical multi-track studio cuts found on non-live albums. Also included on the follow-up are some tracks recorded live at 2005's Rites of Spring Festival.  2016 - present  2016 saw the release of the most ambitious Tiles project yet, Pretending 2 Run. This was both a concept and double album, and featured appearances by Mike Portnoy, Ian Anderson, Adam Holzman, Colin Edwin, Max Portnoy, Mike Stern, and others. In addition, the band continued its long association with Terry Brown and Hugh Syme. The band continues to perform live in 2017. On January 19, 2018, the band announced that while commemorating their 25th anniversary as a band, singer Paul Rarick would be retiring from the band after their tour in April.

It had also collaborated with Dubai- based Arabtec Construction. In 2008, Raheja Developers planned to build a Special Enterprise Zone (SEZ) in Gurgaon at an estimated cost of $660M US. The development was to be on a site, but the project did not advance. The Government of India announced denotification of the SEZ project on 29 January 2014. In 2020, Raheja Revanta, the tallest residential towers by Raheja Developers, was awarded the Luxury Project of the Year by CNN News 18 Real Estate Business Excellence Awards. The project is being built by Arabtec, the makers of Burj Khalifa, Dubai. Raheja Vanya, located in Gurugram, bagged the Green Project of the Year Award 2020.  Controversies  In 2010, a raid by Indian Income Tax authorities led to a recovery of tax evasion amounting to . In 2014 investigative portal Cobrapost conducted a sting operation against several real estate developers. It alleged that Raheja was one among the several developers willing to accept black money. Based on this, the Central Board of Direct Taxes ordered a probe into Raheja and 34 other developers. In 2014, the Prime Minister of India's Office ordered a probe relating to alleged irregularities in a Gurgaon housing project named Raheja Atharva. Subsequently, the State Level Expert Appraisal Committee investigated, and 0.8 acres of the Atharva project was sealed as it was illegally constructed without any Environmental Clearances. In October 2019, one of Raheja's projects were imposed with a heavy fine, for flouting pollution norms. In July 2019, Raheja Developers faced insolvency proceedings under the Section 7 of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, on a complaint filed by home buyers on alleged delay in delivery of flats. On enquiry, the NCLAT bench observed that the home buyers had filed the application with intent of refund of money. The NCLAT reserved its order in the case in September 2019, further removing the Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) in January 2020, thus allowing the board of directors to take back control of the company.

In addition to this, activists also argue that since the British government is not actively negotiating nuclear disarmament and is actively considering upgrading the UK Trident programme, it is in violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968.

Although her responsibility for the children's deaths had not been definitively established, the hanging was carried out and a pardon, granted by the state and entrusted to her brother, William, was not delivered in time to stop the execution. There was tremendous popular interest in her story, which quickly evolved into a tale of moral failing and divine redemption. Following his sister's death, William became a recluse, popularly known as The Pennsylvania Hermit. Title page artwork from the first edition of The Pennsylvania Hermit, ca. 1838. Note William approaching on horseback, calling, \\"A pardon.\\" In some sources, William and Elizabeth are referred to as Amos Wilson and Harriot Wilson. However, the historical record leaves no doubt that the Hermit and his sister were named William and Elizabeth. The origin of these \\"alternate\\" names has never been fully explained. Many key elements of the Wilsons' saga are documented in the records of the Chester County Courts and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. However, the story quickly became a part of local folklore and was embellished by generations of storytellers. It is possible to note which elements of the tale are a part of the historical record and which might be considered suspect. However, \\"the Wilson Story\\" might best be considered historical fiction, as the popular tale incorporates elements of both, and even scholarly discussions of the events are at odds regarding certain details. The following is a synthesis of numerous, often conflicting sources and is best regarded as historical fiction. Early life Very little background information has survived regarding the Wilson family. According to one account, William and Elizabeth's father was a farmer named John Wilson. John's first wife, and the children's mother, was also named Elizabeth.A Faithful Narrative of Elizabeth Wilson, Who Was Executed at Chester, January 3, 1786, Charged With the Murder of Her Twin Infants At least four nearly identical editions are extant: Philadelphia (1786), New Haven (1786); Hudson NY: Stoddard (1786); Philadelphia (1807). Sources are divided regarding Elizabeth's age. Some report that she was nineteen when she died (born ca. 1766), others that she was twenty-seven (born ca. 1758).The Pennsylvania Hermit: a Narrative of the Extraordinary Life of Amos Wilson (1839). Philadelphia: Smith & Carpenter.Butterfield, Roger P (5 March 1933). The Hangman Who Didn't Wait. Philadelphia: Public Ledger. There is no record of other siblings, and some accounts specify that Elizabeth was her parents' only daughter and William their only son. Elizabeth was said to have been born in East Marlborough Township, in central Chester County. (Prior to 1789, Chester County included all of present-day Delaware County, and Chester was the county seat. Chester then served as the seat of Delaware County until the seat was moved to Media in 1851.) The Wilson family lived in Chester County, most likely in East Bradford or West Bradford Township.O'Neill, Robert F (25 June 1995). Hummelstown Caves Conceal a Tragic Tale. Philadelphia: Philadelphia Inquirer.Grigson, Carol (1997). Personal correspondence.Indian Echo Caverns (undated). Guide orientation materials. Theirs was a farm family of modest means but solid reputation. During the American Revolution, they sided with the British, and much of their property was confiscated by American forces., Mrs. Wilson died while the children were still young. Their father later remarried, but his second wife did not care for her stepchildren. She encouraged their father to send them away as soon as they were of age.Execution of a Woman in the Olden Time (6 Jan 1854). Chester: Delaware County Republican 21(23). \\"The Victim of Seduction!\\" At sixteen, William was apprenticed to a stone carver in Lancaster County. Elizabeth's activities after leaving her father's house are less certain. Some accounts tell that she was sent to work at the Indian Queen Tavern in Philadelphia. Others suggest that she was a social butterfly who simply frequented the Indian Queen.Davis, J Allen (undated). clipping in Dr. Anna Broomal's Chester Notebook Vol 3, pp 57-60. Some portray her as a chaste and virtuous country girl, a devout Christian who made a terrible mistake.Ashmead, Henry Graham (1884). History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Philadelphia: Everts. (Marginalia found in copy at Pennsylvania State Library, Harrisburg PA)Futhey, J Smith & Gilbert Cope (1881). History of Chester County, Pennsylvania, with Genealogical and Biographical Sketches. Philadelphia: Everts. Others describe her as much more worldly, and one even reports another, earlier, out-of-wedlock pregnancy that ended in stillbirth. In early 1784 a George Magoleher was tried in Chester after being arrested \\"for fouling upon the body of Elizabeth Wilson,\\" although it is not certain that this Elizabeth was the Hermit's sister. (Court documents reveal that this Elizabeth's father was named Thomas Wilson.)Chester County Quarter Session Dockets (Feb 1784). The Faithful Narrative also includes a lurid jailhouse confession attributed to Elizabeth in which she admits to several out-of-wedlock pregnancies.Elizabeth Wilson (undated). Chester: Delaware County Republican. Elizabeth is invariably described as exceedingly beautiful and always surrounded by admirers, but as with other portions of her tale, there are several versions of how she met her seducer. In one, she was invited to a wedding in nearby Hock-Hossing (perhaps Hockessin in Delaware), where she met a friend of the groom. In several others, she met a man named \\"Smith,\\" either a native of Philadelphia or an officer from New Jersey. In still others, she met a man identified as either \\"Captain D_____\\" or Joseph DeshongDeshong Park is less than 300 meters from the site of Elizabeth's hanging. It is named for Alfred O. Deshong (1837‚Äì1913), a Chester industrialist and philanthropist. Deshong's ancestors lived in southeast Pennsylvania during the 1780s, but there is no evidence of a Joseph Deshong in his family or of any other connection to the Wilsons' story. Given the dubious and conflicting details in some accounts, it may be that the name was inserted to settle a grudge or simply to fill space. at the Indian Queen. Deshong was alternately an American officer or the Sheriff of Sussex County, New Jersey.Biddle, Charles (1883). Autobiography of Charles Biddle. Philadelphia: Claxton. Whatever his name or his origin, the cad manipulated Elizabeth with false promises of marriage and \\"succeeded in depriving her of all that could render her respectable in the eyes of the world.\\" He then disappeared, leaving Elizabeth pregnant. In one telling she learns that her former lover has taken up with a wealthy widow in another city, in another that he was already married to another woman. Elizabeth remained at the Indian Queen, and as her pregnancy became obvious, she became the focus of scorn and gossip. Eventually, her presence became too great an embarrassment, and she was made to leave. She hitched a ride on a farm wagon and headed back to her father's house. (It is also said that she made the journey on foot, taking a week to reach her destination.) In one version her children were born in a stranger's house along the way, but certainly the more dramatic account has her arriving at her father's home still in the throes of labor. When she first appeared there, she was so careworn, and exhausted by pregnancy and the process of childbirth, that her parents did not immediately recognize her. During the night, Elizabeth gave birth to twin sons.Teeters, Negley (1967). \\"...Hang By the Neck...\\". Springfield, IL: Charles Thomas.Martin, John Hill (1877).

Journal of the Lancaster County Historical Society 64(2). Murder As soon as she was well enough to travel, Elizabeth returned to Philadelphia in search of her babies' father, whom she found at the Indian Queen. He feigned happiness at seeing her and again promised that they would be married. Elizabeth returned home and several days later headed out to meet her imagined groom. She set out on the road to Newtown Square (most likely the present-day West Chester Pike). She rode part of the way with a neighbor, who left her sitting on a rock, nursing her babies. (The day is often described as a Sunday, with her parents leaving to attend church, but those sources that mention a specific date give 12 October 1784, a Thursday.) It was anywhere from ten days to ten weeks following the children's birth. Elizabeth was not seen again for as much as a week, and when she reappeared she was disheveled and incoherent and her children were nowhere to be seen. In the coming days or weeks a gruesome discovery was made: a hunter found the bodies of Elizabeth's twins hidden in the woods. The babies were immediately identified, and Elizabeth was quickly arrested. Several newspapers reported that Elizabeth's arrest took place in late December, 1784, roughly two and a half months after her children's deaths. Other accounts suggest that the chain of events (murder, discovery, and arrest) took place over a much shorter period. Several locations are given for the crime scene: along Street Road (S.R. 926), approximately west of Newtown Square; along Edgemont Road above Street Road; near the road from Brandywine to West Chester (perhaps today's Horseshoe Pike); and, most specifically, south of Goshen Street Road in East Bradford Township, on the west side of a small rivulet. An article in the 25 January 1785 Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Mercury and General Advertiser reported under a 5 January dateline that a woman had been arrested 'about a week ago', and that 'she denies' the murder 'but acknowledged having placed the children by the road-side, in order that any person passing that way, in order that any person passing that way, and who had humanity enough, might take them up.'The New Hampshire Mercury and General Advertiser. January 25, 2005, p. 2. Trial Elizabeth Wilson was charged with the \\"murder of her Two illegitimate Male Children\\" and imprisoned in the city of Chester's 4th Street jail. Her trial began in June, 1785 and was held in the court house in Chester. Built in 1724, the Chester courthouse is still standing and is the oldest public building still in continuous use in the United States.http://www.co.delaware.pa.us/courts/webhistoryofcourt.pdfhttp://www.oldchesterpa.com/1724_Courthouse.htm The judge was William Augustus Atlee. Atlee was a Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and at that time Supreme Court justices also served on the county-level Courts of oyer and terminer, making a regular circuit of the counties to hear trials for high crimes and appeals. It was in this latter capacity that Atlee presided over Elizabeth Wilson's trial. When asked to enter a plea, Elizabeth did not respond; Judge Atlee entered a plea of \\"not guilty\\" on her behalf. In fact, at no time during the trial did Elizabeth speak in her own defense. Her counsel was unsure how to proceed, given his client's silence. He requested that the trial be postponed until the fall session, and the judge agreed. Elizabeth Wilson's trial resumed in October 1785. Attorney General Bradford's case was built primarily on circumstantial evidence, but Elizabeth did not refute any of the charges against her. The jury deliberated several hours before returning their verdict.The Victim of Seduction! Some Interesting Particulars of the Life and Untimely Fate of Miss Harriot Wilson. (1802?) Boston: J. Wilkey. Many jurors felt sympathetic toward Elizabeth, but they were charged to decide the case based on the evidence presented. Their decision was \\"guilty of murder in the first degree.\\" Atlee had also become sympathetic, but he, too, was bound to act according to the evidence presented in court. He had little choice but to sentence Elizabeth to death by hanging. The date for the execution was set for 7 December 1785. Confession and pardon After the judge passed sentence, Elizabeth's parents abandoned her. Throughout the trial and the preceding events, William Wilson had remained at work in Lancaster, unaware of his sister's predicament. But when Elizabeth was condemned to death, William mysteriously announced that he was needed in Chester and would have to leave his job. He arrived at the jail on 3 December 1785. After recovering from the shock of seeing her brother so unexpectedly Elizabeth was finally willing to relate the details surrounding her children's murder. William hastily assembled a group of respected officials, including Judge Atlee, to witness Elizabeth's confession. Elizabeth explained that her seducer had agreed to meet her in Newtown Square. However, he unexpectedly met her in a wood about west of the town. He asked to see the babies, claiming that he wanted to see whether they resembled him. He ordered Elizabeth to kill the children and when she refused he trampled them to death. He then held a pistol to Elizabeth's chest and made her swear that she would never reveal what he had done. The confession was signed by the witnesses. William presented it to the Supreme Executive Council on 6 Dec 1785. The President of the Council was Benjamin Franklin, and its Vice President was Charles Biddle (1745‚Äì1821). Biddle's journal includes a brief discussion of the Wilson case and, in addition to court and Council records, is one of the more reputable sources regarding the matter. The Council had previously discussed Elizabeth's sentence on 1 November 1785 and now acted quickly to order that the execution be postponed until 3 January 1786 to allow them more time in which to discuss the case.Minutes of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania (1853). Harrisburg: Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In the meantime, William went in search of his sister's erstwhile lover, but when he found him on a New Jersey farm he denied ever having known Elizabeth. William then began to seek out witnesses who could link the man with Philadelphia and his sister. He was successful in compiling a list of several people, but he became ill around Christmas and spent some time recuperating at a friend's home in Philadelphia. Upon his next visit to the Chester jail, he was horrified to learn that Elizabeth's execution was scheduled for the following day. During his illness he had lost track of time and believed that it was 1 January, rather than 2 January. William rode to Franklin's home to request another postponement of Elizabeth's sentence but had to wait several hours to see him. Franklin felt that it was improper for him to act and referred William to Vice President Biddle. William found Biddle at the State House. Biddle wrote the order, \\"Do not execute Wilson until you hear further from Council,\\" knowing that the members of the Executive Council were sympathetic towards Elizabeth and intended to grant a full respite. With Biddle's pardon in hand, William began the ride to Chester. He approached the Middle Ferry across the Schuylkill River. Heavy rain had made the river dangerously high and choked it with ice and debris; the ferry was not in operation. In desperation, he drove his horse into the icy water. The animal struggled against the current but drowned just from the opposite shore. William swam the rest of the way, and by the time he reached dry land he was approximately downstream from where he'd entered the water. William found another horse and continued to Chester. Execution Meanwhile, officials in Chester reluctantly began preparations for Elizabeth's execution. Elizabeth spent the morning with several clergymen and received holy communion. At ten-thirty she was moved from the jail to Hangman's Lot. (The present-day site is a triangular lot at the intersection of Edgmont and Providence Avenues. A B&O; Railroad station stood there for many years, and it has more recently been the site of a Howard Johnson's motel.) A wild cherry tree grew there, with a strong branch that grew out horizontally from the trunk and to which ropes were tied. Several old illustrations of Elizabeth Wilson's hanging show a scaffold and gallows, but at that time such structures were not in widespread use. Rather, the condemned were \\"swung off.\\" They were placed atop a ladder or cart (the latter being the case in Chester); one end of the rope was tied most likely to a convenient tree branch and the other, of course, placed around the victim's neck; the condemned was then pushed from his perch, or the support was quickly pulled from beneath him. Executions in this manner were often protracted, gruesome affairs, resulting in a slow death by asphyxiation rather than a quickly-broken neck, and hanging was considered (as it has been throughout history) one of the most shameful methods of capital punishment.Laurence, John (1960). The History of Capital Punishment. Seacaucus NJ: Citadel.Barck, Oscar Theodore & Hugh Talmage Lefler (1968). Colonial America. New York: Macmillan. While the execution of women has always been relatively uncommon, there were many instances in this period of women who were hanged for the murders of their \\"bastard children.\\" The sheriff of Chester (given as either Ezekiel Leonard or William Gibbons ) was one of many who had come to believe that Elizabeth was innocent and who, following her confession, suspected that she might be pardoned. He stationed flagmen at intervals along the Queens Highway (4th Street), leading from Philadelphia, who could signal if William were coming with a pardon. Those assembled watched expectantly for a signal but none was seen. Noon arrived, and by law the sheriff could wait no longer. The order was given and the cart was pulled from beneath Elizabeth Wilson's feet. She did not die outright but showed little sign of struggle. Several long moments passed before the crowd noticed white flags waving along the road from Philadelphia. William rode to Hangman's Lot calling, \\"A pardon! A pardon!\\" His horse reared at the sight of Elizabeth's body, throwing him to the muddy ground beneath his sister. The sheriff quickly cut the rope and tried frantically to revive Elizabeth, but it was too late to save her. Varying accounts state that William arrived anywhere from mere moments to twenty-three minutes too late to deliver Biddle's pardon and save his sister's life. (The unreliability of this form of hanging may account for the need to have left Elizabeth hanging for twenty-three minutes ‚Äîto ensure that she was, in fact, dead.) anachronistic dress of the individuals portrayed. Biddle later wrote, \\"For my own part, I firmly believed her innocent....The next day when Council met, and we heard of the execution, it gave uneasiness to many of the members, all of whom were against her being executed.\\" Elizabeth Wilson in popular culture Contemporary accounts As previously noted, the story of the children's murder and Elizabeth's arrest was reported at least as far away as New Hampshire. Only two days after Elizabeth's execution, a printer in Philadelphia published the first version of The Faithful Narrative of Elizabeth Wilson. By the end of the year, at least three (and as many as six) other editions were published in the northeast U.S. At least four editions of The Faithful Narrative are extant and several other editions are alluded to in secondary sources. The four known editions are practically identical, the only discrepancy being that one describes the children's murder as being eight days after their births, while the others report eight weeks. There is a liberal mixture of historical fact and melodrama, the latter in the form of extended monologues attributed to Elizabeth, as well as the texts of several letters supposedly written in her cell and \\"discovered\\" after her death.Williams, Daniel E (1993). Victims of Narrative Seductions: the Literary Translations of Elizabeth (and \\"Miss Harriot\\") Wilson. In Early American Literature (XXVIII), pp 148-170. In addition to the various Narratives, a Boston printer, Ezekiel Russell, published ‚Ä¶Elegy &c.;, a poetic telling of Elizabeth's story; it survives only as a fragment. This was essentially an advertisement for another Russell publication, a crime magazine titled The American Bloody Register, the fourth issue of which dealt with the Wilson case; no copies of the Register are known to have survived.‚Ä¶g Elegy, &c.; (1786) Boston: Ezekiel Russell. Another Boston printer published The Victim of Seduction!, marking perhaps the first use of the name Harriot in place of Elizabeth. (While the date of Victim is unknown it appears to predate The Pennsylvania Hermit, another early source of the names Amos and Harriot.) New editions of The Faithful Narrative continued to appear, the latest in 1807. From a publishing standpoint, the interest in Elizabeth's case was unprecedented in the new nation, and the sentimental features of many of the accounts were calculated to appeal to female readers, whose numbers increased dramatically following the Revolution.Biddle, Henry D (ed.) (1889). Extracts from the Journal of Elizabeth Drinker. Philadelphia: Lippincott. (Entry for 16 May 1797) After Elizabeth's death, her brother William withdrew from society. After wandering for several years he took up residence in a cave near Hummelstown, Pennsylvania. He died there in 1821. In the late 1830s, The Pennsylvania Hermit: A Narrative of the Extraordinary Life of Amos Wilson was published. It is a twenty-four page pamphlet in two parts. The first, titled The Life of Amos Wilson, &c.;, is a brief telling of the Wilsons' story. The writer describes himself as William's friend and claims to have visited him the night before he died. As such, the book is often assumed to be authoritative, yet it contains numerous and often glaring errors. It is also another early source of the 'alternate' names, Amos and Harriot. Myth and morality The tragic, lurid tale of William and Elizabeth Wilson quickly became familiar throughout the Philadelphia area and was told and retold in local papers throughout the 19th and 20th Centuries. Some themes, such as the broken marriage promise, are nearly universal, while many others exist in a single source and are at odds with all other versions of the tale, and with the historical record. In addition to the discrepancies noted above, The Pennsylvania Hermit tells that Elizabeth gave birth to a single child whom she killed immediately after birth. In this version, her jailhouse confession was simply an acknowledgement of guilt and of her sinful nature. One story in a Chester newspaper made repeated reference to a small blue stool on which William, as a boy, had carved the initials \\"E & W.\\" Predating Charles Foster Kane's Rosebud by a century, the stool served as a reminder of a more innocent time as Elizabeth awaited execution. Another version claims that after William arrived at Benjamin Franklin's home, Franklin immediately convened a special late-night session of the Executive Council and all necessary work related to the pardon was completed within minutes; this is dramatically at odds with the details provided by the vice president of that Council. As mentioned previously, the Wilsons' story was sometimes used to teach lessons in traditional morality. The Life of Amos Wilson contains the passage, \\"You see by the foregoing pages the gradation of evils dependent on a departure from...dignified modesty.\\" Readers are admonished to \\"(t)urn your attention to those houses of debauchery where Vice reigns triumphant, and on whom poor mourning Virtue sheds a tear of pity.\\" Several sources also include dramatic, extended quotes attributed to William and Elizabeth. Again, these passages sometimes seem to have more to do with moral instruction than with relating the factual story of William and Elizabeth Wilson, and as many exist only in a single source their authenticity must be viewed skeptically. Ghost stories The Wilsons' story inevitably inspired several ghost stories. For many years local folks claimed to see and hear a spectral horseman galloping across Chester and Delaware Counties and up to the old jail. This story became well known after William became a recluse ‚Äîbut long before he actually died.Ashmead, Henry Graham & William Shaler Johnson (1883). Historical Sketch of Chester on Delaware. Chester PA: Republican Steam Printing. When trees were cleared to make a parking lot for Indian Echo Caverns (the name given to William's hermitage on its development as a tourist attraction), it was said that the newly opened space revealed Elizabeth Wilson's wandering spirit. This ghost story is unusual in that, while living, Elizabeth never set foot anywhere near the area she was alleged to haunt. More poignant are tales from East Bradford Township of a female spirit walking through the woods where (according to some sources) the bodies of Elizabeth's children were discovered, looking for something lost beneath the leaves. While early storytelling focused on Elizabeth's saga and the moral implications of her actions, the current focus seems to be on the sensational aspects of William's ride and Elizabeth's execution and on the strange circumstances of William's life in the cave. As such, the story is sometimes resurrected by local media in connection with Halloween observances or as part of \\"strange but true\\" features.

The 4.6 km long double-track and electrified section from Witten Hauptbahnhof to Wengern Ost is now used for the transport of freight. The 17 km long and single-track section from Witten-H√∂he to Schwelm was intended to be a part of a relief route from the Ruhr to Cologne. It was envisaged that the line to Schwelm would have been extended to the south via Lennep (near Remscheid) to Cologne, but this was not completed due to the outbreak of the First World War.  History  Work on the line began in 1911 and although ultimately only part of the original plan was completed, this was delayed until 1934. Thus Deutsche Reichsbahn opened the first section from the Witten Hauptbahnhof via Witten-H√∂he to Wengern Ost on 4 October 1926 with connections to the Ruhr Valley Railway from Hattingen to Hagen. It was then used exclusively for freight for about ten years, relieving the Elberfeld‚ÄìDortmund railway. The economic decline during and after the war was the reason for the drawn-out construction of the main part of the line, with most works carried out before 1914. The necessary work to complete the line was implemented in the early 1930s as a job creation measure. The cost of building the line eventually amounted to 50 million Reichsmarks. In the period from 1934 to 1939, a total of 23 passenger trains, including five express trains, operated on the line daily. In addition, there was a considerable amount of freight. During the Second World War, the Silschede Tunnel and the Klosterholz Tunnel were used under the code names of Buchfink and Goldammer as underground factories under the U-Verlagerung Program for the production of weapons, using forced labour. The operation of the railway was resumed after 1945, but traffic decreased steadily in the postwar period. As a result of this decrease, passenger services were closed on the middle section from Witten-H√∂he via Wengern West and Albringhausen to Gevelsberg West on 30 November 1979. All traffic on this section ended on 14 January 1980 and the line was formally closed on 1 January 1983.  Route  The line included some elaborate viaducts and railway tunnels, which included the Ruhr viaduct near Witten. More viaducts could be found in Wengern over the Elbsche and in Gevelsberg. There were two 900 m-long tunnels located at Silschede and north of Schwelm. The line was well constructed from a technical perspective with: *double track *low gradients *large curve radii *large tunnel cross sections *no level crossings. It was planned to what were considered European standards. Nevertheless, only part of the planned route was built.  Current situation  The northern part of the route is now again used only for freight, while the southern portion through the 945 m long Linderhausen Tunnel from Gevelsberg to Schwelm is used by S-Bahn line S 8 of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (Rhine-Ruhr Transport Association) to link the D√ºsseldorf- Derendorf‚ÄìDortmund S√ºd railway and the Elberfeld‚ÄìDortmund railway.  Planning  It is planned to build a cycle path on the disused part of the line. The route runs through a scenic area with two viaducts and two tunnels, including the 845 m-long Silschede Tunnel, which would be extraordinary long for a tunnel on a cycle path. Because of these structures, however, the financing of the project is not yet clear, since, for example the lighting of the tunnel would cause substantial costs. Part of the route has already been upgraded for a section of the ‚ÄúFrom Ruhr to Ruhr‚Äù cycleway (Von-Ruhr-zur-Ruhr-Radweg).  Henriette Davidis  During the construction of the line, the house in which Henriette Davidis worked for a long time had to be demolished. The plate of the stove on which many of her recipes were developed was installed in the wall of a small bridge. The bridge can be found on Henriette-Davidis-Weg in Wengern.

Part of the Venntro Media Group, Ross Williams, a UK businessman, started the company in 2003 and it has since grown to have three additional offices located in London, New York, and Melbourne. Global Personals employs more than 150 people around the world and possesses a combined portfolio of more than 12,000 dating websites. History Ross Williams founded Global Personals in 2003, teaming up with partner Steve Pammenter. The two funded the project using credit cards, and focused on buying appropriate keywords on Google AdWords for a dating website. They simultaneously worked on building a large database of members in order to launch a private label platform to be used by affiliates and partners in building their own individualised dating websites. The company started out with just one dating site, Singles365.com, which utilised the platform they developed called WhiteLabelDating. This platform was the first iteration of the company‚Äôs current turnkey dating software. Williams‚Äô work on Global Personals was noticed in the running for Young Entrepreneur of the Year in 2006 for the CBI Growing Business Awards. Accusation of fraudulent practice In November 2012, Channel 4 News revealed that the company had created a team of employees whose job was to create fake accounts for its network of websites, in order to send large amounts of flirtatious messages to genuine users. Former employees revealed that their job, the details of which they were not permitted to discuss with anybody outside the organisation, was to search the profiles of genuine members from around the world, select the most attractive photographs, and create artificial profiles, known as \\"pseudos\\". Each employee was responsible for managing up to 15 different pseudos. The purpose of this practice was twofold. Firstly, it was intended to coerce genuine members who had registered for free into paying a membership fee, in order that they could respond to the messages which they had received. Secondly, it was to dissuade paying members from cancelling their monthly subscriptions: the pretence would sometimes continue for months, until the victim put too much pressure on the employee for a real-life meeting, at which point the pseudo would use one of several previously-prepared strategies for discontinuing the interaction. In some cases the employee would then target the same member, using a different pseudo. It was claimed by one of the former employees that this practice increased the company's revenue by 50 per cent. Windsor Trading Standards confirmed that it took claims of fake profiles very seriously and had had \\"ongoing dealings\\" with Global Personals regarding this practice. Global Personals claimed to have stopped using fake profiles in 2008: the former employees interviewed by Channel 4 News claimed the pseudo team was wound up in 2010. Global Personals today In 2013, Global Personals earned the distinction of being the 13th company in the Sunday Times HSBC International Track 200. The list consists of mid-market companies across Britain and ranks them according to which ones have the most aggressively growing international sales. Global Personals‚Äô revenue is close to hitting ¬£50 million for the year. In addition, Global Personals continues to invest in growth initiatives, including offering affiliates of the FriendFinder platform a chance at a 100 per cent revenue share for the next 6 months if they transition over to WhiteLabelDating.com. The company also recently acquired Smooch.com, one of the leading free/‚Äùfreemium‚Äù dating brands in the UK. The company was moved under the umbrella of Venntro Media Group Ltd in 2016. Owned and Operated Web Sites Global Personals owns and operates a number of their own dating site brands. They include Dating Republic, Dating Agency, Love2Meet, Singles 365 and Adult Play among others. Web Sites Operated on behalf of Partners In addition to operating their own dating sites, Global Personals also operate over 1,700 sites on behalf of partners according to their website who use a shared set of databases belonging to global personals covering multiple niches including adult, straight, affair and LGBT. Global personals split the revenue of these sites with their partners. In April 2018, Global Personals set about closing thousands of partner websites, with very little notice to the partners, resulting in them moving members to their own dating websites and withholding past and future revenue to hundreds of partners.

Kim's next work after that was The Tower, a disaster film about a fire in a high-rise apartment building, starring Sol Kyung-gu, Kim Sang-kyung and Son Ye-jin. In response to the criticisms of Sector 7, Kim spent nearly two years working with the post- production team on CGI; the film was finally released in December 2012. Kim stated that he got the idea for The Tower from a variety of boyhood experiences, including his first visit to Seoul where he saw the 63 Building and wondered what it would be like to get trapped inside, and a later incident where he got stuck in an elevator, which he described as \\"the moment when I first felt dread\\".

She is most recognized for her abstract wooden and stone- carved sculptures that explore the relationship between art and nature, and works on paper that developed alongside her sculptural practice. Lim's attention to the minute details of curve, line and surface made her an exponent of minimalism. Early life Kim Lim was born in Singapore and spent much of her early childhood in Penang and Malacca.At the age of 18, having finished her schooling in Singapore, Lim moved to London to enrol at Saint Martin's School of Art (1954‚Äì1956). There, she took a particular interest in wood-carving; she then transferred to the Slade School of Art, where she concentrated on printmaking, graduating in 1960. Career and Works  In the 1960s and 1970s her sculptures were mainly carved from wood, using forms inspired by basic rhythmic forms and structures, with each element forming a balanced whole. Candy (1975) is one of the sculptures that exemplifies these characteristics, showing the artist's interest in balance, colour, form and her concept of 'less elaboration and more strength'. Her prints from this time also explore these modulations, as in the etchings Set of Eight (1975), which consist of simple patterns of blocks and lines. After her twenty-year retrospective towards the end of the 70s, Lim began transitioning to working in stone and marble, which were included in the exhibition alongside her wood forms: ‚Äòit made me very aware of the pull within myself between the ordered, static experience and the dynamic rhythms of organic, structured forms,‚Äô she concluded. ‚ÄòHow to incorporate and synthesize these two seemingly opposed elements within one work became ‚Ä¶ the starting point for the ‚Ä¶ stone sculptures.‚Äô At the First Hayward Annual in 1977 Kim Lim was both the only woman and the only non-white artist represented, her work appearing alongside that of notable male contemporaries such as Frank Auerbach and Kenneth Martin. There was growing recognition of systemic sexist bias within the art world at this time. For the Second Hayward Annual, in an attempt to redress this balance and make a public statement about gendered selection-bias, an all- female selection committee was formed comprising Kim Lim, Tess Jaray, Liliane Lijn, Rita Donagh and Gillian Wise Ciobaratu. During the 1980s, Kim Lim turned to stone-carving, and continued to make prints and fill sketchbooks with drawings from nature. In Sea-Stone (1989; London, Tate), the marble has been carved with incised lines and textures so that the stone both seems to be worn by the sea. In the 1990s she became more concerned with imbuing the stone with a lightness and softness, as in Syncopation No. 2 (1995), where a large piece of slate has been slashed with regular cuts, so that it appears almost as a drawing rather than a solid form. During her career she travelled to China, Indonesia, Cambodia, Egypt, Malaysia and Turkey with her husband, artist William Turnbull.An Interview with Alex Turnbull on Kim Lim https://www.artandonly.com/an-interview-with-alex-turnbull-on-kim-lim/ While Kim Lim was well-known and respected among artists and collectors during her lifetime, her work has been slow to be recognized internationally. Contrary to the popular assumption that Turnbull influenced her, close friends and family‚Äîsuch as their son Alex Turnbull and artist Tessa Jaray‚Äîhave suggested that the exchange for creativity was mutual.

The film tells the story of police officer, Marc Borgmann (Koffler), who lives with his pregnant girlfriend, Bettina Bischoff (Sch√ºttler). Whilst on a training course, Borgmann meets fellow police officer, Kay Engel (Riemelt), and a romance develops between the two men. Borgmann is torn between his love for Bettina and his new found feelings for another man. When Engel disappears for a while, Borgmann realises his life is rapidly going into \\"free fall\\", as he cannot meet the high expectations of the people he knows. Filming began in Ludwigsburg, Germany, in the summer of 2012. Freier Fall has been compared to Brokeback Mountain and received good reviews following its premi√®re at the Berlin Film Festival on 8 February 2013, and at the Frameline Film Festival in the United States on 21 June 2013. The original motion picture soundtrack written by music duo D√ºrbeck & Dohmen was released digitally online by MovieScore Media to coincide with the film's opening release on 23 May 2013. It made a box office gross of $599,721. A sequel, Free Fall 2 (German: Freier Fall 2), is about to be produced , provided the related crowdsourcing project is funded. Plot Marc Borgmann (Koffler), a young police officer, is on a training course for the riot control unit. He is struggling at the police academy, being somewhat behind his peers in his physical training. Cocky and self-assured, Marc does not initially get along with his roommate at the academy, Kay Engel (Riemelt). They have a physical confrontation during a training exercise, but afterwards Marc apologizes for his aggressive behavior and they become friends. The two begin jogging together regularly, and during one jog, Kay kisses Marc as they share a marijuana cigarette. Marc, taken aback, is reassured by Kay that it's just a joke. Marc is reluctant to jog again due to his own apparent conflicted attraction to Kay, but on Kay's insistence he goes on a run alone; Kay catches up to him, and, despite Marc's initial resistances, the two kiss and Kay gives him a handjob. Marc initially accepts the advances, but then runs away in confusion. Kay is later transferred into Marc's police unit to fill a vacancy, where Marc finds it difficult to ignore him. Eventually Kay shows up with a colleague to a bowling alley where Marc and his family are having a game and is introduced to Bettina, Marc's pregnant longtime girlfriend. Marc attempts to stay committed to Bettina and forget about Kay, but he is unable to ignore his feelings and goes back to the jogging trail, where Kay is waiting. The two have sex in the rain. The encounter makes Marc late for a maternity exercise with Bettina, who grows suspicious of Marc's activities. Meanwhile, Marc continues to have intimate encounters with Kay, spending nights with him under the guise of having night shifts, and Kay gives him a key to his apartment. Marc finds himself less able to sexually perform with Bettina, which he explains is only due to her pregnancy. Marc and Kay later go to a gay bar, where Marc takes ecstasy. The next morning, Bettina rebuffs his advances and asks him if he's seeing another woman, to which Marc responds that he's not. Bettina goes through Marc's phone while Marc is shaving and finds nothing suspicious other than recent calls from Kay. Eventually Bettina gives birth to their son, and Marc tries to cut Kay out his life; however, Kay attempts to contact Marc, leading to a physical altercation with Marc demanding to be left alone. Marc finds his unit being lectured on acceptance, and that discrimination will not be tolerated; he finds out that Kay was discovered at a gay bar that the unit raided. He then shows up at Kay's apartment and tells him that he didn't ask for Kay to come in and screw up his life. His conflicted jealousy causes him to accuse Kay of going to the bar to find other men to sleep with. Kay calls Marc selfish, only thinking of himself and never of his lover, but says he loves him and that he isn't sleeping with anyone else. Marc tries to leave but breaks down in Kay's arms and the two share an intimate kiss. Later, Kay attacks his fellow officer Limpinski, following a homophobic incident. Marc gets hit in an attempt to separate the two. Kay visits Marc in the hospital, and though Marc tells him to leave before his mother arrives, the two end up sharing a passionate kiss that Marc's mother ends up witnessing. After catching up to her, they have an argument and Marc leaves alone. Later, Kay arrives at a party after Bettina's invite, where Marc's parents tell him to stay away from Marc due to his new family. Marc, overhearing the conversation, tells him to leave. Marc visits Kay at his apartment to find Kay's face bruised following an altercation with Limpinski. Marc advises him to transfer to another unit to protect himself, and Kay asks about the future of their relationship. Marc returns the key to his apartment and departs. He returns home to find Bettina packing to leave with their son; she has learned that he has been lying about working night shifts and wants him gone by the time she has returned, questioning Marc's friendship with Kay. Marc does not admit to his romantic relationship with Kay. Marc tries to see her at Frank's house, and admits to her his affair with Kay. She eventually returns to the house with their son, but there is emotional distance between them. Marc tries to visit Kay at his apartment to find it empty; Kay has moved, also departing from the unit without notice. When Limpinski tries to goad Marc about his relationship with Kay, taunts him, leading Limpinski to assault him. Frank witnesses this and implies that Limpinski will be let go for this. Marc, unhappy, visits the gay bar alone, and though he seeks a sexual encounter with another man, he ends up rebuffing him. Back at the house, Marc and Bettina admit to each other that they can't see their relationship going on as before. The film concludes with Marc at the academy, on a jog with his peers as in the first scene of the film; he outpaces them and runs ahead, alone.

It became the first bird refuge in Pretoria when it was opened by the then mayor of Pretoria, Mr. W. J. Seymore, on 27 October 1956. It was officially proclaimed as a nature reserve on 26 February 1958, and it was fenced in June 1970. The sanctuary is named after South Africa's well-known ornithologist and mammalogist, J. Austin Roberts. He was born in Pretoria in 1883, but grew up in Potchefstroom as a minister's son, where the local amateur ornithologist, Thomas Ayres, was his mentor. Access Free access is limited to the bird hide, which is reached from the northern perimeter, where a small exhibition facility is located. It has been declared a provincial heritage site due to its recreational and educational value. Habitat A former clay quarry at the confluence of Walker and Argo Spruit was allowed to fill with water, and some exotic trees were planted along its verges. In addition nine small perennial dams or wetland basins have been created, some with artificial islands, to accommodate aquatic birds and animals. The natural veld type of the sanctuary is mixed bushveld. Bird species Upwards of 170 native bird species have been recorded, but the presence or breeding of some have been transient, due to urbanization and other factors. Resident or visiting passerine birds include thick-billed weaver, southern red bishop, African reed-warbler, little rush-warbler and lesser swamp-warbler. Various heron species visit the reserve, including black-crowned night-heron, little bittern, green-backed heron, purple heron, black and little egret. Other regular water birds are red-knobbed coot, fulvous duck, Egyptian goose, white-faced duck, Cape teal and southern pochard. Pinioned crowned cranes and blue cranes have been released into the reserve, and some exotic duck species are present.

He was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1881 to 1902, representing the electorates of Stanley (1881-1884) and Gladstone (1884-1902). He was Commissioner for Public Works under John Cox Bray from 1881 to 1884 and again under Thomas Playford II from 1887 to 1889. Catt was born in Newington, Kent, England, third child of Charles Catt, a carpenter, and his wife Sarah, n√©e Knott. Catt arrived in South Australia in 1847, and for ten years engaged in agricultural pursuits at Balhannah and Strathalbyn. After a short trial of the Victorian diggings he returned to Strathalbyn, and entered into business. Subsequently he opened a store at the then youthful town of Gladstone, South Australia. Catt was elected to the Assembly for the district of Stanley, 27 April 1881. Three years later, when the constituency was reconstructed, he was returned for Gladstone. Catt accepted the post of Commissioner of Crown Lands in John Bray's first administration, on 24 June 1881, and held it till 23 April 1884, under circumstances of special difficulty. Disasters had fallen thickly upon the farmers of the colony, especially in the northern districts lying beyond Goyder's Line of rainfall, where thirsty and often heavily timbered country had been taken up at extravagant prices by the competing agriculturists, who in some cases had offered as much as ¬£6 6s. per acre. The attempt to grow wheat in these parts proved that the selectors could not pay the stipulated price, and the Government of the day came to the rescue with a proposal that the farmers should be allowed to surrender their land and compete for it again. The result was that they got their land back at about ¬£1 0s. 6d., thus entailing upon the State a nominal loss of about half a million. The surrender clauses were admittedly difficult to administer, and Mr. Catt was much blamed at the time for allowing farmers holding excellent land in the lower north and south-east to come under these clauses. Catt, however, claimed that these were exceptional cases. On the fall of the John Downer Ministry in 1887, Catt accepted the portfolio of Commissioner of Public Works under Thomas Playford II, and held it from 11 June 1887, to 27 June 1889. At the commencement of the session of 1890 Catt was unanimously elected to the Chairmanship of Committees of the Legislative Assembly. In 1887 he received the royal permission to bear the title of \\"Honourable\\" within the colony. Catt died in St Peters, Adelaide, South Australia, on 28 October 1919.

Examples include a human and their dog, a couple and their cats, a dog and a cat, or even a mule and a sheep. The emphasis is on love and that the members of the group care for and treat each other like a family. For instance, \\"interspecies family\\" may describe a group composed of a dog and a person who refers to their dog as their child, best friend, or other phrase that connotes a stronger bond than just a \\"pet\\", a term which implies a sense of property and ownership. Most often this is used to discuss non-human interspecies families, typically where a mother of one species will foster a youngling from a different species. With the more recent growth of the fields of anthrozoology and animal studies, this is being used more frequently to refer especially to bonds between human and non-human animals.  History and use   Anthropomorphism  Some of the earliest instances of the interspecies family involve the use of anthropomorphism, such as in the children's book Stuart Little in which a mouse is a member of a human family. This is a fairly common idea which led to some of the first uses of \\"interspecies family\\" in media targeted towards children.  Non-human animal relationships  There is also a popular trend in books and internet sites that involves capturing photographs and stories of interspecies non-human animal families. These heartwarming cases promote the idea that animals can look past such differences. However, in these cases they are more often referred to as \\"interspecies adoptions\\", \\"interspecies pairings\\", and \\"interspecies friendships\\".  Human and non-human animal relationships  Just recently, the term has been used to describe non-fiction situations involving human and non-human animal relationships. In 2011 a dissertation was written by Avigdor Edminster entitled \\"'This Dog Means Life': Making Interspecies Relations at an Assistance Dog Agency\\" in which \\"Interspecies families\\" is used frequently. There have been other instances since then, but they have been strictly within academic works. In the fall of 2013, The National Museum of Animals & Society created the exhibit entitled My Dog Is My Home: The Experience of Human-Animal Homelessness. The exhibit explores the experience of being homeless with an animal, and specifically the needs that are unmet because of homeless services' failure to recognize the legitimacy of the human-animal bond and their status as an \\"interspecies family\\". The exhibit helped popularize the phrase \\"interspecies family\\" among its animal protection audience as well as among social service providers. Part of the museum's mission is to promote this idea of inter-species families and make the general public more aware of the strong bonds that can be shared between human and non-human animals.
