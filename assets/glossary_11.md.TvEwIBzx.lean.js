Rising Tide UK. Retrieved 05-02-2010 Rising Tide UK is formed of regional and local groups in the UK, and supports networks of similar groups around the country. Actions carried out by Rising Tide UK groups range from protests and street-theatre style events, to mass occupations of petrol stations, and blockades of key fossil fuel industrial sites.  Key values and goals  The aim of Rising Tide UK and the International Rising Tide Network more widely is to confront the root causes of climate change, by bringing about a socially just transition to a non-carbon society. They see the issue of climate change as directly linked to colonial-style economic domination by Northern powers, which have created a globalised economy that over-uses resources for the interests of the North, while keeping down equitable development in the South. They work towards these goals through grassroots and often confrontational direct action, and supporting other groups with similar goals. Rising Tide's work has targeted the fossil fuel industry in particular, and aims for an end to new fossil fuel development, and a dismantling of the elements of the current economy that are built around fossil fuel. It advocates an overall economic shift to community run renewable energy, and believes that reducing consumption in the North is also necessary to achieve a just economic structure. Rising Tide specifically argue against mechanisms such as Carbon Trading and many other elements of the ‚ÄòClean Development Mechanisms‚Äô which were a key part of the Kyoto Protocol. It shares the view of many other environmentalist groups that these market-based mechanisms are ‚ÄòFalse Solutions‚Äô that allow Northern companies to continue to emit green house gasses while gaining access to new markets in ‚ÄòCarbon Sinks‚Äô in the South. RT UK specifically advocates an immediate 60% drop in global emissions, leading to a 90% drop, and argues that mechanisms such as Carbon Trading preclude such a drop.‚ÄúRising Tide Political Statement‚Äù.

History and key actions  = Origins (2000) and political statement = Rising Tide UK and the International Rising Tide Network are a significant part of a wider environmental and social justice movement that started to crystallise in the new millennium, fuelled by increasing concern about climate change and the inaction of governments to deal with it. Rising Tide formed around a political statement written by a coalition of groups who came together in November 2000 to organise protests and events at the United Nations Climate Conference of Parties (COP6) in The Hague. COP6 was the 6th UN conference on climate change, which ended up collapsing over US proposals for Carbon Sinks in order to avoid reducing its emissions.Pomeroy, Robin (18-11-00). ‚ÄúClimate Talks Stall Over US Proposal for Carbon 'Sinks', Pollution 'Credits'‚Äù.

It is financed by the City of Vienna and the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy.  History  The Jewish Community Vienna (Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien, IKG) and several other renowned institutions initiated the idea to establish an international Shoah research institute in Vienna in 2002. Simon Wiesenthal was still personally involved in designing the concept for the institute before his death in 2005. In December 2002, the City of Vienna confirmed that it would financially support the project with a sum to match that to be provided by the Republic of Austria. In March 2008, support by the Republic of Austria for the VWI was also finally confirmed in a speech in the council of ministers. There followed the establishment of the office, taking up work in the spring of 2009.

The aim of the documentation project of the VWI is to unite thematically relevant but hitherto separated archival materials, ensure their safekeeping and make them accessible to search tools. A first step in this direction has been taken in the form of cooperation in producing the online platform ns-quellen.at which had been commissioned to the \\"Research Office. Association for Academic and Cultural Services\\" (Forschungsb√ºro. Verein f√ºr wissenschaftliche und kulturelle Dienstleistungen) and was completed in March 2011. Digitalization of the Holocaust-relevant parts of the IKG archive began in September 2010 with work on the so-called Jerusalem materials of the archive. This work is conducted using the archival software \\"scopeArchiv\\", which is in widespread use in Austria. The scholarly library of the VWI of the VWI is currently numbering approx. 14,000 volumes so far, concentrating to some extent on books on Holocaust-Studies which are not accessible in Austria. The institute library is a public reference library. The library catalogue can be searched via the Austrian joint library system (OBV). Since the autumn of 2012, the institute hosts two senior, two research and four junior fellows a year. In general, the call for proposals is announced at the end of a calendar year. Decision on grants is made by a sub-commission of the Academic Advisory Board and a research staff member of the VWI in the spring of each year. In the autumn of 2014, the e-Journal of the institute ‚Äì S:I.M.O.N. - Shoah: Intervention. Methods. DocumentatiON. - went online, publishing the peer- reviewed manuscripts of the Simon Wiesenthal Lectures, the Working Papers of the fellows and articles selected by the Editorial Committee. VWI's bilingual ‚Äì German and English ‚Äì book series is edited by the Viennese publishing house new academic press. The institute's German-speaking, annual newsletter VWI im Fokus informs on all upcoming events and activities.  Events  Fifth Simon Wiesenthal Lecture by Robert Jan van Pelt ‚Äì June 10, 2010 To achieve its aims of education, the VWI organises events such as book presentations, media and/or arts interventions in the public space in remembrance of the Shoah. An exhibition centre and an online platform are planned for when the institute has taken up full operation. The \\"Simon Wiesenthal Lectures\\" which have by now grown into a VWI trademark event, aim to bring current Holocaust research to a wider public with the help of renowned international researchers. They take place approx. every two months in the roof-top foyer of the Austrian State Archives at the Minoritenplatz in Vienna. At the end of a calendar year, VWI organises its annual \\"Simon Wiesenthal Conference\\": In 2011, the conference's topic was \\"Scores of Commemoration. The Holocaust in Music\\", while in 2012, \\"Before the Holocaust had its Name. Early Confrontations of the Mass Murder of the Jews\\". In 2013, VWI - together with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum - hosted the Simon Wiesenthal Conference under the title \\"Collaboration in Eastern Europe during World War II and the Holocaust\\".

Fauna Europaea These wasps normally occur in coniferous or mixed woodland. Description Rhyssa persuasoria (meaning persuasive burglar) is one of the largest ichneumon wasps in Europe. The length of adults varies from about in males up to in the females, plus about of the ovipositor. These ichneumon wasps have a thin black body, several whitish spots on the head, thorax, and abdomen and reddish legs. The antennae are long and thin. Females have a long ovipositor, which they use when laying eggs. The length of the ovipositor exceeds the body length. Nature Spot This species is rather similar to Rhyssa amoena Gravenhorst, 1829. Biology Adults can mainly be encountered from July through August, especially in paths and clearings of coniferous forests. They feed on carbohydrates such as sugar and starch, which are obtained, for example, by eating on honeydew or pine needles. Flowers are not visited. Helen Hocking (1967): The influence of food on longevity and oviposition in Rhyssa persuasoria (L.) (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae). Journal of the Australian Entomological Society 6: 83-88. Female of this parasitic species drills deep into wood by its hair thin ovipositor (terebra) and lays its eggs on larvae living deep in timber (up to 40 mm), which become a food supply and an incubator for the progeny, until it is fully grown. This species has one generation a year (univoltine). Larvae overwinter in the wood, pupating the next spring and emerging from the wood as adults. Main hosts of Rhyssa persuasoria are the larvae of Horntail or Wood Wasps (Urocerus gigas, Siricidae species, a type of xylophagous sawfly), as well as larvae of Longhorn Beetle (Spondylis buprestoides, Monochamus sutor) and Great Capricorn Beetle (Cerambyx cerdo).

He also lectured on Russian literature at universities in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Early life  Georgy Adamovich was born into the family of senior military officer Viktor Adamovich, an ethnic Pole, who served as head of the Moscow military hospital with the rank of major general. Georgy spent the first nine years of his life in Moscow. \\"We were a military family; two of my brothers were army officers. My dad said of me, if the family legend is to be believed: \\"This boy's got nothing officer-like in him- let him be a civilian. And so it was to be,\\" Adamovich later remembered. After his father's death the family moved to Saint Petersburg where Georgy joined the First Gymnasium. In 1910 he became a student at Saint Petersburg State University. He started writing poetry there and in 1915 became a member of the Acmeist circle.  Career  Adamovich's debut short story \\"Merry Horses\\" (–í–µ—Å—ë–ª—ã–µ –∫–æ–Ω–∏) was published in 1915 in the journal Voice of Life, edited by Dmitry Filosofov and Zinaida Gippius. By 1917 he was a member (later one of the two leaders, along with Georgy Ivanov) of the Saint Petersburg Poet's Workshop. Adamovich's first collection of poetry Clouds (–û–±–ª–∞–∫–∞) was praised by Nikolai Gumilyov for \\"class and good taste.\\" His second book of poetry, Purgatory (–ß–∏—Å—Ç–∏–ª–∏—â–µ, 1922) began with a tribute to Gumilyov whom the young poet now regarded as his mentor. Gumilyov's fellow Acmeist, Anna Akhmatova frequently visited Adamovich's sister Tanya at their home. Adamovich often met Akhmatova at the Saint Petersburg nightclub \\"The Stray Dog\\" (–ë—Ä–æ–¥—è—á–∞—è –°–æ–±–∞–∫–∞), a place where artists and writers would gather to discuss art and literature, socialize, or to listen to the recitation of new poems by Akhmatova and other poets including Konstantin Balmont, Sergei Yesenin, and Igor Severyanin. Adamovich graduated from the Faculty of History and Philology at Saint Petersburg State University in 1917. After the 1917 Revolution Adamovich worked for The World Literature publishing house (founded by Maxim Gorky in 1919), translating the works of Charles Baudelaire, Voltaire, Jos√©-Maria de Heredia, Lord Byron and Thomas Moore. In 1921-22 he attended the literary gatherings and poetry meetings held at The House of Art (–î–æ–º –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤), formerly the mansion of a wealthy Saint Petersburg merchant. In 1923 he went to Berlin, then settled in France to 'join the anti-Soviet circles' (as the Soviet Literary Encyclopaedia noted in 1934). Here he soon made a name for himself as a literary critic and essayist, working for Zveno (The Link) magazine and Poslednye Novosty (The Latest News). In the thirties Adamovich was widely regarded as 'the leading Russian literary critic abroad', working for such magazines as Tchisla (Numbers) and Vstrechi (Meetings), of which he was the editor for a time. He almost stopped writing poetry and yet is credited as a major force behind the Paris Note (–ü–∞—Ä–∏–∂—Å–∫–∞—è –ù–æ—Ç–∞), a school of Russian poetry in exile holding for its main principles \\"total sincerity in depicting the anguish of the human soul\\" and \\"demonstrating the naked truth\\". Georgy Fedotov called Adamovich, with his 'truth-seeking' paradigm, an 'ascetic wanderer'. In 1939 Adamovich's book of poetry In the West (–ù–∞ –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–µ) was published. Later its title was used by the poet and literary scholar Yuri Ivask who in 1953 compiled and edited an anthology of Russian emigrant poetry (in which Adamovich was well represented).  Later life  The Autumn of 1939 saw Adamovich fighting the Nazis as a volunteer in the French army. He was interned after the army's defeat. During the late 1940s, Adamovich went through a brief period of 'enchantment' with the USSR and Joseph Stalin in particular; he thought that the great victory in the World War II could trigger some kind of political reform or renovation process in the USSR. Adamovich contributed to several pro-Soviet western papers and published a book entitled The Other Motherland (–î—Ä—É–≥–∞—è —Ä–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞, 1947). Written in French, it was seen by some Russian emigres as \\"an act of capitulation before Stalinism.\\" In the years to come, though, Adamovich became increasingly more disillusioned. These feelings were reflected to some extent in his 1955 collection of essays called Loneliness and Freedom (–û–¥–∏–Ω–æ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∏ —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–∞). Adamovich continued to translate French literature into Russian including the works of Jean Cocteau, Saint-John Perse and Albert Camus (The Stranger). He lectured on Russian literature at the University of Manchester from 1950 to 1960, and for one semester (1960‚Äì61) at the University of Oxford. In 1971 he travelled to the United States, lecturing at Harvard University, Yale University, and New York University. In 1967 his last book of poetry Unity (–ï–¥–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ) was published. It coincided with the release of Comments (–ö–æ–º–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–∏), a vast collection of critical essays. Georgy Adamovich died on February 21, 1972 in Nice, France.  Career as a critic  Adamovich was one of the most important emigre critics. His main critical stance centered on simplicity. He rejected experimental poetry and recommended eschatological subject matter such as truth, loneliness, suffering, and death. He admired the works of Alexander Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov, Alexander Blok, and Leo Tolstoy (although he did not like Tolstoy's moral preaching). He disliked Afanasy Fet and Anton Chekhov (especially his plays), whose portrayals of the dullness and mediocrity of everyday life obscured, in Adamovich's opinion, the questions of eternal significance. Adamovich saw Fyodor Dostoyevsky as a dangerous metaphysical writer, and disapproved of Marina Tsvetaeva's \\"loudness\\" and her experimentation in rhythm, meter, and rhyme. He severely criticised Boris Pasternak's poems from Doctor Zhivago. His sceptical views of poetry and writing resembled those of his fellow critic Mark Aldanov. Adamovich was highly appreciative of the musical qualities of Blok's poems and those of Georgy Ivanov. He expressed these views in his meetings with younger poets, and in his critical essays.

With 26 bedrooms, a private lake and falconry school, it has a 5-star rating by the Scottish tourist board. The castle has hosted celebrity guests such as the Beatles, Barbara Cartland, Margaret Thatcher and the King of Norway, and is a wedding venue which has attracted several celebrity weddings in recent years.  History  The original castle dates back to 1220 built by Sir Humphrey de Kirkpatrick when he was Senestal of Annandale. The Kirkpatrick family, close allies of Robert the Bruce and King Robert would have been entertained at Auchen Castle often. The Kirkpatrick clan has long since moved from their seat at Auchen Castle and their estates and holdings came under the ownership of the Clan Johnstone. The Johnstone's remain Lords of Annandale to this day. The castle as it is today was largely completed in 1849 by General Johnstone. Through marriage, the castle then went on to Sir William Younger, 1st Baronet, of Auchen Castle of the Youngers brewery family. The castle still maintains many original features; such as the Victorian spring water catchments and reservoirs that supply the castle today. In the castle grounds there are many unusual species of trees and plants, brought to the estate over the centuries, some of which have a rich history and are of unusual varieties.  Weddings  The castle is one of Scotland's most sought after wedding destinations, and is used exclusively for weddings. In 2007 it was the venue for the wedding of model Michelle Marsh to footballer Will Haining, which appeared in OK! magazine. The castle hosted ITV's Good Morning Britain which broadcast four weddings live on the lead up to Valentines day 2016.http://www.itv.com/goodmorningbritain/entertainment/four- weddings-and-a-breakfast-show  Architecture  Auchen Castle is well known for its architectural curiosities and its design is layered in symbolism, earning it the nickname, \\"Egypt\\". General Johnstone who build the castle as it is today, served under Sir Ralph Abercromby in Egypt against the French in 1801 and it is thought that the design of the castle and the estate were laid out to show the positions of units in the Battle of the Nile. The floor plan is made up of two wings, running East to West and North to South. These two wings connect three corners of an isosceles triangle. At each of these corners there are three rooms of a similar design, with an octagonal box window in each with five sides of the octagon, showing on the outside, but the interior three sides are missing. This rule of three applies throughout the castle. At the entrance, in the form of three steps with two Corinthian pillars lead into the castle via a checkered floor, symbolic of the entrance to King Solomon's temple. Opposite the entrance there are a set of 21 steps, ascending a stepped pyramid shaped garden and surmounted by two sphinxes. When the rule of three within the castle itself is applied to this, and the number of steps is divided by it, the number is seven. This is the number of stages in the construction of a ziggurat, which is the original name for a pyramid.

Formerly part of the French colonial empire, British rule in Mauritius was established de facto with the Invasion of Isle de France in November 1810, and de jure by the subsequent Treaty of Paris. British rule ended on 12 March 1968, when Mauritius became independent.  History  Isle de France, which consisted of Mauritius and some other islands had been under French rule since 1715. However, during the Napoleonic Wars, despite the French naval victory in the Battle of Grand Port on 20‚Äì27 August 1810, Mauritius was captured on 3 December 1810 by the British under Commodore Josias Rowley. British possession of the island was confirmed four years later by the Treaty of Paris. Nonetheless, French institutions, including the Napoleonic Code of law, were maintained, and the French language was still more widely used than English. The British administration, with Robert Townsend Farquhar as the first governor, brought about rapid social and economic changes. One of the most important was the abolition of slavery on 1 February 1835. The planters received a compensation of two million pounds sterling for the loss of their slaves, who had been imported from Africa and Madagascar during the French occupation. The Mauritian Creole people trace their origins to the plantation owners and slaves who worked in the sugar fields. Indo-Mauritians are descended from Indian immigrants who arrived in the 19th century via the Aapravasi Ghat in order to work as indentured labourers after slavery was abolished. Included in the Indo-Mauritian community are Muslims (about 17% of the population) from the Indian subcontinent. In 1885, a new constitution was introduced. The Franco-Mauritian elite controlled nearly all of the large sugar estates and was active in business and banking. As the Indian population became numerically dominant and the voting franchise was extended, political power shifted from the Franco-Mauritians and their Creole allies to the Indo- Mauritians. Conflicts arose between the Indian community (mostly sugarcane labourers) and the Franco-Mauritians in the 1920s, leading to several (mainly Indian) deaths. Following this, the Mauritius Labour Party was founded in 1936 by Maurice Cur√© to safeguard the interest of the labourers. Cur√© was succeeded a year later by Emmanuel Anquetil, who tried to gain the support of the port workers and was thus exiled to the island of Rodrigues in 1938. After his death, Guy Rozemont took over the leadership of the party. Following the Uba riots of 1937 the local British government instituted significant reforms that un-banned labour unions, improved channels of arbitration between labourers and employers, and improved working conditions.However even deadlier riots broke out again in 1943 which became known as the Belle Vue Harel Massacre. In the period just before the official declaration of independence and hand over of power to an independent government the island was rocked by a series of ethnic riots such as the 1965 Mauritius race riots, August 1967 riots and ten day period of violent riots (January 1968) that resulted from ethnic tensions.

He connected an Apple II microcomputer in the service of \\"Video Texto\\" of Telesp and a microcomputer TRS-80 in \\"Projeto Cirand√£o\\" of Embratel. At Embrapa Roraima, made the connection of the first corporate local area network of the state in 1991, in a client-server architecture (a 386/DX 33Mhz server with 8MB RAM and 80GB HD MFM connected through a network Amplus to 3 12 MHz PC/XT). He was responsible in 1992 for the introduction of free and open source software in the state of Roraima, and set up, initially, the first Intel 386 PCs running Unix (SCO), which then became the first Linux server. Also in 1992, he made the first Internet connection and Web access in Roraima, with the support of Embratel, using RENPAC 2000 and implementing TCP/IP on a PC. The scheme used was to create a TCP/IP tunnel over RENPAC, connecting a PC at his home to a minicomputer at Embrapa Inform√°tica Agropecu√°ria (which was connected with FAPESP) for, from there, access and download web pages. Together with two friends, Marcus Vinicius Quintella and Jo√£o Claver, he was responsible for the design and implementation of the first Internet Service Provider (ISP) of the State of Roraima, TechNet, in 1996, with servers based entirely on open source software. He left the company in December 2004, but all that has been built yet kept working. With TechNet, he had the opportunity to configure and operate the first Internet-connected servers in the state of Roraima (web, ftp, email), besides being the author of the website (home page) of the State of Roraima in 1997.This first site can be seen in the state webarchive (https://web.archive.org/web/19970220152043/http://www.technet.com.br/). Embryos arose from social networks, through the services of online chat and thus he was responsible for creating the first IRC server of the State of Roraima in 1997, connected to the Brasnet network, with the first channel chat about the state, the well known then Canal Roraima (#Roraima). The online games were also starting in scene, with the creation of the first Quake server Roraima in 1999. In 2001, it was him and his colleagues that designed and implemented of the first wireless (WiFi) network for public access in the State of Roraima, initiating the first broadband connections. With the evolution of the Internet and the possibility of creating dynamic sites, he was the creator of the first information portal of the State of Roraima, in January 2002, based on PHP and MySQL. Certainly the Internet would come to Roraima. However, it was because of the entrepreneurial and pioneering spirit of someone like George that things happened quickly. It is worth remembering that many people contributed with him, but only one had the courage to start over.

Albert Weyman and Albert Prince) is a French-born keyboard player, composer and record producer, long time resident of, and working in, Italy.  Life and career  =The beginnings: Evy and \\"I Pyranas\\"= Born in Paris and raised in an italian family of musicians, Albert Verrecchia started very young with his sister Evy (√âvelyne) who was already recording. He got a band together for her in Paris, Les Probl√®mes and then joined Vigon et les Lemons, a R&B; ensemble with an awesome horn section, that eventually became Evy's backing group. Then Evy had them all move to Italy, where she got some popularity with the single \\"L'Abito Non Fa il Beatnik\\" (1966) ‚Äì an Italian cover of Jackie Edwards' and Spencer Davis Group's 1965 UK number one hit, \\"Keep on Running\\" ‚Äì and they started playing live in most of night clubs, both in Italy and in France as well as in North Africa, especially at the 'Titan Club' in Rome and at 'Bus Palladium' in Paris. As The Lemons, furthermore, Evy's backing group featuring Albert backed Chuck Berry in his French concerts and got credits on Evy's third Italian single \\"Domani il Mondo Sar√† nelle Nostre Mani\\". In that period Verrecchia also toured with Raffaella Carr√†. Later, in Rome, popular black jazz singer Rocky Roberts who had just split with The Airdales to go solo, chose the best musicians he could find in Paris to back him up, and one of the most influential Italian beat bands was born, \\"I Pyranas\\". Verrecchia played the W√ºrlitzer Piano and a Hammond M3 with incorporated Leslie, while Alex Ligertwood was on vocals and Andr√© Ceccarelli on drums,. Later Robbie McIntosh (former drummer of Average White Band who later worked a lot with Santana) and Steve Ferrone also played in the group. Left Rocky Roberts, I Pyranas continued solo for several years with three successful albums released on RCA's ARC subsidiary label - Tanti Successi per i Pyranas (1968), Motivi di Ieri, Successi di Oggi (1969), Giulietta e Romeo (1970). When they disbanded, Verrecchia began with a series of collaborations with many then up-and-coming artists, among these Alan Sorrenti ‚Äì Verrecchia produced his debut album Aria (1972) contributing also as keyboardist and arranger using the alias Albert Prince - and Renato Zero. Verrecchia played keyboards and did arrangements on his first album, No! Mamma, no! (1972) - before mostly dedicating himself to write and direct film soundtracks in the following years. = Film soundtracks = Albert Verrecchia with Pyranas in late 60s. In film soundtracks Verrecchia delivered what are regarded as his most interesting works to date, with Tecnica di un Amore (1973), which he composed for a still rather obscure Italian erotic drama directed by Brunello Rondi and starring Janet √Ögren alongside Erna Schurer and Silvano Tranquilli, standing as his most praised outcome. Tecnica di un amore got a first vinyl release in 1973 by the Naples B.B.B. Records' label and was later reprinted on LP and CD in 2000 by Moving Image Entertainment. Another Verrecchia highlight is the recently rediscovered Roma Drogata: La Polizia Non Pu√≤ Intervenire (also known as Hallucination Strip), from a 1975 drugs-themed movie starring Bud Cort, Patrizia Gori, Annarita Grapputo, and directed by Lucio Marcaccini. It received a public release in 2007 (on the Cinedelic GDM label CD, thanks to Associazione Culturale Escalation's interest), Verrecchia made use of electric sounds instead of canonical orchestral arrangements, mixing soul, hard rock, blues style, experimental vocals and percussions, with heavy psychedelic influences. For the instrumental part, Verrecchia recruited a group of young players: Cyan ‚Äì an italo-English quartet formed by George Sims (guitars), Roger Smith (bass), Alberto Visentin (keyboards) e Franco Di Stefano (drums) derived from a former Patty Pravo backing band ‚Äì the Baba Yaga ‚Äì a female vocal trio who worked for RCA and had already backed singer- songwriters such as De Gregori (in Alice Non Lo Sa, 1973) and Dalla (in Anidride Solforosa, 1975) singing as well in a few soundtracks by Guido & Maurizio De Angelis such as Watch Out, We're Mad! (1974), in the track \\"Dune Buggy\\"). Roma Drogata: La Polizia Non Pu√≤ Intervenire, both film and record, open with \\"We've Got a Lord\\", a soul ballad interpreted by Sammy Barbot featuring Baba Yaga. It was written by √âvelyne who credited herself from this period on as √âvelyne Lenton. The film opened showing the actual recording sessions of \\"We've Got a Lord\\". Other Verrecchia scores include: A Black Ribbon for Deborah (Marcello Andrei, 1974), Prigione di Donne (Brunello Rondi, 1974) and Season for Assassins (Marcello Andrei, 1975). =Disco era= Early 70's studio session with Albert Verrecchia (center), Alan Sorrenti (left) and Jean-Luc Ponty (right). In 1976, Verrecchia turned his music interests toward the emerging disco euroscene and started his own record productions under the pseudonym Albert Weyman releasing the single \\"Le Chat (La Chatte √† la Voisine)\\", banned on Italian radio, but regularly programmed on Vatican State Radio until they had the lyrics double meaning translated. What followed in Verrecchia's mind was the idea of a glittering disco trio led by Evy, who with two black chorists, Marcia Briscoe from Atlanta and Jusy Fortes from Cape Verde, formed Belle Epoque. Their first success was with Miss Broadway which Verrecchia wrote, but the real exploit came in 1977, when the trio score a major European hit with a disco-fied remake of a big success of the decade before, \\"Black Is Black\\" by Los Bravos. The Belle Epoque version was a top ten hit in many European countries, including number 2 in the UK Singles Chart (the same chart position that Los Bravos' original had reached there eleven years earlier). The song also became a number 1 hit in Australia in 1978, while in the States Belle Epoque were better known for \\"Miss Broadway\\", which charted at number 26 on the U.S. R&B; chart and at number 92 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1978. Both songs rose to number 21 on Billboard's \\"National Disco Action Top 40\\" chart in summer 1977. After \\"Black is Black\\" Verrecchia and Belle Epoque followed with a number disco successful productions into the late 1970s, \\"Bamalama\\" (1978), \\"Let Men Be\\" (1978), \\"Com'On Tonight\\" (1978), \\"Now\\" (1979), \\"Jump Down\\" (1979), and a dance version of Bobby Solo's \\"Una Lacrima sul Viso\\" (1978). At the principle of 1980s the disco boom was over, and after so many years of intense work Verrecchia decided to take a pause, reducing his musical activity. While Evy began recording solo again in 1982, contributing with her vocals both in English and French productions until the end of the decade, her brother bought a boat, the 'Silver Maid', Scottish, all in teak, which had been Susan Stafford's - where he managed to enter a grand piano! - and opened an exclusive disco club, the \\"Superstar\\", in Nice, French Riviera. =Recent activity= In 2011, Verrecchia is dedicating to music again (and again under the moniker Albert Weyman), forging a modern, updated style, which he describes as a blend of electronica, new-age, house and progressive.

Topical immunotherapy using diphenylcyclopropenone may also be an effective treatment option for recalcitrant warts. It is not approved by either the Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency. Mechanism of action Diphenylcyclopropenone triggers an immune response that is thought to oppose the action of the autoreactive cells that otherwise cause hair loss.Public summary of positive opinion for orphan designation of diphenylcyclopropenone for the treatment of alopecia totalis, European Medicines Agency. Document Date: London, 23 April 2009. Doc.Ref.:EMEA/COMP/428277/2006 One hypothesis is that in response to DPCP treatment, the body will attempt to downregulate inflammation through a variety of pathways, resulting in a downregulation of the autoimmune response at the hair follicle. This autoinflammatory reaction would otherwise destroy body's hair follicles. Studies A study of 41 alopecia areata patients showed significant hair regrowth in 40% at 6 months, being sustained in two thirds of these after a 12-month-follow up-period. In a 2002 study for the treatment of warts, the responders consisted of 135 individuals (87.7%) that had complete clearance of warts. Reported adverse effects were local and included with pruritus (itching) (15.6%), with blistering (7.1%), and with eczematous reactions (eczema)(14.2%). The majority of the patients tolerated the treatment very well. One patient developed local impetigo (minor infection). Patients had an average of 5 treatments over a 6-month period.  Chemical properties  The chemical properties of diphenylcyclopropenone are dominated by the strong polarization of the carbonyl group, which gives a partial positive charge with aromatic stabilization on the cyclopropene ring and a partial negative charge on oxygen. Furthermore, the phenyl groups stabilize the partial positive charge in the ring through resonance. Diphenylcyclopropenone reacts with electrophilic chlorinating agents, including oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride and phosphorus pentachloride, to give 3,3-dichloro-1,2-diphenylcyclopropene, which is a reagent for the activation of carboxylic acids.

Guadagnoli and Timothy D. Lee (2004), provides a theoretical basis to conceptualize the effects of various practice conditions in motor learning. This framework relates practice variables to the skill level of the individual, task difficulty, and information theory concepts. The fundamental idea is that ‚Äúmotor tasks represent different challenges for performers of different abilities‚Äù (Guadagnoli and Lee 2004, p212). Any task will present the individual with a certain degree of challenge. However, the learning potential from this task difficulty level will differ based on the: :# skill level of the performer :# task complexity :# task environment Importantly, though increases in task difficulty may increase learning potential, increased task difficulty is also expected to decrease performance. Thus, an optimal challenge point exists when learning is maximized and detriment to performance in practice is minimized.  Importance and applications  Practice has been proposed as the most important factor for the ‚Äúrelatively permanent‚Äù improvement in the ability to perform motor skills (Adams 1964; Annett 1969; Fitts 1964; Magill 2001; Marteniuk 1976; Newell 1981; Salmoni et al. 1984; Schmidt and Lee 1999; Guadagnoli and Lee 2004). With all other variables held constant, skill increases with practice (Guadagnoli and Lee 2004). However, time devoted to practice can be made more efficient by careful consideration of practice conditions. The challenge point framework presents a theoretical perspective to consider the roles of the level of the performer, the complexity of the task and the environment in regulating the learning potential during practice. Adjustment of these components to enhance motor learning can be applied to variety of contexts, including rehabilitation (Descarreaux et al. 2010; Onla- or & Winstein 2008) and simulation-based health professions education (Gofton 2006).  History  The challenge point framework involves concepts generated through various lines of research including information theory, communications theory, and information processing (Lintern and Gopher 1978; Martenuik 1976; K.M. Newell et al. 1991; Wulf and Shea 2002). Specific notions borrowed from prior research important to understanding the theoretical framework include: :# Learning is a problem-solving process in which the goal of an action represents the problem to be solved and the evolution of a movement configuration represents the performer‚Äôs attempt to solve the problem (Miller et al. 1960 as cited by Guadagnoli and Lee 2004). :# Sources of information available during and after each attempt to solve a problem are remembered and form the basis for learning, which is defined as a relatively permanent improvement in skill that results from practice (Guthrie 1952 as cited by Guadagnoli and Lee 2004). :# Two sources of information are critical for learning: :## An action plan is a construct that invokes intention and ultimately results in a specific movement configuration on a given performance (Miller et al. 1960 as cited by Guadagnoli and Lee 2004). See motor control. :## Feedback may be inherent to the individual (e.g. vision) or available via external, augmented sources (e.g. verbal instruction). :# Information is transmitted only when uncertainty is reduced (Shannon and Weaver 1949; Fitts 1954; Fitts and Posner 1967; Legge and Barber 1967; Martenuik 1976; Miller 1956 as cited by Guadagnoli and Lee 2004).  Components  It follows from the description of the challenge point framework that: :* It is impossible to learn without information :* Learning is impaired by presentation of insufficient or excessive amounts of information :* Learning is facilitated by an optimal amount of information, which depends on individual skill and task difficulty = Information available and task difficulty = Learning is fundamentally a problem-solving process. It has been proposed that with practice, there is reduced information available to the participant because better expectations are formed (i.e. practice = redundancy, therefore less uncertainty; Marteniuk 1976). However, increasing functional task difficulty results in less certainty about the predicted success of the action plan and the nature of the feedback. At low levels of functional difficulty, the potential available information is low for performers in all skill levels. As functional task difficulty increases, the potential information available increases exponentially for beginners and less rapidly for intermediate and skilled performers. For experts, the potential information available increases only at the highest levels of functional task difficulty. = Task difficulty and skill = Task difficulty has received considerable attention in prior research (Fleighman and Quaintance 1984; Gentile 1998). Important to the challenge point framework, task difficulty is not explicitly defined. Alternately, two broad categories can encompass these elements: * Nominal task difficulty  Difficulty due to the characteristics of the task only, reflecting a constant amount of task difficulty (e.g. the target of a throw being near versus far); includes perceptual and motor performance requirements (Swinnen et al. 1992). * Functional task difficulty  Difficulty due to the person performing the task and the environment (e.g. two individuals, a major league pitcher and an inexperienced ball thrower, are asked to throw a baseball as fast as they can to first base on two days, one on a sunny day and the other on a windy day). Performance of a task with low nominal difficulty will be expected to be high in all groups of performers (i.e. all skill levels). However, beginner performance will be expected to decline rapidly as nominal difficulty increases, whereas intermediate and skilled performance will decline less rapidly, and expert performance is expected to decline only at the highest nominal difficulty levels. Although the \\"Expert\\" skill level is useful to explain this framework, one may argue that experts should have a high level of predicted success for all nominal task difficulties. It is possible that once expertise is attained, these individuals are able to predict the outcome of the ongoing task and modify ongoing processes in order to reach a suitable outcome (e.g. surgeons). = Optimal challenge points = The optimal challenge point represents the degree of functional task difficulty an individual of a specific skill level would need to optimize learning (Guadagnoli and Lee 2004). However, this learning depends on the amount of interpretable information. Therefore, although increases in task difficulty may increase learning potential, only so much is interpretable, and task performance is expected to decrease. Thus, an optimal challenge point exists when learning is maximized and detriment to performance in practice is minimized. With increased practice it is assumed that one's information- processing capabilities will increase (Marteniuk 1976). Therefore, the optimal challenge point will change as the individual's ability to use information changes, requiring further changes in functional difficulties in task to facilitate learning (Guadagnoli and Lee 2004).  Practice variables and framework predictions  = Contextual interference (CI) and action planning = Predictions from the challenge point framework with respect to CI (refer to motor learning; Guadagnoli and Lee 2004, p 219): :# \\"For tasks with differing levels of nominal difficulty, the advantage of random practice (vs. blocked practice) for learning will be largest for tasks of lowest nominal difficulty and smallest for tasks of highest nominal difficulty\\". :# \\"For individuals with differing skill levels, low levels of CI will be better for beginning skill levels and higher levels of CI will be better for more highly skilled individuals\\". = Knowledge of results (KR) and feedback information = Predictions from the challenge point framework with respect to KR (refer to motor learning; Guadagnoli and Lee 2004, p221): :# \\"For tasks of high nominal difficulty, more frequent or immediate presentation of KR, or both, will yield the largest learning effect. For tasks of low nominal difficulty, less frequent or immediate presentation of KR, or both, will yield the largest learning effect\\". :# \\"For tasks about which multiple sources of augmented information can be provided, the schedule of presenting the information will influence learning. For tasks of low nominal difficulty, a random schedule of augmented feedback presentation will facilitate learning as compared with a blocked presentation. For tasks high in nominal difficulty, a blocked presentation will produce better learning than a random schedule  External links  Memory processes Motor skills Nervous system Motor control ","title":"Challenge point framework"},{"id":"31284198","text":"Western Australian population growth between 1880 and 1897. In the latter part of the nineteenth century, discoveries of gold at a number of locations in Western Australia caused large influxes of prospectors from overseas and interstate, and classic gold rushes. Significant finds included: * Halls Creek in 1885, found by Charles Hall and Jack Slattery. Triggered the \\"Kimberley gold rush\\". * Near Southern Cross in 1887, found by the party of Harry Francis Anstey. The \\"Yilgarn gold rush\\".\\"The Yilgarn Hills Gold-Fields\\", The West Australian (Perth) 16 November 1887, p.3\\"The Discovery of the Yilgarn Goldfields\\", Western Mail (Perth), 7 September 1889, p.4 * Cue in 1891, found by Michael Fitzgerald, Edward Heffernan and Tom Cue. The \\"Murchison gold rush\\". * Coolgardie in 1892, by Arthur Bailey and William Ford. * Kalgoorlie in 1893, by Patrick \\"Paddy\\" Hannan, Tom Flanagan and Dan Shea. A small rush at Nundamurrah Pool, on the Greenough River, near Mullewa, east of Geraldton occurred in August 1893. The Kalgoorlie event in particular, following the June 1893 discovery of alluvial gold at the base of Mount Charlotte by Irish prospectors Paddy Hannan, Tom Flanagan and Dan O'Shea, saw a massive population increase and ultimately, brought great wealth to the state. Capital works, including roads and railways and in 1896, construction of the ambitious Goldfields Water Supply Scheme, came about on the back of the gold rushes. The population in Western Australia in 1891 was 49,782. By 1895 it had doubled to 100,515, and by 1901 was 184,124. These previously unexplored eastern districts were hot and barren and had limited natural water supplies or pre- existing infrastructure to support sudden influxes of people. As a result, all supplies had to be carted, either from Perth or Esperance. Carted water was sold for up to 5 shillings per gallon. Kimberley Prospector Charles Hall and others found alluvial gold in the eastern Kimberly region in 1885. The find created the first gold rush in Western Australia. In terms of gold yield, the rush was not particularly successful, but was the first significant find in the northern and western parts of Australia. It was nearly 40 years after the Victorian rushes. Yilgarn The \\"Yilgarn gold rush\\" refers to a rush which commenced in 1888 after the November 1887 discovery of gold in the Yilgarn Hills area, north of Southern Cross. Yilgarn is an Aboriginal word for white quartz, a common indicator of gold. Murchison Gold was discovered in 1892 though there is uncertainty as to who made the first find. Michael Fitzgerald and Edward Heffernan collected 260 ounces after being given a nugget by an Aboriginal known as 'Governor'. Tom Cue travelled to Nannine to register their claim. The townsite was gazetted in 1893 and named after Tom Cue. The town's first water supply was a well in the centre of the main street; after an outbreak of typhoid fever, the well was capped with a rotunda built over the top. The water supply was replaced by another well dug near Lake Nallan and carted 20 km south to the townsite. The town of Day Dawn, south, was established within a year; by 1900 a hospital and cemetery were established between the two towns and they had three newspapers operating. The rivalry between the towns fuelled a diverse sporting culture in the area. Cycling and horse-racing groups held regular events attracting competitors from as far away as Perth and Kalgoorlie. Coolgardie Gold was discovered by Arthur Bailey in 1892. The Bailey's Reward gold mine would become one of the richest mines in the state. Kalgoorlie Prospectors Paddy Hannan, Tom Flanagan and Dan Shea found 100 ounces of alluvial gold at Mount Charlotte in 1894. After Hannan registered the reward claim, 750 men were prospecting in the area within three days. A town quickly sprang up which was initially called Hannans and later Kalgoorlie. Whilst new prospectors were arriving in the colony, large numbers of workers were also moving between the various districts as new discoveries happened. False and exaggerated rumours were also rampant and many died from thirst and disease.

History  The thick bed mortar method has been around for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Historically, a sand/cement mixture was mixed with water to a fairly dry consistency and was spread on either a portland cement water paste (neat cement), or over cement powder spread on the surface which is then sprayed with water to create a slurry coat and spread over the surface. The thick bed mortar would then be compacted and screeded (made flat and/or level) prior to installation of tile or stone. As the slurry coat dried it would bond the mortar bed to the concrete surface on which it was installed. Mortar beds were used underneath almost every tile or stone installation until the late 1950s when a chemical engineer, Henry M. Rothberg, invented the technology which introduced latex to sand/cement mortar mixes, and created a new industry based on thin bed adhesive installations by founding Laticrete International, Inc. Mortars used in this technique typically have a compressive strength ranging from at least 400 psi (2.8 MPa) to 1600 psi (11 MPa), when tested using ANSI testing procedures. However, with advancements in technology and materials, the potential strengths of the thick bed mortar system have increased. Quality controlled manufacturing processes create thick bed mortar mixes which combine carefully graded, high quality aggregates (sand) in a precise ratio with portland cement. This means that a consistent mix can be achieved without the need for a laborer to blend sand/cement and possibly lime at the jobsite. These pre-packaged mortars also eliminate the problems caused by excessively damp sand, incorrect mixing ratios, quality of the raw materials, and piles of sand on a jobsite. Today's thick bed mortars can be fortified with the inclusion of a liquid latex or redispersible polymer per the manufacturer's directions to enhance the performance properties of the thick bed mortar.

Overview The entrance to Parliament House, Canberra ‚Äì scene of the 1996 riot. The Australian Council of Trade Unions called the \\"cavalcade to Canberra\\" rally to protest against the industrial relations reform agenda of the Liberal-National Coalition Howard Government. The protest began with senior Australian Trade Union officials including ACTU President Jennie George and Assistant Secretary Greg Combet, as well as senior members of the Australian Labor Party rallying demonstrators from a podium.Jennie George bids farewell to politics ‚Äì Local News ‚Äì News ‚Äì General ‚Äì Illawarra Mercury According to then President of the Senate, Margaret Reid, the initially peaceful protest deteriorated into violent action when a new group of demonstrators arrived in the early afternoon and, joined by people from the main protest, attacked the entrance to Parliament. Around 90 personnel were injured ‚Äîincluding lacerations, sprains, and head and eye injuries. Damage to the forecourt and foyer of Parliament was initially estimated at $75,000 and the Parliamentary shop was looted.

Both endeavours were opposed by Trade Unionists who organised a campaign of protest to culminate on the eve of the federal budget, 19 August 1996 with a protest rally on the lawns of the Federal Parliament, called the \\"Cavalcade to Canberra\\". The protest and riot On 4 July 1996, the A.C.T. Trades and Labour Council advised the Speaker and President of the Parliament that a rally would be held at Parliament House on Monday, 19 August and requested permission to conduct a march around the Parliament building. The march was approved for between 1.35 p.m. and 2.25 p.m, provided adequated marshalling was organised and that the demonstration did not obstruct access to Parliament. Subsequent discussions were also conducted with the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and the indigenous representatives and all agreed to these parameters for the demonstration.

In the House of Representatives, Opposition Leader Kim Beazley called the rioters \\"lunatics\\" and \\"louts\\" who had distracted from a \\"peaceful and lawful\\" protest, while Prime Minister John Howard described the violence as \\"thuggery\\" and said that the ACTU should accept some responsibility for the riot: See also * Union violence References Riots and civil disorder in Australia Political riots Parliament House Riot Union violence Parliament of Australia Political history of Australia 1990s in Canberra Far-left politics in Australia August 1996 events in Oceania ","title":"1996 Parliament House riot"},{"id":"31284341","text":"Robert Simms (20 March 1761 ‚Äì 1843) was an Irish radical, and a founding member in Belfast of the Society of United Irishmen. A Presbyterian born in Belfast, Simms was the owner of a paper mill in Ballyclare with his brother William Simms, one of twelve proprietors of the Northern Star newspaper. A close friend of Wolfe Tone who nicknamed him 'the Tanner', he was one of the founders of the Society of United Irishmen in Belfast in 1791 and the author of \\"Declaration and Resolutions of the Society of United Irishmen of Belfast.\\" Simms served as the first Secretary of the Society, drafting many of its early letters, pamphlets and papers. Following the French declaration of war on Britain in February 1793, the movement was outlawed and went underground from 1794 as they became more determined to force a revolt against British rule. Simms, along with his brother William and Thomas Addis Emmet were arrested, but swiftly acquitted. The leadership was divided into those who wished to wait for French aid before rising and the more radical elements that wished to press ahead regardless. However, the suppression of a bloody preemptive rebellion, which broke out in Leitrim in 1793, led to the former faction prevailing and links were forged with the revolutionary French government with instructions to wait sent to all of the United Irish membership. In 1795, along with Tone, Samuel Neilson and Thomas Russell met atop the summit of McArt's Fort, overlooking Belfast, and, in Tone's words, \\"took a solemn obligation...never to desist in our efforts until we had subverted the authority of England over our country and asserted her independence.\\" The Simms brothers were again arrested in 1797 and held in Newgate Prison. From there he was transported along with Russell and Emmett to Fort George, Scotland. In his absence, the press of the Northern Star was burned. Upon his release, he was appointed as Commander of the United Army in Antrim. The appointment was met reluctantly however, as Simms felt his lack of military experience counted against him being an effective leader. In addition, many leaders were beginning to agitate for a rising without French aid. Simms was unwavering in his rejection of this idea. He resigned his position on 1 June 1798 after falling out with the leadership on this issue when most had changed their minds. He was replaced by Henry Joy McCracken who would lead the society in the Battle of Antrim. Simms was accused by many of cowardice and indecision for his refusal to launch an insurrection in Antrim. He was nonetheless arrested and again imprisoned in Fort George with Emmet and William James MacNeven and was released in 1802. When Robert Emmet's failed coup was launched in 1803, the Simms brothers did not participate. He died in 1843, at the age of 82. Robert Simms was a friend of the naturalist John Templeton and his son, also Robert Simms, was one of the founders of the Belfast Natural History Society.

Commercial tobacco plants typically produce alkaloids at levels between 2% and 4% of total dry weight, with nicotine accounting for about 90% of the total alkaloid content, and the related compounds anabatine, nornicotine, and anabasine making up nearly all the rest. These compounds are thought to be biologically active, and part of plants' natural defense system against insects. Anatabine has been studied in animal models and in cells to see if it might be useful for treating nicotine addiction and inflammation, and has been studied in models of diseases characterized by inflammation, such as Alzheimer's Disease, thyroiditis, and multiple sclerosis. Note: content is supported by discussion section which provides a brief review of research to date. On a biochemical level, it appears to be active against certain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Commercial development Star Scientific developed and sold the compound as a dietary supplement primarily through GNC up until mid 2014. Subsequently, Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals (formerly a subsidiary of Star Scientific), headquartered in Florida, began developing anatabine as a drug. The dietary supplements were known as Anatabloc and CigRx; the company has also marketed cosmetics with the Anatabloc brand. Rock Creek had been working on synthetic methods to scale up production of anatabine and has funded pre-clinical and clinical research in several indications. In 2013 the FDA warned Star Scientific for unlawfully promoting CigRx and Anatabloc before anatabine was proved to be safe.FDA Warning Letter Subsequently, new management and a mostly new board under the banner of Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals withdrew the dietary supplement because of the FDA's concerns. In 2013, Star Scientific became embroiled in political scandal, when news broke that the governor of Virginia, Bob McDonnell, and his wife had received significant loans and gifts from Jonnie Williams Sr, the CEO of the company. They were found to have helped the company in several ways like arranging meetings with top officials and giving special favors from the state government. Williams resigned in 2014 and the company changed its name and restructured its board and management at the end of 2013 due to the scandal. However, the accumulated legal costs from the defense of Jonnie Williams in the McDonnell scandal overwhelmed the company‚Äôs finances and it filed for bankruptcy in 2016. As a consequence, the development and clinical trials of anatabine were halted indefinitely.

It had an epicenter in the eastern part of Shan State in Burma (Myanmar) with a hypocenter 10 km deep.Magnitude 6.8 ‚Äì MYANMAR It had two aftershocks, one of magnitude 4.8, another at magnitude 5.4, and two subsequent shocks at magnitude 5.0 and 6.2. The quake's epicentre was from the northern Thai city of Chiang Rai, north of Mae Sai and southeast of Kentung. Geology USGS ShakeMap for the event The earthquake occurred in an area of complex tectonics caused by the continuing collision between the northward moving Indo- Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate, which created the Arakan Yoma mountains. In this zone of highly oblique collision, most of the motion is accommodated by the north-south trending Sagaing fault, a major dextral (right lateral) strike-slip fault that runs through the western and central part of Burma. The remaining component of shortening across this zone causes distributed deformation of eastern Burma and Thailand extending into Laos. This deformation is partly accommodated by a set of southwest-northeast trending sinistral (left lateral) strike-slip faults. The faults closest to the epicenter are the Mae Chan and Nam Ma faults. The focal mechanism for this earthquake is consistent with left-lateral movement on one of these faults, away from the main zones of seismic activity in Burma. Other recent significant earthquakes in this area included the 2011 Yunnan earthquake and the 2007 Laos earthquake. According to the Earth Observatory of Singapore, it appears likely that it was caused by motion on the western segment of the Nan Ma Fault. Casualties A damaged road in Tarlay, Shan State Dozens of houses were destroyed in Shan State Early reports suggested that at least 10 people were killed by quake-triggered landslides in the town of Tachileik, including a child, as well as Tarpin to its north, both in Shan State, northeastern Burma. Another person was killed in Mae Sai, Thailand, near the Burmese border. At least three injuries were reported in Burma. After sunrise, the casualty toll increased to 24 in Burma, in addition to the one fatality in Thailand. Officials warned that the death toll is likely to rise. Later, death toll rose to 74 killed in Burma and 1 in Thailand, while 111 people were injured. In Tarlay, located between Tachileik and Mong Hpyak, at least 40 were killed when 130 houses collapsed. Vertical displacement of 1.5 metres in subsidence was observed in the area. The Bangkok Post reported on 27 March 2011 that the death toll was \\"over 150\\", which is double the official figure of 75. Aftermath Temporary evacuations of tall buildings took place in Chiang Rai of Thailand, Menghai County in Yunnan, Nanning in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China, and in Hanoi of Vietnam. At least one bridge is reported collapsed in Myanmar. In total, 390 residential homes, 14 monasteries and 9 government buildings were destroyed. In Monglin, at least 128 homes were reduced to rubble.

(1991). Comparison and expectancy processes in human judgment. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 61, 203-211. Evaluation and judgment are subjective and may be imposed by onlookers depending on the group being evaluated. Prior experiences with a given group affect future assessments of group members by creating expected norms for behavior. Applications =Previous restrictions= Originally, this model was thought to only harm stereotypical low-status groups. However, recent research by McCabe & Brannon, suggests that the shifting standards model can be used in evaluating people from a higher status group. In a study conducted with undergraduate college students, McCabe and Brannon instructed each participant to read a paragraph with either a stereotypical black or white name, then rate the level of ambition for each individual. The unemployed subtype of the stereotypical high-power White group was rated less ambitious than the unemployed subtype of the stereotypical low- power Black group.McCabe, A. E., & Brannon, L. A. (2004). Effect of shifting standards on evaluations of white subtype members. Journal of Social Psychology, 144(1), 91-92. Retrieved from EBSCOhost. =Competition for limited and unlimited resources= The shifting standards model can also have an effect on making evaluations, depending on the kind of judgment being made. That is, if there are more negative stereotype views toward one group than others, then standards used to evaluate an individual from one of those groups shifts either up or down.Kite, M.E., and Whitley, B.E.; The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination .Wadsworth, Cengage Learning,2010 Some groups are generally considered to be of high competency, such as white males; and some groups are considered to be of lower competency, such as women or African- Americans. In a competition of limited resources, the high competency group will be awarded the resources, even if they are actually less deserving. However, in cases of unlimited resources, such as performance appraisal, lower competency groups will be given more of the resource, even if they performed relatively more poorly.Biernat, M., & Vescio, T.K. (2002). She swings, she hits, she's great, she's benched: Implications of gender-based shifting standards for judgment and behavior. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 28, 66-77. This is due to lower expectations of negatively stereotyped groups. =Sex and gender differences= This model can also be applied to sex and gender differences. Fuegen and colleagues presented a study from two different universities where the subjects were instructed to review job applicants and judge their competence level for the job. Each applicant was either male or female, single or married and had no children or two children. Strikingly, both male and female parents were judged as less competent for the job than childless applicants. Also, gender standards were shifted in the evaluation of applicants. Male parents were judged with more leniency than childless males and women with children. This displays the notion that good performance for a male is not equivalent to what constitutes good performance for a female.Fuegen, K., Biernat, M., Haines, E., & Deaux, K. (2004). Mothers and Fathers in the Workplace: How Gender and Parental Status Influence Judgments of Job-Related Competence. Journal of Social Issues, 60(4), 737-754. =Measuring stereotype accuracy= In measuring stereotype accuracy, researchers often assume that assessments are stable across time and situation. However, research based on the shifting standards model shows just the opposite, that stereotypes are unstable and depend largely on how the participant chooses a reference point for making their assessment.Biernat, M., & Manis, M.

The WBDG is based on the premise that to create a successful high-performance building, one must apply an integrated design and team approach in all phases of a project, including planning, design, construction, operations and maintenance. The WBDG is managed by the National Institute of Building Sciences. History The WBDG was initially designed to serve U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) construction programs. A 2003 DOD memorandum named WBDG the ‚Äúsole portal to design and construction criteria produced by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), and U.S. Air Force.‚Äù Since then, WBDG has expanded to serve all building industry professionals. The majority of its 500,000 monthly users are from the private sector. The WBDG draws information from the Construction Criteria Base and a privately owned database run by Information Handling Services. A significant amount of the Whole Building Design Guide content is organized by three categories: Design Guidance, Project Management, and Operations and Maintenance. It is structured to provide WBDG visitors first a broad understanding then increasingly specific information more targeted towards building industry professionals. The WBDG is the resource that federal agencies look to for policy and technical guidance on Federal High Performance and Sustainable Buildings In addition, the WBDG contains online tools, the original Construction Criteria Base, Building Information Modeling guides and libraries, a database of select case studies, federal mandates and other resources. The WBDG also provides over 70 online continuing education courses for architects and other building professionals, free of charge. Development Development of the WBDG is a collaborative effort among federal agencies, private sector companies, non-profit organizations and educational institutions.

Description Buddleja farreri, Longstock Park, UK. Buddleja farreri is a deciduous shrub of sparse habit which, left unpruned, grows to a large size. The flowers appear on the old wood before the leaves at the nodes of the previous year's growth, during April in the UK. The lax panicles are < 20 cm in length and pale lavender in colour. The leaves are initially white, owing to a dense coating of hairs, but ultimately become almost glabrous, with a dark green upper surface; the underside remains white and tomentose. Their size and shape are variable, depending on the type of shoot bearing them. Strong shoots from the base will bear large stipules, and broad, winged petioles, very different from those on ordinary shoots. Farrer summarized the plant as a \\"noble bush with ample flannely foliage\\", however Bean noted that it is probably the cooler, damper UK climate which prevents the shrub from making the striking display that so impressed Farrer in China. Cultivation The shrub is hardy in southern Britain, although shoots are killed in severe winters. The plant is self- fertile, and can produce copious viable seed. Softwood cuttings can be struck in June. Hardiness: USDA zones 8-10.Stuart, D. D. (2006). Buddlejas. RHS Plant Guide. Timber Press, Oregon.

Bush signing the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which was designed to promote US nuclear reactor construction, through incentives and subsidies, including cost-overrun support up to a total of $2 billion for six new nuclear plants. The nuclear energy policy of the United States developed within two main periods, from 1954‚Äì1992 and 2005‚Äì2010. The first period saw the ongoing building of nuclear power plants, the enactment of numerous pieces of legislation such as the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, and the implementation of countless policies which have guided the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy in the regulation and growth of nuclear energy companies. This includes, but is not limited to, regulations of nuclear facilities, waste storage, decommissioning of weapons-grade materials, uranium mining, and funding for nuclear companies, along with an increase in power plant building. Both legislation and bureaucratic regulations of nuclear energy in the United States have been shaped by scientific research, private industries' wishes, and public opinion, which has shifted over time and as a result of different nuclear disasters. In the United States, there have been numerous legislative actions and policies implemented on a federal and state level to both regulate atomic energy and promote its expansion. Growth of nuclear power in the US ended in the 1980s, however the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was passed in 2005 which aimed to jump start the nuclear industry through financial loan-guarantees for expansion and re-outfitting of nuclear plants. The success of this legislation is still undetermined, since all 17 companies that applied for funding are still in the planning phases on their 26 proposed building applications. Some of the proposed sites have even scrapped their building plans, and many think the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster will further dampen the success of expansion of nuclear energy in the United States. In 2008, the Energy Information Administration projected almost 17 gigawatts of new nuclear power reactors by 2030, but in its 2011 projections, it \\"scaled back the 2030 projection to just five\\". Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, public support for building nuclear power plants in the U.S. dropped to 43%, slightly lower than it was immediately after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, according to a CBS News poll. A survey conducted in April 2011 found that 64 percent of Americans opposed the construction of new nuclear reactors. A survey sponsored by the Nuclear Energy Institute, conducted in September 2011, found that \\"62 percent of respondents said they favor the use of nuclear energy as one of the ways to provide electricity in the United States, with 35 percent opposed\\". History of the Nuclear energy policy of the United States Almost a year after World War II ended, Congress established the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to foster and control the peacetime development of atomic science and technology. Reflecting America's postwar optimism, Congress declared that atomic energy should be employed not only in the Nation's defense, but also to promote world peace, improve the public welfare, and strengthen free competition in private enterprise. Later legislation enacted by Congress split the AEC into our current Department of Energy and Nuclear Regulatory Commission.Alice Buck (1983). \\"The Atomic Energy Commission\\", U.S. Department of Energy, p. 1. In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates the nuclear energy industry more strictly than most other industries. The NRC and the Department of Energy (DOE), work together to insure plant safety, building and operational permits, movement and storage of nuclear waste, management of weapons-grade byproducts of plants, radiation protection, and loan guarantees. The United States has more active nuclear power plants than any other country in the world, with 104 plants out of the total 441 active sites and another 62 under construction worldwide. This is nearly twice as many sites as the next two countries, France (58) and Japan (55), combined. Construction of U.S. nuclear facilities peaked between the 1970s and 1980s, during which time, these facilities were granted 20‚Äì40 year operational permits. The administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower ushered in the first nuclear age with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 In the early days of nuclear energy, the United States government did not allow for any private sector use of nuclear technology. In 1946, President Harry Truman signed the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 into law, which prohibited the dissemination of nuclear technology or information to other entities, both domestic and abroad. This act represented the fear that foreign nations, including allies, would gain the technology and use it against the U.S. As time went on, this fear subsided and interest from the public sector emerged, in the hope that nuclear power could provide a viable energy alternative to coal. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, also under the administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower, amended the earlier act and ushered in the first nuclear age in the U.S. This amendment allowed the private sector to use certain government information about nuclear technology and establish private energy facilities. However, these facilities would have to abide by government rules and regulations and work closely with the government regarding the plant safety, mining, storage, transportation, and the use of weapons-grade byproducts. First nuclear age There were two phases in U.S. nuclear policy. The first phase lasted from approximately 1954 to 1992. By the end of the 1980s, new plants were being built, and after 1992, there was a period of 13 years without any substantial nuclear legislation. The United States was not the first nation to create a nuclear power plant. Both Russia and England managed to establish small, limited power plants before the U.S. Although developments were taking place in the U.S. private sector before the 1954 act, it was not until mid-1956 that the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania came online. This facility, which generated 60 MW of power, and later up to 200 MW, was the first full-scale nuclear power plant in the U.S. and the world. In the coming years, more and more plants were built by regulated utility companies, often state-based. These companies would \\"put the capital cost into their rate base and amortize it against power sales. Their consumers bore the risk and paid the capital cost.\\" Some nuclear experts began to voice dissenting views about nuclear power in 1969. These scientists included Ernest Sternglass from Pittsburg, Henry Kendall from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Nobel laureate George Wald and radiation specialist Rosalie Bertell. These members of the scientific community \\"by expressing their concern over nuclear power, played a crucial role in demystifying the issue for other citizens\\", and nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970s. =Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 and NRC governing laws= The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was established under the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, a single agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, had responsibility for the development and production of nuclear weapons as well as the development and safety regulation of the civilian uses of nuclear materials. The Act of 1974 split these functions, assigning to one new agency, the Department of Energy, the responsibility for the development and production of nuclear weapons, promotion of nuclear power, and other energy- related work. Regulatory work, excluding regulation of defense nuclear facilities, it assigned to the NRC. The Act of 1974 gave the NRC its collegial structure and established its major offices. The later amendment to the act also provided protections for employees who raise nuclear safety concerns. Applications for new plants are filed with the NRC and usually take between three and five years to be approved. They require detailed reports on all reactor operations, transportation of fuels, enrichment, waste storage, mining of yellow cake, and more. Moreover, the government often \\"promises to provide incentives for building new plants through loan guarantees and tax credits,\\" backs loans or even direct funding for building, and conducts atomic research to further the field. EPA was directed to set standards for radioactive materials under Reorganization Plan No. 3 =Reorganization plans= Reorganization Plan No. 3 was an executive order by President Richard Nixon in 1970, which created the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This plan directed the EPA to establish \\"generally applicable environmental standards for the protection of the general environment from radioactive material.\\" Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1980 strengthened the executive and administrative roles of the NRC chairman, particularly in emergencies, transferring to the chairman \\"all the functions vested in the Commission pertaining to an emergency concerning a particular facility or materials ... regulated by the Commission.\\" This reorganization plan also provided that all policy formulation, policy-related rulemaking, and orders and adjudications would remain vested with the full Commission. =Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978= The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 sought to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. Among other things, it established criteria governing U.S. nuclear exports licensed by the NRC and took steps to strengthen the international safeguards system. This helped ensure the security of the United States. Countries that signed the international Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) committed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in return for U.S. knowledge and materials in the form of nuclear reactors and fuel. In addition to supplying countries with nuclear technology and materials, the U.S. would aid countries in their effort to identify domestic sources of alternative energy, consistent with economic and material resources, and in compliance with environmental standards within that country. In this way, the U.S. sought to ensure control over all information, technology, and materials relevant to nuclear activities. The Nuclear Non- proliferation Act amended the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 by establishing new criteria governing U.S. nuclear exports licensed by the NRC. Congress directed the DOE to initiate and plan the design, construction, and operation activities for expansion of uranium enrichment capacity, sufficient for domestic and foreign needs. The act specified that the nuclear non- proliferation controls would not expire annually, eliminating the need for extensions. =Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978= A Nuclear Waste Container coming out of the Department of Energy run Nevada National Security Site on public roads traveling to an unknown final location, March 2010 (Photographer Bill Ebbesen)) The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA) was designed to establish programs for the stabilization and control of mill tailings of uranium or thorium mill sites, both active and inactive, in order to prevent or minimize, among other things, the diffusion of radon into the environment. Title II of the act gives the NRC regulatory and licensing authority over mill tailing at sites under NRC license on or after January 1, 1978. This also gave the DOE the responsibility of stabilizing, disposing, and controlling uranium mill tailings and other contaminated material at twenty-four uranium mill processing sites located across ten states and at approximately 5,200 associated properties. In the 1950s and 1960s, private firms processed most uranium ore mined in the United States. After uranium mining came under federal control, companies abandoned their mill operations, leaving behind materials with potential long-term health hazards. These mills contained low-level radioactive wastes and other hazardous substances that eventually migrated to surrounding soil, groundwater, surface water, and emitted radon gas. Under the Act, the DOE established the Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action (UMTRA) Project to monitor the cleanup of uranium mill tailings. The UMTRCA gave the NRC regulatory authority over the cleanup and licensing of mill tailing facilities at sites under NRC license. The EPA had the task of developing cleanup strategies and recording standards for mills. The UMTRA used on-site disposal methods for eleven of the mills, while excavating and disposing of the wastes found at the remaining thirteen sites to remote off-site disposal locations owned by the DOE. =Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended= Nevada and California Highway Patrol Officers conduct radiological surveys and mechanical inspections on the first Nevada Test Site transuranic waste shipment at the Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Complex located on the Nevada Test Site. The shipment is destined for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant located near Carlsbad, New Mexico on January 4, 2004. A waste removal project at the former Fort Greely Nuclear Power Plant. Seen here, workers attempted to remove 1500 cubic yards of soil contaminated with extremely low levels of nuclear waste The current locations across the U.S. where nuclear waste is stored The United States originally planned to store nuclear waste at the south portal of the Yucca Mountain facility. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established both the federal government's responsibility to provide a place for the permanent disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, and the generators' responsibility to bear the costs of permanent disposal. The Act provides for extensive state, tribal, and public participation in the planning and development of permanent repositories. Amendments to the Act focused the federal government's efforts, through the DOE, on studying a possible site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, but the project was canceled in 2009. Without a long-term solution to store nuclear waste, a nuclear renaissance in the U.S. remains unlikely. Nine states have \\"explicit moratoria on new nuclear power until a storage solution emerges\\". =Low-level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985= The Low-level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 gives to states the responsibility to dispose of low-level radioactive waste generated within their borders and allows them to form compacts to locate facilities to serve a group of states. The Act provides that the facilities will be regulated by the NRC or by states that have entered into agreements with the NRC under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act. The Act also requires the NRC to establish standards for determining when radionuclides are present in waste streams in sufficiently low concentrations or quantities as to be \\"below regulatory concern.\\" =Energy Policy Act of 1992= The Energy Policy Act of 1992 had a provision under Section 801, which directed the EPA to promulgate radiation protection standards for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada. The Yucca Mountain site was then designated by the federal government to serve as the permanent disposal site for used nuclear fuel and other radioactive materials from commercial nuclear power plants and U.S. Department of Defense activities. The costs for this project have reached $13.5 billion for this expected 25-year program. However, in 2009, President Barack Obama fulfilled his campaign promise to end the shipping of nuclear waste to the site. Soon after this, the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives passed legislation to back Obama's decision, although the site is still active and being funded by the government ($196.8 million in the federal budget). Although Obama has asked the NRC to devise another long-term solution to waste storage of spent fuel rods from nuclear reactors, as yet, none have been proposed, and all radioactive waste is still being stored on-site at nuclear power plants. Currently, there still are many remaining concerns as to where storage of nuclear waste should be stored or even if a central location is required. On May 24, 2011, the Institute for Policy Studies came out with a new report ranking various spent fuel sites and contending that spent nuclear reactor fuel needs to be moved en masse into safer dry cask storage rather than the current liquid pool system. However, Harry Reid brushed aside such remarks with the contention that transport to a central site increases risks. \\"Leave it on-site where it is,\\" he said last year. \\"You don't have to worry about transporting it. Saves the country billions and billions of dollars. Currently, Congress nor the NRC or DOE have established a fixed plan for nuclear waste and is still being stored on site at each nuclear facility. Nuclear renaissance The nuclear renaissance of nuclear energy in America denotes the time period where political legislation was passed to promote the expansion of nuclear power in the United States. This second age started with the passing of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which made significant changes in nuclear policy and funding options for nuclear energy. Congress hoped this act would help encourage utility companies to install more reactors and build more nuclear plants to meet the demands of the country's growing energy needs. =Energy Policy Act of 2005= On August 8, 2005, President George W. Bush signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 into law shortly after it passed in the Senate by a 74‚Äì26 margin and in the House by a 275‚Äì156 margin. Its focus was to provide funding and tax breaks to producers and consumers alike. Although it provided many incentives to individual consumers and green energy technology, nuclear energy gained the most concessions. The following are the incentives for nuclear energy: *Production tax credit of 2.1 ¬¢/kWh from the first 6,000 MWe of new nuclear capacity in their first eight years of operation. *Federal risk insurance of $2 billion to cover regulatory delays in full-power operation of the first six advanced new plants. *Rationalized tax on decommissioning funds. *Federal loan guarantees for advanced nuclear reactors or other emission-free technologies up to 80% of the project cost. *Extension for 20 years of the Price‚ÄìAnderson Act for nuclear liability protection. *Support for advanced nuclear technology. *$1.25 billion was authorized for an advanced high-temperature reactor (Next Generation Nuclear Plant) at the Idaho National Laboratory, capable of co-generating hydrogen. Overall, more than $2 billion was provided for hydrogen demonstration projects. Called the Nuclear Power 2010 Program. In total, over almost $5 billion, as well as extensive tax breaks, were originally designated for nuclear funding, but far more would be put forth to back the loan guarantees. Within the actual legislation, the Secretary of the Interior was charged with carrying out the legislation. In the matter of new funding for next-generation reactors, the Secretary's decision should be in line with the recommendations of the Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee in the report entitled \\"A Roadmap to Deploy New Nuclear Power Plants in the United States by 2010.\\" In other sections, the Secretary was required to work with the Director of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology in the Department of Energy. This legislation jump-started the nuclear industry again by firmly establishing it as the alternate energy source that politicians wanted. Moreover, it provided financial backing for building, tax incentives, risk insurance, and repealed the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 which allowed utility companies to merge. Soon after its passage, The Washington Post critically analyzed the legislation and found that the nuclear industry received serious concessions from the government in the Environmental Policy Act of 2005. It wrote: > \\"The bill's biggest winner was probably the nuclear industry, which received > billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks covering almost every facet > of operations. There were subsidies for research into new reactor designs, > \\"fusion energy,\\" small-particle accelerators and reprocessing nuclear waste, > which would reverse current U.S. policy. Rep. Ralph Hall (R-Tex.) even > inserted a $250,000 provision for research into using radiation to refine > oil...The bill also included $2 billion for \\"risk insurance\\" in case new > nuclear plants run into construction and licensing delays. And nuclear > utilities will be eligible for taxpayer-backed loan guarantees of as much as > 80 percent the cost of their plants.\\" =Implementation of the Energy Act of 2005= Locations of new reactor cores and nuclear plants The implementation of funding, loan guarantees, and more advanced research is the sole responsibly of the DOE. In 2008, the DOE began accepting applications from utility companies for the funding of construction promised in the 2005 legislation. Originally, the loan guarantees totaled $18.5 billion for nuclear power plants, and two billion on uranium enriched plants. To provide the funding to nuclear companies, their proposed plants would first need to be approved by the NRC for the initial construction. Currently, there are 26 known applications from 17 different utility companies (18 Before Duke Power and Progress Energy Merged), 17 of which have been approved or accepted for approval by the NRC. Of these NRC approvals, there are 14 newly proposed nuclear power plants, and 21 new reactor cores to be installed in existing facilities, using five different designs (as of 2011). Furthermore, the DOE also received two applications for uranium enriched power plants. As of March 21, 2011 The NRC has expected two new applications to be filed in 2012 by two companies, Blue Castle Project in Utah and Callaway County in Missouri. If all the sites come online, 28,800 MWe per year would be added to the power grid. These companies requested loan guarantees totaling far more than the budgeted $18.5 billion. In total, they requested and additional $122 billion, which would bring the overall projected production cost to $188 billion. The uranium enriched power plants only requested a total of $4 billion, which was later accepted by both the NRC and DOE. The provided loan guarantees encourage private lenders to fund these companies. In essence, the government is promising to protect lenders against 80% of their potential loss, and legitimatizes the investment by first having the DOE review their applications. Moreover, because they are only guarantees, they are not considered government appropriations; no taxpayer dollars are spent unless the loans fall through in a failed investment. Therefore, Congressional approval is thus easier to get. Because of the enormous costs involved, the nuclear industry requested more loan guarantees from the government, totaling $100 billion. In February 2010, President Obama, who ran on a pro-nuclear platform, negotiated with the companies and added $36 billion to the budgeted $18.5 billion, bringing the total of $54.5 billion to the Presidential 2011 Budget for the DOE loans. The DOE also sought another $9 billion though other legislation for the utility companies, Southern Company and Oglethorpe Power for Plant Vogtle in Georgia, as well as three other plants for the installation of five proposed reactor cores. On April 19, 2011, The New York Times reported that NRG Energy has ended construction of the two largest proposed nuclear plants in South Texas. NRG claims that they will write off the $331 million investment as a loss and according to David Crane NRG's CEO, that unless the situation changes, the chance of continuing is ‚Äúextremely daunting and at this point not particularly likely.‚Äù. Even though \\"The plan was for the South Texas Project 3 and 4 reactors, and was identified more than two years ago by the Energy Department as one of the four candidates for loan guarantees that were authorized by the 2005 Energy Act,\\" NRG notes that there is a surplus in Texas of Natural Gas utilities and the nuclear incident in Japan has led to further funding problems for the facilities. Although NRG still plans on paying the full licensing costs to the NRC for the two proposed facilities, Crane told to the Dallas news that even if the project is resurrected, ‚Äúit will have to be fueled by somebody else's financial resources.‚Äù The halting of construction of these reactors marks the \\"second of the four to die; Calvert Cliffs 3, in Maryland, seems unlikely at this point, because Constellation Energy could not reach financial terms with the Energy Department. The department has granted a conditional loan guarantee to one project in Georgia and may give another to a project in South Carolina.\\" =Advanced Nuclear Technology Act of 2017= The House passed the Advanced Nuclear Technology Act of 2017 on January 23, 2017. The Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program will help build two new prototype small modular reactors, with up to $4 billion of government funding support. State response to nuclear expansion legislation Most states have been complicit with the utility companies' installation of nuclear plants, but some states have not. Although the federal government has the foremost control over nuclear energy regulations, safety and funding, each state government has some say about whether or not to implement nuclear energy in their state. In 1976, California passed legislation which prevented new nuclear power plants from being built until an approved means of disposing of fuel-rod waste was approved. This legislation, which was also renewed in 2005, effectively put a moratorium on nuclear power plants in California, since no fuel-rod waste measure was ever approved. Soon afterwards, other states passed similar laws limiting nuclear energy influence in their state. This California legislation was reaffirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1983 when it ruled that, \\"It did not conflict with federal authority because it addressed legitimate state issues of economic and electricity reliability concerns, and not safety.\\" Moreover, individual states also are allowed to have a public service commission that regulates electricity sales to consumers, and can either grant or deny any federal funds or loans appropriated for nuclear companies' construction in the state. They also have veto power over where nuclear waste is stored (unless overridden by Congress), such as in the case of the Yucca Mountain Waste Storage Facility. Finally, states are allowed to levy taxes on nuclear companies, which grants them power to prevent facilities from operating or encouraging new growth through tax breaks. Construction plans and cancellations Many license applications filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for proposed new reactors have been suspended or cancelled. As of October 2011, plans for about 30 new reactors in the United States have been \\"whittled down to just four, despite the promise of large subsidies and President Barack Obama‚Äôs support of nuclear power, which he reaffirmed after Fukushima\\". A reactor currently under construction in America, is at Watts Bar, Tennessee, was begun in 1973 and may be completed in 2012. Matthew Wald from The New York Times has reported that \\"the nuclear renaissance is looking small and slow\\". Generation III reactors are safer than older reactors like the GE MAC 1 at Fukushima, Vermont Yankee and other plants around the world. But after a decade in which the federal government did all it could to boost this new version of nuclear power, only one Generation III+ reactor project has been approved in the United States. Work on it has just begun in Georgia, and already \\"there are conflicts between the utility, Southern Company and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\\". Moreover, this project is going forward only because it is in one of the few regions of the United States (the Southeast) where electricity markets were not deregulated. That means \\"the utility, operating on cost-plus basis, can pass on to rate- payers all its expense over-runs\\". In 2008, the Energy Information Administration projected almost 17 gigawatts of new nuclear power reactors by 2030, but in its 2011 projections, it \\"scaled back the 2030 projection to just five\\". Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, public support for building nuclear power plants in the U.S. dropped to 43%, slightly lower than it was immediately after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, according to a CBS News poll. A survey conducted in April 2011 found that 64 percent of Americans opposed the construction of new nuclear reactors. A survey sponsored by the Nuclear Energy Institute, conducted in September 2011, found that \\"62 percent of respondents said they favor the use of nuclear energy as one of the ways to provide electricity in the United States, with 35 percent opposed\\". As of December 2011, construction by Southern Company on two new nuclear units has begun, and they are expected to be delivering commercial power by 2016 and 2017. But, looking ahead, experts see continuing challenges that will make it very difficult for the nuclear power industry to expand beyond a small handful of reactor projects that \\"government agencies decide to subsidize by forcing taxpayers to assume the risk for the reactors and mandating that ratepayers pay for construction in advance\\". On February 9, according to a Southern Company press release, the NRC voted and approved for the full issuance of the Combined Construction and Operating License for Plant Vogtle units 3 and 4. These two unites, if completed, would be the first two new reactors to be built in American in almost 30 years. According to Southern Company, they plan on utilizing $1 billion in benefits from the Department of Energy loan guarantees, production tax credits and recovering financing costs during construction. If construction proceeds on schedule, Georgia Power expects Unit 3 to begin operating in 2016 and Unit 4 in 2017. Closure of existing nuclear power plants A number of factors have led to increased pressure on the economic viability of the current fleet of nuclear power plants. The age of the existing 104 nuclear power plants means that the licenses of most need to be extended. Most of the nation's first wave of nuclear power plants came on- line between 1956 and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. Typically, they received forty-year licenses, which means most plants' licences were set to expire between approximately 1996‚Äì2014. However, many of these plants were extended by twenty years and often received power up-grades, which allowed them to run at 120% their originally intended capacity. While new plants are subject to stricter standards, these older plants often do not have to adhere to them. Considering the expensive modifications necessary (sometimes in the billions of dollars) to make many of these older nuclear plants adhere to current safety standards, many believe that these older nuclear power plants open may not be financially viable when compared to sustainable energy alternatives, such as wind and solar energy. Additionally, an AP investigation published on June 27, 2011 found that older nuclear power plants were also often built in areas that at the time the plants were built were located outside of urban areas but are now in close proximity to metropolitan cities and their suburban sprawl. The twin dangers of increased proximity and decrepit plants has raised alarm bells for concerned area residents. Public response to nuclear accidents A clean-up crew working to remove radiation at Three Mile Island Over the years, public opinion about the nuclear industry, both in the United States and worldwide, soured significantly after several nuclear-related incidents. According to Benjamin K. Sovacool, writer and professor at Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a leading environmental researcher in nuclear energy policy, in the United States alone, there were over 52 different incidents from 1959 to 2010, ranging from leaks, cooling rod malfunctions, explosions, cracks in the core, electrocutions, core overheating and other issues. These incidents led to the deaths of seven individuals and to costs estimated at $8.56 billion (inflation adjusted to 2006). President Jimmy Carter leaving Three Mile Island, shortly after the accident =1979 Three Mile Island accident= One of the largest accidents was the Three Mile Island incident in Middleton, Pennsylvania in 1979. Believed today to have been caused mostly by human error, a partial-meltdown occurred when a valve was left open, letting out substantial amounts of reactor coolant. Governor Dick Thornburgh, on the advice of NRC Chairman Joseph Hendrie, advised the evacuation \\"of pregnant women and pre-school age children...within a five-mile radius of the Three Mile Island facility.\\" The evacuation zone was extended to a 20-mile radius on Friday March 30. Within days, 140,000 people had left the area. More than half of the population within the 20 mile radius remained in that area. According to a survey conducted in April 1979, 98% of the evacuees had returned to their homes within 3 weeks. Although some debate remains, \\"several health studies found there were no long-term adverse effects on the health of the population living around Three Mile Island.\\" \\"Even though there was a release of radiation, the radiation dose to people living within 10 miles of the plant was eight millirem, and no more than 100 millirem to any single individual. Eight millirem is about equal to a chest X-ray, and 100 millirem is about a third of the average background radiation received by U.S. residents in a year. Aerial photo of Chernobyl, taken from the Russian space station, Mir =1986 Chernobyl disaster= The 1986 disaster in Chernobyl, USSR is generally considered to be the worst nuclear disaster, to date. On 25 April 1986, during routine maintenance, the crew at Chernobyl began preparing for a test of the reactor's turbine. During the test, the site experienced a loss of their main electrical power supply Because of this loss of power, the automatic shutdown mechanisms failed, and the reactor started to become unstable. As the Chernobyl operators tried to cool the rods by inserting them into the reactor core, a large power surge occurred. This is generally believed to be from a design flaw in the rods. This power surge combined with the hot fuel rods touching the water in the reactor caused \\"fuel fragmentation along with rapid steam production and an increase in pressure.\\" This led to the fuel rods to rupture, and the safety protocols for the reactor core could not withstand the damage of 3‚Äì4 of its fuel rod assemblies. The resulting pressure inside the core forced the covering plate of the reactor to dislodge itself, also \\"rupturing the fuel channels and jamming all the control rods, which by that time, were only half-way down.\\" The resulting steam from the incident caused many of the emergency cooling circuits to malfunction. This led to a large fission explosion which released radioactive materials into the atmosphere. In a period of a few seconds, a second explosion occurred which caused graphite fragments of the fuel ruptured rods to be blasted into the atmosphere, although debate still exists, some scientists believe that it was caused by \\"zirconium-steam reactions\\" Chernobyl radiation map from the 1996 CIA Handbook According to World-Nuclear.org, \\"Two workers died as a result of the explosions. The graphite (of which, about a quarter of the 1200 tons was estimated to have been ejected) and fuel became incandescent and started a number of fires, causing the main release of radioactivity into the environment. A total of about 14 EBq (14 x 1018 Bq) of radioactivity was released, over half of it being from biologically-inert noble gases.\\" Following the explosion, hundreds of tons of water per hour were poured into the reactor to douse the fires which were releasing radioactive smoke. However, this was quickly abandoned after half a day, to prevent water from flooding units 1 and 2. For the next eight days, \\"Some 5000 tons of boron, dolomite, sand, clay and lead were dropped by helicopter onto the burning core in an effort to extinguish the blaze and limit the release of radioactive particles.\\" Aside from the two initial deaths, officially, 28 more died in the following weeks. Soon after, 336,000 people were evacuated after the explosion and fire. Eradiated ash, dust, and smoke traveled across much of Europe including Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. There is a heated debate over the official number of deaths, illnesses and subsequent birth defects caused by the plant's meltdown. The estimated number of deaths potentially resulting from the accident vary enormously; the World Health Organization (WHO) suggested it could reach 4,000 while a Greenpeace report puts this figure at 200,000 or more. According to WHO, by mid-2005, only about 50 deaths could be directly associated with the disaster. A 1979 anti-nuclear protest in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania after the Three Mile Island incident =Public opinion after Chernobyl= As the west began to learn about the Chernobyl incident, fear and anxiety about nuclear energy swelled in U.S. public opinion. Even as early as 1975, anti-nuclear movement coalitions were making strides in reducing the power of the nuclear industry. The coalitions were able to instill fear in the population over the many errors in the daily operations of nuclear energy plants, causing them to be constantly shut down, and exposing the ineffectiveness in their energy production. By this point, in the late 1980s, most U.S. plants were either at or close to completion, so the Chernobyl incident did not prevent plants from coming online. However, after 1986, anti-nuclear messages were reinforced by media pictures of deformed babies and other atrocities from the fallout in the Soviet Union after Chernobyl. Citizen pressure forced the NRC to address many issues alarming the public, resulting in \\"improved reactor safety, reporting abnormal occurrences at power plants, revised radiation standards, protecting nuclear plants from sabotage, safeguarding nuclear materials from theft, licensing the export of nuclear equipment and fuel, authorizing steps to use plutonium as fuel for nuclear power, and other matters.\\" Shortly after the 1979 Three Mile Island incident, a poll by The New York Times and CBS found that public approval for building new nuclear plants dropped from 69% to 49% and opposition increased from 21% to 41%. Similarly, after the Chernobyl incident, a CBS news poll showed that 55% of those questioned believed a similar meltdown was likely to happen in the U.S. After Chernobyl, with popular fear and distrust of nuclear power, and most energy companies preferring coal-fired plants, the U.S. nuclear industry went dormant for many years, although legislation continued until 1992. Although nuclear plants were still quite active and even improving production and safety practices, construction of new plants ended in the late 1980s. This was acceptable to many utility companies, because most of the plants were licensed to operate on 20‚Äì40 year contracts, despite an unfavorable political climate. Over time, numerous polls showed a steady increase in public support and decrease in opposition, except for a temporary drop in numbers after the September 11 attacks and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. According to a Gallup poll in 2009, 59% of the public favored the use of nuclear energy, including 27% who strongly favored it, an increase from 49% since 2001. Moreover, in 2009, the Gallup poll showed 56% people believed nuclear energy was safe versus 42% who believed it was unsafe. Other polls showed an even larger gap; Bloomberg and The Los Angeles Times found that 61% supported nuclear energy, while 30% opposed in 2010. Bisconti Research Inc./Gfk Roper, market researchers commissioned by the Nuclear Energy Institute, a nuclear industry lobbying group, found that \\"A record-high 74 percent of Americans surveyed in a new national poll support nuclear energy and a similar majority of 70 percent says the United States should 'definitely build more' nuclear energy facilities [in 2010].\\" According to Ann Bisconti, PhD, \\"This unprecedented support for nuclear energy is being driven largely by people's concerns for meeting future energy demand and environmental goals, but it coincides with statements by President Obama and other national leaders who have voiced strong support for more nuclear power plants.\\" =2011 Fukushima accidents and public policy impact= What had been growing acceptance of nuclear power in the United States was eroded sharply following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, with public support for building nuclear power plants in the U.S. dropping slightly lower than it was immediately after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. Support had been at an all-time high of 69 percent in 1977, according to polling by the New York Times and CBS News. 43 percent of those polled after the Fukushima nuclear emergency said they would approve building new power plants in the United States. This represents a decline from a high of 57 percent in July 2008. Activists who were involved in the U.S. anti-nuclear movement's emergence (such as Graham Nash and Paul Gunter) suggest that Japan's nuclear crisis may rekindle an interest in the movement in the United States. The aim, they say, is \\"not just to block the Obama administration‚Äôs push for new nuclear construction, but to convince Americans that existing plants pose dangers\\". March 2011 satellite photo of the damaged reactors at the Fukushima facilities after the earthquake and tsunami. Public opinion appears to have been aroused with regard to the re-licensing application of the Diablo Canyon Power Plant. Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials had already planned to conduct a series of public meetings in January, February and March 2011 as public attention in San Luis Obispo County turned towards the question of whether the plant should be re- licensed subsequent to public disclosure of a third major fault close to the plant. Protest leaders contend that there is no safe way to store spent reactor fuel, but other community leaders such as the mayor of a nearby town dispute that contention. In a review of current trends, state Sen. Sam Blakeslee (R-San Luis Obispo), who holds a doctorate in geophysics, was quoted as stating: \\"The fundamental question is whether these facilities should be located next to active faults and whether they are operated safely\\", said. \\"With what's unfolding in Japan, why would anyone approve a permit for these plants to keep operating until every question is answered?\\" In March 2011, 600 people gathered for a weekend protest outside the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant. The demonstration was held to show support for the thousands of Japanese people who are endangered by possible radiation from the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. The New England region has a long history of anti-nuclear activism and 75 people held a State House rally on April 6, 2011, to \\"protest the region‚Äôs aging nuclear plants and the increasing stockpile of radioactive spent fuel rods at them\\". The protest was held shortly before a State House hearing where legislators were scheduled to hear representatives of the region's three nuclear plants‚ÄîPilgrim in Plymouth, Vermont Yankee in Vernon, and Seabrook in New Hampshire‚Äîtalk about the safety of their reactors in the light of the Japanese nuclear crisis. Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim have designs similar to the crippled Japanese nuclear plant. It was the anniversary of the US Three Mile Island nuclear incident which was the occasion of a substantial rally in South Korea in March 2011. South Korean environmental activists staged an anti-nuclear rally on Monday, marking the 32nd anniversary of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant accident in the United States. In Pennsylvania, \\"dozens\\" reportedly turned out for the 32nd anniversary of the Three Mile Island event. In contrast to the apparently reinvigorated protests in Europe, California and New England, the dozens of protesters gathering at the gates of the TMI plant received and in the coverage received, organizers referred only obliquely to the Fukushima incident. \\"Plants age, we knew that [industry] profit motives rather than safety motives meant there was going to be another accident‚Äù, said Gene Stilp, the organizer of the Three Mile Island protest and No Nukes Pennsylvania member, to the German Press Agency DPA. He urged the United States to discontinue producing nuclear energy, expressing doubt in U.S. nuclear power plants‚Äô preparedness for unforeseen natural disasters. \\"You can't control mother nature,\\" he reasoned.\\" The article continued to quote the U.S. Nuclear Energy Foundation to the effect that too much stock is being put into the fear surrounding Fukushima power plant. On a policy level, United States officials were wary. U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu told Congress that the Obama administration intends to hold the course on underwriting new nuclear power plants. \\"The people in the United States, U.S. territories, are in no danger‚Äù, Chu said during a Fox News Sunday broadcast. \\"It's unlikely they will be exposed to danger.\\" As the ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit 2011 Keynote Presentation, he skirted the nuclear issue and argued for a \\"longer term more measured approach\\". He emphasized lithium-ion batteries, high-speed rail, computerized design for streamlining long-haul trucks, carbon capture and other technologies, emphasizing that Europe and China may be surpassing the US in clean energy and roboticized manufacturing. The power point presentation, and a video of the presentation, are available online. The US is in the lead of venture capital financing, technology adaptation and deployment but in many areas is neck and neck with China. Many of his comments seem broadly applicable to nuclear policy, such as that \\"just because we've lost a lead doesn't mean we can't recover it.\\" ARPA-E is Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, a relatively new United States government agency set up to promote and fund research and development. Nevertheless, the nuclear disaster in Japan is likely to have major effects on US energy policy, according to billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Speaking on CNBC in March, Buffet said that the \\"United States was poised to move ahead with nuclear plans here, but the events in Japan derailed that\\". \\"Radiation terrifies people\\", Buffett told CNBC. \\"It's unseen, there's no way to quantify sort of the limits of what might happen from it so I would say that I would be very surprised if there's any nuclear facilities built in the United States for a long time.\\" Moreover, Japan's government and TEPCO response to the Fukushima Daiichi incident has been criticized worldwide, and Gregory B. Jaczko, Chairman of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, broke with ordinary protocols by overruling the Japanese with regard to the public exclusion zone. As a result of the harshly criticized Japanese handling of the crisis, there has been a scramble by the EU to reform nuclear policy. Some commentators expect that US will have a greater influence on nuclear policy worldwide.

The site is oval shaped and is defined by a triple bank on the northern side with a double out-turned bank on the southern side. Background Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated \\"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction\\".

Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. 363 (1971), is a United States Supreme Court decision in an in rem case on procedures following the seizure of imported obscene material. A 6‚Äì3 court held that the federal statute governing the seizures was not in violation of the First Amendment as long as the government began forfeiture proceedings within 14 days of the seizure. The case began with the seizure of the photographs, depicting various sexual positions, from Milton Luros, a Southern California publisher who was returning from Europe. He had intended to use them to illustrate a volume of the Kama Sutra, or failing that, to keep them for his own personal use. A district court panel, guided by the Court's Freedman v. Maryland decision of several years before, rejected his claims that the First Amendment allowed citizens to import obscene material, but found the statute unconstitutional due to the lack of time limits and ordered the Customs Service to return the images to Luros. The government appealed directly to the Supreme Court. Justice Byron White wrote for the majority, distinguishing the case from Freedman v. Maryland, which had also involved time limits, by noting that it was a federal statute rather than a state one and therefore the Court could give it an authoritative construction. John Marshall Harlan and Potter Stewart also wrote concurring opinions expanding on aspects of the majority holding. Stewart did not agree with the majority that the ban on personal importation of obscene material was consistent with Stanley v. Georgia. The dissenting justices wrote two opinions. Hugo Black and William O. Douglas took issue with every aspect of the holding, believing the government had no power to regulate obscenity. Thurgood Marshall agreed with them and Stewart that the blanket importation ban was constitutional. That issue would be reconsidered in a similar case two years later, United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film. The case would have little impact on the future development of obscenity law. It has, however, been cited as the first forfeiture case to deal with the question of time limits, and also reaffirmed a principle by which the Court avoids dealing with constitutional questions when it can through alternative constructions. Background of the case For most of American history, literary and artistic works depicting or even alluding to sexual acts and topics or using profane language, had been banned from publication or distribution, often by both confiscation of the works themselves and criminal prosecution of all individuals involved, following the traditions of English common law on obscenity and statutes at the state and federal levels. At the same time, demand for such materials continued, and the laws were often widely flouted. No defendant or claimant in such an action had ever persuaded a court to entertain the argument that the First Amendment's guarantees of free speech and free expression barred them. That began to change during the 20th century, in response to social and cultural trends of greater tolerance for literature and art that depicted such proscribed material. In the landmark 1933 case United States v. One Book Called Ulysses, Judge John M. Woolsey of the Southern District of New York ruled that James Joyce's novel Ulysses, chapters of which had been held obscene over a decade earlier when published in a literary review, could not be barred from the United States purely on the basis of its language and content without considering its literary merit.United States v. One Book Called Ulysses, 5 F.Supp. 182 (S.D.N.Y., 1933). Second Circuit judges Learned Hand and Augustus Hand upheld Woolsey on appeal,United States v. One Book Entitled Ulysses, by James Joyce, 72 F.2d 705 (2nd Cir., 1934) and the book, considered a masterpiece of modernist literature, could be freely published and sold. Censorship battles continued in the next decades over other works of literature and art, such as Lady Chatterley's Lover, expanding to include films. In 1957, the Supreme Court finally considered a case arising from an obscenity prosecution, Roth v. United States.Roth v. United States, . William Brennan wrote for a 6‚Äì3 majority that upheld the criminal conviction but abandoned the century-old Hicklin test in favor of a narrower definition of obscenity. It did not settle the issue, however, and the Warren Court had to hear more cases arising from subsequent prosecutions in the next decade, during which the Sexual Revolution began a more direct challenge to social mores on the issue. In some of those cases, like Memoirs v. Massachusetts, the justices realized their Roth standard was inadequate, but they could not agree on a new one.Memoirs v. Massachusetts, . The search for a workable legal definition of obscenity led to Potter Stewart's famous line \\"I know it when I see it\\", in Jacobellis v. Ohio.Jacobellis v. Ohio, . Other Court decisions restricted the scope under which obscenity could be suppressed. Freedman v. Maryland held that local film boards could not ban films, effectively eliminating them, and had to approve a film within a specified time.Freedman v. Maryland, . In Stanley v. Georgia, the Court held that possession of obscene material in the privacy of the home was constitutionally protected as well.Stanley v. Georgia, . Underlying dispute In October 1969, Milton Luros, a former illustrator turned adult magazine publisher, returned to Los Angeles from a trip to Europe. Customs agents at Los Angeles International Airport searched his luggage and found 37 photographs depicting naked heterosexual couples having sexual intercourse in different positions. They confiscated them pursuant to Title 18, Section 1305, of the United States Code, a federal law passed in 1930 absolutely prohibiting the importation of any obscene material, but they did not arrest Luros for attempting to violate the law. He later revealed he had planned to use the photos to illustrate a copy of the Kama Sutra, the classic Indian treatise on human sexuality.United States v. Thirty-seven (37) Photographs, 390 F.Supp. 36, 37 (C.D. Cal., 1970).United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, , 366, (1971), White, J. Two weeks later, lawyers with the office of United States Attorney William Matthew Byrne, Jr. filed for forfeiture. A week later, Luros filed a counterclaim. He argued that the images were not obscene, and he claimed that both the seizure and the statute authorizing it were unconstitutional. The seizure had violated his First Amendment rights since the pictures were meant to be viewed by adults only within the privacy of their own homes, which the Supreme Court had recently held was protected activity in Stanley. As for the statute, not only was it too vague to be enforceable, it allowed seizures prior to an adversary hearing and did not require that the forfeiture action be commenced within a specified time period, both violating due process requirements, Luros argued. In district court The law provided for contested forfeitures to be heard by a panel of three judges, similar to an appellate hearing. Since Luros had not been criminally charged himself, the case was an in rem action, with the photographs themselves as the defendants. Stanley Barnes from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals was seated along with Central District of California judges Jesse William Curtis Jr. and Warren John Ferguson. They heard arguments from Luros's attorney Stanley Fleishman and the assistant U.S. attorneys representing Byrne's office, and they then issued their decision in January 1970. Ferguson wrote for the panel, which unanimously ruled for Luros. After rejecting the publisher's argument that Stanley absolutely covered the photographs, since he had admitted to planning a commercial use for them, the judge considered the other element of the First Amendment argument: the right of other adults to receive the book. While quoting from William Brennan's concurrence in Lamont v. Postmaster General to demonstrate his agreement that it was a fundamental right,Lamont v. Postmaster General, , 308, (1965), Brennan, J., concurring, quoted at 309 F.Supp at 37 he nevertheless found it inapplicable to the case, since ruling otherwise would have an economically disparate impact: \\"The First Amendment cannot be construed to permit those who have funds for foreign travel to bring back constitutionally protected literature while prohibiting its access by the less affluent.\\"309 F.Supp. at 38. Instead, Ferguson found the due-process claims much more relevant. Freedman had held that any statutory process by which obscene material was seized and potentially suppressed must explicitly require a hearing within a brief period of the time of seizure. While Luros admitted that the government had moved to hold a forfeiture hearing within a reasonable time period of the photographs' seizure, it still took 76 days until the court had heard the case. \\"All concede that under present statutory procedures it could not have been accomplished any sooner.\\" The delay was also not necessarily due to bureaucratic delays. Ferguson observed that \\"Section 1305 does not prohibit customs agents from long delaying judicial determination. The First Amendment does not permit such discretion.\\" Having reached that conclusion, he declined to consider Luros's other arguments and ordered the photographs returned following a 30-day stay to allow the government time to appeal if it wished to do so. Before the Court The government appealed directly to the Supreme Court, as statute allowed it to do so, and was granted certiorari. The Court heard oral arguments almost a year later, on the same day as United States v. Reidel, another case directly appealed from the Central District of California challenging, under Stanley as well, the prohibitions against mailing obscene material to willing adult recipients. Fleishman argued for Luros and the photographs again. Solicitor General Erwin Griswold appeared for the government. Decision The Court handed down its decision in the case in May 1971, on the same day as Reidel. In both cases, the majorities had declined to extend Stanley to cover the distribution of obscene material. Justice White wrote both opinions. In Thirty-seven Photographs, two of the justices who had joined the majority, John Marshall Harlan and Potter Stewart, also wrote concurrences. Hugo Black and William O. Douglas, both of whom had long made it clear they believed the government had no business forbidding obscenity, wrote an extensive dissent critical of all elements of White's opinion. Thurgood Marshall wrote a separate concurrence in Reidel that also explained his reasons for dissenting in Thirty-seven Photographs. =Majority opinion= Unlike the situation in Freedman, Justice White observed, the challenged statute was federal, rather than state. Thus, \\"it is possible to construe the section to bring it in harmony with constitutional requirements.\\"Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. at 368. He reviewed the legislative history of Section 1305 and found that senators during debate had been concerned about putting so much power in the hands of a low-level official. As a result, the bill was amended to allow for review.Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. at 369‚Äì71. At that time, no time requirement was included. Perhaps those senators, Justice White speculated, had not seen a need to do so, but, nearly four decades later, there was. In some cases, months had passed between the seizure and the hearing. \\"[F]idelity to Congress' purpose dictates that we read explicit time limits into the section,\\" he wrote. Otherwise, the only possible resolution to the case was to hold the statute unconstitutional, but that, too, had been prevented by a severability provision. Based on other such statutes with a time-limit provision, Justice White found 14 days to be an apt requirement.Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. at 371‚Äì73. Justice White did not find the analogy to Stanley convincing. That case did not support a right to import obscene materials for private use. \\"[A] port of entry is not a traveler's home. His right to be let alone neither prevents the search of his luggage nor the seizure of unprotected, but illegal, materials when his possession of them is discovered during such a search.\\"Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. at 376. =Concurrences= Justices Harlan and Stewart had also joined the first part of White's opinion, creating the 14-day rule from Freedman. Harlan chose to defend the statute from Luros's claim that it was overbroad, which the district court had not ruled on and so did not have to be addressed by the majority. \\"It is incontestable that 19 U.S.C. ¬ß 1305(a) is intended to cover, at the very least, importation of obscene materials for commercial purposes,\\" he wrote. \\"Since the parties stipulated that the materials were imported for commercial purposes, Luros cannot claim that his primary conduct was not intended to be within the statute's sweep.\\" Only a holding that Stanley covered the importation of obscene material for private use would force a reconsideration of the constitutionality of the entire statute, due to the severability clause, and Harlan thought that should be avoided since it was not necessary to decide that question in order to resolve the case.Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. at 377‚Äì78, Harlan, J., concurring. Stewart's short concurrence differed with Justice White and the other justices over the applicability of the Stanley holding to the importation of obscene material for private use. \\"The terms of the statute appear to apply to an American tourist who, after exercising his constitutionally protected liberty to travel abroad, returns home with a single book in his luggage, with no intention of selling it or otherwise using it, except to read it,\\" he wrote. \\"If the Government can constitutionally take the book away from him as he passes through customs, then I do not understand the meaning of Stanley v. Georgia\\".Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. at 378‚Äì79, Stewart, J., concurring. =Dissents= At the beginning of his dissent, Justice Black reiterated his opposition to the concept of obscenity as completely beyond the reach of the Constitution. \\"In my view, the First Amendment denies Congress the power to act as censor and determine what books our citizens may read and what pictures they may watch.\\" He found it most objectionable that the majority had returned to that aspect of the Roth holding, since the Court's own jurisprudence since then had found the concept difficult to define. \\"After Roth, our docket and those of other courts have constantly been crowded with cases where judges are called upon to decide whether a particular book, magazine, or movie may be banned. I have expressed before my view that I can imagine no task for which this Court of lifetime judges is less equipped to deal.\\" As such, he had thought the Court was beginning to abandon Roth. Since it had instead affirmed it in both of the cases that it decided that day, he warned that: Justice Black turned to specific issues with the majority. He had not found its explanation of how the district court had erred in applying Stanley to the importation of images for private use. As a general matter, he wrote, \\"[t]he mere act of importation for private use can hardly be more offensive to others than is private perusal in one's home. The right to read and view any literature and pictures at home is hollow indeed if it does not include a right to carry that material privately in one's luggage when entering the country.\\" Nor did he find the majority's specific reason, that travelers returning from abroad and their luggage are routinely subject to search, compelling since it was just as likely that police would search a private home for reasons unrelated to suspected possession of obscene material.As had occurred in Stanley.Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. at 380‚Äì81. Perhaps, he speculated, the majority had assumed, without actually saying so, that the import ban was necessary to prevent the distribution of obscene material through domestic commercial channels. However, an analogous argument had been specifically rejected in Stanley, and, as a general principle, the Court had held in other First Amendment cases that a restriction on protected rights that served a state interest had to be narrowly tailored to that interest. Since the pluralityBecause Harlan had indicated he merely concurred in the Stanley analysis without joining it, and Stewart did not concur with it at all, that section of the majority opinion is considered a plurality, since it does not command a majority of the justices. did not make that distinction, \\"I can only conclude that, at least four members of the Court would overrule Stanley. Or perhaps, in the future, that case will be recognized as good law only when a man writes salacious books in his attic, prints them in his basement, and reads them in his living room.\\"By the 21st century, three decades after Thirty-seven Photographs was decided, this was actually possible and practical.Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. at 381‚Äì82. Justice Black also criticized the imposition of the 14-day time limit on a textualist basis, an approach he commonly employed. The majority should have simply found the statute unconstitutional for lacking one and affirmed the district court on that basis, leaving the actual revision of Section 1305 to Congress. As it was, the Court's action \\"represents a seizure of legislative power that we simply do not possess under the Constitution.\\"Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. at 382‚Äì83. There were also specific problems with that action in the instant case. Justice Black also argued that the legislative history of the statute's adoption, which the majority had used as a basis for imposing this limit, did not, in fact, support its action, since it referred to a version of the statute that was never actually adopted. In previous obscenity-related cases, where the Court had held that the statutes could be amended to bring them into constitutional compliance, it had declined to do so. Nor had it let severability provisions stop such holdings.Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. at 383‚Äì87. Since he could not find the time limit justified by either previous jurisprudence or the legislative history of the statute, Justice Black suspected the majority was deriving them from the First Amendment itself. If that was so, he found it: Marshall's dissent, at Reidel, distinguished that case from Thirty-seven Photographs by noting that the delivery of obscene material via the mail presented the hazard that children or unwilling recipients would be exposed to it, which the state had an interest in preventing, whereas only Luros would be exposed to the photographs. \\"[T]he seized items were then in his purely private possession and threatened neither children nor anyone else.United States v. Reidel, , 361, (1973), Marshall, J., dissenting. Subsequent jurisprudence The Supreme Court got a chance to reconsider Thirty-seven Photographs very quickly. While it reached a broader, similar conclusion, the law was eventually repealed, and there were no further cases. The case has also been cited for its procedural holdings in other forfeiture cases. =United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film= Shortly after the case had been heard in district court, another, very similar seizure action started the next case that would allow the Supreme Court to revisit the issues of Thirty- seven Photographs, with a key difference. In April 1970, a California resident named Paladini was searched by customs agents in Los Angeles upon returning from Mexico. As they had with Luros, they found obscene material in his luggage, described later as \\"movie films, color slides, photographs, and other printed and graphic material\\". He, too, was not charged, and challenged the forfeiture.United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, , 125, (1973), Burger, C.J. Another in rem case, United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Super 8MM. Film et al, began. This time, the claimant insisted the subject materials were intended for purely private and personal use, and they asserted, as Luros had, that Stanley permitted such importation. A similar panel relied on its predecessor's opinion in Thirty-seven Photographs and likewise held Section 1305 unconstitutional, not just for the procedural shortcomings but as a violation of the First Amendment on its face. The government appealed to the Supreme Court, which decided to hear what was now United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film. Justices Black and Harlan, both of whom died shortly thereafter, retired before the October 1971 term began. With their seats vacant, the case would be argued twice, along with four other obscenity- related cases the Court had decided to take. William Rehnquist had been seated to replace Harlan before the January hearing, but the delay in seating Lewis Powell to bring the Court back to full strength delayed a rehearing into the next term, to November 1972. The decisions in all five cases were announced on the same day at the end of the term, since one was Miller v. California, in which a majority had agreed on a new standard of obscenity, superseding Roth. It governed the application of the other cases, including Reels of Film, which was remanded to the district court to determine if the materials met the new standard of obscenity, which relied on contemporary community standards rather than a national one. Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote for a 5‚Äì4 majority, including the two new justices, that Stanley was still inapplicable to the importation of obscene material. \\"To allow such a claim would be not unlike compelling the Government to permit importation of prohibited or controlled drugs for private consumption as long as such drugs are not for public distribution or sale.\\"Reels of Film, 413 U.S. at 128. Justice Douglas's much lengthier dissent reviewed the history of obscenity in the United States, noting it appeared not to have been vigorously prosecuted in Colonial America, if at all, and thus an obscenity exemption could not be presumed to have been implicit in the First Amendment as the Miller majority had suggested. \\"[I]t is ironic to me that, in this Nation, many pages must be written and many hours spent to explain why a person who can read whatever he desires\\", he wrote, \\"may not without violating a law carry that literature in his briefcase or bring it home from abroad.\\"Reels of Film, 413 U.S. at 137, Douglas, J., dissenting. William Brennan wrote a shorter dissent, joined by Justices Stewart and Marshall, agreeing with the district court that Section 1305 was unconstitutional.Reels of Film, 413 U.S. at 138, Brennan, J., dissenting. =Other cases= Most later jurisprudence that has relied on Thirty-seven Photographs has referred to its requirement of a time limit for forfeiture proceedings. Within six months, the Tenth Circuit heard and decided Sarkisian v. United States,Alternatively known by the in rem name United States v. One Package of Antiques and Indian Jewelry. in which the Customs Service had refused to return a parcel containing jewelry purchased in Lebanon, claiming that it had been fraudulently misrepresented as antique. As in Thirty-seven Photographs, the statute authorizing the seizure set no time limit for formal proceedings to begin, and the court was unconvinced by government attempts to distinguish the case for lack of an obscenity allegation. \\"The withholding of Sarkisian's property under the circumstances before us presents a constitutional claim of no less dignity than that arising from the dirty pictures. We thus apply the same principles\\", wrote Judge Oliver Seth. It remanded the case with instructions to return the package.Sarkisian v. United States, 472 F.2d 468, 472 (10th Cir., 1973). Several years later, Judge Walter Herbert Rice of the Southern District of Ohio described Thirty-seven Photographs as \\"the earliest significant treatment of delay in a forfeiture context.\\"May v. United States, 515 F.Supp. 600 (S.D. Ohio, 1981) It has also been a touchstone case for the Court's standard of review. Later cases cited it as reaffirming the principle by which the Court avoids ruling on the constitutionality of a statute if it can find a way to construe the statute such that the constitutional question is avoided.The language quoted where the case is cited to this effect‚Äî\\"It is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the constitutional question may be avoided\\"‚Äîis actually from a much earlier case, Crowell v. Benson, , 62 (1932), Hughes, C.J. The Court itself quoted this section in Lorillard v. Pons, (, 577, (1978), Marshall, J.). The Third Circuit's citation of this in Cox v. Keystone Carbon Co., 861 F.2d 390, 393 note 4 (3rd Cir.,1988), is the most notable lower-court reference. In New York v. Ferber, its landmark 1982 holding that child pornography was outside First Amendment protection, the Court clarified that under Thirty-seven Photographs, if such a construction was impossible but the statute was severable, only the unconstitutional portions should be invalidated.New York v. Ferber, , 769 note 24, (1982), White, J. \\"Furthermore, if the federal statute is not subject to a narrowing construction and is impermissibly overbroad, it nevertheless should not be stricken down on its face; if it is severable, only the unconstitutional portion is to be invalidated.\\" See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 402 *List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Burger Court *List of United States Supreme Court cases involving the First Amendment Notes References External links United States v. 37 Photographs, 402 U.S. 363 (1971) 1971 in United States case law United States Supreme Court cases United States obscenity case law United States statutory interpretation case law United States civil forfeiture case law United States in rem cases United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court ","title":"United States v.

The text of the carol was published for the first time in a collection of ancient carols, published in either 1875 or 1876 by Dom G. Legeay.

Big Boa is a brutal, unfeeling taskmaster who whips the unruly Cobra Troopers into shape, as these soldiers are not motivated by patriotism, unit loyalty, honor, or sense of duty. Cobra Troopers say he has a voice like a bullhorn, fists the size of frozen turkeys, and the disposition of a bear with a headache. Big Boa appears in Devil's Due G.I. Joe series. He fights Bazooka, one of four Joes who had just discovered Cobra's influence in the small town of Delhi Hills.

Akamoto battles the Shogun's Generals through the four regions of the afterlife, as well as meeting the gods of each region: General Romeoka and the goddess Sakura, whom he is infatuated with, in the land of Eternal Blossoms; the ill-tempered and foul- mouthed Ikkaku and the chaotic Lightning god Raiden in the Land of Summer; the wise General Higure and Wind God Fujin, in the Land of the Golden Harvest. Unlike the others Higure recognizes Akamoto for who he is and attempts to guide him, warning of a greater danger. Defeating them Akamoto enters Kurokawa's region, the Land of Frozen Fortunes. Confronting Kurokawa it is revealed that he and the Ice Goddess Yuki plan to usurp the Shogun, and that Yuki slowed Akamoto's arrival, allowing Kurokawa to arrive and steal his identity. Akamoto defeats them and the Shogun arrives, revealing that he knew of their treachery and had been using them to test Akamoto. Punishing the two the Shogun explains that he intends to make Akamoto his successor challenging him to defeat him and take his place. After his defeat the Shogun passes the title onto Akamoto, revealing the eternity of misery it entails: being hated, plotted against, and enduring countless meetings. The Shogun prepares to happily pass on, but is grabbed by Akamoto. Saying that he will need help, he eats his skull absorbing his power and becoming the new Shogun. In the bonus Forbidden Isle levels, the player takes control of an unnamed samurai. Recently arrived to the land of the dead the samurai, a lieutenant of Akamoto in life, begins looking for him. Tresspasing on the island the samurai is forced to fight through the island's guard, led by Kurokawa, whom Akamoto has charged with watching over the region. Defeating Kurokawa, the samurai pushes on to find Akamoto, who has lost his way to the bureaucratic side of the Shogun position. Meeting Akamoto, the samurai reveals himself to actually be his wife Yoko, having entered the samurai afterlife after leading her late husband's army and becoming a warrior. Akamoto is relieved that she is not a rival out to take his position, however she continues their battle, believing he has grown too relaxed and needs a challenge. The two reconcile mid battle agreeing not to fight any longer.

The story is set in the 1960s through the 2000s in Paris, Reims, Montreal, Prague and London. While not a musical, the characters use musical 'narration' and 'dialogues' throughout the film. Plot In the 1960s, Madeline marries Jaromil and gives birth to their daughter V√©ra. Thirty years later, V√©ra falls in love with a musician Henderson. Cast Production The film is produced by Why Not Productions. The project received 228,000 euro in support from the Ile-de-France Regional Support Fund for Technical Film and Audiovisual Industries. Apart from the French investment, 20% of the 6.8-million-euro budget came from the United Kingdom and 10% from the Czech Republic. Filming started on 18 October 2010. Release The film had its world premiere as the closing film of the 2011 Cannes Film Festival on 22 May 2011. It was released in France through Le Pacte on 17 August 2011.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, writing, \\"The movie is at its lightest, most charming and most persuasive in the 60s; as it approaches the present, something inescapably preposterous weighs it down, though Honor√© carries it off with some flair.\\" Sheri Linden of Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"In the central roles, real-life mother and daughter Catherine Deneuve and Chiara Mastroianni bring a chemical spark to the onscreen dynamics, and their compelling performances anchor the story's novelistic sprawl, especially when it falters or loses focus.\\" She added, \\"The story lines are thin, but the melancholy that Honor√© and his cast tap into is vibrant, particularly in Deneuve's portrayal of a woman who has embraced romantic daring and can observe her younger self without regret.\\" Alison Willmore of The A.V. Club gave the film a grade of B, calling it \\"rambling, messy, but ultimately charming\\". Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter commented that \\"Location work everywhere is top notch and the smart decision was made not to turn this into a fashion parade through the decades but rather to go for a timeless look in the clothes, furniture and d√©cor.\\" References External links * 2011 films British films Czech films French films Czech-language films English- language films French-language films 2011 romantic drama films French romantic drama films British romantic drama films Films directed by Christophe Honor√© Films set in London Films set in Paris Films set in Prague Films shot in Paris Films shot in London Films shot in Montreal Films shot in the Czech Republic 2011 drama films ","title":"Beloved (2011 film)"},{"id":"31285026","text":"Lim Ding Wen Lim Ding Wen (ÊûóÈºéÊñá, born September 21, 1999) is a young programmer living in Singapore.

At that moment the only Megion oil - field was discovered and three oil wells were opened. As primary task V.A. Abazarov determined the steady raising of the rate of exploring and preparation of oil reserves. He organized the administration for a certain program for construction of developed wooden habitation, social and cultural objects and industrial base. Megion expedition was increasing the rate of drilling with every year. Vatinskoe, Severo ‚Äì Pokurskoe, Aganskoe, Nizhnevartovskoe oil fields were opened. In 1965 famous Samotlor oil field was discovered. In 1967 large Varyeganskoe oil and gas field was opened, in 1968 ‚Äì Malo ‚Äì Tchernogorskoe, in 1970 ‚Äì Bolshe ‚Äì Thcernogorskoe, Tyumenskoe and Severo ‚Äì Varyeganskoe. All in all, Megion geologists have opened more than 135 oil and gas deposits. In 1970 the group of Megion expedition was awarded the order ‚ÄúSign of honour‚Äù. In the same year Vladimir Alekseevich Abazarov, together with L.N. Kabaev, I.I. Nesterov, F.K. Salmanov, V.G. Smirnov, A.D. Storoshev, was awarded Lenin prize for discovery of new deposits in the middle Ob side and fast preparation of industrial reserves. Rates of developing of Samotlor were increasing with every year. Great changes took place from 1971 to 1974 under V.A. Abazarov being the director of geological department ‚ÄúMegionneft‚Äù. He was appreciated for his fairness and consistency, analytical mind and strong will. In 1975‚Äì1976 he was the head of Karskaya oil exploring expedition. Later, in 1976‚Äì1977, he was the director of technology section of industrial union\\"Obneftegasgeologiya\\". In 1977-1980 V.A. Abazarov became the deputy director of drilling department of industrial association ‚ÄúNizhnevartovskneftegas‚Äù, in 1980‚Äì1981 ‚Äì he was the vice ‚Äì president of oil and gas department ‚ÄúBelozerneft‚Äù. From 1983 to 1992 he was the head of Yuzchno ‚Äì Tarkosalinskaya and Yamal expeditions. Abazarov is remembered not only for the discoveries of oil fields in interior of Tyumen North, but for his justice in spite of harshness. ‚ÄúHe worked selflessly, without being sorry of forces and time. In spite of any difficulty, he always was on his post. He could combine dislike to grabbers and dodgers with trust and friendliness to people.‚Äù He continued to work a lot, even when he retired on a pension in 1992. He was the president of Union of creators of oil and gas complex in Western Siberia (1997‚Äì2002), which was founded on his initiative for ‚Äúacceptance of concrete measures for improvement of vital conditions of founders of the Tyumen oil and gas complex..., preservation and development of spiritual, moral and cultural values and traditions‚Äù. Vladimir Alekseevich Abazarov died on 13 May 2003. He was buried in Tyumen on Tchervishevskoe graveyard.

Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS. Ashmole 208, f. 207r. The Book of Plays (full title in original spelling The Bocke of Plaies and Notes therof p formans for Common Pollicie) is a section of a manuscript by the London astrologer Simon Forman that records his descriptions of four plays he attended in 1610-11 and the morals he drew from them. It is now in the Bodleian Library catalogued as MS Ashmole 208.J. H. P. Pafford, \\"Simon Forman's Bocke of Plaies\\" in Review of English Studies New Series 10 (Aug. 1959), 289-91. The document is noteworthy for being the only preserved eyewitness accounts of Shakespeare‚Äôs plays on the professional stage during his lifetime: Macbeth at the Globe Theatre on 20 April 1610;Scholars, critics, and editors usually assume that this \\"1610\\" is a mistake for \\"1611,\\" and that the whole of the Book of Plays most likely dates from that year. See: E.K. Chambers, William Shakespeare, Oxford: Oxford UP, 1930, 2: 337. The Winter's Tale at the Globe on 15 May 1611; and Cymbeline, date and theatre not specified. The fourth play described by Forman is a Richard II acted at the Globe on 30 April 1611; but from its description it covered the king‚Äôs earlier reign, and so was not Shakespeare's Richard II, first published 14 years earlier. The notes were discovered in Forman‚Äôs extensive papers in or before 1832 by Philip Bliss or William H. Black. Joseph Hunter mentioned that Bliss had drawn his attention to them in the summer of 1832, and Black noted them on a proof-sheet of his catalogue of the Ashmole manuscripts.Pafford, 289-90. Suspicions of forgery The description of MacBeth mentions characters \\"Ridinge\\", a detail that critics with a knowledge of Jacobean dramaturgy and stagecraft had found startling,Scragg, Leah. \\"MacBeth on Horseback\\" in Shakespeare Survey 26 (1973), 81-88; 86. although subsequent scholars, commenting on a horse evidently present on stage in another play, have opined that it is within the realm of possibility.Weiss, Lawrence. Thomas of Woodstock. \\"Egan vs. Elliott and Valenza\\". Online summary report. 29 Aug. 2011. SHAKSPER: The Global Electronic Shakespeare Conference. P. 11, n. 20. Also the idea that Forman, a worldly-wise and canny operator, would spend his time drawing sententious morals from the stage plays he saw struck some modern critics as psychologically false, and in the 20th century suspicion emerged that the Book of Plays was one of John Payne Collier's forgeries, although Collier, who announced his discovery of the document in 1836, claimed to have used a transcription made for him by an unnamed \\"gentleman\\" (identified in 1841 by James Halliwell as W[illiam] H. Black, who catalogued the Ashmolean Collection).Kassell, Lauren. Medicine and Magic in Elizabethan London: Simon Forman, Astrologer, Alchemist, and Physician, Oxford: Oxford UP, 2005: 2, n10. In 1933 Samuel A. Tannenbaum published an elaborate case arguing that the section was a forgery. Much of Tannenbaum's case centered on palaeographic arguments about the manuscript's handwriting.Samuel A. Tannenbaum, Shakspearian Scraps and Other Elizabethan Fragments, New York: Columbia UP, 1933. An earlier examiner of the manuscript had transcribed the section title as \\"A Book of Places\\", and Tannenbaum theorised that the section originally contained descriptions of places in England that Forman had visited and that Collier had altered the title and either inserted forged leaves or had chemically removed the ink for his forgeries. However, subsequent scholars examined the leaves under ultraviolet light and found no trace of forgery or rebinding. In 1945, W. W. Greg criticised Tannenbaum's scholarship and J. Dover Wilson and R. W. Hunt both examined the manuscript without finding any evidence of tampering. It was also learned that Tannebaum, who had not examined the manuscript but relied instead on photostats, had compared the section with writing Forman had done ten years earlier instead of using a control from the same period. Finally, the record Halliwell had found identifying Black as the librarian that had made a transcript of the Forman manuscript for Collier in 1832 was rediscovered, confirming that Collier never had access to the manuscript.Altick, Richard D.

Their abductors are believed to have been a gang of Lebanese and Syrian nationals headed by fugitive Darwish Khanjar, who transferred the cyclists to a second gang, Harakat al-Nahda wal-Islah (\\"The Movement for Renewal and Reform\\"), led by Wael Abbas. All seven cyclists were released in Lebanon on 14 July 2011, after 113 days in captivity. They were flown back to Estonia early the following morning. Wael Abbas was arrested by Syrian security forces in November. On 2 February 2013, the Lebanese army was the victim of an armed ambush in the northeastern town of Arsal, during which three officers were killed as it was seeking to arrest Khaled Homayed, who is believed to have been behind the kidnapping. Homayed has been active in the Free Syrian Army since the beginning of the Syrian Civil War.http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2013/Feb-01/204650-army- patrol-ambushed-in-east-lebanon-several-casua.ashx#axzz2JflCcR28 Background Above (in red): The Zahl√© District of the Beqaa Governorate, Lebanon On Tuesday, 15 March 2011, a group of seven Estonian cyclists landed in Beirut, Lebanon, whence they cycled north into Syria. Six days later, on Wednesday, 23 March 2011, they crossed back into Lebanon via the Masnaa Border Crossing. Shortly thereafter they were abducted by armed men near the city of Zahl√©, east of Beirut. The kidnappers were reported to be masked and to be driving two white vans and a black Mercedes with the license plates removed. One of the cyclists, Martin Metspalu, is a dentist; another, Andre Pukk, a cycling enthusiast; and a third, Jaan Jagom√§gi, a software engineer with Estonian geopositioning software company Regio. The remaining four were identified by Estonian officials as Madis Paluoja, August Tillo, Priit Raistik, and Kalev K√§osaar. Diplomacy and search efforts Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Paet established an Intra-Institutional Crisis Committee on 23 March in order to coordinate Estonia's activities in relation to the incident and provide regular updates to President Toomas Hendrik Ilves. On 24 March the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs convened a press conference where it was publicly confirmed that seven Estonian citizens who had been cycling in Syria were kidnapped the previous afternoon after having crossed into Lebanon. Foreign Affairs Minister Paet told reporters that Estonia would be dispatching a special diplomat to work with local authorities in Lebanon. Lebanese security forces focused their search efforts on the Beqaa Valley region, an area known for its lawlessness and rivalries between clans over control of hashish production and trade. Some media were quick to suggest that the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ‚Äì General Command (PFLP-GC) was behind the kidnapping, owing to its dominant influence in the area. One Lebanese newspaper speculated that the kidnapping may have been related to Israel's abduction of Palestinian engineer Dirar Abu Seesi in Ukraine a few weeks earlier. The Daily Star, quoting an unnamed source, reported that Lebanese security officials were considering the possibility that the cyclists may have been smuggled back into Syria. A second source quoted by the newspaper proposed that a pro-Syrian group such as Fatah al- Intifada or an organization loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi may have been behind the abduction. The PFLP-GC and Fatah al-Intifada both denied any involvement in the incident. Estonian foreign minister Urmas Paet arrived in Lebanon early Monday, 28 March, for face-to-face deliberations with Lebanese authorities. After meeting with senior Lebanese officials, including President Michel Suleiman and Lebanese Armed Forces chief General Jean Kahwaji, Paet said it was still not possible to determine who the cyclists' abductors were. The Lebanese daily Ya Libnan reported that security sources posited a connection between the kidnapping and the bombing of a Syriac Orthodox church in Zahle on 27 March. Arrests, raids and ransom demand On 29 March, Lebanese security forces, acting on information obtained from arrests made earlier in the week in connection with the abduction, were led to identify the Estonians' captors as a gang of Lebanese and Syrian nationals led by fugitive Darwish Khanjar, known to be involved in smuggling and other criminal activities. Shortly after midnight, Lebanon's Internal Security Forces engaged the captors at several locations in the vicinity of Majdal Anjar. One member of the Security Forces sustained injuries in a gun battle with the kidnappers and was transported to a hospital in Beirut. Late in the day on 30 March, an obscure group calling itself Harakat al Nahda wal-Islah (The Movement for Renewal and Reform), led by Wael Abbas, claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. The group attached copies of three of the Estonian cyclists' ID cards to an email sent to lebanonfiles.com, adding that the Estonians were in good condition and that it would state its demands at a later time. Overnight between 30 and 31 March, Lebanese security forces estimated they were but hours away from resolving the crisis and were optimistic its ending would be a happy one. A source was quoted as saying the kidnappers had been hired by foreign parties. On 6 April lebanonfiles.com indicated that it had received a follow-up email from Harakat al-Nahda overnight demanding a ransom of an unspecified sum. Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip unequivocally rejected the ransom demand. \\"States do not negotiate with terrorists,\\" he said. \\"In our hearts, we would all do our part, but if we started to organize a [rescue] fund, then all Estonians traveling in dangerous areas would have a price tag attached to them.\\" Chief of the Internal Security Forces Major General Ashraf Rifi told Lebanese daily as-Safir that two groups were involved in the incident ‚Äì one that abducted the Estonian cyclists and another that \\"cooperated in transferring the hostages to another place.\\" Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces party, accused Syria of being behind the abduction and said it is likely the Estonians were being held in Syria. Formal charges were brought against eleven people by Lebanese military prosecutor Saqr Saqr on 8 April, for involvement in the kidnapping and for firing on Lebanese security forces. On 19 April, a video was posted on YouTube by a user named \\"thekidnaper2011\\" (sic) in which the seven abducted cyclists were shown asking for help. The Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs was subsequently able to confirm that the video had been uploaded from Damascus. Intelligence expert Fred Burton of Stratfor analyzed the video as \\"a good sign from a counterterrorism perspective\\" but also commented that the hostages' body language suggested the video had been shot \\"under duress, probably at gunpoint.\\" A second video appeared on the internet a month later, again showing the seven Estonian cyclists appealing for help from various countries. A spokeswoman for Estonia's foreign ministry revealed to AFP that a third video of the captive cyclists had been received in mid-June and was subsequently circulated among the cyclists' relatives. Unlike the first two, in the third video the cyclists were shown to have been separated into three smaller groups. Release On 14 July 2011, the seven cyclists were set free by their captors and taken by French delegates to the French Embassy in Beirut. According to Lebanese Interior Minister Marwan Charbel, they were \\"in good health, but rather underweight.\\" Estonia's foreign minister arrived in Beirut later in the day and escorted the cyclists back to Estonia. A source close to Minister Charbel insisted that no ransom was paid in securing the cyclists' release. The Baltic News Service reported that the Estonian cyclists had been held in Syria for part of the time. The cyclists described their abductors as eight Islamic extremists armed with Kalashnikovs, who at one point demanded to know if the Estonians were Jewish or from Denmark and had pressured them to convert to Islam. Aftermath In September 2011 two accomplices of Wael Abbas, the man believed to be the mastermind behind the abduction, were killed by Lebanon's Internal Security Forces near al-Bireh in southwestern Lebanon. Abbas himself was apprehended by Syrian security forces in November. In April 2012 a Lebanese military court indicted 29 suspects, including a Syrian national, in connection with the abduction. 26 of the 29 were accused of kidnapping the cyclists, establishing ties with Fatah al- Islam, firing at police, killing a member of the Internal Security Forces, bombing stores that sell liquor, vandalizing Christian monuments, and other crimes. The judge requested a death sentence for the 26. At the time, only nine of the suspects were in custody. In May Syria agreed to extradite to Lebanon several individuals it was holding for suspected involvement in the kidnapping.

Napoleonic Wars He began his military service in 1806 during the Wielkopolska Uprising when he personally funded the formation of the first regiment of Legia Poznanska (Pozna≈Ñ Legion), and took the command of the unit. He took part in the Napoleonic wars and specifically, the first Polish campaign (1806‚Äì1807), where he fought with the French at the Siege of Gda≈Ñsk (Danzig) and Siege of Ko≈Çobrzeg (Kolberg). Between 1808 and 1809 he fought in Spain, including at the Battle of Almonacid and Battle of Ocana. He was appointed as the governor of M√°laga, and in 1810 was promoted to Brigadier General. In the 1812 War against Russia (which Napoleon referred to as his \\"Second Polish Campaign\\") he commanded a cavalry brigade in the 5th Corps of Count J√≥zef Poniatowski. The Polish poet and playwright Aleksander Fredro, who served under him, recalled that while Su≈Çkowski was courageous and honorable, he had trouble acquiring the full confidence of his men, partly because he tended to use infantry tactics (Su≈Çkowski's previous command) when in charge of a cavalry unit. In the War of the Sixth Coalition he was a division general and led the 4th Cavalry Corps of Micha≈Ç Sokolnicki. After the death of Poniatowski on 19 October 1813, Su≈Çkowski was briefly the main commander of the Polish Corps, even though he was only twenty eight years old at the time. Su≈Çkowski however, did not wish to fight outside of Poland again, and acting on behalf of his unit's sentiment, vowed that Polish troops would not cross the Rhine. After Napoleon made a personal appeal to Polish soldiers they became willing to follow the emperor which put Su≈Çkowski in a difficult position; if he continued to lead his troops he would have to break the oath he made earlier.David R. Stefancic, Armies in Exile, East European Monographs, 2005, pg. 45 As a result, he submitted his resignation which was accepted by Napoleon and returned to Poland. The remaining Polish forces from then on were commanded by Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski. Political activity in Congress Poland After the Congress of Vienna Antoni supported Congress Poland (saying that it was a \\"small and poor version of Poland but Poland nonetheless, and it had that holy name\\") and Tsar Alexander I of Russia, even becoming his aide-de- camp in September 1815. However, by 1818 he became disillusioned with the political situation, lack of real autonomy or independence for the quasi- Polish state, and the tsar's refusal to join lands of the Russian partition to Congress Poland. As a result, he resigned his official posts and began focusing on personal matters. In 1818 he settled permanently in Rydzyna (part of the Prussian partition of Poland) and became active in politics. Su≈Çkowski was made a member of the Prussian State Council, by King Frederick William and later was a Marshall of the Sejm of the Grand Duchy of Posen and participated in the two founding sejms of the grand duchy in 1827 and 1830. As a prominent politician in the Grand Duchy he tried to protect the use of Polish language and Polish education against forced Germanization and discrimination by the Prussian authorities. During the November Uprising against Russia in Congress Poland in 1830, Su≈Çkowski considered joining the insurrection but made a condition of his involvement that he be given his own separate military unit to command. However, personal and family considerations precluded him from following through on this commitment. Nonetheless after the uprising was suppressed he actively campaigned against repression of the insurrectionists and advocated for a general amnesty. He received the Cavalier's Cross Virtuti Militari as well as the Officer's Cross of L√©gion d'honneur. Personal life He was the son of Voyevoda of Kalisz Antoni Su≈Çkowski (1735‚Äì1796) and Karolina Bubna-Littitz, from a Germanized Czech family.Antoni Pawe≈Ç Su≈Çkowski (1785‚Äì1836), , last accessed, 3/25/2011Walter Asmus, Johann Friedrich Herbart: Der Denker, 1776-1809, Quelle & Meyer, 1968, pg. 348 His father was an associate of the Russian general and ambassador, Nicholas Repnin, who was sent to Poland by Catherine the Great. During the Sejm of the First Partition, the elder Su≈Çkowski actively supported Russian, Prussian and Austrian partition of Poland and for his service was awarded Order of St. Andrew by Empress Catherine the Great of Russia. Unlike his parents, however, the younger Su≈Çkowski became a Polish patriot, supposedly after witnessing the Warsaw Uprising of 1794 against Russian rule as an eight-year-old. He studied in Wroc≈Çaw and at the University of G√∂ttingen. In 1808 he married Ewa Kicka, the daughter of the former Chamberlain to the last king of Poland, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. The couple had three daughters; Helena (married Count Henryk Potocki), Ewa (married Count W≈Çadys≈Çaw Potocki) and Teresa (married Henryka Wodzicki) and one son, Antoni, who married Maria Mycielska (Antoni's wife Ewa died soon after childbirth). In 1836 he caught scarlet fever from one of his children and died. He was buried in a family crypt in the Church of Saint Stanis≈Çaw in Rydzyna. Commemoration Today, in the city of Ko≈Çobrzeg a major street is named after Su≈Çkowski in commemoration of his part in the Siege of the city in 1807. There are also streets and plazas, as well as schools named after him throughout Poland, including in his home town of Rydzyna.

The park is largely undeveloped and consists of three different trail systems: hiking, off road biking and equestrian. The off road biking trails includes difficulty ranging from green to black diamond in its seven mile (11.2 km) system. The green trails are two miles (3.2 km) of wooded scenery. It features a few small log crossings, one ladder bridge and one corduroy feature. The blue trails provide moderate changes in elevation, some rooted and off-camber terrain and a variety of corduroy sections and log crossings. The black trails have more challenging ascents and descents in elevation, creek crossings, narrow winding trails, roots, skinnies, drops and multiple log crossings. In addition to the biking trails there are also 4.5 miles (7.24 km) of equestrian trails. History The city of Davenport bought the property in the 1970s and it was named Southwest Park, although there was no development of a park until 2005. That year volunteers from the QC Friends of Off-Road Cycling built the off-road bike trails and established the initial routes for the equestrian trails which were later adopted by horseback riding enthusiasts. Sunderbruch Park is the only park that permits horseback riding in the city. In 2006 the park was named for Dr. John Sunderbruch, a Davenport physician, community leader and a lifelong resident of the west end.

Evidence for the concept of motor programs include the following:p. 182 :# Processing of afferent information (feedback) is too slow for on-going regulation of rapid movements. :# Reaction time (time between ‚Äúgo‚Äù signal and movement initiation) increases with movement complexity, suggesting that movements are planned in advance. :# Movement is possible even without feedback from the moving limb. Moreover, velocity and acceleration of feedforward movements such as reaching are highly proportional to the distance of the target. :# The existence of motor equivalence, i.e., the ability to perform the same action in multiple ways for instance using different muscles or the same muscles under different conditions. This suggests that a general code specifying the final output exists which is translated into specific muscle action sequences :# Brain activation precedes that of movement. For example, the supplementary motor area becomes active one second before voluntary movement. This is not meant to underestimate the importance of feedback information, merely that another level of control beyond feedback is used: :# Before the movement as information about initial position, or perhaps to tune the spinal apparatus. :# During the movement, when it is either ‚Äúmonitored‚Äù for the presence of error or used directly in the modulation of movements reflexively. :# After the movement to determine the success of the response and contribute to motor learning.  Central organization  = Open and closed-loop theories =  Response-chaining hypothesis  The response-chaining, or reflex- chaining hypothesis, proposed by William James (1890), was one of the earliest descriptions of movement control. This open-loop hypothesis postulated that movements required attention only for initiation of the first action.p. 165 As such, each subsequent movement was thought to be automatically triggered by response-produced afferent information from the muscles. Although feedback is involved in this process, ongoing movements cannot be modified if there are unexpected changes in the environment; feedback is not compared to some internally generated reference value for error checking. However, research involving deafferented animals and humans suggests feedback is not necessary for movement, thus the response-chaining hypothesis provides an incomplete account of movement control.  Adams‚Äô closed-loop theory  In contrast to the open-loop response-chaining hypothesis, Adams' closed-loop theory suggested that processing of afferent information was central in human motor control. Adams‚Äô closed-loop theory is based on basic motor learning research that focused on slow, graded, linear positioning tasks, which involved error detection and correction to meet goal demands. To learn a movement, a ‚Äúmotor program‚Äù consisting of two states of memory (i.e. memory trace and perceptual trace), is required. The memory trace (equivalent to recall memory in verbal learning) initiates the motor movement, chooses its initial direction and determines the earliest portions of the movement. Strengthening of the memory trace results from practice and feedback about movement outcome (see motor learning). In addition, the perceptual trace (similar to recognition memory in verbal tasks) is involved in guidance of the limb to the correct position along a trajectory. This is accomplished by comparing incoming feedback to the perceptual trace, which is formed from the sensory consequences of the limb being at the correct/incorrect endpoint in past experience. In the event of an error, the limb is adjusted until the movement is appropriate to the goal of the action. Importantly, the more accurate the movement, the more useful the perceptual trace that is collected and retained. Though this theory represented an important leap forward in motor learning research, one weakness in Adams‚Äô closed-loop theory was the requirement of 1-to-1 mapping between stored states (motor programs) and movements to be made. This presented an issue related to the storage capacity of the central nervous system; a vast array of movements would require equally large repository of motor programs. Additionally, this theory could not be used to explain how motor programs for novel movements were formed. = Schmidt‚Äôs schema theory = Early motor program theories did not adequately account for evidence illustrating the influence of feedback for the modification of ongoing movement while providing a suitable explanation of motor programs storage or application in novel movement. Consequently, the notion of the generalized motor program (GMP) was developed.p. 205 The GMP is thought to contain an abstract representation for a class of movements with invariant features pertaining to the order of events, the relative timing of events and the relative force with which events are produced. In order to determine how a particular movement should be performed, parameters such as overall movement duration, overall force of contractions and the muscles involved are specified to the GMP. This revision of the motor program concept allows many different movements to be produced with the same motor program as well as the production of novel movements by specifying new parameters. Richard Schmidt (1975) proposed the schema theory for motor control, suggesting in opposition to closed-loop theories, that a motor program containing general rules can be applied to different environmental or situational contexts via the involvement of open-loop control process and GMPs.p. 32 In Schmidt's theory, the schema (psychology) contains the generalized rules that generate the spatial and temporal muscle patterns to produce a specified movement.p. 32 Therefore, when learning novel movements an individual may generate a new GMP based on the selection of parameters (reducing the novel movement problem), or refine an existing GMP (reducing the storage problem), depending on prior experience with movement and task context. According to Schmidt, four things are stored in memory after an individual generates a movement: # The initial conditions of the movement, such as the proprioceptive information of the limbs and body. # The response specifications for the motor programs, which are the parameters used in the generalized motor program, such as speed and force. # The sensory consequences of the response, which contain information about how the movement felt, looked and sounded. # The outcome of that movement, which contains information of the actual outcome of the movement with knowledge of results (KR). This information is stored in components of the motor response schema, which include the recall schema and recognition schema. The recall and recognition schema are strongly associated, as they use the relationship between the initial condition and actual outcomes; however, they are not isomorphic. They differ in that recall schema is used to select a specific response with the use of response specifications, whereas the recognition schema is used to evaluate the response with the sensory consequences. Throughout a movement, the recognition schema is compared to the expected sensory information (e.g., proprioceptive and extroceptive) from the ongoing movement to evaluate the efficiency of the response.p. 32 An error signal is sent upon finalizing the movement, where the schema is then modified based on the sensory feedback and knowledge of results (see motor learning). The schema theory illustrates that motor learning consists of continuous processes that update the recall and recognition schemas with each movement that is made.p. 33 = Multiple paired forward and inverse models = An alternate viewpoint on the organization and control of motor programs may be considered a computational process of selecting a motor command (i.e., the input) to achieve a desired sensory feedback (i.e., the output). Selection of the motor command depends on many internal and external variables, such as the current state of the limb(s), orientation of the body and properties of the items in the environment with which the body will interact. Given the vast number of possible combinations of these variables, the motor control system must be able to provide an appropriate command for any given context. One strategy for selecting appropriate commands involves a modular approach; multiple controllers exist such that each controller is suitable for one or a small set of contexts. Based on an estimate of the current context, a controller is chosen to generate the appropriate motor command. This modular system can be used to describe both motor control and motor learning and requires adaptable internal forward and inverse models. Forward models describe the forward or causal relationship between system inputs, predicting sensory feedback that will occur. Inverse models (controllers) generate the motor command that will cause a desired change in state, given an environmental context. During motor learning, the forward and inverse models are paired and tightly coupled by a responsibility signal within modules. Using the forward model's predictions and sensory contextual cues, responsibility signals indicate the degree to which each pair should be responsible for controlling current behavior.  Impairment of motor programs  = Cerebellar degeneration = Errors in reaching are commonly found in patients with cerebellar degeneration. This suggests their motor commands do not predicatively compensate for interaction torques inherent in multi-joint motion. Several lines of research have been conducted to understand this, with evidence being provided that this impairment may be due to a malfunctioning inverse model: * the cerebellum plays a dominant role in representing the inverse model * the cerebellum is active during learning of arm movements in force fields. With this knowledge, an experiment conducted by Smith and Shadmehr (2005) illustrated an impaired ability for cerebellar subjects to alter motor commands to compensate for applied force fields within a trial (i.e. modify an ongoing movement) as well as to use this error to update the following trial (i.e. changes in a following trial were unrelated to prior trial error). This agreed with prior work by Mascheke et al. (2004) who illustrated those with cerebellar degeneration had difficulty adapting motor commands when limb dynamics were altered.

Google Apps Script was initially developed by Mike Harm as a side project whilst working as a developer on Google Sheets. Google Apps Script was first publicly announced in May 2009 when a beta testing program was announced by Jonathan Rochelle, then Product Manager, Google Docs. In August 2009 Google Apps Script was subsequently made available to all Google Apps Premier and Education Edition customers. It is based on JavaScript 1.6, but also includes some portions of 1.7 and 1.8 and a subset of the ECMAScript 5 API. Apps Script projects run server-side on Google's infrastructure. According to Google, Apps Script \\"provides easy ways to automate tasks across Google products and third party services.\\"Google Apps Script Apps Script is also the tool that powers the add- ons for Google Docs, Sheets and Slides.Bring a little something extra to Docs and Sheets with add-ons Benefits # Based on JavaScript 1.6 and a selection of JavaScript 1.7 and 1.8 # Cloud based debugger for debugging App Scripts in the web browser. # It can be used to create simple tools for an organization's internal consumption. # It can be used to perform simple system administration tasks. # Community-based support model.

Using Date/Time objects and functions without very precise declaration and thorough testing may result in inaccurate results. Example Add-ons In March 2014, Google introduced add-ons for Docs and Sheets (soon followed by Forms). The add-on stores let users add extra features to Google editors, such as mail-merging, workflows, diagrams builders,... All add-ons are either 100% built with Apps Script or simply use Apps Script to display a UI in the Google editors while relying on an external backend to perform some tasks. For example, MailChimp, a mail- merging tool, has an add-on for Google Docs that communicates with MailChimp platform to send emails. Before add-ons, it was possible to publish scripts for Google Sheets in the Script Gallery. When users installed scripts through this gallery, a copy of the Apps Script code was installed on the user's Sheet. With add-ons, the source code is not visible to the end user and everyone is using the latest version published by the developer. This new approach make it easier to support existing code and helped convince several companies, such as MailChimp or LucidChart to invest in Apps Script. As part of the add-ons release, Google also introduced a UI Style GuideUI Style Guide for Add-ons and CSS package to help developers built add-ons that integrate smoothly into the editors. Each add-on is also reviewed by Google before its publication and developers can benefit from advice from Googlers to provide a better user experience.

The $87.5M loan was then used to secure a 20% interest in the Moskva Hotel project. In September 2010, after the commencement of a criminal investigation into the $87.5M fraud, Egiazaryan filed a claim in a Cyprus court complaining that a group of Russian politicians, and businessmen, including Suleyman Kerimov, conspired to take over Egiazaryan‚Äôs share in the multi-billiondollar Moskva Hotel project.

Egiazaryan‚Äôs Duma office was also searched and investigators seized paperwork related to the case against him. In January 2011, the Basmanny district court of Moscow indicted Egiazaryan on charges of large scale fraud. The court also attached Egiazaryan‚Äôs assets to be used to compensate Vitaly Smagin and Europark for the $87.5M that was embezzled. As a result of the court ruling, the lower house of parliament in Russia gave approval on March 9, 2011 for Egiazaryan‚Äôs arrest on charges of large-scale fraud. Arrival in the United States After being indicted for fraud in Russia, Egiazaryan fled to the United States, claiming that he feared for his life and that the fraud allegations against him were politically motivated. Peter Zalmayev, director of the Eurasia Democracy Initiative (EDI), stated, ‚ÄúEgiazaryan claims he is fleeing persecution, but the real reason appears to be that he is fleeing prosecution. His lawyers are reportedly seeking political asylum for their client.‚Äù Egiazaryan later sued Zalmayev for defamation and Zalmayev countersued for infringement of his speech utilizing the anti-Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation laws of New York State. Egiazaryan‚Äôs case was dismissed, but Zalmayev‚Äôs case continues.

He founded the Kufi school of Arabic grammar, the rival philology school to the Basri school founded by Sibawayh. Life A Persian native of al-K≈´fah, he learned grammar from al-Ru‚ÄôƒÅsƒ´ and a group of other scholars. It is said that al-KisƒÅ‚Äôƒ´ took this moniker from the particular kind of mantle he wore called a kisƒÅ‚Äô. Al-KisƒÅ‚Äôƒ´ entered the court of the AbbƒÅsid caliph HƒÅr≈´n al-Rashƒ´d at BaghdƒÅd as tutor to the two princes, al-Ma‚Äôm≈´n and al-Amƒ´n. His early biographer Al-Nadim relates Ab≈´ al-·π¨ayyib‚Äôs written account that Al-Rashƒ´d held him in highest esteem. When the caliph moved the court to al-Rayy as the capital of KhurƒÅsƒÅn, al-KisƒÅ‚Äôƒ´ moved there but subsequently became ill and died. During his illness al-Rashƒ´d paid him regular visits and deeply mourned his death. It seems he died in 804 (189 AH) on the day that the hanƒ´fah official of Al-Rashƒ´d, Mu·∏•ammad al-ShaybƒÅnƒ´ also died. It is also said he shared his date of death with the judge Ab≈´ Y≈´suf in 812 (197 AH). When al- KisƒÅ‚Äôƒ´ died al-FarrƒÅ' was elected to teach in his stead, according to the account of Ibn al-K≈´fƒ´. =Rival Schools= A famous anecdote relates a grammatical contest in Baghdad between the leaders of the two rival schools, with al-KisƒÅ‚Äôƒ´ representative of Al-Kufah, and Sibawayh of the Ba·π£rans. The debate was organized by the Abbasid vizier Yahya ibn Khalid, and became known as al-Mas'ala al-Zunburƒ´yah (The Question of the Hornet). At issue was the Arabic phrase: ŸÉŸÜÿ™Ÿè ÿ£ÿ∏ŸÜ ÿ£ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿπŸÇÿ±ÿ®Ÿé ÿ£ÿ¥ÿØ ŸÑÿ≥ÿπÿ© ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ≤ŸÜÿ®Ÿàÿ± ŸÅÿ•ÿ∞ÿß ŸáŸà ŸáŸäŸáŸà ÿ•ŸäÿßŸáÿß I always thought that the scorpion is more painful than the hornet in its sting, and so it is (lit. translation).Kees Versteegh, The Arabic Linguistic Tradition, pg. 64. Part of the Landmarks in Linguistic Thought series, vol. 3. London: Routledge, 1997. At issue was the correct declension of the last word in the sentence. Sibawayh proposed:M.G. Carter, Sibawayhi, pg. 13. London: I.B. Tauris, 2004. > ... fa-'ida huwa hiya (ŸÅÿ•ÿ∞ÿß ŸáŸà ŸáŸä), literally ... sure-enough he she meaning \\"so he (the scorpion, masc.) is she (the most painful one, fem.)\\"; In Arabic syntax the predicative copula of the verb 'to be' or is has no direct analogue, and instead employs nominal inflexion. Al-Kisa'i argued the correct form is: > ... fa-'ida huwa 'iyyaha(ŸÅÿ•ÿ∞ÿß ŸáŸà ÿ•ŸäÿßŸáÿß), literally ... sure-enough he her meaning \\"he is her\\". In Sibawayh's theoretical argument the accusative form can never be the predicate. However when al-Kisa'i was supported in his assertion by four Bedouin -Desert Arab, whom he had supposedly bribed-Franz Rosenthal, A History of Muslim Historiography, pg. 245. Leiden: Brill Archive, 1952. that the correct form was huwa 'iyyaha, his argument won the debate. Such was Sibawayh's bitterness in defeat, he left the court to return to his country where he died sometime later at a young age. Al-Kisa'i was accosted by one of Sibawayh's students after the fact and asked 100 grammatical questions, being proved wrong by the student each time. Upon being told the news about Sibawayh's death, al-Kisa'i approached the Caliph Harun al-Rashid and requested that he be punished for having a share in \\"killing Sibawayh.\\"al- QƒÅsim Ibn- ªAlƒ´ al- ·∏§arƒ´rƒ´, The Assemblies of Al ·∏§ar√Æri: 1: containing the first 26 assemblies, vol. 1, pg. 499.

She participated in the Paris Commune and the First International and was a friend of Karl Marx. She was once courted by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, who published two of her stories in his journal. Her sister was the mathematician and socialist Sofia Kovalevskaya (1850‚Äì1891). Early life Anna Vasilevna Korvin- Krukovskaya came from a respectable, wealthy military family of aristocratic status. Her father was General Vasily Korvin-Krukovsky. Anna and her sister, the future mathematician Sophia Kovalevskaya, were raised in an enlightened household. As young women they read the materialist literature then popular‚Äîbooks by Ludwig B√ºchner, Carl Vogt and others‚Äîand the writings of 'nihilist' and Narodnik social critics like Nikolai Chernyshevsky and Peter Lavrov. Both women became associated with radical Narodnik circles. In the 1860s, Anna was courted by the famous writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky. She met him in 1864, after publishing two stories in his literary journal, The Epoch, unbeknownst to her family. Dostoyevsky respected her talent and encouraged her writing. However, the two were not politically compatible. Although Dostoyevsky had sympathised with utopian socialist ideas in his youth and had even been banished to Siberia for his involvement in the Petrashevsky circle, by the 1860s he was becoming increasingly religious and conservative. She rejected his proposal, but they remained on friendly terms for the rest of her life. It is thought that Dostoyevsky based the character of Aglaya Epanchina in The Idiot on Anna.Cp. Lantz, K., The Dostoevsky Encyclopedia. Westport, 2004, p. 220. In 1866 Anna Korvin-Krukovskaya went with her mother and sister to Geneva, Switzerland, where she associated with exiled radicals from Russia and elsewhere. In 1869, she left Russia under the pretext of being chaperoned by her younger sister, Sofia, who had undertaken a nominal marriage with a young Russian radical, Vladimir Onufryevich Kovalevsky, together with her husband. But, in fact, Anna went to Paris, and there met Victor Jaclard, a Blanquiste leader of the Montmartre contingent of the National Guard during the Paris Commune. The Paris Commune The fall of Napol√©on III in 1870 had enabled Jaclard to return to France, and the two of them entered into a common law relationship. Together with her common-law husband she participated actively in the Paris Commune of 1871. She sat on the Comit√© de vigilance de Montmartre (the Montmartre Committee of Vigilance) and on the committee supervising the education of girls; she was active in organising the food supply of the besieged city of Paris; she co-founded and wrote for the journal La Sociale; she acted as one of the representatives of the Russian section of the International and she participated in a committee on women's rights. She was convinced that the struggle for women's rights could only succeed in conjunction with the struggle against capitalism in general. Anne Jaclard, as she was then known, collaborated closely with other leading feminist revolutionaries in the Commune, including Louise Michel, Nathalie Lemel, the writer Andr√© L√©o, Paule Mink and her fellow Russian, Elisaveta Dmitrieva. Together they founded the Women's Union, which fought for equal wages for women, female suffrage, mesures against domestic violence and the closing of the legal brothels in Paris. When the Paris Commune was suppressed by the Versailles government of Adolphe Thiers, Anna and Jaclard were arrested. He was sentenced to death, but she managed to escape to England, where she stayed at the home of Karl Marx. In October 1871, with the aid of Anna's father, who made a plea to Thiers, as well as her sister Sofia, and her sister's husband, Kovalevsky, Jaclard was rescued from his captivity, and spirited out of France, to Switzerland, where he and Anna officially married. Marx, who had taught himself Russian, was at the time very interested in the Russian revolutionary movement. Anna began, but did not complete, a translation of Volume 1 of Marx' Capital. Later years In 1874, Anna and her husband returned to her native Russia. Victor found a job as a French teacher, and Anna worked primarily as a journalist and translator. She contributed to such oppositional papers as Delo and Slovo. The Jaclards also resumed friendly relations with Dostoyevsky. Neither Dostoyevsky's earlier efforts at courting Anna nor their strong political differences with the Jaclards prevented cordial and regular contact between them. She occasionally assisted him with translations into French, in which she was fluent. Anne Jaclard also resumed her contacts with revolutionary circles. She was acquainted with several members of the Narodnik movement 'to the people' in the 1870s and with the revolutionaries who, in 1879, formed the group Narodnaia Volia (The People's Will). In 1881, this group assassinated the tsar, Alexander II. However, the Jaclards had left Russia by then, and were not caught up in the repression which followed. In 1880, a general amnesty enabled Anne and Victor Jaclard to return to France. There, they resumed their journalistic work. Anna Jaclard died in 1887.

They use high energy ‚Äì low frequency sound waves that provide 360¬∞ particulate de-bonding and at a speed in excess of 344 metres per second. Because they employ non-destructive sound waves, unlike steam soot blowers they eliminate any concerns over corrosion, erosion or mechanical damage and do not produce an effluent stream. The sonic soot blower can in some ways be compared to a musical reed instrument such as an oboe, where the ‚Äòbase tone‚Äô is created by blowing air over a reed and then converting this ‚Äòbase tone‚Äô into a particular high or low note, depending on how far the sound wave has to travel along inside the body of the instrument. The sonic soot blower operates in the same manner, the ‚Äòbase tone‚Äô being produced by passing compressed air into a wave generator which houses a titanium diaphragm causing it to oscillate rapidly. This ‚Äòbase tone‚Äô is then converted into a range of selected frequencies ranging from 350 Hz down to 60 Hz by the design and length of the horn section, producing the desired sound frequency at a sound level approaching 200 dB. The sonic soot blower is usually ‚Äòsounded‚Äô for a few seconds at intervals of between 3 and 10 minutes. This ‚Äòsounding‚Äô pattern is normally controlled via the plant‚Äôs PLC. However, it may also be operated by such means as a SCADA system, individual timers on each solenoid valve or via a manual ball valve. Construction Sonic soot blowers are normally constructed from fabricated, 316 grade stainless steel as opposed to some sonic horns which are manufactured from heavy cast iron. For installations in harsher environments, such as high temperature or acidic gas streams, other types of stainless steels are used such as 310, 316 and 825. Performance Sonic soot blowers create a rapid series of very powerful sound induced pressure fluctuations which when transmitted into the ash or particulate, cause them to de-bond from other particles and from the heat transfer surface to which they are bonded and so carried away in the gas stream. This prevents the ash from building up and sintering onto the boiler tubes thus significantly reducing thermal efficiency. This is in contrast to the operating principles of steam soot blowers which are usually only employed at most once every eight hours by which time the ash has built up and baked hard onto the heat transfer surfaces. The steam soot blower then tries to blast away his hard deposit, usually only from the leading edge of the steam tubes. Advantages Sonic soot blowers are a proven alternative to conventional steam soot blowers in power generation plants which burn a range of fossil fuels and other waste fuels including biofuels. Depending on the application and boiler plant design, sonic soot blowers usually totally replace existing high maintenance steam soot blowers whether of the retractable or rotary type. In a few cases, sonic soot blowers can be used to supplement steam soot blowers. Sonic soot blower cleaning technologies can be applied in superheaters, generating sections, economizers, and airheaters as well as downstream equipment such as electrostatic precipitators, baghouse filters and fans. The main advantages of sonic soot blowers over steam soot blowers are:- ‚Ä¢ Elimination of opacity spikes due to more regular, more efficient cleaning ‚Ä¢ No structural damage to tube bundles or boiler structure ‚Ä¢ Elimination of tube corrosion and erosion problems ‚Ä¢ 360¬∞ cleaning of all tube surfaces ‚Äì not harsh leading edge tube cleaning as with steam soot blowers ‚Ä¢ Prevention of ash build up and sintering on steam tubes due to sonic soot blowers regular operation ‚Ä¢ Extremely low maintenance or operational costs ‚Ä¢ Eco-friendly ‚Äì helps to combat global climate change and the effect of global warming References *Sonic soot blowers *Mechanisms of steam soot blower erosion *Hartge Acoustic Cleaning Acoustics Audio engineering Cleaning tools ","title":"Sonic soot blowers"},{"id":"31285618","text":"Charles Allen Thorndike Rice (June 18, 1851 ‚Äì May 16, 1889) was a journalist and the editor and publisher of the North American Review from 1876 to 1889.pp.405-406 in American National Biography, Vol. 18, Oxford University Press, New York. (c)1999 Early life and family C. Allen Thorndike Rice was born 18 June 1851 in Boston, Massachusetts as the only son of Henry Gardner Rice (1820‚Äì1869), from a Boston publishing family, and Elizabeth Frances (Thorndike) Rice, from a New York publishing family. Rice (known as Charles or Charlie as a child) grew up in the Beacon Hill section of Boston and Baltimore, Maryland, but his parents divorced in 1859, and a child custody dispute ensued. Custody was eventually awarded to his father by a Maryland Court and upheld by way of a 1 August 1860 decision by Justice George Bigelow of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. In retaliation, Elizabeth Thorndike Rice arranged for a kidnapping of Charlie in the summer of 1860 when he was in Nahant, Massachusetts. The kidnapping was witnessed by nine-year-old Charlie's school mate, Henry Cabot Lodge, who testified to the authorities leading to the capture of the kidnappers.pp.72-80 In: Lodge, H.C. (1913). Early Memories. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. 362pp. However, Elizabeth was able to escape to Canada with Charlie disguised as a girl. They eventually moved to France and Germany and resided there for several years. In 1866, Rice's mother Elizabeth died and he was able to rejoin his father in Boston. In 1869, Rice's father Henry died and he returned to Europe for his education. He graduated from University of Oxford with a BA degree in 1874, and earned his MA degree there in 1878. He was never married. Professional career C. Allen Thorndike Rice (known as Allen in later life) began his career in 1876 when he purchased the North American Review for $3000, and he established himself as the publisher and editor-in-chief. The magazine provided an outlet for his interest in writing, as he was a frequent contributor. In 1879, he became interested in international exploration, so he contributed funds to enable the Charnay Expedition to explore and photograph Mayan ruins in Mexico and Guatemala. On the return of the expedition, Rice wrote an account in 1880 entitled Ruined Cities of Central America that publicized and popularized the effort. That year he was awarded the Chevalier de L√©gion d'honneur by French President Jules Gr√©vy. Rice ran as a Republican in the election of 1886 against General Francis Barretto Spinola for New York's 10th congressional district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lost the race and he subsequently alleged electoral fraud in the process. Rice then dedicated himself to the cause of promoting the use of the secret ballot in the United States. In 1889, he was appointed as Minister to Russia by President Benjamin Harrison but he died at a hotel in New York City on 16 May 1889 prior to assuming his post.

Despite many Turkish authority claims, the PKK has never taken responsibility. Background In late 1991, Turkish President Turgut √ñzal attempted to establish dialogue with the PKK. He had said the idea of a federation could be discussed and a Kurdish language TV channel could be opened. He also passed a bill, partially unbanning the use of the Kurdish language.Kurdish Language Policy in Turkey In response the PKK declared a cease-fire on March 20, 1993. On April 17, 1993 Turgut √ñzal died under suspicious circumstances. The attack Turkish authorities claimed that PKK commander ≈ûemdin Sakƒ±k had responded to the previous state's decision with a show of force and ordered PKK units in Diyarbakƒ±r to close down all main highways in the province and nearby on May 24. One of these roads was the Elazƒ±ƒü-Bing√∂l highwayPage 214 which was allegedly attacked by over 150 PKK militants, coming from the South-Eastern mountains. PKK followed orders and stopped several buses that were transferring unarmed Turkish soldiers in civilian clothing and then dragged 33 soldiers and 5 civilians (including four teachers) from their vehicles and executed them. Some 22 soldiers were briefly captured by the PKK, before being freed by Turkish rescue operations. The military was criticized for the fact that the soldiers were unarmed and there were no units protecting them. Aftermath The attack broke the PKK's cease-fire with the Turkish government and in response to this, the Turkish military intensified its anti- insurgency operations against the PKK during the following months. A total of 92 Turkish security forces, 203 Kurdish rebels and 29 civilians were killed during anti-insurgency operations in May and June, an additional 120 Kurds were arrested during these operations.

The company operates globally, largely through external alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, patient advocacy groups, and venture capitalists. As of December 31, 2019, Evotec had a market capitalization of ‚Ç¨3.47 billion and a pipeline of more than 100 partnered programs in discovery, pre-clinical development and clinical development. The company's 2,000+ employees work across a number of therapeutic areas including CNS/neurology (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease), metabolic diseases (e.g. Diabetes), Cancer, and inflammatory and infectious diseases. It has long-term discovery alliances with Celgene, Bayer, Sanofi, Boehringer Ingelheim, the CHDI Foundation, Genentech, Roche, and more. On October 28, 2009, the company was listed on the TecDAX index, which tracks the performance of the 30 largest German companies from the technology sector. On September 24, 2018, Evotec joined the MDAX index, following a rule change that enabled dual listing. The MDAX tracks 60 Prime Standard shares from sectors excluding technology.  Company formation  Evotec SE was established as Evotec BioSystems GmbH in 1993 by a group of founders that included Karsten Henco, Ulrich Aldag, Freimut Leidenberger, Heinrich Schulte, Rudolf Rigler, Charles Weissmann and Nobel Laureate Manfred Eigen.Jackle H, Rotte C, & Gruss P (2017) Manfred Eigen: the realization of his vision of Biophysical Chemistry. European biophysics journal Vol. 47, pp. 319-323. Eigen won the 1967 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work measuring ultrafast chemical reactions. Evotec Biosystems went public in 1999, listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol EVT. The following year, it merged with the British chemical services company Oxford Asymmetry International plc, adopting the new name Evotec OAI. In 2002, the company was divided into two business divisions; \\"Discovery and Development Services\\" and \\"Tools and Technologies,\\" creating the wholly owned subsidiary Evotec Technologies GmbH. Four years later, this division was sold to PerkinElmer in a move that, according to Evotec, allowed it to focus its resources towards the discovery and development of new pharmaceutical drugs. The company later rebranded as Evotec AG in 2005, with an aim to \\"reflect the growing emphasis of proprietary drug development in its business model and have a single \\"new\\" name which stands for both parts of its business.\\"  Notable acquisitions  In 2008, Evotec acquired US-based Renovis in a $152 million stock deal, allowing it to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange. One year later, the company announced it was voluntarily de-listing its American Depositary Receipt to cut costs and concentrate its share trading on the German TecDAX platform. In 2010, the company acquired DeveloGen AG, a spin-out from the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry that was developing novel therapies for metabolic disorders, such as diabetes. In 2011, Evotec acquired Kinaxo Biotechnologies GmbH, a Munich-based, privately owned biotech company. Kinaxo specialized in chemical proteomics and its application in small molecule drug discovery. That same year, Evotec took control of Compound Focus the compound management arm of the Galapagos group subsidiary Biofocus. In January 2013, Evotec acquired CCS Cell Culture Service GmbH, a Hamburg-based company that supplied custom cells and cell-based reagents for drug discovery applications. In May 2014, Evotec acquired Euprotec for $3.15 million, a contract research organization (CRO) with expertise in infectious diseases and respiratory biology. In December 2016, Evotec completed its acquisition of Cyprotex, a preclinical contract research organization. In July 2017, Evotec acquired the integrated drug development services provider Aptuit for ‚Ç¨256 million. In recent years, Evotec has made two significant deals with French pharmaceutical company Sanofi. In 2015, Evotec took over Sanofi's small-molecule drug development site in Toulouse, France, bringing approximately 200 Sanofi chemists into its team. In 2018, Evotec acquired Sanofi's infectious disease unit, absorbing an additional 100 Sanofi employees and a majority of its anti- infectives research portfolio, including more than 10 R&D; assets. Per the agreement, Evotec will continue to run infectious disease R&D; operations in Lyon, France. Evotec's initial focus will be on antimicrobial resistance (\\"AMR\\") and superbug infections, tuberculosis, and malaria, as well as the creation of novel antiviral therapies with new mechanisms of action. In April 2019, Evotec AG announced it had completed its conversion into a company under European law (Societas Europaea, ‚ÄúSE‚Äù).

The wildlife of the Falkland Islands is quite similar to that of Patagonia. The Falkland Islands have no native reptiles or amphibians, and the only native land mammal, the warrah, is now extinct. However, a large number of bird species have been seen around the islands, and many of them breed on the smaller islands of the archipelago. Insects play a large role in the ecosystem of the islands, and over 200 species have been recorded. The waters around the Falkland Islands sustain many animals, including a large number of marine mammals. Three pinniped species breed on the islands. There are no trees native to the area, leading to a wide proliferation of grass species. This includes tussac grass, the dense leaves of which provide a micro-climate for many bird and invertebrate species. Small bushes are also found, along with a small number of freshwater plants. The plant species vary with different factors such as the fertility of the soil, the humidity, and altitude. There is a lack of data about many species in the islands, as well as a lack of long-term data about the environment. Introduced animals are having a detrimental effect on native wildlife, which is now mainly restricted to smaller offshore islands. Some native animals are protected, but many are not, due to a lack of information about them. Ecological zones and habitats The Falkland islands are an archipelago located some off South America in the south Atlantic Ocean. Biogeographically, the Falkland Islands are classified as part of the Antarctic ecozone and Antarctic Floristic Kingdom. Strong connections exist with the flora and fauna of Patagonia in South America, especially to those in Tierra del Fuego. As the Falkland Islands were originally connected to the African rather than South American mainland, the connections with Patagonia suggest wildlife on the islands arrived through dispersal.McDowall, R.M. 2005. Falkland Islands biogeography: converging trajectories in the South Atlantic Ocean. J. Biogeogr. 32: 49‚Äì62. There are two main islands in the archipelago, East Falkland and West Falkland, along with over 700 smaller ones. 19 land habitats are recognised. The soil types in the island vary, due to the relative dryness of the west compared to the east and differences in altitude. Many coastal areas have tussac grass, which needs high humidity and salty air to flourish. Inland habitats are often heath, either grass or shrubs, or feldmark made of cushion plants. Lowlands have acidic peaty soil with a low fertility. These lowlands support grass in wetter areas, but only shrubs in the drier areas. In the areas with high nutrient levels, the lowlands can support turf, however most peat is very shallow and lies on top of clay. The mountains usually have clay or stony soils, on which only feldmark plants such as cushion plants can grow and which support a very small diversity of species. Fauna The archipelago had only one terrestrial mammal upon the arrival of Europeans, the Falkland Islands wolf (also known as warrah), found on both major islands. It was traditionally thought that Patagonian Indians once brought the warrah to the islands as a hunting dog. However, a 2009 DNA study by scientists at UCLA suggested that the warrah arrived on the islands long before humans migrated to the New World, possibly during one of the particularly intense cold intervals 340,000 years ago, 150,000 years ago or 25,000 years ago. Its nearest relative was the maned wolf, an extant South American canid. It became extinct in the mid-19th century as human settlement spread. 14 species of marine mammals including killer whales, Peale's dolphins, Commerson's dolphins, leopard seals, southern elephant seals, and southern sea lions frequent the surrounding waters. Elephant seals, fur seals, and sea lions all breed on the islands, and the largest elephant seal breeding site has over 500 animals in it. Other species, especially cetaceans, are also sometimes seen. Populations of large whales, drastically reduced by illegal whaling carried out by the Soviet Union until the late 1970s, are now recovering. These include southern right whales, humpback whales, blue whales, fin whales, sei whales, and sperm whales. Penguins at Gypsy Cove 227 bird species have been seen on the islands, over 60 of which are known to breed on the islands. 21 of the resident species are land birds, and 18 are water birds. There are 22 species of seabirds which breed on the islands, and at least 18 annual migrators who breed elsewhere. There are two endemic species of bird (the Falkland steamer duck and Cobb's wren), and 14 endemic subspecies. There are five penguin species breeding on the islands, king penguins, rockhopper penguins, magellanic penguins, gentoo penguins, and macaroni penguins. Approximately 494,500 breeding pairs are thought to live on the island, 500 of which are king penguins. Five other species have been recorded, but do not have a breeding population. The largest breeding population of black-browed albatross is found on the islands, making up over 80% of the global black-browed albatross population. This is the only breeding species of albatross, although nine others have been recorded. Many species of petrel also nest on the Falklands. Most remaining bird colonies exist on remote offshore islands. Inland, upland and ruddy-headed geese live near small freshwater ponds, along with silver teal, Chilo√© wigeon, and white-tufted grebe. There are six species of herons and egrets that have been recorded, although only the black-crowned night heron is known to breed in the area. The Striated Caracara, a bird of prey found in the Falklands. There are no native reptiles or amphibians on the islands. Over 200 species of insects have been recorded, along with 43 spider species and 12 worm species. Over 60 species of true flies live on the islands, 12 species of wasps, and 20 species of butterflies and moths. There is a high diversity of beetles species, with 110 species of which 15 are ground beetles, 20 are weevils, and 16 are darkling beetles. There are 15 species of hemiptera, and 12 booklice. Only 13 terrestrial invertebrates are recognised as endemic, although information on many species in lacking and it is suspected up to two thirds of species found are actually endemic, including 16 spiders. Insects are important as decomposers, and also make up a large portion of the diet of some bird species. Due to the island environment, many insect species have developed reduced or absent wings. There are around 129 freshwater invertebrates, the majority being rotifer, however the identification of some species remains in dispute. Six species of fish are found in freshwater areas including the zebra trout (Aplochiton zebra), the Falklands minnow and common galaxias (Galaxias maculatus), which is among the most widespread fishes in the world.Pauly D. 2004. Falklands Islands, p. 75 in Darwin's Fishes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK. Many of these native species are amphidromous, spending part of their lives at sea. Introduced brown trout, have been established in many freshwater streams and have also formed sea-runs resulting in an increase in body size.Armstrong, P.H. 1992. Darwin's Desolate Islands: a Naturalist in the Falklands, 1833 and 1834. Picton Publishing, Chippenham.Wheeler, A. 2004. p. 163. The Falklands and South Georgia Island. Lonely Planet. Due to the introduction of brown trout and other fish species the endemic zebra trout (a galaxiid fish unrelated to typical salmonid trout) is now restricted to small streams in remote parts of West Falkland and Lafonia. Different species of krill are found in Falkland waters, with lobster krill inhabiting the warmer waters in the north. Flora Vegetation on the archipelago is composed of grasses, ferns, and shrubs. Around 363 species of vascular plants have been recorded on the island, 171 of which are native and 13 of which are endemic. 21 species of ferns and clubmosses are recorded, and 278 species of flowering plants have been recorded. There are no native tree species, although there are two species of bushes, fachine and native box. Some bogs and fens exist and support some freshwater plant species, but these are not common on the islands. Bolax gummifera Tussac grass, which averages in height but can reach up to , consists of a tussock of vegetation around a fibrous central pedestal. They are known to live for over 200 years, and can become large enough for birds to nest on them. Due to the need for high humidity and salty air, tussac grass is not found more than away from the coast, causing it to form bands around larger islands. The dead leaves that accumulate in these areas make them highly fertile, although few other species can grow due to the density of the grass. The dense canopies formed create an insulated micro- climate suitable for many birds and invertebrates. Heath is found commonly inland, made up of either grass or shrubs. The most common grass species is whitegrass (Cortaderia pilosa), and this grass heath covers the majority of the main islands. These grasses support other flowering plants, along with insects and birds. The shrub heath is composed mostly of low-growing shrubs such as diddle-dee, and also hosts many other plant species along with invertebrates and small birds. In the feldmark environments formed on exposed ridges and higher areas, cushion plants such as balsam bog (Bolax gummifera). Species of fern can also grow in such areas. In the most extreme areas, only lichen and specialised plants such as snakeplants can grow. The pale maiden (Olsynium filifolium) is the Falkland Island's proposed national flower. Issues and introduced species There is little long-term data on habitat changes, so the extent of human impact is unclear, although threats such as invasive species and camp burning are recognised. Vegetation such as tussac grass, fachine, and native box have been heavily affected by introduced grazing animals. Tussac grass now exists in only 20% of its former range, mostly offshore islands, as a result of its extreme sensitivity. Many breeding birds similarly only live on offshore islands, where introduced animals such as cats and rats are not found. The only native terrestrial mammal, the warrah, was wiped out in the mid-19th century. Wildlife tourism is growing, and steps are being taken to protect the wildlife of the islands. Some protection exists under the Conservation of Wildlife and Nature Ordinance 1999. Only two bird species lack legal protection. One fish species, the zebra trout, is protected. Amid a lack of information on invertebrates, legislation only exists to protect butterflies. Virtually the entire area of the islands is used as pasture for sheep. There is also an introduced reindeer population, which was brought to the islands in 2001 for commercial purposes. Rats have been introduced in the area, and guanacos were introduced south of Mount Pleasant in 1862 so Prince Alfred could hunt them in 1871. However, the introduction was generally unsuccessful, and they died out everywhere except Staats Island. South American gray foxes were introduced and are having a detrimental impact on birds that nest on the shores, as are feral cats. A number of invertebrate species have been introduced since the arrival of Europeans, some filling niches that were not previously filled. House sparrows and domestic geese are the only introduced bird species. Introduced fish species exist, such as the brown trout. Twenty-two introduced plant species are thought to provide a significant threat to local flora. The climate and soil composition combined with limited knowledge and inadequate protection have meant that past attempts to establish trees on the islands have not been very successful, although various attempts have been made over the past 80 years. Having trees in place to disrupt the cold winds of the islands would positively impact sheep farming, improving lamb survival rates and helping with recovery from stress. It could also allow for some crops to be farmed, providing shelter and enhancing soil quality. A 1983 study determined that it may be possible to plant trees for wind shelter, although imported stock would have to be used as it was impractical to raise sufficient numbers on the islands. A small number of sizeable plots exist, but they are largely confined to sites near houses and gardens.

In 1485 his Grandfather Ndrek son of Gjon Kastrioti sent him to the Ottoman sultan to guarantee his loyalty, as an Ottoman vassal. Stanko converted into Islam and received the name Skender (Turkish for Alexander), hence he is also known as Skenderbeg Crnojeviƒá, and became the Ottoman sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Montenegro in 1514‚Äì1528.Denkschriften, p. 46 He is enumerated in Serbian and Montenegrin epic poetry, in which he is sometimes known as Maksim.Fleming, p. 55 Life Stani≈°a (nickname: \\"Stanko\\") was born in Upper Zeta (corresponding roughly to the southern half of Cetinje municipality, Montenegro), which at the time was a nominal vassal of the Republic of Venice, under Great Voivode Stefan I Crnojeviƒá (r. 1451‚Äì1465), Stanko's grandfather. His father Ivan I Crnojeviƒá succeeded as the Lord of Zeta from 1465 to 1490. His mother Gojisava was a daughter of the Albanian George Arianites.

Vlatko then turned against Ivan, and overran much of Zeta, including ≈Ωabljak in 1478, and Scutari in 1479. Ivan fled to his coastline in 1479, and managed to return in 1481 following the death of Mehmed the Conqueror. The new Ottoman sultan Bayezid II faced revolts in Albania, and did not want to face the same in the recently conquered Zeta. The disagreements between the three Crnojeviƒá brothers proved fatal for Zeta, as it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. In 1485, Stanko, disillusioned by the impossibility to succeed his father, went to Bayezid II in Istanbul and converted into Islam, receiving the name Skender.≈†ekularac, p. 99 According to Zlatar, Ivan offered vassalage to Bayezid II, who accepted, but also took Stanko as his hostage. Ivan Crnojeviƒá lost his independence in foreign affairs, but retained complete autonomy at home. Ivan relocated his capital from destroyed ≈Ωabljak to Cetinje, where the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitanate of Zeta was to be seated (Eparchy of Cetinje). Ivan was succeeded by ƒêorƒëe in 1490, who only ruled for six years; he conspired with Western rulers against Bayezid II in 1496, and was forced to leave the country after the Sultan had learnt this. Stefan hoped to succeed, but Bayezid II incorporated Zeta into the Ottoman Empire (known in Turkish as karadag - \\"Black Mountain\\", from Venetian Montenegro), and ended the history of medieval Zeta. The Ottomans administrated Montenegro as any other newly conquered territory, though they were careful not to antagonize the local nobility. That is why they appointed Stanko as pasha. Skender, henceforth known as Skenderbeg Crnojeviƒá, was appointed sanjakbey of Montenegro and the neighbouring Albanian tribes in 1513, under Selim I. The next year, 1514, Bayezid II designated Montenegro a separate region (sanjak). He nominally ruled the region until 1528, but failed to subject the Montenegrin tribes to his authority. The tribes of Old Montenegro were since 1519 under the rule of the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitans of Zeta. In a defter from 1523, he is mentioned as having 2,100 akƒ±ncƒ± in the Crmnica region.Franetoviƒá-B√ªre, p. 420 Skenderbeg Crnojeviƒá ruled from his court at Rijeka Crnojeviƒáa. During the reign of Selim I, he was known as one of the most prominent Muslim administrators of Slavic origins in the northern reaches of the Ottoman Empire. Stani≈°a Crnojeviƒá is known to have commanded an army of approximately 3,000 Akƒ±ncƒ±, and he maintained correspondence with neighboring contemporaries, such as Gazi Husrev-beg. The last mention of Skenderbeg Crnojeviƒá is the Vranjina edict (Vranjinska povelja) which he wrote in 1527, confirming the rights of the Vranjina Monastery.Pavlovic, p. 60 Aftermath and legacy After his death in 1530, a Christian inquisition and conflict began against his followers. The uprising was eventually put down by Gazi Husrev-beg, who was killed in battle against Christian clans. His men, however, succeeded in maintaining order in the region. Mahmud Pasha Bushatli of Shkod√´r, who launched offensives into Montenegro in the 18th century, claimed direct descent from Skenderbeg Crnojeviƒá. He was beheaded during the Battle of Krusi against the forces of Petar I Petroviƒá-Njego≈°, the Exarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Cetinje. He is a main character in King Nikola's play The Empress of the Balkans (\\"Balkanska Carica\\"), written in 1894. Stani≈°a is enumerated in Serbian epic poetry in songs such as Sons of Ivan-bey, Death of Maksim Crnojeviƒá and The Wedding of Maksim Crnojeviƒá which is by far the longest Serbian epic song recorded. The song was introduced to the western audiences by Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz during his lectures at Coll√®ge de France.http://riznicasrpska.net/knjizevnost/index.php?topic=695.0 Inspired by the epic song Serbian playwright Laza Kostiƒá wrote the drama Maksim Crnojeviƒá, which would later serve as a source material for opera The Prince of Zeta by Petar Konjoviƒá.

He is particularly known for his research in cosmology and approximate Bayesian statistical methods.  Biography  After finishing the Nova Gorica Grammar School, Seljak did his undergraduate studies at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, graduating in 1989, and received a master's degree from the same institution in 1991. He then went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, receiving his Ph.D. in 1995. After postdoctoral studies at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, he took faculty positions at Princeton University, the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy, and the University of Zurich, before joining the UC Berkeley physics and astronomy departments in 2008. He also holds a joint appointment with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  Work  Seljak is a cosmologist who is particularly known for his research on cosmic microwave background radiation,. galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing,. and the implications of these observations for the large scale structure of the universe.. In 1997 Seljak predicted existence of B-modes in CMB polarization as a tracer of primordial gravitational waves from inflation . Together with M. Zaldarriaga he developed CMBFAST code for CMB Temperature, E and B-mode polarization and for gravitational lensing effects on CMB. In 2000 he developed the halo model for dark matter and galaxy clustering statistics. Much of Seljak's recent work has been focused on how to extract fundamental properties of our universe from cosmological observations using analytical methods and numerical simulations. He has developed cosmological generative models of dark matter, stars and cosmic gas distributions, including differentiable FastPM code and its extensions. Seljak is actively developing methods for accelerated approximate Bayesian methodologies, and applying them to cosmology, astronomy, and other sciences. Examples of this work are expectation optimization of L2 f-divergence for stochastic variational Bayes inference, Gaussianized bridge sampling for Bayesian evidence, and BayesFast, a surrogate model based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. Seljak is developing machine learning methods with applications to cosmology, astronomy, and other sciences. Examples are Fourier based Gaussian process for analysis of time and/or spatially ordered data, generative models with explicit physics symmetries (translation, rotation), and sliced iterative transport methods for density estimation and sampling.

The PS-2 is constructed with a steel tube fuselage and a wooden wing, all covered in doped aircraft fabric covering. The wings lack spoilers of other glide-path control devices and are supported by dual, parallel struts. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel and a skid. Operational history Franklin XPS-2 The prototype Eaglet performed a number of long tows, including one flown by Frank Hawks from California to Elmira, New York in 1930 and is now in the National Air and Space Museum. In 1934, the PS-2 was the glider of choice for the Lustig Skytrain experiment. The concept was to tow three gliders in tandem, taking off from New York City and releasing one each over Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. The gliders were piloted by Jack O'Meara, PS-2 designer R.E. Franklin and Stan Smith. The Skytrain was intended to be a proof-of-concept for a future airline service, but was not pursued. The PS-2 was also used in 1934 for a United States Navy primary flight training experiment in Pensacola, Florida, designed by Ralph Barnaby The PS-2 was also flown by many early glider pilots including Richard Chichester du Pont, Warren Eaton, Floyd Sweet and Stan Smith. In 1983, two were reported as being still flown and one was under restoration by the designer's son, Chuck Franklin.

He was the father of the social scientists, Max and Alfred Weber. Biography Max Weber was born in Bielefeld, on May 31, 1836. He came from a family of Westphalian origin, with a background as merchants and industrialists in the textile business. He was a brother of the entrepreneur Carl David Weber. He studied at G√∂ttingen, where he became member of Burschenschaft Hannovera (fraternity),:de:Burschenschaft Hannovera G√∂ttingen and Berlin and received a doctorate, becoming a doctor of law. Between 1862 and 1869, he worked for the municipal council in Erfurt as a magistrate, having previously held this position in Berlin. He began working in Berlin in 1893 and finally, in Charlottenburg. He was a leading member of the National Liberal Party and was a member of the central executive committee. He was a member of the Berlin City Council. Between 1872 and 1877 and again from 1879 to 1884, Weber was a member of the German Empire Reichstag. He was also a member of the Prussian House of Representatives () from 1868 to 1882 and from 1884 to 1897, the National Debt Commission (), and the Prussian Debt Commission (). Politically, he was a \\"constitutionalist\\" (a supporter of the monarchy and the constitution) and a follower of Rudolf von Bennigsen. He wrote several journal articles on politics and statistics. Throughout his life, he avoided acting in a way that would make him seem radical, or not part of the establishment. He died on August 10, 1897 in Riga while traveling with his friend. The cause of his death has been uncertain, possibly a bleeding ulcer. He was buried in Berlin (Kirchhof Jerusalem und Neue Kirche IV cemetery). Personal life In 1863, he married Helene Weber, n√©e Fallenstein (1844‚Äì1919), daughter of poet George Friedrich Fallenstein (1790‚Äì1853). They had eight children, six of whom reached adulthood, including the sociologist Max (Jr.) and the economist Alfred Weber. His daughter, Clara (1875‚Äì1953), married one of Theodor Mommsen's sons. His house was often visited by prominent politicians, such as Rudolf von Bennigsen and immediate subordinates of Otto von Bismarck. He was also visited by intellectuals, like professors Heinrich von Treitschke, Heinrich von Sybel, and Theodor Mommsen. His wife was an intellectual herself and an active participant in the discussions. Unlike his ascetic wife, Weber \\"enjoyed earthly pleasures\\".Lutz Kaelber Max Weber‚Äôs Personal Life, 1886-1893 This created marital tension in the family and was one of the reasons he grew estranged from his son, Max Weber, Jr. The conflicting influences of his parents were often cited as important influences on the younger Max. Two months before his death, he had a serious quarrel with his son, Max, regarding his treatment of his wife, a quarrel that was never resolved and shortly afterward, following his funeral, young Max suffered a severe and long depression, events that are all seen as related to one another. The event was such an influence on the young Weber that it resulted in several articles. Notes * a Numerous sources refer to Max Weber as Max Weber, Sr. or senior. This likely serves to differentiate between the more famous young Max Weber and his father.

Built in 1955 to replace the smaller hospital at the Kaiser Steel Mill, the facility now serves over 400,000 members of Kaiser Permanente's health care plans in the area. The hospital is accredited by the Joint Commission. According to U.S. News & World Report, the hospital performs highly in diabetes & endocrinology, ear, nose & throat, geriatrics, pulmonology, and urology. In the most recent year with available data, Kaiser Fontana had 90,675 emergency department visits, 26,640 admissions, performed 4,956 inpatient and 21,790 outpatient surgeries.  History  In 1943, Henry J. Kaiser and Dr. Sidney R. Garfield opened a 50-bed hospital, housing six physicians for the 3000 employees and their families at the new Kaiser Steel Mill in Fontana, California, offering a then revolutionary pre-paid health care plan for $0.60/week for adults, and $0.30/week for children. In 1945, the Kaiser Permanente health plan was opened to the public, providing the opportunity of affordable health care to the residents of Fontana. Following the end of World War II, as the steel mill and community continued to grow, the demand rapidly outgrew the small facility, and in 1955, the hospital was moved to its current location on Sierra Ave. It has undergone an almost constant pace of expansion and remodel to reach its current state, with major expansions about once a decade; it now contains over 400 beds, houses over 150 doctors, and employs 6000.  New construction  In 2009, construction started on a 'replacement hospital' on the Fontana Campus. The new 7-story facility, being built to meet requirements of CA Senate Bill (SB) 1953 and slated to open in 2013, will have 314 beds and offer major technological and systematic improvements over the current, aging facility. The new hospital is pursuing LEED certification by the US Green Building Council. Environmentally friendly features of the building include: energy efficient lighting, use of reclaimed water for landscaping and cooling towers, dual pane exterior window glazing, and natural day lighting. Medical education The hospital operates the following programs: family medicine residency (est. 1975), internal medicine residency (est. 2013), psychiatry residency (est. 2014), sports medicine fellowship, geriatrics fellowship, and child and adolescent psychiatry fellowship.

According to the early chronicler Thomas Dimsdale, the gang attempted to steal gold while it was being transported; they killed many travelers who resisted. Sheriff Henry Plummer of Bannack, Montana was accused of leading the group, and was executed by a group of vigilantes from Virginia City in January 1864, along with several other alleged gang members. Criminal activities Early historians, originating with Dimsdale, stated that the gang consisted of over one hundred members at its height. Their headquarters was supposedly based at the Rattlesnake Ranch, twelve miles outside of Virginia City, Montana. The gang allegedly killed over one hundred people (only eight deaths have been confirmed by documented sources) and stole a significant amount of gold while it was being transported the seventy-mile distance between Virginia City and Bannack. Researchers believed the gang operated in small units in order to prey upon travelers from different towns. The gang was said to place watchmen in mine offices and gambling offices to determine when gold would be shipped. The members of the gang were believed to use secret code words for identification, as well as a secret knot in their ties. Many residents soon became frustrated by the rate of robberies and murders. In late 1863 they formed a committee of vigilantes (the Montana Vigilantes) to combat the rash of murders and robberies. Vigilante justice Plummer was initially suspected of criminal activity after two residents who had been robbed claimed that they had recognized him during the robberies. Another local robbing victim said that, after he confronted Sheriff Plummer about the danger of the roads, Plummer offered to return some of his money to him. The vigilante committee arrested three men in Nevada City in December 1863, charging them with murder. One man was executed, and the group banished the other two. After learning of this event, boot-maker George Lane rode to Bannack to tell Plummer about the incident. For the next month, the vigilante committee arrested many local men suspected of being part of Plummer's gang. They passed sentences ranging from execution to flogging to banishment. Shortly before one man was hanged, he told the assembled crowd that Plummer was the ringleader behind the recent crime spree. This confirmed the suspicions held by the vigilantes, and they soon arrested Plummer. After being arrested, he tried to bribe his captors but was unsuccessful. Between December 1863 and February 1864 the vigilante committee executed Plummer and twenty-two alleged members of his gang, including George Lane. At one point the vigilantes assembled a force of over 500 men and sealed off Virginia City in order to catch gang members. The gallows on which Plummer was hanged had been built at his request as sheriff in relation to an earlier case. Over 5,000 people assembled to watch the hangings of the gang members. Modern scholarship Scholars have noted a lack of documentation and other historical evidence pertaining to the Innocents. The earliest accounts of the gang have been shown to be unreliable. The descriptions of activities and secret codes conform to a common pattern of frontier mythography. (The number of members was \\"over a hundred,\\" the number of victims also \\"over a hundred,\\" their secret password was \\"I am innocent\\"). Frederick Allen and other modern scholars have questioned whether the gang was as influential as told. Mather and Boswell are among scholars who deny that any gang conducted the relatively few documented robberies in the area, saying they were more likely the work of a small number of independent (or at most loosely organized) outlaws.

He participated in organizing a rebellion against the Axis forces on 4 July 1941 in ≈†ehitluci near Banja Luka. This was the final agreement by the Communists to begin a rebellion in Bosanska Krajina. In the second half of June 1941 Karabegoviƒá visited Prijedor, Bosanski Novi, Krupa and Bihaƒá where he held a few meetings with Partisan military officers and the Party's committees and transferred decisions made by the Communist Party about plans of a rebellion.

It is known as the Mexican golden red rump tarantula or the Amula red rump tarantula. The carapace is a light golden color and the abdomen dark, covered with long red hairs. Females typically live for about 15 years (up to 20). Males usually live about 5 years or up to 12 months after the last molt.http://www.terrarium.com.pl/zobacz/brachypelma- albiceps-630.htmlhttp://brachypelma.org/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=12:balbiceps&catid;=7:bcaresheets&Itemid;=50 Description Females of Brachypelma albiceps have a body length of about 65 mm. The fourth leg is longest at about 60 mm. The carapace is covered with fine hair; its apparent color depends on the illumination, varying from sandy grey through to rose or yellow. The pedipalps and the first two pairs of legs may be lighter than the last two pairs of legs. The abdomen is dark with bright red longish hairs (setae). The spermatheca has two rounded seminal receptacles. Taxonomy Brachypelma albiceps has a somewhat tangled taxonomic history. In 1897, F. O. Pickard-Cambridge described the species Eurypelma pallidum (now Aphonopelma pallidum) on the basis of two males collected in Chihuahua, Mexico. He assumed that two female specimens, collected independently in Guerrero, belonged to the same species. In 1903, R. I. Pocock used the new name Brachypelma albiceps for these two females. He did not give a full description, merely saying in a footnote that the name was for the females from Guerrero that Pickard-Cambridge had doubtfully assigned to the same species as the males. Alexander Petrunkevitch in 1939 and Carl Roewer in 1942 restored Pickard-Cambridge's original name, treating albiceps in this context as a junior synonym of pallidum. After studying the original specimens (which neither Petrunkevitch nor Roewer had done), Andew Smith in 1995 reinstated Pocock's distinction, recognizing the females as a separate species, which, however, he placed in the genus Aphonopelma rather than Brachypelma. In 1997, G√ºnter Schmidt described a new species, Brachypelmides ruhnaui, and in 2004, transferred Pocock's Brachypelma albiceps to Brachypelmides. In 2005, Arturo Locht et al. restored Smith's Aphonopelma albiceps to its current genus Brachypelma and also synonymized Schmidt's Brachypelmides ruhnaui. Distribution and habitat Brachypelma albiceps is endemic to the central highlands of Mexico, especially in Guerrero and south of Morelos. In the wild, they build long burrows, typically under large rocks, but may inhabit nests abandoned by rodents or other animals. They are most active at night and dusk. Conservation In 1994, all Brachypelma species were placed on CITES Appendix II, thus restricting trade. Nevertheless, large numbers of tarantulas caught in the wild continue to be smuggled out of Mexico, including species of Brachypelma. Food Their diet typically includes crickets, grasshoppers, beetles, and cockroaches. In captivity, live food is typically required, such as moths, mealworms and pinky mice, as dead food may be ignored. Reproduction Females lay cocoons containing roughly 500 (up to 900) eggs two months after mating. Spiderlings hatch 8‚Äì10 weeks later. Pets B. albiceps is commonly available at pet stores. Lighting is not needed, as these spiders naturally prefer darkness.

He authored 18 volumes of responsa, spanning over 50 years, entitled Mishneh Halachos. Additionally, he authored some 25 other seforim, including a commentary on Simeon Kayyara's BeHag. Toward the end of his life, he relocated from Brooklyn, New York to Jerusalem. Biography Menashe Klein was born in 1924 in the town of Orlova, Czechoslovakia (now known as Irlyava, Ukraine) near the city of Ungvar, Czechoslovakia (now known as Uzhhorod, Ukraine).See Hemmendinger and Krell, The Children of Buchenwald: Child Survivors of the Holocaust and Their Post- war Lives (Gefen, 2000). He studied in the yeshiva of the Rav of Ungvar, Yosef Elimelech Kahane. During World War II, he was incarcerated in Auschwitz- Birkenau, Auschwitz-Buna, and finally in Buchenwald. At Buchenwald, he was sent out to \\"Stein,\\" a Nazi satellite camp at Eschershausen, but was listed in camp records as returned to Buchenwald, where he was liberated and where he completed a postwar military interview.Based on Red Cross International Tracing Service documents at the USHMM. On June 2, 1945, he was evacuated by train with 427 other former Buchenwald inmates ages 7 to 17 - among them Yisrael Meir Lau, Naphtali Lau-Lavie, and Elie Wiesel - to France, where they boarded at a sanitarium in √âcouis. He was transferred to Ambloy together with about 100 other boys who desired kosher facilities and a higher level of religious observance. This group was under the supervision of social worker Judith Hemmendinger, who attempted to re-acclimate the boys to normal living. The group was transferred to Taverny after Yom Kippur 1945.Schmidt, Shira, and Mantaka, Bracha. \\"A Prince in a Castle\\". Ami, September 21, 2014, pp. 136-143.

MicroVolts released its first closed beta phase on August 12, 2010 and launched its second closed beta on January 28, 2011. The game's open beta phase began on March 10, 2011. Rock Hippo Productions announced that the official release of the game would start on June 9, 2011. It was shut down on 9. September 2017 9AM GMT and the rights were allegedly sold to Masangsoft. The game was ranked as the Second Most Anticipated MMO of 2010 by MMOSite's Reader's Choice Awards. It was also named as MMOGames' Editor's Choice in April 2011.  Story  The game is set in the real world where toys have come to life behind closed doors. A secret battle began between nine original figures, code-named MicroVolts. Naomi, Knox, Pandora, C.H.I.P were the names of the original prototypes, but they were soon joined by other modified versions (Kai, Simon, Amelia, Sophitia, and $harkill Khan). The toys battle it out for valuable battery resources and ultimate supremacy of the Micro World.  Weapons  Unique to MicroVolts is the fact that players have access to all seven types of weapons within a given match, unrestricted by class. The weapons are Melee, Rifle, Shotgun, Sniper Rifle, Gatling Gun, Bazooka and Grenade Launcher. Each player starts out equipped with a basic weapon of each type, and can purchase more weapons through Micro Points from the in-game shop. New players receive a set of trial weapons for a week. These possess much better stats than the default stock weapons. Unlike weapons bought with RT, these need no repairs. This helps the player to build up an amount of MP before leveling up.  Gameplay  = Game modes = There are 17 game modes in MicroVolts: Team Death Match, Free For All, Item Match, Capture the Battery, Close Combat, Elimination, Zombie Mode, Arms Race, Invasion, Scrimmage, Bomb Battle and Boss Battle. Each mode requires the player to use different skills in order to succeed. While some of the modes rely on team play and cooperation, such as Team Death Match and Elimination, other modes require a player to play offensively, such as Free For All and Close Combat and Arms Race. Boss Battle is a special mode where 1-4 players have to fight an enormous robot and mini-robots called \\"Trackers\\". Players must avoid attacks and destroy the mini-robots in order to survive. Successfully defeating the boss and winning the mode will give each player a gift box of Diamond, Gold, Silver or Bronze; Diamond is the rarest. Each contains a random gift, and better gifts correspond to the rarity of the box. Completing this mode doesn't give the player any experience points or micro points (MP), as in other modes. = Maps = There are 27 different maps, each featuring a different theme, layout and size. The 27 toy-like environment maps include Junk Yard, Castle, Neighbourhood, House Top, Model Ship, PVC Factory, Chess, Battle Mine, Toy Garden, Magic Paper Land, The Studio, Toy Fleet, Academy, Hobby Shop, Bitmap, Wild West, Rumpus Room, Cargo, PVC Factory (Night), Forgotten Junk Yard, Beach, Tracker Factory, Bitmap 2, Rock Band, Rock Band W, Rock Band S, Foosball and Championship Castle siege. The Reactor map is only for Invasion. Academy Invasion is the only map for the Boss Battle. Some maps are exclusive to certain game modes.  Game features  =Battery Charge= Battery Charge is the game's reward system. By completing certain activities, players are able to unlock new rewards in the form of Micro Points, forum signature, image/video posting privileges, poll creation, and for a 25% charge earn a \\"RockHippo\\" set playable for the Knox character. The Battery Charge System is currently removed but developers are planning on a similar, better system. = Achievement system = By completing certain objectives in-game, players unlock achievements. This allows players to gain Micro Points to spend in-game. There have been no updates to this system since it was first introduced. = Community events and forum = MicroVolts regularly hosts game tournaments, social media and forum events for players. These have included a Splash of Colour Event, which invited players to colour-in a wallpaper design, submitted as an official MicroVolts wallpaper; and a CrossVolt Contest which quizzed players on their MicroVolts game IQ. = Social media = The game engages with players through Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and MySpace. Its website features a clubhouse area which grants players access to unique community features. A clan feature was introduced to the game upon its official release. Players can create, manage and challenge other clans in-game for domination of the Micro World.  Free-to-play  MicroVolts is released under the free-to-play category of games; the game itself is free to download and play, and revenue is generated from micropayments. Players may buy the in- game currency, called Rock Tokens (RT), to purchase exclusive items to customize their characters. Hair, face, top, bottom, hands, shoes and accessories for each character can upgrade the character's abilities, such as faster run speed, additional health points and extra bullets. Additional weapon upgrades can also be obtained. Customizable options can also be purchased through in-game points called Micro Points (MP). These can be earned by playing the game. The number of Micro Points given to a player is determined by their kill/death ratio, their mission accomplishments, a win or loss and the duration of the match. Micro Points are also given for accomplishing certain objectives in the in-game Achievement System, completing objectives in their Battery Charge system, and leveling up characters. Gaining levels has no impact on gameplay, but serves as a useful indicator of skill. The game keeps track of individual performance with every weapon and character as well. A comprehensive update of MicroVolts in 2011 introduced a new \\"Capsule\\" icon from which players could get items. The capsule machine can currently be used with RT. Rock Hippo Productions introduced MP mode for the capsule machine, but they removed this feature soon after. This was most likely because people exploited it by creating thousands of new accounts, and spinning the machine endlessly until they hit an MP Jackpot, resulting in millions of MP points. Most capsule weapons do not require repairing, and MP weapons are less powerful than RT weapons. Players level up their characters through gaining experience points within a played match. Experience points are determined by a player's kill/death ratio in a match, a win/loss of a match, mission accomplishments and the duration of the match. When a player levels up, additional customizable options become available.  Reception and recognition  MicroVolts was awarded Second Place in MMOSite's Reader's Choices for the Most Anticipated MMO of 2010, and was MMOGames' Editor's Choice in April 2011. The gaming community welcomed this third-person shooter as something new and different, as most shooter MMOs are from the first-person perspective. The ability for characters to carry seven weapons at once, freely switching between each, \\"makes gameplay feel varied and unique\\". Reviews have highlighted the game's larger-than-life environments as giving the game a \\"different feel and approach to the online-action genre\\", and having a distinct fast-paced gameplay. MicroVolts was also noted by some gamers as bearing similarities to Team Fortress 2, as an early trailer for MicroVolts had a comparable graphic style. All the weapons in the game are equivalents of TF2 weapons.  The capsule machine  The capsule machine (released November 11, 2011) features \\"rares\\" that are unique and generally cannot be won anywhere else in-game. Rares include gold, silver, and bronze forms. All seven weapons have versions of \\"rares.\\" Rare clothes also exist for each character. Some have since been retired. The Capsule Machine costs 1,000 RT (roughly $1) a spin, and the user spinning is guaranteed to receive an item. The chances of winning a rare based on an 100k RockToken / Weapon experiment are roughly expressed by a 1 : 75 ratio (or a 1 in 75 chance of winning a rare). Clothes are easier to win, and have a rough 1 : 25 ratio per rare. Whether the clothing won is HP or Speed is completely random and determined on the spot.

Pope Benedict XVI confirmed his selection on 25 March 2011. =Enthronement= Shevchuk was enthroned as Major Archbishop on 27 March 2011 in the UGCC's new mother church, the Patriarchal Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ in Kyiv, which was still under construction at the time. He was the first primate to be enthroned in Kyiv in 400 years.Most previous Major Archbishops had been installed in Lviv. The original Metropolitan Archdiocese of Kyiv-Galicia was suppressed in 1838 and Lviv served as the primatial see of the UGCC from 1808 until 2005, when it was transferred back to Kyiv. Representatives of all three main branches of Ukrainian Eastern Orthodoxy were present for his enthronement, including Metropolitan Mefodiy (UOAC), Metropolitan Volodymyr (UOC-MP), and Bishop (UOC-KP).At the time Yevstratiy was an auxiliary bishop of Kyiv for the UOC-KP (and thus an assistant to Patriarch Filaret of Kyiv). He has since become the UOC-KP Archbishop of Chernihiv. =Visits to Canada= On 31 May 2012, Sviatoslav held his first pastoral visit to Canada. He visited Edmonton after being met by Eparch David Motiuk and other clergy upon his arrival in Calgary. He attended events at St. Josaphat Cathedral and St. George Parish. On 2 June, the head of the UGCC celebrated the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Parish of the Assumption of the Holy Mother of God in Calgary. He again returned to Canada later in 2012, and on Sunday, 9 September, after the participants took an oath the previous day, Shevchuk celebrated the Divine Liturgy to open a worldwide Ukrainian Catholic Synod of Bishops at Saints Volodymyr and Olha Cathedral in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. He visited Miller Comprehensive High School and stopped at St. Basil's Ukrainian Catholic Church and St. Athanasius Ukrainian Catholic Church, on 21 September 2012 in Regina, Saskatchewan. He stopped in Vancouver to mark the 100th anniversary of the first Canadian visit of a Ukrainian Catholic bishop. In May 2014, he again visited Canada to mark the arrival of the Sheptytsky Institute within the University of St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto. In October 2016, he traveled to Ontario on the occasion of the consecration of the church of St. Elias the Prophet in Brampton. Views =On the patriarchal title= On 29 March 2011, Shevchuk said \\"I'm departing with my bishops and all of the metropolitans of our church to Rome, because it's our duty to make a courtesy visit to the Holy Father (i.e., the Pope),\\" he said at a press conference in Kyiv. The UGCC leader said that the UGCC Synod of Bishops had prepared a number of proposals for the Pope. \\"We're really going to tell of how our church is developing and that each developing church [becomes] a patriarchate, because a patriarchate is a period in the completion of the development of a church,\\" he said. Cardinal Slipyj in the 1960s already petitioned for the patriarchal title. Instead, Pope Paul VI responded by devising the rank of \\"Major Archbishop\\", which grants all the prerogatives of an Eastern patriarch to the head of a self- governing church in full communion, just without the title itself. On 12 June 2012 Shevchuk was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. =On his own election= In April 2011, Shevchuk said while visiting Rome to meet Pope Benedict XVI, that he believes he was elected \\"despite my age\\". Ukrainian bishops from around the world, who met in a synod in late March to elect a new Major Archbishop for their church, were looking for a leader who could \\"unite the church in Ukraine and outside Ukraine\\", who could \\"promote the unity of Christians in Ukraine and establish some sort of dialogue with the new Ukrainian government. ...The No. 1 priority for each head of a church is evangelization, preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ in today's world. ...Of course, our church is growing, is developing its structures, ... but we are conscious that the decision about the patriarchate belongs to the Holy Father and we would never press him. We respect his freedom.\\" Shevchuk said his age is not really so shocking when one considers that the average age of his priests is about 35. \\"In our tradition, we do have a married clergy, but a married clergy is not the main reason we have so many young priests\\", he added. On 22 June 2011 Shevchuk was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches to a five-year term. =On meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch= When asked in April 2011 whether he would wish to meet the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill, Shevchuk said that \\"I would like very much to visit him and hold a personal meeting with him. I am convinced that in peacefully and openly communicating with each other, we can relieve any tension ... I think that today, we should heal the wounds rather than irritate and deepen them. One can heal the wounds of our memory only with mutual forgiveness. Therefore, as for any of our brethren or neighbors who wounded us or were wounded by us, the best way to communicate is to be open in a brotherly dialogue, be open to the purification of our memory, to ask for forgiveness and to forgive.\\" External links *Official profile of Sviatoslav Shevchuk at Facebook *Official profile of Sviatoslav Shevchuk at VK Footnotes References 1970 births Living people Ukrainian Eastern Catholics People from Stryi Bishops of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church Leaders of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas alumni ","title":"Sviatoslav Shevchuk"},{"id":"31286293","text":"The Deepside Deejays are a Romanian band formed in 2008 by vocalist Victor de la Pena, DJ Nick Kamarera, MC Vibearena and keyboardist Dave Pryce.

Life  Sabina was the daughter of George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1484‚Äì1543) from his second marriage to Hedwig of M√ºnsterberg-Oels (1508‚Äì1531), daughter of the Duke Charles I of M√ºnsterberg-Oels. The princess was brought up by her stepmother Emilie of Saxony in the Lutheran faith. On 12 February 1548 Sabina married Elector John George of Brandenburg (1525‚Äì1598) in Ansbach. His first wife Sophie of Legnica was Sabina's cousin. The day before the wedding ceremony, she solemnly renounced her possible paternal inheritance. The district, city and castle of Plauen were made over to her as her Wittum. Since Plauen, like all districts of Brandenburg, was not free of debt, lengthy negotiations about the compensation for her dowry of 12,000 guilders led to the district and monastery of Spandau also being assigned to her. Sabina's husband was heir apparent to the Electorate of Brandenburg for 23 years. The couple spent this time on various castles in the territories of Brandenburg. The family's official residence was Zechlin castle in Rheinsberg near Wittstock. Here Sabina cared for her own children and also for her stepson Joachim Friedrich, who later became Elector of Brandenburg. Sabina's thrifty life style caused Rheinsberg to prosper for a while. After Sabina's husband became Elector in 1571, she had an influence on religious affairs and was a patron of churches and schools. She supported the sick and the poor and had regular personal contact with the doctor Leonhard Thurneysser. Sabina died on 2 November 1575 and was buried in the Berlin Cathedral.  Offspring  From her marriage Sabina had the following children:Princess Sabine zu Brandenburg, Electress of Brandenburg in: ourfamilyhistories.org [retrieved 14 November 2015].Sabine Princess of Brandenburg in: tree.familyhistory.uk.com [retrieved 14 November 2015]. # George Albert (19 February 1555 ‚Äì 8 January 1557) # John (1557 ‚Äì died young), twin with Albert # Albert (1557 ‚Äì died young), twin with John # Magdalena Sabina (1559 ‚Äì died young) # Erdmuthe (26 June 1561 ‚Äì 13 November 1623), married in 1577 to Duke John Frederick of Pomerania # Marie (1562 ‚Äì died young) # Hedwig (1563 ‚Äì died young) # Magdalena (1564 ‚Äì died young) # Margaret (1565 ‚Äì died young) # Anna Maria (3 February 1567 ‚Äì 4 November 1618), married in 1581 to Duke Barnim X of Pomerania # Sophie (6 June 1568 ‚Äì 7 December 1622), married in 1582 to Elector Christian I of Saxony  Notes   References  * Daniel Martin Ernst Kirchner, The princesses and queens on the throne of the Hohenzollerns, Part 2: The last eight princesses, Berlin 1867, , p. 4-31. - 1529 births 1575 deaths Electresses of Brandenburg House of Hohenzollern Electoral Princesses of Brandenburg Burials at Berlin Cathedral ","title":"Sabina of Brandenburg-Ansbach"},{"id":"31286357","text":"The women's 70 kg (154 lbs) Semi-Contact category at the W.A.K.O.

Early life and education ≈Ωivorad Kovaƒçeviƒá was born in Jagodina, Kingdom of Yugoslavia (present-day Serbia), of father Ilija, who spent World War II as a prisoner in Mauthausen, and mother Darinka. His older brother, Radovan, was killed by Germans in Jagodina in 1941; he is survived by an older sister, Stojanka. ≈Ωivorad Kovaƒçeviƒá was educated at an all-male Gymnasium called \\"≈†esta Mu≈°ka\\" in Belgrade, and then the Journalist Diplomatic Academy (Vi≈°a Novinarsko-Diplomatska ≈†kola) graduating in 1952. He received his M.A. in political science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1961, and specialized in international relations at Harvard University in 1963. Political career Kovaƒçeviƒá worked as the Editor-in-Chief of the magazine Komuna (1954‚Äì1962), Director of Public Administration Institute (1962‚Äì1964), Vice-Secretary of the Executive Council of Serbia (1964‚Äì1967), and Secretary General of the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities (1967‚Äì1973). He served as Deputy Mayor and then Mayor of Belgrade for eight years, from 1974 to 1982. During his tenure, Sava Centar was built in time to host the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, as well as the Hotel InterContinental for the meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Many other projects were carried out during this period, most notably, Ada Ciganlija and Kliniƒçki Centar Srbije (Serbian Clinical Center). Kovaƒçeviƒá was quoted as being proud of the fact that each year during his term between 10,000 and 12,000 apartments were built in the capital. On a more symbolic level, as a mayor, he set up a monument to Karaƒëorƒëe (the leader of the first Serbian uprising against the Turks) on the great lawn in front of the National Library of Serbia. From 1982 to 1986, Kovaƒçeviƒá was a Minister in the government of Milka Planinc, a Prime Minister of Yugoslavia who tried to undertake economic reform after years of stagnation. Working in the federal government, he was a member of the Federal Executive Council, as well as the President of the Foreign Affairs Commission, paving the way to a career that was more international in perspective. Kovaƒçeviƒá was appointed Ambassador of Yugoslavia to the United States in 1987, but was recalled in 1989 after his disapproval of Slobodan Miloseviƒá's policy, which he openly criticized in Washington. He was noted as one of a few citizens of Belgrade who met six American presidents, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush, and five Secretaries of State, Henry Kissinger, Cyrus Vance, George P. Shultz, James Baker, and Lawrence Eagleburger. His personal contribution, while ambassador in the US, in sending Nikola Tesla's assets from the United States to Belgrade is widely acknowledged. NGO activities After his recall from the post of the Ambassador to the United States in 1989, Kovaƒçeviƒá retired from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and spent the rest of his life as a prominent NGO activist and promoter of Serbia's integration in the European Union. He was the President of the Forum on International Relations, and in 1994, he joined the European Movement in Serbia, whose president he was to become in 1999. He held that position for the rest of his life. Based on his personal account, Kovaƒçeviƒá was offered the post of Foreign Minister in the Government of Milan Paniƒá in 1992, but was prevented by Borisav Joviƒá from taking it. Kovaƒçeviƒá was one of the founders of the Igman Initiative, which rallies 140 organizations in the so-called 'Dayton Triangle' (Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina). The Igman Initiative launched a \\"mini-Schengen\\" project, to bring about better relations on the territory of Former Yugoslavia similar to those that exist in the European Union, primarily in terms of a visa-free regime. The organization was founded following Kovaƒçeviƒá's endeavors in April 1995, when, with a group of 38 anti-war intellectuals and activists from FR Yugoslavia, Kovaƒçeviƒá crossed Mount Igman to join and support the citizens of Sarajevo during the siege. Kovaƒçeviƒá was the first President of the Foreign Relations Council of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia, established in 2007. Academic activities In parallel with his work in helping build democratic relations in Serbia and elsewhere, Kovaƒçeviƒá was a prolific writer.

These characters imitate French cursiva letters of the Renaissance. History Civilit√© types used in a French courtesy book (1785) The first book in the new type was Dialogue de la vie et de la mort, a French version of Innocenzo Ringhieri's dialogue, in the dedication of which Granjon explains his purpose in cutting the new design. He calls the typeface \\"lettres fran√ßaises\\" and suggests that France like other nations should have a type based on the national hand; his model was contemporary handwriting. The popular name for the type came from the titles of two early books in which it was used: Erasmus's La Civilit√© puerile, Jean Bell√®re, Antwerp, 1559, and La Civile honestet√© pour les enfans, R. Breton, Paris, 1560. \\"Civilit√©\\" meant \\"good manners\\" and it was thought an advantage that children should learn to read from a book printed in a type resembling current handwriting. Between 1557 and 1562 Granjon printed some 20 books in this type. Two other Paris printers had typefaces made that were very similar and Granjon himself supplied his version to Guillaume Silvius and to Christophe Plantin at Antwerp.Johnson, A. F. (1966) Type Designs; 3rd ed. London: Andre Deutsch; pp. 138-40 Philippe Danfrie was another early creator of civilit√© types.

In the latter, they were used until the second half of the 19th century to print children's lesson-books teaching civility and manners from which the type got its name.Elias, Norbert, 1978: The Civilizing Process: a History of Manners. Urizen Books, New York. p.54 Civilit√© type did not win great popularity in France although used occasionally at all periods. Another version of civilit√© were used in one book printed in 1597 by Claude Micard, and two others in two books printed by Jean de Tournes in 1581 and 1598. In the mid 19th century Louis Perrin of Lyons printed J. Soulary's Sonnets humouristiques in civilit√©.

The perimeter of the mound was buried under a metre of soil but the remains of rectangular buildings were found in 2 phases. Building walls were of wall made of stiff earth or clay with pebble bases and large stones in the upper layers. The floors were layered with white plaster with plastered and even burnished walls. Hearths and other areas were constructed of plaster or clay. The wide variety of materials recovered included a stone assemblage of tools, obsidian blades, basalt bowls and hammers, clay sling ammunition, finely denticulated flint blades, scrapers, borers and a few axes. Pottery included Halafian painted shards both pattern and plain burnished with incised decoration including horizontal or vertical lines with dots, waves, zig-zags and cross-hatched designs. some with an application of red wash. These finds were significant as they represented the most southerly Halaf type painted pottery yet found.

A product of Houston's inner city neighborhoods, Alejandro grew up in the barrios and ghettos that would enrich his consciousness. Living on the east side, he tasted all the spices of Salsa music, Tejano and life lessons told through Mariachi music. Attending schools in Houston's 5th ward, he was heavily influenced by the sweet sounds of soul, intimacy of jazz and hard hits of hip hop. From an early age music was all around, and his diverse influences only help broaden his music appreciation and creative palette. Early life = (1987‚Äì1995) = Alejandro's professional career began as a senior in high school, with the co-founding of Tejano-pop band Valentino. Valentino was led by David Flores, who departed another Houston band called La Mafia. Alejandro joined the band on keyboards, having taught himself after saving a year to buy his first keyboard, an Ensoniq ESQ-1. He quickly mastered the synthesizer and its capabilities, but his music technique was limited. Texas musician Joel Guzman gave him lessons not only on technique but playing in the Tejano style. Technology was fast becoming the norm in music and Alejandro took the opportunity to learn about MIDI, sequencing, sampling, and other digital technologies available at the time. His keyboard arsenal grew to include an E-mu Emax, Roland R-8 drum machine and a Yamaha C1 music computer, one of the first MS-DOS computers made to run music software. Valentino was known throughout the state as the most electronic band in Tejano, in a genre where traditional instruments of drums, bass, guitars, and accordions were the norm. The band would perform concert using these various technologies, midi sequencing backing tracks, triggering audio samples, and blending electronic pop sounds with the tradition Tejano arrangements. Rodney's reputation grew as a skilled music programmer, and he continued to work on his performance technique. But the calls came to help other artist in their quest to incorporate electronic instruments. Valentino toured in the Tejano circuit with great artist like Little Joe y La Familia, Groupo Mazz, Selena y Los Dinos, La Sombra, and La Mafia to name a few. During these travel he connected with many great musicians and began to collaborate on other projects. A.B. Quintanilla III asked Rodney to come work with Selena contributing arrangement and production services on her song \\"Amame\\",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zQqcMdNbds on the Entre Mi Mundo project. Tony Guerrero of La Sombra from Chicago, asked Rodney to sequence and program sounds for their projects, and a solo project by the lead singer Gavino Guerrero. Albert \\"Tiger\\" Diaz, another singer in the group, recorded a solo project and he too hired Alejandro for arranging and keyboard programing. These relationships would lead to further collaboration many years later. : Valentino continued to perform, but making the crossover to more Latin American pop music market. They performed original bilingual pop songs recorded at Sugarhill Studios in Houston. Traveling to LA, they worked with producers Michael Sembello, and Preston Glass, on demos pursuing a record deal. In 1992, Valentino performed on Buscando Estrellas, the Latin version of the American show Star Search, and won in the band category. \\"Vamos A Bailar\\" was a song written by Alejandro, the group used to win with. That trip to LA introduced him to other artist one being Coyote of Ponce, Puerto Rico. Rodney contributed a bi-lingual song called \\"Mas Dura\\" to their effort on the American show, Star Search. The band went on to win the season finale and signed to Capitol/EMI Latino. Their first single was \\"Bien Dura\\", a full Spanish version of the original bilingual song. Unknowingly, Alejandro became the only songwriter to win Star Search in Spanish and English. In 1992, Valentino signed a record deal with BMG International. Alejandro contributed 8 of the 10 tracks record for the album and project was released in 1993. While in the studio, Rodney met Jamie Glaser, a guitarist who mentioned the value of his Berklee education. Being self-taught in pop music got him only so far, so Rodney set his sights on Berklee College of Music. Upon returning to Houston from LA, Alejandro enrolled at a local community college to pursue his education and music professional goals. =(1995‚Äì1997)= Having completed basic requirement course at San Jac Community College, he then transferred to Berklee College of Music in June 1995. Summer semester was his first, carrying a full course load, his objective was to get in and get out. By the end of summer he took a job in the school's work study program. He was assigned to the Berklee Performance Center, where he worked as a stage hand, and later as sound engineer for college functions and various professional concerts. This allowed him to stay and complete a degree program. He chose a dual degree program in music production and engineering and contemporary writing and production. His previous experience in professional music would help him throughout the journey. With each passing semester, he garnered more scholarship funds, and was awarded the Ticketmaster Award for Excellence. 1n 1997, Rodney completed his studies, graduating summa cum laude, and received the Production Scholar of the Year from the MP&E; dept. and Outstanding Excellence from the CW&P; dept. See Education below for further details.  Career  = (1997‚Äì2001) = After graduating, Rodney headed to San Francisco with one connection. During his time at Berklee, he maintain a professional relationship with producer Preston Glass. Preston introduced Rodney to 3x Grammy Winner Narada Michael Walden the previous summer. Landing in SF, Rodney contacted Narada but there was no place for him in his camp at the time. Rodney pursued other avenues and worked as a stage hand to make ends. After 2 months he got a message Narada was now looking for a staff music programmer. Rodney reconnected with Narada and his first assignment to prove himself was a project for Diana Ross. Narada approved of his work and hired Rodney on staff in Oct 1997. During his tenure with Narada Michael Walden, Rodney worked with some of today greatest artist and legends.

Owned by Stone Canyon Media Group, it broadcasts a conservative talk format serving Flagstaff, Arizona. History KBTK signed on as KFLX which started as a construction permit granted to Ted Tucker and his Desert West Air Ranchers Corporation for a new station on 105.1 kHz in Winslow with the call letters KTDX. Tucker was able to shoehorn KTDX into the more populous Flagstaff market (city of license: Kachina Village) and changed the call letters to KFLX. The construction permit changed hands to D.B. Broadcasting in 1994, then to Red Rock Communications a year later. Red Rock signed the station on with an Adult album alternative format named \\"The Eagle\\". Toward the end of the 1990s and early 2000s, KFLX morphed into an adult alternative/Modern AC hybrid similar to that of Phoenix's KZON. Red Rock continued to own the station until it and sisters KWMX-FM and KSED-FM were sold in 2007 to Grenax Broadcasting II, LLC who also owned WCFX in Mount Pleasant, MI. Grenax completely transformed the station into a pure Hot AC station as \\"105.1 The Canyon\\". The station known as 105.1 The Canyon became Hot Adult Contemporary. In July 2010, KFLX flipped to talk radio as 97.1 The Big Talker, primarily featuring conservative personalities such as Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity. The Mitch and Joe Show also debuted when the station changed formats, which features local broadcast veterans Joe Harting and Mitch Strohman. Jason Lewis, Phil Hendrie and America's Morning News were also part of the original weekday line up. Since its launch, a few changes in the weekday line up have occurred. Mark Levin replaced Jason Lewis, and Roy Masters replaced Phil Hendrie. In August 2013, Mitch Strohman announced he was leaving the Mitch and Joe Show to put more emphasis on his job as 'The Voice of the Lumberjacks' calling sports for Northern Arizona University's athletics program. The Joe Harting Show began following Strohman's departure, with Harting hosting the local talk program solo, Harting left KBTK in 2015 to focus on his full-time job at NAU. On October 19, 2016, KBTK moved from 105.1 to 97.1, due to conflicts with KHOV/Wickensburg after its move to the frequency. On September 24, 2018, Grenax Broadcasting II, LLC announced the sale of KBTK and its sister stations to Stone Canyon Media Group; the purchase was completed in December.

Stanger was diagnosed with a concussion as a result of the assault. The next day, Middlebury College President Laurie L. Patton confirmed that the protesters' behavior \\"[inside and outside Wilson Hall] was in clear violation of Middlebury College policy\\". Some Middlebury students challenged the published accounts of the attack on the Middlebury student blog, Middbeat, asserting that Middlebury staff had instigated the violence by pushing protesters. Some students (and faculty) felt that by refusing to allow Murray to speak, and by injuring Stanger, the Middlebury College student community \\"trod all over the ideas of free speech this country was founded upon\\". Patton later issued a statement, saying the school would conduct an investigation into the sequence of events and then determine what actions to take for those individuals who were involved. Patton also said that the Middlebury Police Department would investigate the violent confrontation outside McCullough.

Its goal is to raise awareness of the role that architecture, engineering, urban planning and construction have in achieving a sustainable built future. The organization encourages and rewards sustainable responses to the technological, environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural issues affecting building and construction. The two main initiatives of the Foundation are the LafargeHolcim Forums (a series of academic symposia) and the LafargeHolcim Awards (a USD 2 million competition for sustainable construction projects and visionary concepts). History The organization was established in 2003 in Zurich, Switzerland with Holcim Ltd as its sole sponsor. Holcim Ltd and Lafarge S.A. completed their global merger and launched LafargeHolcim Ltd in July 2015. The name of the Foundation was changed to LafargeHolcim Foundation. The initiatives of the Foundation operate in a three-year cycle. LafargeHolcim Awards for Sustainable Construction The LafargeHolcim Awards for Sustainable Construction is an international competition that seeks projects and visionary concepts in sustainable construction. It offers USD 2 million dollars in prize money in each three-year cycle. Eligible for entry are projects in buildings and civil engineering works; landscape, urban design and infrastructure; and materials, products and construction technologies. There are two categories: The main category is open to architects, planners, engineers, and project owners that showcase sustainable responses to technological, environmental, socioeconomic and cultural issues affective contemporary building and construction. The fifteen projects that receive LafargeHolcim Awards Gold, Silver or Bronze in the five regions then qualify for the competition for the Global LafargeHolcim Awards.

Target issues for sustainable construction The LafargeHolcim Foundation measures and evaluates sustainable construction using five \\"target issues\\".\\"target issues\\" Three of these align with the triple bottom line concept of balanced social, environmental and economic performance. The two further target issues cover the contextual and aesthetic impact, and innovation and transferability. =Innovation and transferability - \\"Progress\\"= Projects must demonstrate innovative approaches to sustainable development, pushing the envelope of practice and exploring new disciplinary frontiers. Breakthroughs and trend-setting discoveries must be transferable to a range of other applications. Materials should be recyclable and integrated within circular economies. The production of waste should be avoided throughout a structure's use-cycle. * Innovative concepts regarding design, integration of materials and methods, structure, enclosure and mechanical systems. * Outstanding contributions to construction technologies and building processes, operation and maintenance. * Advancements in the disciplines of architecture, urban and landscape design, civil, urban and environmental engineering, and other fields involved in the production of the built environment. * Long-term monitoring methods to evaluate whether expectations and goals have been met. * Dissemination of knowledge, including project documentation, communication, education and training. =Ethical standards and social inclusion - \\"People\\"= Projects must adhere to the highest ethical standards and promote social inclusion at all stages of construction, from planning and building to use and servicing; to ensure an enduring positive impact on communities. Proposals must demonstrate how they enhance the collective realm and contribute to an affordable and socially inclusive habitat. * Adherence to ethical standards in all phases of the project. * Contributions to the formation of socially-viable environments, strengthening of shared values and empowerment of communities. * Participation of stakeholders, including users, clients, neighborhood affiliations, local authorities and non-governmental organizations. * Quality of working conditions in the construction industry and including on site; with specific attention given to fair compensation, adequate benefits, safety and gender equality. * Political transparency, unbiased processes and commitment to principled interaction, just practices, all in the effort to prevent corruption at every level. =Resource and environmental performance - \\"Planet\\"= Projects must exhibit a sensible use and management of natural resources throughout their entire life cycle. Long-term environmental concerns, especially pertaining to stocks and flows of material, water and energy, should be an integral part of the design philosophy. * Minimizing a project‚Äôs ecological footprint and maximizing its positive impact on the environment; reduction of harm and increase of beneficial effects. * Environmentally-conscious land use strategies and policies that preserve the natural landscape, while taking water and land reclamation into account. * Emphasis placed on the use of renewable energy in construction, use and upkeep of the built fabric to reduce CO2 emissions and avoid toxicity. * Innovative deployment of material resources in construction with an emphasis on cradle to cradle cycles, mining existing building stocks, minimizing the consumption of water and reduction of waste. * Resilient products, robust construction details, smart interaction of building systems and environmentally sound technologies. =Economic viability and compatibility - \\"Prosperity\\"= Projects must be economically feasible and able to secure financing ‚Äì whether from public, commercial, or concessional sources ‚Äì while having a positive impact on society and the environment. Avoiding the wasteful consumption of material resources and limiting CO2 emissions, an economy of means in construction is to be promoted. Construction must adhere to the logic of circular economies. * Funding sources and profits earned must be legitimate and transparent. * Projects should cover operating costs over their lifetime and generate an acceptable rate of return. * Integration of the project into the wider economic framework of local, regional, and global monetary flows. * Demonstrate flexibility to adapt to future changes of user needs, ownership, laws, regulations, and economic fluctuations. * Robust economic models are sought that take unpriced external costs into consideration from the outset. * Contribute positively to reducing emissions and to the overall CO2 balance of a structure‚Äôs use-cycle. =Contextual and aesthetic impact - \\"Place\\"= Projects must convey a high standard of architectural quality as a prevalent form of cultural expression. With space, form and aesthetic impact of utmost significance, the material manifestation of the design must make a positive and lasting contribution to the physical, human and cultural environment. * Improvement of existing contextual conditions responding to the natural and built environment. * Interdependencies of landscape, infrastructure, urban fabric and architecture. * Working with the given building stock through sensitive restoration, re-use or re-modeling of the built environment. * Inventive programming strategies in terms of use, multiplicity of functions, short-term flexibility and long-term adaptability. * Architectural quality and aesthetic impact, specifically concerning space, spatial sequences, movement, tactility of materials, light and ambiance.  Organisation and management  = Board of the LafargeHolcim Foundation = The Board of the LafargeHolcim Foundation ensures that the activities of the LafargeHolcim Foundation are aligned with current interpretations of sustainable construction, and also inspires the Foundation‚Äôs approach by framing the architectural, scientific, cultural, and policy concerns that are integrated into its initiatives. The Board defines the strategies through which the LafargeHolcim Foundation encourages innovative approaches to sustainable construction.

The founder of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a twice-monthly journal of the financial markets, he is the author of Money of the Mind (1992), The Trouble with Prosperity (1996), John Adams: Party of One (2005), Mr. Speaker: The Life and Times of Thomas B. Reed, the Man Who Broke the Filibuster (2011), and The Forgotten Depression (2014) among other works. His most recent publication is Bagehot: The Life and Times of the Greatest Victorian (2019), a biography of the brilliant and influential English banker, economic and political writer, and editor of the Economist, whose ideas about central banking informed the U.S. Federal Reserve's response to the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-09. Personal life Grant served as a Navy Gunner's mate, graduated from Indiana University, and received a master's degree in International relations from Columbia University. He is married to Patricia Kavanagh, M.D., a neurologist, and lives in Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn. They have four children. Journalism He began his journalistic career at the Baltimore Sun in 1972 and joined the staff of Barron's in 1975. He founded Grant's in 1983. Success was some time in coming. \\"A critic complained that Money of the Mind, my . . . history of American finance, was like an account of the interstate highway system written from the point of view of the accidents,\\" Grant wrote in Minding Mr. Market (1993). \\"The same might be said, both fairly and unfairly, of Grant's. Where most observers of the 1980s emphasized the rewards, we dwelled mainly on the risks. In the junk bond, in the reckless patterns of bank lending, in the dementia of Japanese finance, in the riot of the Treasury's borrowing, we saw not the bull markets of today but the comeuppance of tomorrow.\\" However, the publication's signature skepticism served it, and its readers, better in the 2000s. Mr. Market Miscalculates (2008), a collection of Grant's articles published over the preceding 10 years, elicited an appreciative review in the Financial Times. \\"If Grant could see what was happening this clearly,\\" wrote John Authers of the staff of the FT, \\"and warn of it in a well-circulated publication, how did the world's financial regulators fail to avert the crisis before it became deadly, and how did the rest of us continue to make the irrational investing decisions that make Mr. Market behave the way he does?\\" Grant received the 2015 Gerald Loeb Lifetime Achievement Award for excellence in business journalism. 2012 election Ron Paul named Grant as his likely candidate for Chairman of the Federal Reserve to replace Ben Bernanke whose term expired in 2014.

History The property for Fejervary Park was given to the city by Celestine Fej√©rv√°ry, a daughter of Nicholas Fej√©rv√°ry. He was a Hungarian nobleman who came to Davenport as a refuge in 1853 following the failure of an insurrection in his native Hungary. The park was the site of Fejervary‚Äôs estate. He chose the location for his home because the steep bluffs with a view of the Mississippi River reminded him of his home on the Danube River. The house, which was on the site at the time of the donation, is now gone. All that remains of the buildings is a carriage barn. The park land was acquired by the Davenport Board of Parks Commissioners as part of a city program to develop public parks throughout the city. Other parks in the program at the time included Vander Veer, Riverview Terrace, and Prospect. A municipal zoo was added to the park in 1909. It became known as Mother Goose Land. Patrons would enter the zoo through a large Mother Goose structure. There was also a feature called Monkey Island.

She is beautiful, passionate, generous, and loves with all her heart and soul. Though she is wealthy, she does not care much for material things. The story begins in 1990, 19-year-old Aurora is a dancer and attends New York School of the Arts with her two best friends, Natalia Suarez and Vanessa Miller. One night after a dance rehearsal, they all go to a bar, where Aurora meets the love of her life, Lorenzo Lobos, a dance instructor and single father. Aurora and Lorenzo begin a romance and fall madly in love. Aurora keeps Lorenzo secret from her parents as she knows they wouldn't approve of her being with someone below her social class and doesn't tell Lorenzo she is wealthy because the mother of his son left them to be with a wealthy man. On the day of her twentieth birthday, Aurora decides to announce to everybody her love for Lorenzo at her birthday party. Lorenzo is invited to the party by Vanessa, who is secretly in love with him. Vanessa arranges it so Lorenzo sees a forced kiss between Aurora and Federico √Ålvarez de Toledo. Lorenzo misinterprets the kiss and breaks up with a devastated Aurora. Shortly after it is discovered that Aurora is pregnant with Lorenzo's baby. Her father refuses to tell Lorenzo about the pregnancy and sends her as far away from him as possible. A few months pass and Aurora tries to run away and return to Lorenzo, but she falls and goes into labor. She gives birth to a girl, who she names Blanca. Aurora becomes very ill and on her deathbed, calls Lorenzo, and says to him with her dying breath, \\"I will always love you.\\" Gustavo decides to freeze Aurora in a cryogenic capsule. Twenty years later, Gustavo discovers a cure for Aurora and wants to reanimate her. However, the medical board in his clinic votes against reanimation. Gustavo goes against the board's decision and brings Aurora back to life. The capsule had stopped her from aging, so Aurora still looks twenty years old. Lorenzo's son, Mart√≠n, sees Aurora sleeping and instantly falls in love with her. When she wakes up, she meets Mart√≠n and believes he is Lorenzo since he looks exactly like Lorenzo did twenty years ago. She is later shocked to learn he is Lorenzo's son. Aurora escapes the clinic with the help of her chauffeur, Roque, to find her true love. She sees Lorenzo through a window and is overwhelmed with emotion, but she is heartbroken when she finds out he is now married to her childhood best friend, Natalia. When Lorenzo and Aurora finally come face to face, she runs off and he loses her. Lorenzo is told by Mart√≠n that she is not the Aurora he fell in love with twenty years ago but actually Aurora's long-lost daughter also named Aurora. Lorenzo asks Aurora if she is his daughter and she tells him she is not. Her former fianc√©e, Federico, agrees to pretend to be Aurora's father. From then on she is known as Aurora √Ålvarez de Toledo. Aurora manages to seduce Lorenzo, but as they are about to make love she becomes ill and nearly dies. Things are further complicated for Aurora when she notices Blanca is attracted to her half-brother, Mart√≠n. When she questions Mart√≠n about his relationship with Blanca, he tells her they are just friends and that he wants to be with her. Blanca is kidnapped and Aurora goes to save her. With the help of Lorenzo and Mart√≠n, she is able to rescue Blanca, but they are all nearly killed. Aurora is horrified when she witnesses a kiss between Blanca and Mart√≠n. Aurora realizes she has to tell Blanca the truth about her paternity. Aurora tells Blanca that Mart√≠n is her brother. Blanca does not understand how this could be possible, but Aurora explains that Lorenzo is her father. When Blanca asks who her mother is, Aurora lies and tells her it's In√©s. Aurora is continually pursued by Mart√≠n. She turns him down, but she is also growing increasingly attracted to him. Gustavo is given permission to reanimate Aurora, but this proves to be a problem because he already did. Therefore, Gustavo and the other doctors at the clinic reenact a reanimation with Aurora, who now has to pretend to be two people, her true self and her daughter. Unknowingly, Aurora is being hypnotized and manipulated by her stepmother, Elizabeth, into starting a relationship with Mart√≠n as Aurora's daughter. She also has a relationship with Lorenzo as her true self. Aurora becomes increasingly confused about who she really is and starts to believe she is the daughter she made up. She breaks up with Lorenzo because she believes she is in love with Mart√≠n. Eventually she discovers Elizabeth's manipulations and that Vanessa is responsible for all the events that happened before her \\"death.\\" Aurora confesses to everyone that there is only one Aurora, but she cannot bring herself to tell Mart√≠n. Instead, Lorenzo tells Mart√≠n that his Aurora, \\"Aurorita,\\" died and he is devastated. Martin is told the truth by Vanessa and tells Aurora he wants nothing to do with her. Lorenzo and Aurora decide to live together with Blanca so they can be family, but decide it's best not to have a relationship since they don't want to hurt Mart√≠n. One year later, Aurora and Lorenzo still maintain a platonic relationship. Aurora finds an abandoned baby named Tommy. Lorenzo and Aurora pretend to be engaged so they can adopt the baby, though it is clear they both wish it were real. Aurora desperately wants to be happy with the love of her life, but does not want to come in between father and son, or at least till she is truly forgiven by Mart√≠n and by herself. When Aurora has a chance encounter with Mart√≠n, she is shocked by his new appearance. He tells her he is not in love with her anymore and he wants her to be with Lorenzo. Aurora asks him to come home, but he tells her he still needs time. Aurora and Lorenzo finally reunite. They decide to marry, to the delight of their family. However, their wedding is interrupted by Federico who announces Mart√≠n is dying. Everybody rushes to Mart√≠n. After some harsh words from Federico, Aurora runs off with Tommy and her dog, Lucero. She is taken in by a woman named Pilar and her two children, Daniela and Beto. Daniela calls Aurora's apartment and is wrongly informed that they are preparing for Mart√≠n's funeral. Aurora is devastated and breaks down. Catalina Perez-Quintana, Mart√≠n's boss, shows Aurora footage of Mart√≠n confessing that he still loves her. Once Aurora is reunited with her family, she tells Lorenzo she feels responsible for all the bad that things have happened and ends her relationship with him. Aurora begs Mart√≠n to forgive her, but he refuses and tells her to reunite with his father. Aurora finds out she is ill due to the effects from the cryogenics, but she decides not tell anyone. Aurora and Lorenzo go on a romantic trip together and agree to split up for good when they come home. Lorenzo changes his mind and wants to get back together. Aurora realizes she should enjoy the rest of her life and reunites with Lorenzo. Daniela, who is Tommy's nanny, tells Aurora's family about her illness and they all promise to stick by her. Tommy's biological father comes into the picture and wants custody of his son. Aurora and Lorenzo are heartbroken when they have to hand the baby over, but they feel better when they are asked to be Tommy's godparents. Daniela confesses she is in love with Lorenzo. Aurora is kind to her at first, but quickly grows impatient. Aurora misinterprets several moments between Lorenzo and Daniela and their relationship is strained. After catching them in a hotel room together (Lorenzo believed he was meeting Aurora), she angrily kicks Lorenzo out. Eventually Daniela's manipulations are exposed and Lorenzo and Aurora agree to never let anything come between them again. Aurora is thrilled when her beloved godmother, Pasion Urquijo, is reanimated. She later finds out that Mart√≠n is responsible for bringing Pasion back. She thanks him and Mart√≠n and Aurora finally make peace with each other. Aurora becomes friends with Christian Santana, a veterinarian who is interested in studying her dog, Lucero, who was also frozen. It is later revealed that Christian is Pasion's son, who she believed died at birth. When Natalia is brutally raped by a group of men, Aurora is there for her. She goes undercover in a strip club to find the men responsible for the attack. Lorenzo rescues her before she is attacked by the club's owner. Aurora and Lorenzo are thrilled when they find out she is pregnant. They get married in a private ceremony. Eights months later, Aurora gives birth to a beautiful baby girl, who they name Aurora. Aurora's happiness has come full circle...naturally tragedy is just around the corner. The highly anticipated musical Aurora based on her life is opening. Aurora decides to stay home with the baby.

Aurora's car crashes and she is rushed to Gustavo's clinic. Unfortunately, there is no hope for Aurora. After telling Lorenzo she wants him to move on with his life, she dies peacefully. Federico receives word of her death. He walks on stage during the performance of Aurora and announces her death. Aurora's loved ones are devastated. Aurora had requested that her heart be donated.

His mother abandoned him and his father while he was young to be with a wealthy man. He is caring, passionate, and extremely talented. He always had an extremely close relationship with his father and is also close with his stepmother, Natalia, who he considers to be his mother, and his siblings, Nina and Cesar. Mart√≠n gets a job as a doctor at Gustavo Ponce De Le√≥n's clinic. Mart√≠n sees a young, beautiful patient sleeping and instantly falls in love with her, unaware that she is none other than his father's true love, Aurora Ponce De Le√≥n. He is told a lie that she is Aurora's long-lost daughter who is also named Aurora. When he informs his father about Aurora's \\"daughter,\\" Lorenzo reveals that she could be his daughter and therefore Mart√≠n's sister. Mart√≠n is relieved when it is confirmed that Aurora is not his sister. Mart√≠n wants to be with Aurora, but she wants to be with Lorenzo, which causes major conflict between father and son. One night, while out partying, Mart√≠n has sex with a masked stripper, who turns out to be his adopted sister, Nina, who is in love with him. Nina is happy but Mart√≠n is disgusted and does not want anyone to find out. Mart√≠n becomes close to Blanca Ponce De Le√≥n, who he is unaware is his half-sister. Blanca is romantically interested in him, but he only thinks of her as a friend. When Blanca is kidnapped, Mart√≠n, Lorenzo, and Aurora manage to rescue her, though they are all nearly killed themselves. Blanca kisses Mart√≠n to thank him, which is witnessed by Aurora. So they don't commit incest, Aurora tells Blanca that Mart√≠n is her brother. Nina drunkenly tells Lorenzo about her one night stand with Mart√≠n, which prompts Lorenzo to throw Mart√≠n out the house. Mart√≠n tells Lorenzo that he wants him to leave Aurora alone so he can be with her, but Lorenzo tells him he can't because he has fallen in love with her. Mart√≠n is relieved when Lorenzo decides to start a new life in Spain with Natalia and Cesar. However, their plane crashes and they are believed to be dead, leaving Mart√≠n devastated. Blanca finally tells Mart√≠n that they are siblings and they mourn together. Luckily, his parents and Cesar never boarded the plane and the family is reunited. Tired of being jerked around by Aurora, Mart√≠n decides to move on. He starts seeing his friend and co-worker, Dr Liliana Rosales.

Lorenzo tells Mart√≠n that his Aurora, \\"Aurorita,\\" died and he is devastated. Cesar is seemingly murdered by Perez's widow, Catalina Perez- Quintana. At his funeral, Vanessa Miller tells Mart√≠n that there has only ever been one Aurora. Mart√≠n is heartbroken that he was lied to by the people he loves the most and declares he hates Aurora. Mart√≠n decides he needs some space from his family to clear his head. One year later, Mart√≠n is still heartbroken over Aurora and has barely had any contact with his family. He has changed his appearance and has turned into a bitter, angry man. To ease his pain, he has been having a casual relationship with a woman named Diana del Valle. Diana is in love with him and wants a real relationship, but Mart√≠n is only interested in the physical part. Mart√≠n has devoted most of his time to finding a cure for Vicky Hutton, who was frozen after being poisoned by Elizabeth. It is revealed that Cesar is actually alive and Mart√≠n had made an agreement with Catalina, who is Vicky's grandmother, that he would cure Vicky in exchange for Cesar's safety. Mart√≠n and Aurora have a chance encounter at a church. Mart√≠n lies that he does not love her anymore and tells her that he can't forgive her, but he wants her and Lorenzo to be together so his beloved father can finally be happy with the woman he waited twenty years to be with. Aurora tells Mart√≠n that she cannot be happy unless he is happy but he tells her not to worry about him. Mart√≠n gets his wish and Aurora and Lorenzo finally reunite.

Ingrid comes to see Mart√≠n shortly after everything is resolved and tells him he is a lost cause when it comes to love. Mart√≠n finds a cure for Vicky. To prove it works, Catalina tells Mart√≠n to poison himself and then take the remedy. Indifferent to the possibility he may die, Mart√≠n agrees. It appears the remedy is not working and Mart√≠n starts having convulsions and calling out Aurora's name. Federico interrupts Lorenzo and Aurora's wedding and announces that Mart√≠n is dying. Eventually the remedy does work and Mart√≠n recovers. Catalina makes Aurora believe that Mart√≠n really is dead. A furious Mart√≠n confronts her and she pushes him into admitting that he is still in love with Aurora and that once Vicky is better, he plans on leaving and never coming back.

Lorenzo declares that nothing has changed for him, Mart√≠n is still his son, to which Mart√≠n agrees. Mart√≠n sees his true paternity as a good thing, because it means they are not a father and son who fell in love with the same woman.

Mart√≠n has a change of heart and goes to visit Vicky at her family's summer house. They are about to make love when Vicky changes her mind and tells Mart√≠n she will only sleep with him when he is completely over Aurora. Christian kisses Vicky to help make Mart√≠n jealous and she plays along. Mart√≠n in turn invites Diana to make Vicky jealous. Diana observes how bothered Mart√≠n is when Vicky is with Christian and tells him he has fallen in love with Vicky without even realizing it. Mart√≠n profusely denies this, he says that since Vicky has no memory, therefore she is not her real self and that once she regains her memory she will have no feelings for him. He already fell in love with someone who does not exact (Aurora) and does not want to go through all that suffering again; he begs Diana to help him forget about her. Things between Mart√≠n and Vicky are further complicated by Lorenzo's friend, Ernesto, who is in love with Vicky.

Mart√≠n realizes he is not in love with Aurora anymore and rushes to stop Vicky, but he sees her kissing Ernesto and changes his mind. However, she ends up not going through with it. Gustavo informs Mart√≠n that he may lose the clinic, which means they won't be able to help Pasion, Aurora, and Vicky who may develop illnesses from being frozen. Mart√≠n agrees to get his inheritance. He asks to Diana to marry him and she happily agrees. It seems like all hope is lost for Mart√≠n and Vicky. Mart√≠n is informed he cannot get his inheritance if he marries someone who is divorced, which Diana is.

They are about to make love when Vicky changes her mind and tells Mart√≠n she will only sleep with him when he is completely over Aurora. Vicky plays along when Christian kisses her so she can make Mart√≠n jealous. Martin in turn makes Vicky jealous with Diana. Diana rubs in Vicky's face her beauty and relationship with Mart√≠n; this along with finding Mart√≠n in bed with Diana makes Vicky feel like she should just give up. Ernesto wants to be with Vicky. He previously told her they had never slept together before she was frozen, but lies and says they did. Vicky decides to sleep with Ernesto to forget about Mart√≠n. However, she cannot go through with it. Vicky is ecstatic when Mart√≠n decides to get his inheritance. She hopes that he will ask her to marry him, but he asks Diana. Vicky is heartbroken and feels like all hope is lost until it is revealed that Mart√≠n can't marry someone who is divorced, which Diana is. After much convincing, Mart√≠n agrees to marry Vicky. Mart√≠n wants the marriage to be only a business deal. Vicky agrees and they get married. They eventually fall madly in love with each other and Vicky also regained her old memories back. She is kidnapped by Ernesto, who is crazily in love with her and acid is thrown in her face but Martin saves her, they have two children together Martin and Victoria, Nina Lobos Nina Lobos is portrayed by Talina Duclaud. Nina is the daughter of Ernesto and Natalia. Her parents agreed that Ernesto would not be involved in Nina's upbringing and she was later adopted by her stepfather, Lorenzo Lobos. Nina was never informed of her true paternity and always believed her biological father had abandoned her. She is selfish, manipulative, and can be rather nasty, but she is also desperately lonely and craves attention. She absolutely adores her parents and her brothers, Mart√≠n and Cesar, though she can be rather neglectful towards them. Nina, like her parents, is a dancer and attends New York School of the Arts. Though they grew up together, Nina has always been in love with her adoptive brother, Mart√≠n, and she refuses to acknowledge him as her brother. Mart√≠n, however, does not reciprocate her feelings. She becomes friends with Blanca and Vicky at school. She is furious when Mart√≠n falls in love with Aurora and decides she has to act fast. She pretends to be a stripper at a party that Mart√≠n and Cesar are attending. Mart√≠n does not recognize her since she is wearing a mask and the two have sex. Nina is thrilled to have finally been with the man she loves but when she reveals her identity, Mart√≠n is disgusted, leaving her heartbroken. When the other members of her family find out about their one night stand, they are also disgusted and tell Nina she needs to forget about Mart√≠n, but she refuses. Nina is disgusted by Aurora's presence in their lives. She blames her for stealing Mart√≠n from her and ruining her parents' marriage. Nina is shocked when Aurora reveals that Natalia had an affair with her father, Gustavo. Nina is horrified to realize that Gustavo could be her father and begs Natalia to finally tell her who her father is. She is shocked to the core when Natalia reveals it is her godfather, Ernesto. Elizabeth Oviedo Dr. Elizabeth Oviedo is portrayed by Monica Franco. Dr. Elizabeth Oviedo is a doctor at Gustavo's clinic. She is evil, conniving, and psychotic. She murders or attempts to murder people who try to get in her way or pose threat to her. Elizabeth is married with Gustavo and becomes crazy. Gustavo is thrown from the clinic, with this she becomes enraged, and she wants to go to Aurora, but shortly pierces Lorenzo. Gustavo is led to the jail, but was released. Elizabeth threatened Gustavo because he wanted to confess the truth. She arranges a meeting with Martin and leaves behind a toxic food to poison him. Not a few time later, she comes to Natalia and wants to kill her. By luck, Cesar appears which help Natalia avoid the poisoned food. He then informs her that his mother, Elizabeth was taken to the madhouse. After a while she leaves with clinic, cured, and becomes a good person.

Elizabeth finds the clinic on the roof and pushed from the balcony. Liliana dies on the spot. Catalina Perez- Quintana Catalina Perez-Quintana is portrayed by Zully Montero. Catalina is the mother of Vanessa and grandmother of Vicky and Arturo. She runs a prostitution ring and is involved several other criminal activities. She was married to Ignacio Miller, who had an affair with Pasion Urquijo. This made Catalina a bitter woman and she set out to destroy Pasion's life. She did this by stealing Pasion and Ignacio's son at birth and making Pasion believe he had died. In reality, Catalina gave their son to the Santana family, he was named Christian and Catalina became his godmother. Despite her hatred for Pasion, Catalina loves Christian like a son and even funded his education. Pasion Urquijo Pasion Urquijo is portrayed by Ang√©lica Mar√≠a. Pasion is a world- famous actress and singer and the beloved godmother of Aurora. The two always had an extremely close bond. This bond made Aurora's mother, In√©s, resent Pasion, who she believed Aurora loved more than her. Pasion had a long affair with Ignacio Miller, who was the love of her life. She had a son with him who she believed died at birth. Her son was actually stolen by Catalina and given to the Santana family, who named him Christian. The loss of her son devastated Pasion; she believed it was punishment for her affair and success as an entertainer. Years later, Pasion became ill and was frozen in a cryogenic capsule. Just months later, her goddaughter, Aurora, was frozen as well. Many years later, Dr. Mart√≠n Lobos finds a cure for Pasion and reanimates her. Pasion can't believe so much time has passed and believes this even more so when she is reunited with Aurora, who looks exactly the same. Aurora explains everything that happened to her and it is clear their bond is still strong. Mart√≠n uses an alias with Pasion as he does not want Aurora to find out about his involvement. Pasion takes a strong liking to Mart√≠n and wants to know more about him. Blanca reveals to Pasion who Mart√≠n really is and about his situations with Vicky and Aurora.

Cone beam computed tomography (or CBCT, also referred to as C-arm CT, cone beam volume CT, or flat panel CT) is a medical imaging technique consisting of X-ray computed tomography where the X-rays are divergent, forming a cone.Technical Description of CBCT from University of Manchester. Citing: CBCT has become increasingly important in treatment planning and diagnosis in implant dentistry, ENT, orthopedics, and interventional radiology (IR), among other things. Perhaps because of the increased access to such technology, CBCT scanners are now finding many uses in dentistry, such as in the fields of oral surgery, endodontics and orthodontics. Integrated CBCT is also an important tool for patient positioning and verification in image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). During dental/orthodontic imaging, the CBCT scanner rotates around the patient's head, obtaining up to nearly 600 distinct images. For interventional radiology, the patient is positioned offset to the table so that the region of interest is centered in the field of view for the cone beam. A single 200 degree rotation over the region of interest acquires a volumetric data set. The scanning software collects the data and reconstructs it, producing what is termed a digital volume composed of three-dimensional voxels of anatomical data that can then be manipulated and visualized with specialized software. CBCT shares many similarities with traditional (fan beam) CT however there are important differences, particularly for reconstruction. CBCT has been described as the gold standard for imaging the oral and maxillofacial area. History Cone beam technology was first introduced in the European market in 1996 by QR s.r.l. (NewTom 9000) and into the US market in 2001. In 2013, during the Festival della Scienza in Genova, Italy, the original members of the research group (Attilio Tacconi, Piero Mozzo, Daniele Godi and Giordano Ronca) received an award for the invention of cone-beam CT. File:Prima Immagine Cone-Beam-1994-07-01 -1.jpg  Axial image obtained from the first Cone-Beam 3D Scan performed on July 1, 1994 File:Prima Immagine Cone- Beam-1994-07-02.jpg  Axial image obtained from the first Cone-Beam 3D Scan performed on July 1, 1994 File:Prima Immagine Cone-Beam-1994-07-01-3.jpg  Axial image obtained from the first Cone-Beam 3D Scan performed on July 1, 1994 File:Prima acquisizione totale 1994-07-01-pag1.jpeg  Original notes about the first Cone-Beam 3D Scan performed on July 1, 1994 Applications = Endodontics = According to the American Association of Endodontics, there are many specific situations where 3D images produced by CBCT enhances diagnosis and influences treatment and its use can not be disputed over conventional intraoral radiology following the principles of ALARA. = Implantology = A dental cone beam scan offers useful information when it comes to the assessment and planning of surgical implants. The American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology (AAOMR) suggests cone-beam CT as the preferred method for presurgical assessment of dental implant sites.New AAOMR Guidelines on CBCT Use in Implant Planning =Orthodontics= As a 3D rendition, CBCT offers an undistorted view of the dentition that can be used to accurately visualize both erupted and non-erupted teeth, tooth root orientation and anomalous structures, that conventional 2D radiography cannot. Processing example using x-ray data from a tooth model: File:DVT-scan- MagoCut-bild1-singlesample.jpgsingle sampled (noisy) image File:DVT-scan- MagoCut-bild2-oversamplefocus.jpgseveral samples overlay File:DVT-scan- MagoCut-bild3-panoramiomodejoined.jpgjoined images to panoramic File:DVT- scan-MagoCut-bild4-dvtreconstructed.jpgalgorithmic reconstruction File:CBCT image 03.pngin-vivo image = Orthopedics = The CBCT scanner offers undistorted views of the extremities. One advantage of orthopedic CBCT is the ability to take weight bearing images of the lower extremities. In the realm of the foot and ankle particularly, weight bearing CBCT is gaining momentum due to its ability to combine 3 dimensional and weight bearing information which are of the utmost importance in diagnosis and surgical planning. The preferred term used for CBCT in the lower limb is thus WBCT for Weight Bearing CT following the first scientific publications on the subject. =Image-guided radiation therapy= Image-guided radiation therapy is a form of external beam radiotherapy where the patient is positioned with the organs to be treated accurately matched in position to the treatment field, to reduce the dose to nearby organs which are not being treated. Many organs inside the body move by millimeters relative to the external skin surfaces, and a CBCT scanner mounted on the head of the radiotherapy unit is used immediately before treatment (and sometimes again during treatment) to ensure the patient's organs are in exactly the right position to match the treatment field, and to adjust the position of the treatment table if necessary. The images may also be used to check for other requirements of some types of treatment, such as full or empty bladder, empty rectum, etc. The same cone beam beam source and detector can alternatively be used to take simple X-ray positioning images if the organ shows particularly well on X-ray or if Fiducial markers have been inserted into the organ. =Interventional radiology= The CBCT scanner is mounted on a C-arm fluoroscopy unit in the interventional radiology (IR) suite, which offers real time imaging with a stationary patient. This eliminates the time needed to transfer a patient from the angiography suite to a conventional computed tomography scanner and facilitates a broad spectrum of applications of CBCT during IR procedures. The clinical applications of CBCT in IR include treatment planning, device or implant positioning and assessment, intra- procedural localization, and assessment of procedure endpoints. CBCT is useful as a primary and supplemental form of imaging. It is an excellent adjunct to DSA and fluoroscopy for soft tissue and vascular visibility during complex procedures. The use of CBCT before fluoroscopy potentially reduces patient radiation exposure. =Clinical applications= * Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: CBCT with contrast confirms that the proper artery is selected to deliver the therapy. The contrast enhances the parenchyma supplied by the selected artery and therefore reveals if the vasculature also supplies the tumor. Post treatment noncontrast CBCT confirms lipiodol staining of the tumor, which improves operator confidence of complete tumor coverage or further treatment. * Prostatic artery embolization for benign prostatic hypertrophy: CBCT provides the soft tissue detail needed to visualize prostatic enhancement, identify duplicated prostatic arteries, and avoid nontarget embolization. CBCT is superior to DSA for this therapy since the enhancement patterns on DSA can be difficult to discern due to the overlapping pelvic structures and variable arterial anatomy. * Abscess drainage: CBCT confirms needle tip location after placement under ultrasound and confirms drain placement by revealing contrast injection into the desired location. * Adrenal Vein sampling for an adenoma: contrast enhanced CBCT shows perfusion of the adrenal gland to confirm catheter placement for obtaining a satisfactory sample. * Stent placement: CBCT improves the visualization of intracranial and extracranial stents compared to conventional DSA and digital radiography by providing a better depiction of the relationship of the stents to nearby structures (i.e. vascular walls and aneurysm lumen). * Lung nodule percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy: CBCT guides needle placement and demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 98.2%, 96.8%, and 100%, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy was unaffected by technically challenging conditions. * Vascular Anomalies: After correction of arteriovenous malformations with coiling, CBCT sensitively detects small infarcts in tissue that has been \\"sacrificed\\" during the procedure to prevent further shunting. The infarcted tissue appears as a small area of contrast retention. * Peripheral Vascular Interventions * Biliary Interventions * Spinal Interventions * Enterostomy Interventions =Technical limitations= While the practicality of CBCT fosters its increasing application in IR, technical limitations hinder its integration into the field. The two most significant factors that affect successful integration are image quality and time (for set up, image acquisition, and image reconstruction). Compared to multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), the wider collimation in CBCT leads to increased scatter radiation and degradation of image quality as demonstrated by artifacts and decreased contrast-to-noise ratio. The temporal resolution of cesium iodide detectors in CBCT slows data acquisition time to approximately 5 to 20 seconds, which increases motion artifacts. The time required for image reconstruction takes longer for CBCT (1 minute) compared to MDCT (real time) due to the computationally demanding cone beam reconstruction algorithms. Reconstruction Cone beam reconstruction algorithms are similar to typical tomographic reconstruction algorithms, and methods such as filtered backprojection or iterative reconstruction may be used. However, since the reconstruction is three-dimensional, modifications such as the FDK algorithm may be needed. Risks Total radiation doses from 3D dental CBCT exams are 96% lower than conventional CT exams, but deliver more radiation than standard dental 2D x-ray (OPG). The time of exposure in CBCT is also comparatively less when compared to conventional CT. CBCT use is only lightly regulated in the US. The recommended standard of care is to use the smallest possible field of view (FOV), the smallest voxel size, the lowest mA setting and the shortest exposure time in conjunction with a pulsed exposure mode of acquisition. International organisations such as the World Health Organization and ICRP, as well as many local bodies and legislation, encourage the idea of justification for all medical exposures, where risks and benefits must be weighed up before a procedure goes ahead. Disadvantages There are a number of drawbacks of CBCT technology over that of CT scans, such as increased susceptibility to movement artifacts (in first generation machines) and to the lack of appropriate bone density determination. =Bone density and the Hounsfield scale= The Hounsfield scale is used to measure radiodensity and, in reference to CT scans, can provide an accurate absolute density for the type of tissue depicted. The radiodensity, measured in Hounsfield Units (HU, also known as CT number) is inaccurate in CBCT scans because different areas in the scan appear with different greyscale values depending on their relative positions in the organ being scanned, despite possessing identical densities, because the image value of a voxel of an organ depends on the position in the image volume. HU measured from the same anatomical area with both CBCT and medical-grade CT scanners are not identical and are thus unreliable for determination of site-specific, radiographically-identified bone density for purposes such as the placement of dental implants, as there is \\"no good data to relate the CBCT HU values to bone quality.\\" Although some authors have supported the use of CBCT technology to evaluate bone density by measuring HU, such support is provided erroneously because scanned regions of the same density in the skull can have a different grayscale value in the reconstructed CBCT dataset. Dental CBCT systems do not employ a standardized system for scaling the grey levels that represent the reconstructed density values and, as such, they are arbitrary and do not allow for assessment of bone quality. In the absence of such a standardization, it is difficult to interpret the grey levels or impossible to compare the values resulting from different machines. While there is a general acknowledgment that this deficiency exists with CBCT systems (in that they do not correctly display HU), there has been little research conducted to attempt to correct this deficiency. With time, further advancements in CBCT reconstruction algorithms will allow for improved area detectors, and this, together with enhanced postprocessing, will likely solve or reduce this problem. A method for establishing attenuation coefficients with which actual HU values can be derived from CBCT HU values was published in 2010 and further research is currently under way to perfect this method in vivo.

Immunization rates for all pre-school aged children increased to at least 90% for most vaccines in the 1990s. It is difficult to discern if this increase was directly caused by the VFC program. (Abbreviations: DTP/DTaP = diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis; MMR = measles, mumps, and rubella; Hib = Haemophilus influenzae type b; Hep B = hepatitis B; PCV = pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; RV = rotavirus vaccine; Hep A = hepatitis A.) The Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) is a federally funded program in the United States providing no-cost vaccines to children who lack health insurance or who otherwise cannot afford the cost of the vaccination. The VFC program was created by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and is required to be a new entitlement of each state's Medicaid plan under section 1928 of the Social Security Act. The program was officially implemented in October 1994 and serves eligible children in all U.S. states, as well as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. History From 1989 through 1991, a measles epidemic in the United States resulted in over 55,000 reported cases of measles, 11,000 measles-related hospitalization, and 123 deaths. Upon investigation, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that more than half of the children who had measles had not been immunized, despite seeing a health care provider. In partial response to that epidemic, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) on August 10, 1993, creating the VFC Program; the VFC program officially became operational October 1, 1994. The Vaccines for Children program represented a major vaccine finance reform, working as a state-operated federal entitlement program that supplied both public and private providers with federally purchased vaccines. This integration of both the public and private sector benefitted all providers. Because private providers now had a role in the nation's immunization program, they, along with the public health sector, benefitted from the supply of vaccines at no cost, educational opportunities, and the ability to provide immunization services to patients without a need for referral. As of 2019, there are over 44,000 doctors at 40,000 locations enrolled in the VFC program nationwide. Outcomes and Impact By eliminating or reducing cost as a barrier to vaccination, the VFC program encourages improved vaccination coverage among eligible children. Increased vaccination protects not only vaccinated child themselves, but also indirectly protects those around them through herd immunity, which can slow or stop the spread of disease. Thus childhood vaccination, as opposed to vaccination later in life, is particularly effective as a means of controlling and preventing disease spread. The VFC program results in millions of immunizations each year. In 2010 alone 82 million VFC vaccine doses were administered to approximately 40 million children. Due to the exponential impact of vaccination, it is difficult to separate the effect of the VFC from that of other state and federal immunization programs. For example, it is difficult (or perhaps impossible) to disentangle the effects of the VFC program and the increase in public school vaccination requirements that occurred during the 1990s and 2000s. Thus, research primarily focuses the overall effect of increased childhood immunization that began in the mid-1990s, much (but not all) of which is owed to the VFC program. The CDC estimates that among children born from 1994-2013 (that is, children born during the VFC-era), \\"routine childhood immunization... [will] prevent 322 million illnesses (averaging 4.1 illnesses per child) and 21 million hospitalizations (0.27 per child) over the course of their lifetimes and avert 732,000 premature deaths from vaccine-preventable illnesses\\". All told, vaccination among this birth cohort will prevent an estimated 8.9 million measles-related hospitalization and 507,000 diphtheria- related deaths. These rates do not include prevented hospitalizations and deaths resulting from annual influenza immunizations, which the VFC also provides. Additionally, these estimates do not account for the rise in US population during this time period. Both of these factors have the potential to make the CDC's estimates artificially low. The VFC program has also significantly helped close the vaccination rate gap between non-Hispanic whites and other racial groups. During the measles epidemic of 1989-1991, racial/ethnic minority children were 16 times more likely than non-Hispanic white children to contract measles. Due in part to the VFC program, there have been no racial/ethnic disparities in measles-mumps-rubella vaccination in the United States since 2005, and racial disparities for other vaccinations have declined or become absent entirely, depending upon the vaccination and the racial group studied. Overall, while immunization disparities still exist for newer vaccines (i.e. HepA, rotovirus, and HPV), the VFC has effectively eliminated the immunization gap for older vaccines like MMR, polio, and HepB. Vaccination programs like the VFC are expensive, but they also result in significant cost savings through prevented hospitalization and doctor visits. Routine childhood vaccination among the 1994-2013 birth cohort is estimated to result in $107 billion in direct costs and $121 billion in social costs. In return, childhood vaccination results in the aversion of $402 billion in direct costs and $1.5 trillion in societal costs. This gives vaccination a net present value (net savings) of $295 billion and $1.38 trillion in direct and societal costs, respectively. Due to the VFC program, the Federal government of the United States currently purchases between 52 and 55 percent of childhood vaccines administered in the United States. Such large-scale purchases by the federal government are not without economic consequences; the VFC program is one factor contributing to the current deterioration of the U.S. vaccination market. Thirty years ago, dozens of manufacturers produced vaccines for the U.S. market, but today just five companies produce all of the vaccines for children and adults in the United States. The opportunity for large government contracts has led pharmaceutical companies to engage in such aggressive price competition that the market for vaccinations has all but collapsed. This collapse has occurred despite the fact that the U.S. vaccine market has been expanding for decades and is expected to continue expanding. This poses significant problems in the area of vaccine research and development, as there is currently little incentive for innovation within the market. Program The VFC program is funded through an approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the funds are allocated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC buys vaccines at a discount directly from manufacturers and distributes them to state health departments and certain local and territorial public health agencies. The agencies then redistribute the vaccines at no cost to those private physicians' offices and public health clinics that are registered as VFC program providers. Though the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) (previously known as NIP) at CDC is responsible for policy development, state health departments are responsible for management of the VFC program at the state and local level. Most states thus coordinate their state-level immunization programs with the VFC. The successful implementation of the VFC at the state-wide level thus requires the cooperation and coordination of several state and federal agencies, including: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP); and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), among others. In fact, many parents first learn about the VFC program through other federal or state programs that they may or their children already participate in, like WIC or CHIP. The participation and cooperation of Medicaid is particularly important, as the majority of VFC-eligible children are also eligible for Medicaid; state and local Medicaid agencies thus play a crucial role in informing potentially eligible patients about the VFC program, as well as recruiting private physicians to participate in the program. Patient eligibility Children and adolescents are eligible if it is before their 19th birthday and if they meet one or more of the following criteria: * Medicaid- eligible * Uninsured (lacking health insurance) * American Indian or Alaska Native * Underinsured* Based upon these guidelines, the CDC estimates that approximately 50% of children under 19 years old are eligible for VFC benefits. * Underinsured means that a child that is covered by some type of health insurance, but the insurance either does not cover any vaccines, covers only certain vaccines, or does cover some vaccines, but has a cap on the annual cost for vaccines*. Underinsured children and adolescents may only receive vaccines at sites that are federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) or rural health clinics (RHCs). Each state has an administrative fee set by the state that can never be exceeded, of about US$15. As of 2018, many children have benefited from the VFC program, which has saved nearly 936,000 from preventable diseases. Many families are benefiting from this program as it covers vaccines and helps with the costs of vaccines for low-income families. Records indicate that from 1994-2012 after immunizations began to rise, diseases such as Polio and Hepatitis B decreased drastically. Covered vaccines The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) makes recommendations to the VFC program as to what are the most appropriate selection of vaccines and related agents for control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United States. VFC resolutions passed by the ACIP form the basis for VFC program policies on vaccine availability and usage. These resolutions may not necessarily match the general usage recommendations of the ACIP, but rather represent the rules that providers must follow for administering each specific vaccine under the VFC program. The following vaccines are included in the VFC Program: {  * DiphtheriaHaemophilus influenzae type bHepatitis A*Hepatitis BHuman papillomavirus * Influenza (flu)  * MeaslesMeningococcal * MumpsPertussis* (whooping cough) * Pneumococcal*Poliomyelitis*  * Rotavirus*RubellaTetanusVaricella zoster (chickenpox) } * Vaccines initially targeted by the VFC program in 1994.  Vaccines added to the VFC program from 1995-2013.  Latest changes  The VFC program has implemented several regulations to address the changing needs of grantees: In attempts to address fraud and abuse, grantees must now submit a copy of the newly written fraud and abuse policy, which includes identification of staff responsible for these issues, to the CDC no later than December 31, 2007. The VFC program is also requiring the update of user profiles. Rather than having grantees do this task, the goal is to improve accountability and ensure accurate information about the population of eligible children. A larger and more recent enhancement aiming to improve vaccine management at multiple levels (federal, state, local) is the initiation of the Vaccine Management Business Improvement Project (VMBIP). This project aims to simplify the ordering and distribution projects of vaccines, implement a more efficient supply system, and enable direct delivery of vaccines to providers.

The term 'mundillo' means 'little world', referring to the cylindrical pillow on which the lace maker ('Mundillista') weaves intricate designs. The decorative lace is created using wooden bobbins about the diameter of a pencil, which are wound with thread that is twisted and crossed to form a pattern. Depending on the pattern, as few as two dozen or as many as several hundred bobbins may be used. In addition to its use as edging and borders on tablecloths and handkerchiefs, and for traditional shirt collars and trim, mundillo is also used to decorate items for special occasions, such as wedding dresses, baptismal gowns, and the cloths used to adorn religious icons. It is said that it was once common for lovers to exchange mundillo lace with romantic inscriptions. Bobbin lace was brought to Puerto Rico from Spain, where it had thrived in major commercial markets as well as a cottage industry in Galicia, Castilla, and Catalonia. In Spain, lace is called encaje, because it was worked on separately and then joined to material (the Spanish word for \\"join\\" is encajar). In Puerto Rico, the towns of Moca, Isabela, and Aguadilla, all in the northwestern part of the island, are famous for mundillo lace. In Moca, commonly known as the Capital or cradle of Mundillo, there is an annual festival dedicated to the handmade lace as well as a museum, El Museo Del Mundillo. Mundillo is celebrated and featured in festivals around the island. A workshop with kits to help train newcomers to mundillo was offered in Morovis in 2018.

In addition to being part of the long Mundillo tradition of her hometown of Moca, Puerto Rico, she belongs to the much larger, much longer tradition of Spanish and European bobbin lacemaking. Egipciaco was born into a family tradition of lace-making, as her mother and grandmother were noted makers of lace. She recalls starting to learn mundillo when she was four years old. After graduating from the University of Puerto Rico, R√≠o Piedras Campus, she continued to practice mundillo and co-founded the Cultural Center of Moca. Egipciaco moved to New York in 1986 and began to teach lace-making through a variety of programs ranging from workshops for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union to serving as a master in the New York State Council on the Arts Folk Arts Apprenticeship Program. Her work has been exhibited at New York University, Columbia University, the American Museum of Natural History, Casita Maria, El Museo del Barrio, Marymount College, Brentwood International Ladies Garment Union, the Office of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and La Casa de la Herencia Cultural Puertorrique√±a.

It is in production in the Czech Republic. Design and development Ji≈ô√≠ Koneƒçn√Ω designed the CZAW SportCruiser while working for the Czech Aircraft Works (CZAW). His first design after he left CZAW to set up Roko Aero, the NG4 had much in common with the SportCruiser and uses some of its components, though the airframe is different in detail. Its commercial launch was in December 2007 and it was first shown in Prague in 2008. The two prototypes, one the ultralight NG4 UL and the other, the NG4 LSA meeting the LSA criteria, were demonstrated during 2008. The main differences between the two are in span and weight: the UL has a shorter span (8.10 m, 26 ft 7 in) than the LSA (10.10 m, 33 ft 1.5 in). With an empty weight of 298 kg (657 lb) the prototype UL was somewhat over its target of 280 kg (617 lb) but 32 kg (71 lb) lighter than the LSA. The NG4 is a conventionally laid out low wing monoplane, built from riveted aluminium apart from composite wing tips and engine cowling. It has straight-tapered wings with barely swept leading edges. The UL version has upturned tips and the LSA short chord winglets. Four position split flaps fill the trailing edges inboard of the ailerons. The port aileron has a flight adjustable trim tab. The tail surfaces are also straight-tapered; fin and rudder are swept. Rear control surfaces, like the ailerons are unbalanced; there is a large, centrally placed elevator trim tab. The cabin seats two side by side under a large, single-piece, forward-hinged canopy, with supplementary transparencies behind the seats where there is baggage space. Wing lockers provide further stowage space. The NG4 has a tricycle undercarriage with fuselage mounted cantilever spring legs. All wheels have spats. The LSA prototype is powered by a 75 kW (100 hp) Rotax 912 ULS engine, but the 86 kW (115 hp) Rotax 914 ULS, 90 kW (120 hp) Jabiru 2200 and 93 kW (125 hp) Continental IO-240 are options. The two Rotax engines are also options for the UL version, together with the lower-powered 50 kW (80 hp) Rotax 912 UL. Operational history By mid-2010, 12 NG4s appeared in European registers, and a total of 37 had been delivered.

It is the nineteenth episode of the show's seventh season and aired on April 24, 2011. Plot Susan is told by her doctor that she can't have sex for six weeks following her kidney transplant. She ends up having a sexy dream about Paul and wakes up in shock. Mike reveals that she has been moaning in her sleep and, believing that she was dreaming about him, asks her for details. However, Susan manages to stop him asking by saying that she will show him when they can have sex again in two days time. Later, Susan goes to pick up M.J. from Karen's and asks her to watch him again on Wednesday. Karen agrees, explaining that she knows that is the night Mike and Susan can have sex again. Susan is embarrassed, but as she leaves Karen points out that Susan's old house - rented by Paul - is messy. Susan goes over to check on Paul and, while she is waiting for him to answer the door, picks up his newspapers for him. She is surprised when he opens the door and she is face to face with his crotch. However, she notices that he is thin and behind on his chores and asks if he is alright. Paul insists that he is fine. Later, Susan tells Mike that Paul seems run down but Mike admits that he doesn't care, pointing out that Paul has behaved badly towards them in the past. He asks Susan to stay away from Paul. However, that night Susan has another sexy dream about Paul. At her next doctor's appointment, she asks if the dreams are normal. Her doctor suggests that her dreams are telling her to make sure Paul is all right and admits that they might not stop until she does. Susan goes to see Paul and eventually he reluctantly agrees to let her in. Susan, noticing that his house is a mess, decides to help him make a potato and leek soup. As they eat, Susan says they should start having meals together again. She suggests that Paul could become the friendly neighbor she used to have once more. Meanwhile, Mike drops off M.J. at Karen's house and is shocked to see through the window that Susan and Paul are together. He storms over there and Susan spots him. She goes outside and explains that Paul is suffering and has no-one. Mike is angry and claims that Paul is dangerous, but Susan says she doesn't need to be rescued and refuses to leave someone who is hurting. She goes back inside. Later, she returns home and is surprised to see a romantic meal laid out. Mike admits that he thought about it and realised that he can't be mad at Susan for being kind and compassionate. He carries her to the bedroom. Lynette is thrilled when she discovers that Tom has been invited to an important leadership conference and that she can go too. When they arrive, they meet Bob and Lee. Lynette goes to stand in the line for a drink and reads the conference program over somebody's shoulder. She begins chatting to the woman holding it and explains that she is looking forward to the keynote speaker, Chris Cavanaugh. The woman agrees and introduces herself as Meg Butler, the president of Amtec. Lynette explains that she is with her husband, and Meg immediately becomes rude, explaining that Lynette won't see Chris Cavanaugh because the seminars are not available to plus ones. Lynette is surprised and Meg explains that it is because some people spent their lives working up the corporate ladder and others just married someone who did. Lynette is furious but Lee manages to drag her away. Lynette ends up attending yoga, salsa dancing and flower arranging with the other plus ones and gets more and more frustrated. Eventually, she tries to persuade the other plus ones to storm the seminars with her, saying that they are in 21st century America, not an oppressive patriarchal regime. However, the organizers quickly offer the plus ones cocktails and they are distracted. Lynette gives up and takes a drink too. Later, she finds Tom and asks if he can pull some strings to get her into the Chris Cavanaugh talk but he admits that there is nothing he can do. One of the organizers arrives and drags Lynette away to the spa. While she is there, Lynette overhears Meg talking on the phone, explaining that she is going to spend time in the spa before going to Chris Cavanaugh's speech. While she is in a jacuzzi, Lynette steals Meg's pass and stuffs her clothes in a bin. She arrives at the speech and is ushered to a seat in the front row. However, she is shocked when the person on stage announces that Meg is going to introduce Chris. She gets up on stage and admits that she isn't Meg, before making a cringe-worthy introductory speech. She is interrupted when Meg arrives in her dressing gown, shouting that Lynette stole her pass and her clothes. Lynette runs away. Back at home, Renee comes over and discovers that Tom and Lynette are in the middle of a fight. Tom yells at Lynette that she embarrassed him, adding that for years he took a back seat to her career but she can't do the same for him. When he storms off, Lynette tells Renee that the conference was awful because the plus ones were treated like second class citizens. Renee admits that she will just have to get used to it. Carlos continues to ban Gaby from seeing Bree. Gaby and Bree stand in their gardens and speak on the phone. Bree admits that she can understand why Carlos feels the way he does and says that as much as she would like to see Gaby, she can't. Later, Bree goes to look after the Scavo house while they are away and Gaby arrives, claiming that she wanted to see Lynette. They start talking and eventually agree to have coffee together. Bree shuts the curtains so no-one can see them. Soon, they begin secretly spending time together. They admit that it is better because of the danger and Gaby suggests that they should go for a spa weekend. Later, Carlos arrives home and is surprised to see pineapple upside down cake - made by Bree - on the side. Gaby claims that she made it herself but Carlos is suspicious and asks her to make another one right now. He adds that he will watch her the entire time. Gaby goes to get the flour and spills some on herself. She tries to seduce Carlos, but he refuses to be distracted. Instead, she goes to clean off the flour and frantically calls Bree, asking for help. Bree decides to give her instructions on the phone and Gabrielle hides her headset with her hair. Bree guides her through the whole process as Carlos watches and makes her own cake at the same time. Later, the oven timer beeps and Gaby takes her cake out of the oven, but it collapses. She quickly throws a tea towel over it so that Carlos can't see and claims it needs to cool on the windowsill. As she distracts him, Bree rushes over and swaps her perfect cake with Gaby's disaster. Gaby tells Carlos that he should trust her and then shows him the perfect pineapple upside down cake. That weekend, she claims that she is going to the funeral of one of her old model friends. However, Carlos spots a red hair on her coat. Gaby claims that she hugged a clown at a birthday party, but Carlos takes her suitcase and discovers that she has packed bikinis and is planning a weekend away with Bree. He says that he banned her from seeing Bree and adds that ever since they moved to Wisteria Lane he feels like she always puts her friends first. He tells her to choose him or Bree, but Gaby tells him not to. However, he repeats that she has to choose. Later, Gabrielle goes over to Bree's house, explaining that there has been a change of plan because Carlos knows about them. She asks if she can stay with Bree and Bree agrees - but is shocked when Gaby also ushers in her daughters. Meanwhile, Karen is shocked when Felicia comes over. Felicia hands her a brooch that belonged to Martha, to thank her for keeping her secret for years. She adds that she will never tell anyone about the role that Karen played that night. Karen tells her it's not a good time to talk about it and is shocked to learn that Felicia is moving in next door. Inside, Karen asks Roy to get her a drink and has a flashback. She remembers seeing Felicia on the night that she cut off her fingers to frame Paul. Felicia explains what she has done and says that Paul will spend the rest of his life in prison if Karen says that she never saw Felicia. Karen is reluctant and begs Felicia not to make her do this, but eventually she agrees. Back in the present, Karen goes over to see Felicia, who explains that she got out of prison because her daughter died. Karen is shocked to hear that Felicia's daughter was Beth. Felicia claims that Paul wrote to Beth begging her to come and see him and made Beth fall in love with him. She alleges that when Paul was released he told Beth she didn't deserve to live and that he never loved her, so she killed herself. Karen is shocked and asks why Felicia wants to live on the same street as Paul. Felicia explains that she wants to make sure he never hurts another woman and Karen agrees to keep an eye on him as well.

It was his first book, although he had made his living as a writer for most of his adult life, working first as a journalist, magazine editor and freelance writer, and then moving into advertising and marketing copywriting. The book centers around Carlson's traumatic brain injury and subsequent recovery, as well as his mother's death from a traumatic brain injury. However the book is much more far-ranging, delving into such subjects as Zen Buddhism, sailing, divorce, children, family and even poetry. Ultimately it is a book about finding peace and happiness after a traumatic life event, a book about finding the joy in living. Plot summary Passage to Nirvana begins with Carlson's accident, when he was hit by a car standing outside a car wash, striking his head violently on the pavement, fracturing his skull, lapsing into a light coma and sustaining a traumatic brain injury, with bleeding on the brain and other damage. The story follows him through his brief hospitalization, then a year-long rehab in Florida, then his return to the North Fork of Long Island where he tries to rebuild his shattered life. His wife has left him and moved away with their children, his business has evaporated, he has no home and has to begin with noting to renew his life. During his year in Florida he also helps care for his mother, who is severely disabled from her own traumatic brain injury sustained when she fell down a flight of basement stairs. She is in a wheelchair, unable to walk, talk or feed herself. While he is in Florida, his mother eventually dies. Upon returning to Long Island, more misfortunes seem to continue: his aunt dies of cancer, as does his brother-in-law, and he returns to Buffalo to help his sister and her children while his brother-in-law is in the hospital. While this may sound morbid and depressing, the bulk of the book is uplifting, a positive affirmation of life. Carlson concentrates on his Zen Buddhist studies and meditation as a way of helping him heal, working with the noted writer and Zen teacher Peter Matthiessen. Sections of the book take place in the Ocean Zendo, a Zen center run by Matthiessen, and much of the book is a meditation on the spiritual aspects of healing, acceptance and rebuilding a life. Eventually Carlson meets a beautiful, understanding woman who has been through difficulties of her own: a difficult divorce, raising two children as a single mother. They fall in love, and decide to buy a sailboat named \\"Nirvana\\" that they discover rotting in a boatyard in St. Martin. They renovate the boat, sail her back to the eastern end of Long Island, where they are joined by their four children and two dogs, working at creating a new family and a new life. Eventually they sail \\"Nirvana\\" to the Bahamas for a winter writing sabbatical, where most of the book was written. Trying to describe the \\"plot\\" is difficult, however, as the book is really a collection of short essays, some about events happening in real time, some about traumatic brain injury, some reflections on various aspects of philosophy and Eastern thought, and some stories recalling the author's childhood. See the section \\"Unique Writing Style\\" below for more information. Unique writing style The book is written as a series of short, interconnected essays, many of them short, short stories no more than a few pages long, using some example from Carlson's life and recovery as a kind of moral fable. Most of the chapters are preceded by exceedingly short poems, often consisting of only three or four words, that Carlson calls a \\"Po.\\" The narrative of the book is not linear, and in the book's introduction Carlson says that much of the book's unique style came from how his brain functioned during his recovery. The Po because initially he could not remember long sentences; the short chapters because he could not remember longer chapters, and the non-linear narrative because that's how his mind was functioning, having trouble concentrating on any one thing for long periods of time. As such the narrative jumps back and forth, loops around in time, and is refreshingly inventive and interesting. At the same time, each short chapter is designed as a stand-alone essay, so the reader can pick up the book, turn to any chapter and read it as a kind of short story. Background and publication Written during 2005-2010, and published in 2010, Passage to Nirvana was rejected by a number of mainstream publishers and agents, due to its unusual writing style and layout. Because of his background in magazine publishing, Carlson decided to form his own publishing company, Henry Chapin and Sons, to publish and market the book. Given his interest in new technology, the internet, and the rapidly changing publishing business, he also decided to use the new crowdfunding paradigm for raising money to publish the book, and raised nearly $13,000 from small, individual donors using the arts funding web site kickstarter.Lane, Julie (2010-1-20). \\"Local authors go the self-publish route.\\" The Suffolk Times. Retrieved March 26, 2011. He then used Facebook, as well as the worldwide network of Amazon.com sites such as Amazon Japan as a way of marketing the book and reaching out to a worldwide readership, where the book found a following, gathering fans from not only the U.S., but from Canada, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, the U.K., Ireland, France, Italy, Russia, Poland, Morocco, South Africa, Croatia, India, Nepal, Indonesia, Japan, Australia and other countries. Reviews and criticism Passage to Nirvana has received positive reviews. One reviewer said, \\"Mr. Carlson is playful with words, which is part of the enchantment of his po-etics, or short poems, called po. With titles like ‚ÄúPassage to Nirvana‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Book of Po,‚Äù they made me think of ‚ÄúPassage to India‚Äù and ‚ÄúLife of Pi.‚Äù The references lead by imagination to the land of origin for Buddhism, or so I take it. Mr. Carlson‚Äôs journey is graced with whimsy, like a good south wind with the sail in a reach and spray in your face....The writing here is lucid, with a light touch ‚Äî light of heart.\\" Stuart, Rev. Robert (2011-3-10)\\"On the Road to Somewhere.\\" The East Hampton Star . Retrieved March 28, 2011. Another reviewer said \\"No one is perfect, and realizing this is the first step in finding that second opportunity in life. \\"Passage to Nirvana: A Survivor's Zen Voyage: Reflections on Loss, Discovery, Healing & Hope\\" is an inspirational and spiritual read from Lee Carlson. Recovering from a traumatic brain injury, he found new joy in life and found his own passage to joy in life through many arts of Zen. Thoughtful and riveting reading, \\"Passage to Nirvana\\" is an enlightening and educational read that shouldn't be overlooked for those looking for their own second chances.\\" (2011-01). Midwest Book Review.Retrieved March 28, 2011. A third review called Passage to Nirvana \\"An inspirational story of how love and the strength of the human spirit can triumph over adversity, Passage to Nirvana is a reminder to cherish every day and never forget that our health is, indeed, our wealth.\\"(2011-01). \\"Passage to Nirvana.\\" Windcheck Magazine. Retrieved March 28, 2011. While the book is ostensibly about recovering from traumatic brain injury, the spiritual nature of the book is one thing that seems to have captured many people's attention. There is the review in the East Hampton Star that was written by a minister (see first review above), and on the book's website there are many reviews and testimonials from people with two testimonials from religious teachers standing out: ‚ÄúAmazing, Really Amazing. I Want to Share it With Others.‚Äù -Rabbi John Linder, Temple Solei; and ‚ÄúDeserves to be Hailed As A Unique and Lasting Contribution to American Letters.‚Äù -Reverend Thomas Yorty, Westminster Presbyterian Church.

The Jets finished 6‚Äì10 (tied 3rd in AFC East) that season. With the acquisition of Sheldon Richardson in the 2013 NFL Draft, the Jets announced that Coples would transition to outside linebacker. During a preseason game against the Jacksonville Jaguars on August 17, 2013, Coples suffered a hairline ankle fracture after defending a pass thrown by Chad Henne. The Jets projected that Coples was going to be out indefinitely due to the injury but he eventually returned during Week 3 against the Buffalo Bills on September 22, 2013. During the 2013 season, Coples performed somewhat well at his new position as an outside linebacker playing 14 games (13 started) with 38 tackles, a forced fumble, 3 passes defended, and 4.5 sacks. The Jets finished 8‚Äì8 (tied 2nd in AFC East) that season. In 2014, Coples played all 16 games with 15 starts mostly at the outside linebacker position and made 35 tackles with 6.5 sacks along with a forced fumble. The Jets plummeted to a 4-12 record, their worst record since 2007. The Jets picked up the fifth-year, $7.8 million option of Coples' contract on April 23, 2015. Coples began to see limited playing time in 2015 due to lackluster performance, as he only made 8 tackles along with a fumble recovery in 10 games. The Jets waived Coples on November 23, 2015. = Miami Dolphins = On November 24, 2015, Coples was claimed off waivers by the Miami Dolphins. He was released by the Dolphins on February 12, 2016. = Los Angeles Rams = On March 16, 2016, Coples signed a two-year, $6.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Rams. He was released by the Rams on August 29, 2016.

The couple had six children: * Sibylle (1515‚Äì1592) : married in 1540 Duke Francis I of Saxe-Lauenburg (1510‚Äì1581) * Aemilia (1516‚Äì1591) : married in 1533 Margrave George the Pious of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1484‚Äì1534) * Sidonie (1518‚Äì1575) : married in 1545 Duke Eric II of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (1528‚Äì1584) * Maurice (1521‚Äì1553), Elector of Saxony : married in 1541 princess Agnes of Hesse (1527‚Äì1555) * Severinus (1522‚Äì1533) * Augustus (1526‚Äì1586), Elector of Saxony : married in 1548 princess Anne of Denmark and Norway (1532‚Äì1585) Catherine sympathized early with Martin Luther's teachings, while her husband suppressed the Reformation until 1536 for fear of his brother, the reigning Duke George the Bearded. Later, the Freiberg area became Lutheran. When duke George tried bear down on Catherine, she told the envoy: You could do me a big favor by leaving Freiberg right now. In 1539, after the death of Duke George, the couple moved to Dresden and brought the Reformation there. Duke Henry died on 18 August 1541; Catherine outlived him by 20 years. She spent her days in Wolkenstein castle. In 1560, she published a book on etiquette for ladies, which is culturally and historically very interesting.

MODA is the only museum in the Southeast devoted exclusively to the study and celebration of all things design.  Overview  The Museum examines how design affects people's daily lives through exhibitions, K-12 educational outreach, and adult programming. MODA regularly features exhibitions on architecture, industrial and product design, interiors and furniture, graphics, fashion and more. The museum is located on Peachtree Street, across from the High Museum of Art, in Midtown. History MODA first opened in 1989 as the Atlanta International Museum of Art & Design, and was located in the Peachtree Center district of Downtown Atlanta. In 2003, after receiving a series of local grants, the group rebranded and refocused itself as a design museum, launching a critically lauded run of exhibits on subjects such as Bauhaus virtuoso Marcel Breuer, Japanese architecture, and ladies handbag design. In 2011, MODA opened at its present location in Midtown Atlanta at the corner of 16th Street and Peachtree Street on the ground floor (and former parking garage) of a building restored by the architectural firm Perkins+Will. While the upper floors house Perkins+Will and the Peachtree Branch of the Atlanta Public Library, the Museum occupies of street-level space in the building that is LEED Platinum certified ‚Äî the highest environmental rating awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council. On 31 December 2012, Brenda Galina stepped down after five years as executive director. In early January 2013, the Board of Directors appointed Dr. Laura Flusche, Ph.D. as the new executive director.MODA Email to Members 06Feb13. Exhibitions The first exhibit at the Museum's new Midtown location was Passione Italiana: Design of the Italian Motorcycle. Curated by Joe Remling of ai3, Inc., the exhibition presented a dozen Italian motorcycle designs spanning the last five decades with designs by MV Agusta, Ducati, Bimota, and Moto-Morini. Other 2011 exhibitions included WaterDream, a survey of the history of bathroom design, followed by a retrospective of a quarter- century of international AIDS posters. 2012 exhibitions included Emerging Voices 11, an exhibition dedicated to celebrating the work and talent of Atlanta's young architecture community. This was done in partnership with AIA Atlanta and the Young Architects Forum Atlanta. Following that exhibit was Stories in Form: Chair Design by the Portfolio Center. The works featured in Stories in Form were created as part of Portfolio Center's nationally acclaimed course \\"Modernism: History, Criticism and Theory,\\" which explores design history as a catalyst for new design ideas. While learning about Modernism, the history of design and the development of critical thinking skills, students in the course create chairs by means of a design process that combines inspiration from a historical period with personal experience. In addition to demonstrating the step-by-step design process that brings these chairs into being, the exhibition highlighted the ways in which design objects tell stories of design history and personal experience. Another exhibit was Skate It or Hang It!? The Evolution of Skateboard Art. The exhibition, curated by W. Todd Vaught, examined the visual aspects skateboarding, a sport important to contemporary youth culture since the 1970s, by presenting a broad range of styles, imagery, and visual expression in skateboard art. With a broad focus on skateboard graphics‚Äîin particular the styles and methods used to embellish skateboard decks‚Äîthe exhibition appealed to a broad range of skateboarders, designers, artists and to Atlanta's youth in general. Beginning 2013 was The South's Next Wave: Design Challenge. This was presented as part exhibition, part competition; pairing designers of interior spaces with object designers to create imaginative vignettes throughout the museum. The exhibit was curated by David Goodrowe and Tim Hobby, co-founders of the design firm Goodrowe  Hobby. MODA visitors were asked to choose their favorite vignette and object. Other exhibits at the museum have focused on alternative voices in game design, the work of architect Eero Saarinen, the work of designer Paul Rand, the design of everyday things, designing for social impact and other topics. Museum space MODA logo The exhibit space at MODA is in two main galleries with clean, industrial lines and concrete floors. The front desk area can double as a reception space and the back gallery has a vaulted ceiling with windows stretching up two stories. The museum has a built-in A/V system with ceiling-mounted digital projectors, track lighting that can switch on via motion detector, and banks of security cameras.

Location  It is situated on the A483 road, between the towns of Welshpool and Oswestry right on the banks of the river Severn.  Attractions & amenities  Although only a small village in terms of population, there is a church, St John the Evangelist, and a pub, the Powis Arms. The Offa's Dyke Path also passes through the village following the towpath of the Montgomeryshire (latterly the Montgomery) canal. There are views of Admiral Rodney's Pillar, situated on the Breidden Hill, and The Long Mountain.  History  The village gets its name from the fact that it was the highest navigable point of the river close to Welshpool which was originally simply called Pool or Poole. Thus the village was the quay for Pool. Nearby is the site of Strata Marcella Abbey. Besides seeing trade on the Severn, the Montgomery Canal also passes through the village and transshipment between canal and river was conducted in the village. The village was served by the Cambrian Railways, and its successors the Great Western Railway and British Railways until 1965 although the station was some distance from the main village.

It was developed by NeocoreGames, and was published in October 2010 by Paradox Interactive. In Russia the game was published by 1C Company and Snowball Studios called Kings' Crusade. Lionheart. Gameplay The player has a choice to play the campaign scenario or multiplayer game. =Campaign= left The player's aim in the campaign is to conquer the Middle East and merge it under his reign. By winning the battles, and taking certain political decisions, the player must lead Richard the Lionheart and his army to victory, over their enemies. In this campaign the player will be doing business with representatives of several blocks. These parties often have opposing interests, their goals differ in campaigns. Before the battle, the player will have to choose an ally. Interaction with a specific unit increases the player's reputation among its members, with an increase in the level of fame new opportunities arise. Political blocs Crusaders: *France ‚Äî constantly in conflict with England, but on the brink of war with the infidels, French king is ready to send Lionheart his heavy cavalry. *Knights Templar ‚Äî order of chivalry, featuring well- organized armies and wealth. They offer a useful economic improvements, and are sent to the east to fight. *Papacy ‚Äî if the player will enlist the support for the Pope, he will be able to spend less on recruitment of soldiers, their morale will increase, and the papal legate will be able to pass under his start in battle. *Holy Roman Empire ‚Äî they use the campaign strongest infantry detachments, and after the withdrawal of its troops to help the Lionheart became useful improvements for the infantry. The second campaign tells the story of Sultan Saladin, and begins after the crusade of Richard. Choosing the side of his troops, the player will try to regain the Holy Land under the wing of the Muslims. There are a few differences from the campaign for the Christians. *The Saracens have a rich cultural heritage and the quest for new knowledge. They stand united and are not torn by arguments between factions like the Crusaders are. The development of science is presented as a tree technology. Improvements for the troops sold for ducats and the player gets more improvement points as he successfully performs tasks. A tree technology have three branches: the ability to provide access to the deeds of legendary heroes, the troops - to the new types of troops, and the main branch contains improvements of a general nature. *The power of belief ‚Äî unlike skills, which are not free and require the expenditure points, faith does not. During the phase control, points of faith are becoming the replenished property. =Multiplayer= right Selecting this menu item, you can fight with other players via the Internet. There are two modes in a multiplayer game: *Domination - provides for the equality of the enemy and symmetrical construction. Before the game starts you can adjust the amount of core resources and to choose the right battlefield. Dominance: as already mentioned, in this regime the enemy forces are equal. You can gain the upper hand through the proper selection and application teams. It is very important to be aware of the terrain on the battlefield and take into account certain weather conditions. In other words, use the single-player experience. Your goal - to capture and retain most of the victory points. *Protection and attack - simulates attack and distributes forces evenly. In this case, one player becomes the protector, while the other becomes the attacker, you can specify a maximum duration of the battle. Objectives: players are different, the attacker must defeat the enemy and stay within a specified time, and defender - hold on and not give himself into the enemys hands. First, before the battle, you can get more gold, but the defender can spend the points of construction to strengthen its position: to cut down trees, to build a low wall, oil traps, or Trebuchet. In both modes of the game, you can spend gold on the troops and heroes, like hiring the troops and providing them with useful items. Apart in the game modes are scenarios - some battles in which players have to contend with the armies under the control of artificial intelligence. =Battles= left During battles in real-time it is important to influence the ability of the characters. The battlefield also influences the outcome of battle. All combat units have access to a variety of formations, that change their effectiveness against certain kinds of enemy troops. The landscape also influences the effectiveness of certain warriors: the actions in the forestry areas prevents the cavalry, in contrast to the open space. Morale also plays a big role, displaying during the battle at the top of the screen and showing the morale of the opposing sides. During the campaigns and battles the player can discover battle trophies - special items to help the troops. The power and the number of available character relics depends on the number of points of faith. =RPG elements= When teams get a new level, a player can raise some of their units characteristics, such as: attack, defense, or reduce maintenance costs. When the heroes get a new level, they can get access to new abilities. In the game there are 4 kinds of forces: *Light Infantry *Heavy Infantry *Archers *Cavalry Reception GameSpot gave the game 7.5, saying that the game has historical accuracy toward the crusades, but also mentioning the unimaginative multiplayer.

During his career, he won the Rodeo Association of America (RAA) All-Around Cowboy championship in 1935 and 1937 and was second three times; he also won eight titles in individual disciplines. Bowman was involved in organizing cowboys, founding the first group for pro rodeo competitors, the Cowboys' Turtle Association (CTA), now known as the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). From 1936 to 1945, he served as president of the organization. Bowman was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 1979. Rodeo career Bowman was born in Hope, New Mexico, and moved to Arizona when he was 13 years old; he also spent part of his youth in Texas. He joined the pro rodeo circuit in the 1920s: historian Michael Allen wrote that he started in 1924, while the Associated Press gave his debut year as 1925. According to the agency, he took up the sport after attending a Salt Lake City rodeo. In 1926, he won two disciplines and the all- around title at the Ellensburg Rodeo, and finished second for the all-around title at the Pendleton Round-Up. The next year, Bowman won the steer wrestling title at the Ellensburg Rodeo for the second straight year, and finished tied with his brother, Ed, for the all-around title. Bowman teamed with Jack Traynor to win a team steer roping world championship and set a single-run speed record that same year. In 1929, Bowman was the all-around champion at the Calgary Stampede despite not participating in the bronc riding discipline. Bowman won his first RAA season championship in the tie-down roping discipline that year; he added a steer wrestling championship in 1930. At the Calgary Stampede in 1931, he set the fastest-ever time for a calf roping run. Bowman won a third Ellensburg Rodeo steer wrestling title in 1932, and earned an all- around victory at the Frontier Day event in Prescott, Arizona. In 1933, he claimed the RAA season steer wrestling championship for the second time. The year 1935 was Bowman's most successful on the RAA circuit in terms of season championships. He was named All-Around Cowboy winner, and earned his third steer wrestling and second tie-down roping titles. Bowman finished second in the All-Around Cowboy standings in 1936, but in 1937 won his second All-Around Cowboy crown in three years, along with his third calf roping title. That same year, he claimed his only season steer roping championship. In 1938, he won his eighth and final discipline title in steer wrestling, which was his fourth in that category; Bowman finished second in the All-Around Cowboy standings, trailing Burel Mulkey at the end of the season by 87 points. He repeated his second-place finish in 1939. His career ended in 1943, with his final performance at New York City. Bowman won rodeo's Triple Crown (three season championships in one year) twice; Trevor Brazile and Jim Shoulders are the only other cowboys to achieve this feat more than once. During his career and after his death, media members compared Bowman to baseball's Babe Ruth. Fellow rodeo participant Phil Meadows credited him with doing \\"more to put the cowboy in good graces than any other man,\\" calling him \\"a cowboy's cowboy.\\" In competition, Allen said that \\"timed events\\" were considered a strength of Bowman. He did not compete in bronc riding after 1928, saying \\"Too many events and a man is no good in any of them.\\" CTA leader In November 1936, a rodeo was scheduled to be held in Boston, but cowboys were displeased with their lack of authority in organizing the event. Led by several cowboys, including Bowman, a group of cowboys began a strike. Although the promoter of the rodeo expressed interest in using replacement performers, the group's effort to engage in bargaining was successful. The Boston strike resulted in the formation of the CTA.Allen, p. 78. Bowman was the founder of the CTA; it was the first organization of cowboys, and according to Bowman was named because of the lack of speed with which it was created. The group was initially named the United Cowboys' Turtle Association and was founded on November 6, 1936; the first word of their title was later removed. Rusty McGinty was elected as the organization's president, but he gave Bowman the position.Bernstein, pp. 91‚Äì93. Bowman served through 1945, when the CTA became the Rodeo Cowboys Association; the organization later changed its name to the PRCA, which it is now known as. He did announce his resignation in July 1939 when a group of cowboys refused to pay $500 fines for strikebreaking, but Bowman was reelected in February 1940 and nobody else was named to the position before then.Bernstein, p. 93. According to Bowman, even though the CTA's members were able to participate in strikes, the CTA was not a true union. The CTA fought for increased prize purses and control over who judged events. In 1937, the group participated in a national strike which affected events including the Ellensburg Rodeo and Pendleton Round-Up, forcing the use of cowboys who were not part of the CTA's membership. The dispute was resolved in Ellensburg in 1938, and in 1939 in Pendleton.Bernstein, p. 95. The organization frequently battled with the RAA and rodeo committees, who the CTA saw as the RAA's membership.Bernstein, pp. 94‚Äì95. Rodeo magazine editor Will Porter has referred to Bowman as \\"probably the most forceful man in rodeo history.\\"Bernstein, p. 97. The strong-minded personality he had has been the subject of criticism; author Joel H. Bernstein wrote of Bowman that he \\"was not the best of diplomats and there was no way to change his mind when he felt he was right.\\" Despite this, he received praise from CTA member Everett Shaw, who said, \\"These young fellows in Rodeo now, or starting out, will never realize how much they owe to Everett Bowman.\\"Allen, p. 79. Later life and legacy Bowman became a candidate for the sheriff's office in Maricopa County, Arizona as a Democrat in 1944, and gained a job as sheriff in Wickenburg. Historian Willard Porter said that, while in Wickenburg, he \\"held dances, taught horsemanship and talked rodeo to anyone who happened by.\\" In addition, he worked as a rancher in Hillside, accompanied by his wife, Lois.Bernstein, p. 91. Piloting was one of Bowman's hobbies; he had a pilot's license and once flew with Yavapai County Sheriff Willis Butler in a search for a missing two-year-old child. Into his 60s, Bowman continued to make public appearances. He was the Grand Marshal of a parade held in connection to Prescott's Frontier Days rodeo in 1966, and in 1969 accepted a movie role as a pastor in The Great White Hope. In 1971, Bowman died at the age of 72 while flying a plane he owned, which crashed near the ranch he tended. He was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 1979, the Pendleton Round-Up and Happy Canyon Hall of Fame in 1985, and the Ellensburg Rodeo Hall of Fame in 2004. Previously, he had been inducted into the Rodeo Hall of Fame of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1955.

It commonly ranges in height from 4 to 10 feet and often occurs in coastal conditions and near wetlands. The common name Necklacepod is derived from the characteristic string of seed pods that develop after its yellow flowers germinate into seeds. Necklacepod is a nectar plant for bees, butterflies, and in parts of the Americas hummingbirds as well. It is suggested for use by native plant enthusiasts in Florida as a good landscape plant for xeriscaping but it only naturally occurs in coastal counties in the central and southern part of the state, while closely related varieties occur in Texas, and the Caribbean. The variety of Necklacepod growing in Australia is considered an endangered species in some areas due to the clearing of coastal habitat and displacement by invasive species. In Sri Lanka, the plant is known as Moodu Murunga.The inedible pod has some similarities to the Murunga (Drumstick) pod.

The system is designed for Texas Instruments MSP430x microcontrollers. Target microcontroller platform has limited resources, i.e. system clock frequency in tens of MHz and memories amount from tens to a few hundreds KB. The system is adapted to such conditions by providing its compact and efficient image. The efficiency term means here minimization of additional CPU load caused by the system usage. According to this definition, the system is more effective when it consumes less CPU time for execution of its internal parts (e.g. threads management). The DioneOS system is intended for autonomic devices where user interface has limited functions. The core functionality provided by the system is an environment for building multitasking firmware by means of standard, well known concepts (e.g. semaphores, timers, etc.). Because of the target domain of application, the system has no graphical user interface. Memory model Texas Instruments company manufactures a wide range of microcontrollers that use the MSP430 core. Depending on the version, the chip contains different amount of flash memory and RAM (e.g. MSP430f2201 has 1KB/128B correspondingly, but MSP430f5438 - 256KB/16KB). When the size of the memory exceeds 64 KB limit,it happens when the memory cannot fit in a range 0‚Äì64 KB 16 bits addressing is insufficient. Due to this constraint, chips with larger memory are equipped with extended core (MSP430x). This version of the processor has wider registers (20 bits) and new instructions for processing them. At compilation, the programmer selects the type of memory model ('near' or 'far') that is used for FLASH and RAM memories. This choice determines accessible memory range, hence when the FLASH above 64 KB limit is programmed, the 'far' model must be used. The DioneOS supports the 'far' model for code modules, so large firmware that uses extended FLASH can be developed and run under the system's control. The system uses the 'near' memory model for data segments. Threads management The firmware started under the DioneOS system consists of threads that are executed in pseudo-parallel way. Each thread has its own, unique priority used for ordering the threads from the most important to the least one. The thread priority value defines a precedence for running over others. In the DioneOS system the thread can be in one of following states: * Running - the thread is currently executed by processor, * Ready - the thread is ready to be run, * Waiting - the thread is blocked and waits on some synchronization object. Because there is only one core in the processor, only one thread can be in Running state. This is the thread that has the highest priority from all threads that are not in Waiting state. Change of the thread state can be caused by: * triggering an object, that hold the thread, * unsuccessful acquiring the object that is already locked (e.g. a mutex that is owned by someone else), * elapsing timeout, * state change of another thread, that may lead to preemption. The system handles up to 16 threads, including idle one with the lowest priority. The idle thread should be always ready to be run, and never switched to Waiting state, so it is not permitted to call any functions that would block from inside this thread. The idle thread can be used to determine total system load. Features of the system The DioneOS system provides: * items for synchronisation: mutexes and counting semaphores, used for thread synchronization, signalling from ISR to a thread and guarding shared resources, * methods for time management: timers, thread sleeping, timeouts, * communications items implemented by events and queues available as circular buffers, * memory management by memory pool that allocates memory only in fixed-size blocks but is free of fragmentation issues that may appear when heap is used. Regular allocation by malloc/free on heap is also available, it is provided by standard C libraries. * testing support objects: signaling events on chip pins, critical exceptions, objects marking that helps is detection of errors like usage of deleted object or double memory deallocation, etc. Context switch As it was stated in the 'Threads Management' chapter, the firmware consists of pseudo-parallel threads. Each thread has its own context, that contains core registers of the processor, last execution address and private stack. During the switch between threads the system saves the context of stopped thread and recovers the context of the one being run. This state saving makes possible breaking the thread execution and further continuation, even if between them other thread has been executed. Note that preemption followed by context switch may happen in any moment, even if no system function is called in the thread. Although it may happen in unexpected location in the executed code, the thread work is not distorted due to the system and the context saving. From the thread point of view, the switch can be done in background. The context switch is critical operation in the system and the time of its execution determines if how effective the system is. Because of that the context switch in the DioneOS system was optimized for short time. The most important parts were written in assembler, so the switch can be done in 12‚Äì17 Œºsswitching time depends on the system configuration, the longer value appears when the switch is interfered by system tick interrupt. (for fosc=25 MHz). In the DioneOS system the context switch can be initiated from interrupt service routine. This property is useful for moving an event handling to the thread and commonly implemented in two-layer architecture: * the interrupt handler - is called after hardware interrupt has occurred. In this part interrupts are disabled, so execution cannot be continued for long time, otherwise the system responsiveness is compromised. In this layer only jobs that require fast response for interrupt should be processed, any others should be passed to higher layer, * higher layer - processing in separated thread without blocking interrupts; this thread can be preempted. Constraints are not so tight here as in the interrupt handler. The code execution does not block the system. * The context switch measured from signaling point in ISR to other thread recovery takes 10us (for fosc=25 MHz) in the DioneOS system. Configuration The DioneOS has multiple configuration options that affects features inserted in the compiled image of the system. A lot of them are source code switches that are gathered in configuration file and can be altered by a developer of firmware. By this means it is possible to control additional testing parts. If they are enabled the system is built in a version that provides more detection of unusual conditions and run-time information that helps in debugging process. When the errors are found and eliminated these extra features can be disabled for having full performance of the system.

The OKS has subsequently been validated for use in assessing other non-surgical therapies applied to those suffering from issues with the knee. The OKS consists of twelve questions covering function and pain associated with the knee. It was designed and developed by researchers within the department of Public Health and Primary Health CareDepartment of Public Health and Primary Health Care at the University of Oxford in association with surgical colleagues at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre.Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre The benefit to this questionnaire is that it is short, practical, reliable, valid and sensitive to clinically important changes over time. The Oxford Knee Score is owned, managed and supported by Isis Outcomes, an activity within Isis Innovation Ltd, the Technology Transfer Company for the University of Oxford.  Score Evaluation  The original evaluation of the Oxford Knee Score was as follows: First, each of the 12 answers are assigned the previously defined number of points. They range from 1 = least difficult to 5 = most difficult. The 12 ratings are then added together to give a total score used to assess the patient. The possible total score ranges from 12 to 60 points. Here, a low score (e.g. 12 points) indicates good outcomes and vice versa. Because of misunderstandings concerning this, the right holders proposed a different system where response points range from 0 to 4 with a total score range from 0 to 48. Here, a high score (e.g. 48) indicates satisfactory joint function and vice versa. Both scoring systems remain valid. To avoid misinterpretation one should always show the scoring system used.
