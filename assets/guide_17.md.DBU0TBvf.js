He was killed after crashing his Lancaster in thick fog near Kelstern following an operation to bomb Berlin (the infamous Black Thursday). RAF career Holford was inspired to join the RAF when his uncle Air Com D’Arcy Greig won the 1929 Schneider Trophy in a Napier engined Supermarine S5. Greig gave him his leather flying helmet and his destiny was cast (source, his widow Joan Holford). Holford joined the RAF in 1938 aged 17. After pilot training he had become a Wellington bomber pilot with 99 Squadron at RAF Newmarket in March 1940. At Newmarket he flew 11 operations as a second pilot. He flew six missions with Flight Lieutenant Percy Pickard, who later portrayed the fictional Squadron Leader Dickson, in the 1941 propaganda film, Target for Tonight. By June 1940 Holford was captain of his own aircraft and completed a further 15 operations. For nursing a severely damaged aircraft back from an operation he was Mentioned in Despatches and later received the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) before a promotion to Flying Officer and becoming an instructor at RAF Bassingbourn. As a flight lieutenant, Holford was assigned to 103 Squadron at RAF Elsham Wolds, flying 29 operations, including flying a Wellington on a daylight attack against the fleeing German battleships and on 12 February 1942, during what became known as the Channel Dash. For his actions that day, Holford was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and promoted to squadron leader aged just 21. Holford flew the four-engined Halifax bomber and trained and flew operations with 103 Squadron before converting to Lancasters. After marrying Joan, a WAAF RAF Intelligence Officer, left Elsham Wolds for a flight commander position at RAF Lindholme. His still flew actively, attacking Berlin on 17 January 1943. Just four days before his 22nd birthday in February 1943, Holford was promoted to Wing Commander, the youngest man to hold this rank in Bomber Command and one of the youngest in the history of the RAF. On 21 November he was posted to Waltham to take command of 100 Squadron. On the 16 December 1943, 100 Squadron received orders to attack Berlin. Holford piloted a Lancaster for the attack.

Harrison is the Kent and Joyce Kresa Leadership Chair of the Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy at Caltech, Benjamin M. Rosen Professor of Physics at Caltech and the Principal Investigator for NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission. She won the Hans Bethe Prize in 2020 for her work on NuSTAR. Biography Harrison was born in Santa Monica, CA but moved to Boulder, CO, at age three. She completed her undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College in 1985 with high honors in physics, and went to U.C. Berkeley for graduate studies, completing a PhD in 1993. She then went to Caltech as a Millikan Fellow, joining the faculty as an Assistant Professor of Physics in 1995. She became a full professor in 2005 and was appointed as the Benjamin M. Rosen Professor of Physics in 2013. Research Harrison's research combines the development of new instrumentation with observational work focused on high energy observations of black holes, neutron stars, gamma-ray bursts and supernova remnants. As the Principal Investigator for NuSTAR, the first focusing telescope in orbit operating in the high energy part of the X-ray spectrum (3 - 79 keV), she led an international team to propose, develop and launch the mission. The focal plane detectors and instrument electronics were built in Harrison's labs at Caltech. She led the science team executing the two-year baseline mission, which extended from August 2012 - August 2014. Harrison's observational research showed that the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts exhibit breaks in their decay rate due to collimation of the ejecta. Scientific highlights from the NuSTAR mission include mapping the radioactive debris in the Cassieopeia A supernova remnant to constrain the core collapse explosion mechanism, measurement of the spin of supermassive and stellar mass black holes, the discovery of a magnetar in the Galactic Center, and the discovery of an ultra luminous pulsar. Awards and honors Harrison was awarded the Presidential Early Career award by President Clinton in 2000, was named one of America's best leaders by U.S. News and the Kennedy School of Government, was awarded a NASA Outstanding Public Leadership medal in 2013, and the Bruno Rossi Prize of the American Astronomical Society in 2015.

The magazine has been released regularly since February 2001. History Scene World was founded in November 2000 by several Commodore scene personalities under the organization of Joerg \\"Nafcom\\" Droege. The initial magazine presentation system was programmed by Robin Harbron, who would later find success as one of the developers of the C64 Direct-to-TV game device. Harbron stopped actively supporting the magazine in 2001; the presentation system has since been documented, modified, and updated by various editors and staff members. Throughout Scene Worlds history, it has attempted to style itself as both an NTSC (North America, Japan, and South Korea) and PAL (Europe, Oceania, and the Middle East) production, allowing it to court talent and reach audiences in largely disparate computer cultures. Scene World has also been one of the few disk magazines to actively seek individuals that do not fit into the specific software cracking or demo scene subcultures that most other disk magazines focus on. As a result, it has been able to conduct interviews with numerous non-Commodore-related computer industry pioneers. Additionally, Scene World partnered with fellow disk magazine Loadstar (ISSN 0886-4144) in 2003 for a \\"Wild West\\" cross-promotion. Scene World currently utilizes an all-volunteer editorial staff of 20, and produces two issues of the disk magazine per year, generally in summer and winter, with video interviews scheduled to coincide with the disk magazine releases. Podcasts and video reviews are released on a semi-monthly basis, and do not follow the release schedule of the magazine. Magazine content Issues of the magazine are delivered as downloadable disk image files for use in emulators or on actual Commodore hardware. Additionally, issues can be viewed online, via an embedded version of the VICE emulator. Text of the magazine is provided via presentation software. This software allows users to select and read articles and scroll through text, while also allowing them to change text and background color, switch between fonts, alternate between logos, and select either music or silence. Uniquely, support for the Commodore 1351 computer mouse is a feature of the presenter system; during initial planning, Droege felt that American users would be more inclined to view the magazine if it resembled Berkeley Softworks' GEOS operating environment. The text of the magazine is divided into articles or chapters, and covers topics ranging from news and updates, interviews (text-only or transcribed from video interviews), opinion and editorial content, demo party reports, and release charts. In addition to Commodore-specific files, a PDF floppy disk sleeve image is also included with each issue. These \\"diskcovers\\" can be printed to create protective sleeves for people using physical floppy disks. Further endeavors In 2012, Droege expanded Scene Worlds non-disk magazine activities to focus on video-based interviews, initially with Michael Tomczyk and John Draper, and later with other technology pioneers such as Martin Cooper, Jeroen Tel, Bil Herd, Chuck Peddle, Yash Terakura, Walter Day, James Bach, Alexey Pajitnov, Stewart Cheifet, Chris Huelsbeck, Jeri Ellsworth, and Ralph H. Baer. Baer's interview, in particular, garnered significant attention, it being the final—and longest—interview he gave prior to his death in December 2014. In July 2014, Scene World again expanded with an audio podcast, hosted by associate editor AJ Heller (with Droege as co-host), to focus primarily on technology personalities and newsmakers that are currently active and promoting products or services. Guests to date have included Tarnkappe.info's Lars Sobiraj; Frederik Schreiber and Mike Nielsen of 3D Realms; Matt Falcus and Sven Vößing of Cinemaware; SiREN and Esper from Ubisoft's Frag Dolls professional gaming team; game music pioneers David Lowe and Rob Hubbard; Super Mario voice actor Charles Martinet; Vanessa Arteaga; David Fox; Ron Gilbert; Dan Wood; and Jay Maynard, a cosplayer famous for his \\"Tron\\"-based costume, known as the Tron Guy. In June 2015, Droege further expanded Scene Worlds online presence with a channel on the streaming platform Twitch. This channel currently hosts live interviews, conducted by the staff, and aims to create original programming, as well as stream the staff's participation in live and charity events. Since August 2015, Scene World has been a part of the retro area at the video game trade fair Gamescom, running a booth in tandem with retro game music group \\"Hans Hiscore\\". Visitors to the booth can interact with the staff and read the magazine live on a real Commodore 64, as well as play music on Atari and C64 home computers with Hans Hiscore. In December 2015, Scene Worlds YouTube channel began hosting video reviews of new Commodore 64 hardware and software, beginning with a review of a new C64 Wi-Fi adapter, designed by Leif Bloomquist, which gained some coverage in both international and German press. In July 2018, Droege also spoke about the magazine's involvement in video game preservation in an interview  surrounding the C64 Mini and other retro gamig topics - conducted by the gaming scorekeeping institution Twin Galaxies. In August 2018, Scene World released its first Amiga issue of Scene World #28. In November 2018, the Internet Archive added a collection page for the Scene World Podcast to preserve its episodes. In December 2018, Scene World decided to release all video interviews with technology pioneers also as audio versions to make it possible to listen to each interviews rather than watching it on YouTube. For this, a Scene World Tech Interviews RSS feed in podcast format has been created with each interview listed on a dedicated webpage. To help preservation, all interviews are on a dedicated collection page at the Internet Archive as well. In popular culture Scene World has received media attention on several occasions. In March, 2001, Droege was interviewed by the German Radio channel Bayern 3 of Bayerischer Rundfunk. In October 2005, Droege was interviewed in the German magazine Lotek64 and in 2013 in German magazine LOAD #2. On November 11, 2016, Droege was interviewed about the topic of retro gaming as part of a news item in the ZDF news program Heute. On December, 8th 2016, the same news item - containing different quotes from participating interviewees - was aired as part of ZDF's Breakfast television program. In 2015, Droege was recognized for his work on Scene World with a trading card (#2296) in The Walter Day Collection. Excerpts of The Scene World Podcast featuring Heller, David Lowe, and Holly Jazz Lowe were featured in the documentary Uncle Art: The Film in late 2018. Charity and fundraising Following the podcast with UbiSoft's Frag Dolls professional gaming team, Scene World staff members Droege and Heller committed to participating in the Extra Life (fundraiser) charity organization. The two raised money for the Illuminate team (former Frag Dolls team) in 2015 and currently participate with their own team, \\"Scene World,\\" since 2016. In August 2016, Scene World also committed to participate in fundraising for The AbleGamers Foundation as Team Scene World. In May 2017, Scene World helped the Swiss computer museum Musée Bolo by creating awareness about their fundraising to reach beyond the French Swiss community in order to ensure the museum's future existence. .

It consists of settings for high voice and piano of six poems by the Russian poet Alexandr Pushkin (17991837), in their original language. It was published as his Op. 76. The cycle is dedicated to his Russian friends Galina Vishnevskaya (\\"Galya\\") (soprano) and her husband Mstislav Rostropovich (\\"Slava\\") (cellist, pianist and conductor). Britten had previously dedicated several compositions for cello to Rostropovich. He had wanted Vishnevskaya to sing the soprano part in the 1962 premiere of his War Requiem, but the authorities had refused her a visa to travel outside the Soviet Union. The Poet's Echo was first performed in public by the dedicatees at the Moscow Conservatoire on 2 December 1965, by which time the composer had returned to England. A typical performance lasts about 15 minutes.

Biography Brewer was born in Havana, Cuba in 1958. As a child, his family moved often living in New Orleans, San Pedro, Harbor City, and Wilmington. Brewer began playing guitar in his early teens His first band was called The Obstacles which played new wave pop. Brewer met Joe Baiza in Wilmington one summer and Baiza began attending band rehearsals. Baiza joined the band as bass player and slowly started moving the band from a pop sound to something more punk. One by one band members left until it was just Brewer and Baiza. After spending almost a year attempting to put together a new lineup which included a failed audition by Mike Watt, the freshly renamed Saccharine Trust played their first gig in 1980 with Minutemen. The lineup consisted of Baiza on guitar, Brewer on vocals, Luis Maldonado on bass, and Richie Wilder on drums. The band took the name Saccharine Trust from a line in the David Bowie song \\"The Bewlay Brothers\\" on Hunky Dory. Brewers lyrics often featured Biblical imagery and a fascination with Gene Scott. Brewer's performances have been noted for his \\"stuttering, enunciated vocals\\". Brewer wrote the lyrics for Minutemen's \\"God Bows to Math\\" from their Double Nickels on the Dime album. Saccharine Trust were first active in the early to mid-1980s, after which Brewer formed the Jack Brewer Band and in the 1990s recorded several albums with jazz trio Bazooka. Brewer and Baiza both performed with Unknown Instructors and reformed Saccharine Trust in 1996 and have been active to the present. Brewer joined Baiza, Watt, and George Hurley (Minutemen) to record vocals for The Way Things Work by experimental rock band Unknown Instructors. Brewer was one of the subjects, along with Mike Watt, of Jim Sikora's My Char-Broiled Burger With Brewer which Sikora describes as a \\"portrait of an old and enduring friendship between two musicians—one who is very successful (Mike Watt of the Minutemen and the Stooges) and the other (Jack Brewer of Saccharine Trust) who is sliding into obscurity.\\" References Living people American punk rock singers Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Jack Brewer (musician)"},{"id":"46512614","text":"Alvany Rocha-Caridi is a mathematician at the City University of New York who specializes in the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, and who is particularly known for her computation of the characters of the Virasoro algebra..

It is distinguished by its small, decussate leaves and small flower heads which rarely have more than one flower in each inflorescence. Description Melaleuca subalaris is a shrub or sometimes a small tree growing to about tall with branches and leaves that are glabrous when mature. Its leaves are arranged in alternating pairs, each pair at right angles to the ones above and below (decussate) so that the leaves form four rows along the stems. Each leaf is long and wide, narrow oval to egg-shaped, oval in cross-section and with a blunt end. The flowers are white to pale yellow and arranged on the side branches. Sometimes there are up to 4 single flowers in a head up to in diameter. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers and there are 8 to 18 stamens per bundle. The main flowering period is in September and October and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long forming loose clusters on the old wood. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca subalaris was first formally described in 1988 by Bryan Barlow in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (subalaris) is from the Latin word alaris meaning \\"of the wing\\" and the prefix -sub meaning “under” referring to the flowers being in a spike rather than axillary. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in and between the Peak Charles, Zanthus and Esperance districts in the Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in clay or sandy soils on the edges of salt pans. Conservation Melaleuca subalaris is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Electronic scoring systems or electronic targets are automated scoring systems used for sport shooting where the shot placement and score is automatically calculated using electronics and presented on screens to the organizer and shooters. The score may also be shown on a big screen for audience at the shooting range, and this has in many ways revolutionized the shooting sport. With traditional paper targets the audience has to understand the signals used for scoring, and perhaps managed to monitor the scoring of maximum two targets at once, while with electronics the current scores can be shown on big screens only fractions of a second after the shot is fired and the audience can easily see how different shooters compare to each other. Electronic targets automatically gauge the hits, so that no physical inspection of hits is needed. Some systems even allow real time publishing on the internet. The scoring can also be held back by the Range Officer until the string of fire is finished, so that scores for each competitor can be shown in ascending order.  Use  British paratrooper from 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment engaging a close range electronic knock-down target. Electronic scoring system used at the 2016 Summer Olympics 10 meter air rifle competition Electronic targets are used for all types of sport shooting ranging from 10 meter air rifle to over 1000 meter long range shooting competitions, for \\"running targets\\" (moving on rails) like the ISSF 50 meter running target or running moose competitions (popular in Scandinavia), and electronic knock down targets are also used for sport shooting and by many militaries. Targets are available for calibers ranging from air gun pellets up to the 105 mm tank shell.EPICOS - General Information  Advantages  Some advantages of electronic scoring systems are: * Makes organizing matches easier, since the scores are calculated automatically. * Provides the shooter immediate and precise feedback, and can be used for training and competition. * Real time scoring is more exciting to audience, and has in many ways revolutionized the shooting sport.  Disadvantages  Some disadvantages of electronic scoring systems are: * Relatively high construction costs, and often a need for continuous maintenance. * Vulnerability to lightning strikes because of long cables in the ground combined with sensitive electronics. * The cables around the target stand are vulnerable to bullets. This can especially be a problem in speed shooting competitions where some of the shots may miss the target. To protect the cables, brackets made of hardened steel have been used in stangskyting and felthurtigskyting.  Function  All types of electronic targets use some form of trigonometric equations to triangulate the position of bullet impact.  Sound Triangulation  Sound-chamber targets is the oldest type of electronic targets, and uses the Mach wave of the bullet to determine its position as it passes through the target. The first sound-chamber system for big bore rifles was patented in 1975, and was used for the first time in a world championship in 1982.SIUS Brochure \\"Let's tell you about our company..\\" It functions by using microphones to measure the sound wave of the projectile as it passes through the target. The target is built like a frame and covered with rubber sheets front and back providing an almost tight sound-chamber. Inside the chamber there are microphones, either three in the bottom of the frame, or one in each of the four corners. Additionally, the air temperature inside the target is measured to precisely calculate the speed of sound. To avoid large temperature fluctuations the target is insulated in the front and back using insulating material like for instance styrofoam, and the target seen by the shooter is painted on the insulation material. To keep the sound- chamber somewhat tight, there is an additional rubber liner outside the main rubber liner, which can be turned manually or with an electric motor at certain intervals to avoid the holes in the sound chamber becoming too large.  Light Triangulation  In 2010 Sius Ascor released Laserscore, the first electronic target system using lasers, being able to read with a claimed accuracy of a few hundredths of a millimeterSius Laserscore Product Information by using three infrared lasers. Since the measuring method is optical and there are no moving parts, the target is almost free from wear and maintenance.  Piezoelectric Sensors Triangulation  In 2018 Sport Quantum released an impact measuring technology using piezoelectric sensors on a plate. This enabled new generation interactive shooting targets : plate protected screens for pellets, or armored still plates for large calibres. Interactive shooting screens combine precise impact measurement and unlimited choice of targets.  Data transmission  Data can be transferred either wirelessly or through cables. Cables are often used for permanent installations, while wireless radio transmissions are used for targets placed provisionally in the field and for running targets.

The speech was given on the third day of the Munich Debate and lasted 45 minutes. Churchill, a Conservative back-bencher at the time, was critical of the Munich Agreement which had been signed six days earlier by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain under terms largely favourable to German dictator Adolf Hitler. Context As part of a debate in the House of Commons, Winston Churchill, then the member from Epping, disputed Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon's motion to affirm \\"the policy of His Majesty's Government by which war was averted in the recent crisis.\\" For members of parliament at the time, a vote for John Simon's motion would signal approval for Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's signing of the Munich Agreement on 30 September 1938, which ceded the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia to Germany, and more broadly, approval of the strategy of appeasement that Chamberlain had adopted towards Hitler. Though Churchill vehemently opposed both the Munich Agreement and Britain's appeasement policies, he was in the minority, and the day after he gave his speech, the House of Commons voted 366 to 144 to affirm the motion. Summary of the arguments of the speech Churchill used this speech to expose Hitler's expansionist tendencies directly after Germany annexed Austria and the Sudetenland. He heavily criticised Neville Chamberlain and his administration for agreeing to Hitler's annexation of the Sudetenland saying \\"instead of snatching his victuals from the table, [Hitler] has been content to have them served to him course by course.\\" Churchill viewed the Munich Agreement as a show of weakness, which upset the balance of continental power, and he argued that the agreement would fail to prevent the outbreak of war or guarantee that Hitler would change his behaviour. In this speech, Churchill also offered suggestions for dealing with the increasingly belligerent German state. He called for greater regional cooperation, criticising Chamberlain's administration for only collaborating with France and not Russia in the Munich negotiations. His view was that, as the three dominant powers in Europe, it was the responsibility of France, Russia, and Britain to prevent Germany from annexing other countries. Because of the Munich Agreement, the smaller nations of Europe were left unsure of their safety from German influence, which potentially stretched deep into the east. Churchill already saw the lands of Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia as future victims of German annexation. He warned that if Hitler were not stopped he would soon turn towards western Europe and that Britain's acts of appeasement would only add to Germany's desire for more territory. Churchill's major disagreement with John Simon and Chamberlain was over the value of going to war with Germany to defend Czechoslovakia. Churchill felt that Czechoslovakia had been sacrificed to keep peace with Germany and that \\"left to themselves and told they were going to get no help from the Western Powers, [the Czechs] would have been able to make better terms than they have got.\\" Churchill also used his speech to highlight the hypocrisy of forcing Czechoslovakia to give up part of its sovereign territory without a popular vote. He said \\"however you put it, this particular block of land, this mass of human beings to be handed over, has never expressed the desire to go into the Nazi rule.\\" This violated the principle of self-determination, which stated \\"liberal and democratic\\" nations must be protected from being taken over by totalitarian governments, an idea Churchill staunchly supported. Excerpts > * I will begin by saying what everybody would like to ignore or forget but > which must nevertheless be stated, namely, that we have sustained a total > and unmitigated defeat, and that France has suffered even more than we have. > * We in this country, as in other Liberal and democratic countries, have a > perfect right to exalt the principle of self-determination, but it comes ill > out of the mouths of those in totalitarian states who deny even the smallest > element of toleration to every section and creed within their bounds. * It > is the most grievous consequence of what we have done and of what we have > left undone in the last five years - five years of futile good intentions, > five years of eager search for the line of least resistance, five years of > uninterrupted retreat of British power, five years of neglect of our air > defences. * You must have diplomatic and correct relations, but there can > never be friendship between the British democracy and the Nazi power, that > power which spurns Christian ethics, which cheers its onward course by a > barbarous paganism, which vaunts the spirit of aggression and conquest, > which derives strength and perverted pleasure from persecution, and uses, as > we have seen, with pitiless brutality the threat of murderous force. That > power cannot ever be the trusted friend of the British democracy. (Text as given in Hansard) Reactions Churchill was one of the biggest supporters of British rearmament. In A Total and Unmitigated Defeat, Churchill emphasised the necessity of swift rearmament and a buildup of national defences. To the British public, the idea of rearmament was dangerous, due to the belief that it caused arms races, secret diplomacy, and military imperialism. To many, these were the actions of a country with nothing to gain and much to lose by being involved in war; peace was the greatest of national interests.Kennedy, Paul M. Strategy and Diplomacy, 1870–1945: Eight Studies. London: Allen & Unwin in association with Fontana Paperbacks, 1983 p. 89 Yet following Churchill's speech, the tide of British public opinion shifted towards a buildup of national defences – specifically the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy. Duff Cooper, another Conservative Member of Parliament, resigned from the Cabinet in the wake of the signing of the Munich Agreement. Speaking before Chamberlain's first parliamentary appearance after Munich was signed, Cooper believed that Britain had \\"lost the courage to see things as they are.\\" He says in another portion of his resignation speech that Britain had been \\"drifting, day by day, nearer into war with Germany, and we have never said, until the last moment, and then in most uncertain terms, that we were prepared to fight.\\" The Manchester Guardian made a similar statement, saying, \\"to forget, so utterly, the Reichstag fire, and the occupation of the Rhineland, and 30 June 1934, and the fall of Austria! We have lost the courage to see things as they are.\\"Lucas, F. 3L. \\"The Funeral of British Honour.\\" Manchester Guardian 4 October 1938: n. pag. Historian Bruce Kauffman describes Churchill's Munich Speech as a \\"little-known speech\\" that shows his \\"under- appreciated gift of foresight.\\" He continues, saying Churchill's speeches, \\"leading up to (and during) World War II were great not only because of the matchless rhetoric he seemed to call forth effortlessly, but also because – as history would show – he was dead right in his assessment of the issue at hand, even though that assessment was invariably unpopular with, and unheeded by, his countrymen.\\"Winston Churchill  Mediander  Connects.\\" Mediander. N.p., n.d. Web. Interruptions to Churchill's speech Viscountess Nancy Astor, the member for Plymouth Sutton, interrupted Churchill twice. As Churchill said, \\"We have sustained a total and unmitigated defeat, and that France has suffered even more than we have.\\" She interjected, saying \\"Nonsense.\\" Churchill acknowledged her and continued speaking. Later Churchill began to mention her, saying \\"The noble Lady says that that very harmless allusion is—\\" but she interrupted him saying \\"Rude\\". Churchill quipped back, saying, \\"She must very recently have been receiving her finishing course in manners.\\" Astor and Churchill had a famously adversarial relationship and often used cleverly worded insults against each other, so this exchange would not have been unique. As a brash American heiress, Astor clashed with Churchill, who reportedly did not feel that women should be in Parliament. Another possible reason for Astor's opposition to Churchill's points in his speech was her alleged ties to Nazism. https://www.thedailybeast.com/i-am-the-kind-of-woman- i-would-run-from-the-life-of-nancy-astor?ref=scroll Cultural allusions Churchill uses the metaphor of Ethelred the Unready, the old English king who succeeded Alfred the Great; his inability to live up to his predecessor represents how the Allies did not build on success in the Great War.\\"King Aethelred II The Unready.\\" King Aethelred II The Unready. N.p., n.d. Web. Churchill said: \\"In my holiday I thought it was a chance to study the reign of King Ethelred the Unready. The House will remember that that was a period of great misfortune, in which, from the strong position which we had gained under the descendants of King Alfred, we fell very swiftly into chaos. It was the period of Danegeld and of foreign pressure. I must say that the rugged words of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, written a thousand years ago, seem to me apposite, at least as apposite as those quotations from Shakespeare with which we have been regaled by the last speaker from the Opposition Bench. Here is what the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle said, and I think the words apply very much to our treatment of Germany and our relations with her: 'All these calamities fell upon us because of evil counsel, because tribute was not offered to them at the right time nor yet were they resisted; but when they had done the most evil, then was peace made with them.' That is the wisdom of the past, for all wisdom is not new wisdom.\\" Bibliography * References Speeches by Winston Churchill October 1938 events 1938 in the United Kingdom 1938 in politics Speeches in the Parliament of the United Kingdom 1938 speeches ","title":"A total and unmitigated defeat"},{"id":"46512670","title":"Love Light in Flight"},{"id":"46512676","text":"Hans M.

The company is based at Cowra Airport in the Central West of New South Wales and has also signed partnership agreements with Aviation Industry Corporation of China to manufacture light sport aircraft in China for domestic markets. History Phil Goard designed and built an aircraft called the Goair Trainer at Bankstown Airport in Sydney during the 1990s. The single aircraft was later modified in 2001 into the Goair GT-1, a prototype which would form the basis of the Model J544. In 2004, Goard relocated to Cowra and registered the company name Brumby Aircraft Australia. The first Model J544, known simply as the Brumby after a wild horse was registered under a Recreational Aviation Australia certificate in October 2005 and was publicly demonstrated in April 2006. In 2010, the company announced a high-wing variant of the design, designated the Brumby 610 Evolution. The J544 was retrospectively given the designation Brumby 600. In 2013 it was announced the company had purchased the type certificate for the Victa Aircruiser 210, a four-seat general aviation aeroplane designed in the 1960s, which never saw large scale production - although the design was later developed into the successful PAC CT/4 Airtrainer. Brumby anticipate an updated version of this aircraft will compete with the Cirrus SR22, while the company also announced plans to develop a turboprop powered variant aimed at a niche business market with no established competitors. The Aircruiser also represents a significant step for the company beyond ultralight and recreational aircraft as the design has certification by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority meeting the equivalent to the Federal Aviation Administration FAR 23 in the United States. A major 40-year deal was signed in 2014 with the Chinese government owned AVIC to produce the Brumby 600 and 610 aircraft in a purpose-built facility in Fujian Province. The facility will build the light sport aircraft for the Chinese domestic markets, while also providing components for assembly in the Australian market. The joint venture is expected to meet a demand for 280 aircraft over the first four years of the program, and will reduce the time taken to deliver new aircraft from 12 months to approximately 8 weeks. The Aircruiser design was not included in the deal, as Brumby intends to utilise the additional capacity at its Cowra facility to focus on development and production of this model In addition to production facilities, the agreement is also reported to include global sales and support, as well as Brumby's participation in the research and development of a new all-composite seaplane intended to carry 10-20 passengers, addressing a gap identified in the Chinese general aviation market.

Reign Sources Iblul-Il is attested in Mari, where statues bearing his name were excavated in 1952 from the city's temples. However, the deeds of the king are recorded in a letter sent to Ebla by Enna-Dagan, a successor of Iblul-Il. Campaigns Second Mariote kingdom during the reign of Iblul-Il Iblul-Il campaigned extensively against Ebla and its vassals and allies. The offensive was probably due to Ebla's increasing militaristic character, and was meant to block the trade route between Kish, Nagar and Ebla. Iblul-Il was a contemporary of Ebla's king Igrish-Halam, and is mentioned in the letter of Enna-Dagan campaigning in the middle Euphrates defeating the city of Galalaneni, and engaging in a victorious battle with Abarsal in the region of Zahiran, which he destroyed. Next, Iblul-Il campaigned in the region of Burman of the land of Sugurum, where he defeated the cities of Shadab, Addalini and Arisum. The campaigns continued as the king sacked the cities of Sharan and Dammium, and advanced on Neraad and Hasuwan, receiving the tribute from Ebla at the city of Mane, and from the fortress Khazuwan, then continued his march and conquered Emar. In the Tigris valley, Iblul-Il defeated the cities of Nahal, Nubat and Sha-da from the region of Gasur, at a battle in the land of Ganane. Iblul-Il is finally mentioned in the letter conquering the Eblaite cities of Barama, Aburu, Tibalat and Belan. The Mariote king successfully achieved his goals and weakened Ebla, exacting a great amount of tribute in the form of gold and silver. Succession Iblul-Il was succeeded by Nizi. The letter of Enna-Dagan is extremely difficult to read, and early decipherment presented the author as a general of Ebla who defeated and deposed Iblul-Il. However, newer readings confirmed Enna-Dagan as a king from Mari, and further decipherment of the archives of Ebla showed Enna-Dagan receiving gifts from Ebla as a prince of Mari during the reigns of his Mariote predecessors.

Background James graduated from the historically black McKinley Senior High School, Southern University, from which he received a Bachelor of Science in Accounting, and Southern University Law Center, from which he earned his Juris Doctor degree. All of these institutions are in Baton Rouge. James is a Baptist. Political life District 101 was based in Orleans Parish in the 2007 election, when Democrat Cedric Richmond was elected as the U.S. Representative for Louisiana's 2nd congressional district. When Richmond went to Congress, Wesley T. Bishop, another Democrat, won the District 101 seat, but Bishop was moved the following year to District 99, for which he remains the representative. District 101 was switched to East Baton Rouge Parish in 2011. James won the general election, a low-turnout contest, for the District 101 seat over fellow Democrat, Tiffany Foxworth. James received 2,414 votes (58.1 percent) to Foxworth's 1,744 (41.9 percent). In the previous nonpartisan blanket primary James led Foxworth. Four other candidates, two of whom were Republicans, Harold Williams and Sarah Holliday, were eliminated in the primary. Representative James is a member of the Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus and the Democratic Caucus. He serves on these House committee: (1) Appropriations, (2) Judiciary, (3) Natural Resources and Environment, and (4) Joint Budget.

Headquartered in Sacramento, CWL was founded in 1974 to seek the professional advancement of women lawyers, to promote gender equity in the legal profession and judiciary, and to advance women's rights generally.  Programs  \\"So You Want to Be a Judge?\\" aims to demystify the judicial application process and to encourage women in California to seek judicial appointment. Panelists have included the judicial appointments advisor of the Governor of California, members of the Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation (JNE), and sitting judges and justices from throughout the state. Panelists teach lawyers how to build the strongest résumé and gather support for appointment or election. \\"Elect to Run\\" is a program to educate and encourage women to run for public office, meet other women who have run for office, as well as those who support or train women to run, and to get the information you need to decide whether you want to run. Keynote speakers have included Senator Toni Atkins, Senator Kevin de Leon, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf and State Controller Betty Yee. Both \\"So You Want to be a Judge?\\" and \\"Elect to Run\\" have been recognized as Outstanding Member Programs by the National Conference of Women Bar Associations.  Legislative advocacy  CWL promotes state and national policy initiatives meant to improve women's lives. CWL has voiced support for the Violence Against Women Act, bills that protect women's reproductive rights, and a resolution urging California corporations to include more women on their boards of directors. CWL's legislative priorities have included work in the following areas: 1) reproductive justice (choice, maternity care, access and privacy), 2) violence against women and children (human trafficking, domestic violence, gun violence and sex crimes), 3) human rights and equality, 4) court funding and access to justice, and 5) economics. CWL has advocated for many bills on its legislative agenda, such as: AB 1517 which sought to expedite the processing of DNA rape kits. CWL drafted a letter in support of this bill, and wrote directly to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) urging it to increase the speed in which DNA is tested and uploaded into the FBI's Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). SB 477 which protected documented foreign workers from abuse and human trafficking by banning labor contractors from charging recruitment fees and requiring full disclosure of employment conditions. CWL drafted a letter in support of this bill. SB 899 which protects newborn's health and safety while prohibiting the state from inserting itself into the private reproductive and medical decisions of families just because of income level. CWL drafted a letter in support of this bill. SB 939 which would streamline the prosecution of human trafficking charges and help victims avoid the trauma of testifying in multiple jurisdictions against their traffickers. CWL drafted a letter in support of this bill. In addition to these bills, CWL supported Planned Parenthood and sent letters of support for each bill on their legislative agenda. (AB 1755, AB 1841, AB 1805, and AB 1759). CWL supported military spouses by sending a letter to California Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye in support of the Military Spouse JD Network's drafted model rule urging that military spouses be treated similarly to corporate counsel, allowing them to practice law on a limited basis in states to which they are relocated due to their spouse's service. CWL, along with County Welfare Directors Association of California (CWDACA), joined the Commercially Sexually Exploited Children Coalition (CSEC) and sent letters in support of, and testified on behalf of, an increase to the CWDACA's budget to provide training and programming for CSEC. SB 855, which included the increase, was signed into law; it establishes the CSEC program and clarifies jurisdiction of CSEC under the child welfare system. On a federal level, CWL was one of the first 50 organizations in the country to sign on in support of the Protect Women's Health From Corporate Interference Act of 2014, also known as the \\"Not My Boss’s Business Bill\\". 2014 legislative work was especially focused on the use of social media. CWL worked with several national grassroots social media campaigns using tweet \\"storms\\" and national \\"town halls\\" to address the public.  Amicus advocacy  CWL files as a friend of the court in cases which advance women's rights, gender equality and equality generally. CWL writes or joins amicus briefs on these core issues in the Supreme Court of the United States, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the California Supreme Court and the California courts of appeal. Recently CWL has been amici in briefs supporting same sex marriages, equal treatment of female and male student athletes, and the Affordable Care Act’s requirement of full insurance coverage of contraceptives approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA): * Obergefell v. Hodges, Tanco v. Haslam, DeBoer v. Snyder and Bourke v. Beshear – In 2015, CWL joined the National Women's Law Center (NWLC) in an amicus brief in the United States Supreme Court in support of same sex marriages in Ohio, Tennessee, Michigan and Kentucky, and throughout the country. * Ollier v. Sweetwater – In 2014, CWL joined the NWLC in an amicus brief in the Ninth Circuit. Ollier involved several questions of importance in the continuing effort to ensure that women and girls are treated equally in athletics. Female student-athletes brought a class action against a California high school district, alleging unlawful sex discrimination for failing to provide equal athletic participation opportunities and equal treatment/benefits in violation of Title IX. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court judgment granting declaratory and injunctive relief on September 19, 2014. * Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius – CWL joined the NWLC in an amicus brief in the United States Supreme Court in support of the Affordable Care Act's requirement of full insurance coverage of FDA approved contraceptives. However, on June 30, 2014, the Court ruled that requiring closely held corporations to provide health-insurance coverage for methods of contraception that violate the sincerely held religious beliefs of the companies' owners violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.  Judicial evaluations and nominations  Each year, candidates seeking judicial nomination request that CWL research and rate their qualifications for judicial appointment. CWL's confidential ratings are shared directly with the California governor's office. CWL promotes a judiciary that includes people of diverse backgrounds and varied life experiences. CWL shared one of the first diversity awards given to bar associations for consistent efforts to include more women in the legal profession and on the bench.  Annual conference  CWL's annual conference is a full day of educational programming tailored to address issues affecting women in law and society. Recent keynote speakers include Nancy Pelosi, Kamala Harris, Patricia Gillette, Catherine Lacavera, The Hon. Joan Dempsey Klein and professor and author Joan C. Williams.  Annual dinner and silent auction  Prior to 2017, the CWL Annual Dinner was held on the first night of the California State Bar annual meeting, attended by lawyers and jurists from throughout the state. In 2017, The State Bar of California ceased holding its Annual Meeting, and as a result CWL partnered with the California Judges Association. The dinner depends, in large measure, on the sponsorships of law firms, legal departments, associations, and other professionals. At this dinner, the CWL Foundation hosts a silent auction to raise money for the foundation's work.  CWL Foundation  The CWL Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization, which serves to educate lawyers and the general public about the status of women in the legal profession and the legal issues affecting women. The foundation promotes these goals in multiple ways, including: * Facilitating academic stipends for women, as they study for the California bar exam or work their way through law school. * Generating and distributing educational materials about equal access and opportunities for women in law and society. The Foundation's 2010 project, \\"Lessons from Our Mothers,\\" chronicles the California history of women in the legal profession and CWL's role in that history. * Co-sponsoring the San Francisco Color of Justice Program, which won the 2012 Public Service Award from the National Conference of Women's Bar Associations. The program's other sponsors were the San Francisco County Superior Court, the National Association of Women Judges, CWL affiliate Queen's Bench Bar Association, and Balboa High School. In the continuing program, inner-city minority and underprivileged students take part in panel discussions by judges and lawyers, a mock argument, and small-group discussions.  Leadership  The 2020-2021 president of CWL is Naomi Dewey, founder of Trusted Legal. A current list of the board of governors can be found on the CWL website.  In-house counsel network  The CWL In-House Counsel Network (“IHCN”) was created so that CWL and in-house counsel from across the state, and from across industries, could partner on an agenda that included advancing women in law and business, gender pay equity, diversity in corporate legal and executive departments, leadership training, and educational, networking and community service opportunities. Membership in the IHCN is limited to in-house lawyers providing legal services or serving in corporate executive positions solely for the company which employs them. “In- House Counsel” includes corporate counsel of public, private, large and small companies, non-profits, and educational institutions. The founding members of the network include Catherine Lacavera, director of litigation for Google; Sally Narey, general counsel for Fireman's Fund Insurance Company; Michelle Banks, general counsel of Gap; Natalie Panossian, senior counsel for Ricoh Printing Systems America, and Lynne Carrithers, managing counsel for Occidental Petroleum. Other founding members include: Olga Balderama, general counsel for Ruiz Foods; Suzan “Sam” Miller, vice president of legal and corporate affairs as well as deputy general counsel for Intel; Dawn Smith, general counsel for VMware; Catherine McEvilly, vice president and general counsel for Honda North America; Laura Stein, general counsel for The Clorox Company; Erika Rottenberg, general counsel for LinkedIn, and Debra Zumwalt, general counsel for Stanford University.

History   Formation, Operation Star, and Third Battle of Kharkov  The army was formed in February 1943 with the Voronezh Front from the 18th Rifle Corps, under the command of Lieutenant General Mikhail Kazakov. It originally included the 161st, 180th and 270th Rifle Divisions, the 1st Destroyer Division (an anti-tank unit), the 37th Rifle and 173rd Tank Brigades, as well as artillery and other units. By the time it was sent into combat, the army had been reinforced with two more rifle divisions and a tank regiment, and had a strength of around 40,000 men and 50 tanks. Without finishing its formation, the army was sent into battle in Operation Star, an offensive which aimed to recapture Kharkov. The offensive began on 4 February and the army experienced initial success, defeating opposing German units southwest of Novy Oskol and recapturing Volchansk alongside the 38th Army on 9 February. Developing the offensive, its troops crossed the Donets, and operating in conjunction with the 3rd Tank Army and the 40th Army, recaptured Kharkov on 16 February. When the offensive was stopped by the German counterattack that began the Third Battle of Kharkov in early March, the 69th had reached the area southeast of Oposhnya and southwest of Valka and Sharovka. During the Third Battle of Kharkov, the army was able to hold the German attacks for three days but was forced to withdraw back to the left bank of the Donets on the line between Shishino and Bezlyudovka, where the German advance was finally halted. As a result of heavy losses, the 69th was withdrawn to the front reserve on 20 March.  Postwar  After the end of the war, the army became part of the Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany. Its headquarters was relocated to Baku, where it was used to form the headquarters of the Baku Military District in August.

When construction of Line E began in 1938, the tunnel was re-purposed as the first part of the line. Constitución is today a ghost station, used partially as a maintenance area for the rolling stock of both Line E and Line C under the name Constitución Workshops, though the manoeuvring areas had already been used as a workshop as early as 1934 for Line C before work on Line E commenced. Possible use on Line F As early as 1957, the use of the station as part of a new north-south line was being considered. In 2006, it was under evaluation whether the two Line E ghost stations could be used as the southern point of Line F, considering they overlapped the line's trajectory. However, it was later decided that Line F would use a completely new tunnel with new stations given the frequency the line is expected to have.Realizarán estudios en Constitución para ubicar la cabecera de la línea F - EnElSubte, 1 August 2011.

Portrait by Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun, 1793. Theresia of Dietrichstein (Maria Theresia Johanna Nepomucena Josepha Juliana; 11 August 1768 – 16 September 1822), was a German noblewoman; a member of the House of Dietrichstein and by her two marriages Countess Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau and of Mervedlt. She was the fourth child and second (but eldest and only surviving) daughter of Karl Johann Baptist, 7th Prince of Dietrichstein, and Maria Christina Josepha, a daughter of Jan Josef František Antonín, Count of Thun-Hohenstein. Life A woman of extraordinary beauty (she was nicknamed la celeste Therese), Emperor Joseph II became madly in love with her; in order to save her reputation and the position of the Dietrichstein family at court, when the Emperor was away in the Austro-Turkish War, was arranged her marriage with the Imperial Kammerherrn and General Count Philipp Joseph Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau. The wedding took place in the Imperial court at Vienna on 27 August 1787: however, the union was extremely unhappy and the groom abandoned Theresia almost immediately after. The formal separation was pronounced in 1788, but neither spouse was freed to remarry because according to the Catholic precepts they still bonded to each other. Since 1798, Theresia became close to Maximilian, Count of Merveldt, General of Cavalry and ambassador in the Russian and English courts. Because he was a Teutonic Knight, he was unable to marry her until 1807, when Maximilian finally obtained the release of this vows; however, Theresia was still forbidden to remarry until Rome dissolved her marriage. After she declared that she had been forced to marry Count Kinsky and in a \\"letargic\\" state her maternal uncle Leopold Leonhard of Thun-Hohenstein, Bishop of Passau (who officiated at the ceremony) heard her almost imperceptible \\"I do\\", Maria Theresia was finally able to marry the Count of Merveldt. Theresia and Maximilian of Merveldt married on 16 February 1807 in St. Petersburg, where the groom was the Imperial ambassador at that time. In jewelry and diamonds as gifts to his wife Maximillian is said to have spent more than 150,000 guilders. After only eight years of marriage, Maximilian of Merveldt died in 1815. Theresia never remarried and died eight years later, aged 54.

Assignment In April 2015, Kyle Schwartz, a teacher at the Doull Elementary School in Denver, Colorado, asked her third grade class to complete a writing assignment entitled \\"I Wish My Teacher Knew\\" where they were asked to share something about themselves. Schwartz, aged 26, describes herself as \\"a suburban girl\\" and said she created the assignment because she \\"struggled to understand the reality of my students' lives and how to best support them.\\" She explained that most of her students come from underprivileged (mostly Hispanic) households – 92% qualify for free or reduced cost lunches – and thus she could not easily relate to what they went through in their daily lives. Schwartz has taught at Doull for three years and has done the assignment each year. Schwartz said the assignment was designed to build trust and a sense of community within the classroom. The children were given the option of writing anonymously, although most of the students expressed a desire to share their story with the class. The other children in the class rallied around each other in \\"really beautiful\\" moments as they shared their stories. A girl who reported she had no friends to play with at recess inspired \\"all the girls [to huddle] around her and [play] tag\\" the next day. Response Schwartz, describing the answers as \\"heartbreaking\\", decided to share some of them via Twitter using the hashtag #IWishMyTeacherKnew. She received an immediate response and other teachers and schools started using the hashtag to share their own teaching experiences. As a result, the tag trended nationally in the United States. Among the most commented on notes were one by a girl whose father had been deported to Mexico and one by a girl with no friends. The story was picked up by national newspapers and even international sources such as The Sydney Morning Herald. Doull Elementary received numerous donations of school supplies for its students due to answers such as \\"I Wish My Teacher Knew I don't have pencils to do my homework.\\" The story was featured nationally on ABC World News Tonight, which reported that Schwartz had started a \\"movement\\" with teachers across the country copying her assignment to learn more about their own students.

She was the wife of Elizabethan English adventurer Robert Shirley, whom she accompanied on his travels and embassies across Europe in the name of the Safavid King (Shah) Abbas the Great (1588–1629). Teresa was received by many of the royal houses of Europe, such as English prince Henry Frederick and Queen Anne (her child's godparents) and contemporary writers and artists such as Thomas Herbert and Anthony van Dyck. Herbert considered Robert Shirley \\"the greatest Traveller of his time\\", but admired the \\"undaunted Lady Teresa\\" even more. Following the death of her husband from dysentery in 1628, and due to impediments from grandees at the court, and the authorities, during the reign of Abbas's successor and grandson Safi (1629–1642), Teresa decided to leave Iran. She lived in a convent in Rome for the rest of her life, devoting her time to charity and religion. As a pious Christian, and because of her love for her husband, Teresa had Shirley's remains transported to Rome from Isfahan and reburied; on the headstone of their mutual grave she mentions their travels and refers to her noble Circassian origins. Thanks to her exploits, Teresa has been described by Bernadette Andrea as someone who subverted patriarchal gender roles common to the Muslim and Christian cultures of her time. Due to their hybrid identities and adventures, Teresa and her husband became the subject of several contemporary literary and visual works. Nevertheless, the story of Teresa as an important woman of the 17th century has been largely overshadowed and obscured by the tale of her husband Robert and his brothers. Sources The travels of Teresa and Robert Shirley were recorded in many contemporaneous English, Italian, Latin and Spanish sources,. including eyewitness accounts.. According to Penelope Tuson, the main sources that deal with Teresa's life are the \\"predictably semi-hagiographic\\" accounts stored in the archives of the Vatican and the Carmelite order.. These Vatican and Carmelite sources were compiled, edited and published by Herbert Chick in 1939 in his Chronicle of the Carmelites in Persia.; . Though the Chronicle of the Carmelites in Persia evidently portrays a positive image of Teresa, Tuson notes that the accounts are \\"patchy\\" and \\"contradictory\\" on some occasions.. Furthermore, the narrative is considered to be from the viewpoint of European Catholicism.. Other sources that help create a modern scholarly account of Teresa include the only document she is known to have written in English (a petition to King James I of England 1603–1625), paintings, and to a lesser extent, official letters signed by King (Shah) Abbas the Great (1588–1629).. Early life and marriage Portraits of Robert Shirley and Teresa Sampsonia, c. 1624–1627. Shirley is wearing Persian clothing; Teresa, in the European (English) fashion of the day, holds a jewelled flintlock pistol in her right hand and a watch in her left.; . Teresa's veil and jewelled crown are a variation on the headdresses worn by Iranian women from Isfahan in the first quarter of the seventeenth century.. Teresa was born in 1589 into a noble Orthodox Christian Circassian family in the Safavid Empire,; . ruled at the time by Shah Abbas the Great. She was named Sampsonia at birth. The daughter of Ismail Khan, a brother-in-law of the King,; . she grew up in Isfahan in the Iranian royal court as a reportedly beautiful, accomplished horsewoman who enjoyed embroidery and painting.; . Robert Shirley was an English adventurer who was sent to the Safavids, after a Persian embassy was sent to Europe, to forge an alliance against the neighbouring Ottoman Empire, rivals of the Safavids.. During his attendance at court, Teresa met him and fell in love.. On 2 February 1608, with the approval of her aunt and Abbas,; . Teresa married Robert Shirley in Iran.. At about the time of their wedding, she was baptised as a Roman Catholic by the Carmelites in Isfahan with the name Teresa.; ; ; ; . Her baptismal name derives from the founder of the Discalced Carmelites, Teresa of Ávila.. Travels First mission William Larkin in England, and dressed in then contemporary attire. According to art historian Patricia Smyth, \\"the embroidery on Teresa's dress includes honeysuckles, which are to signify love, as well as strawberries, as a symbol for fruitfulness\\".. Smyth notes that these emblems may have an additional meaning \\"as the Shirley's child, Henry, was born during this short stay in England\\".. Teresa accompanied Robert on his diplomatic missions for Shah Abbas to England and other royal houses in Europe. When they set off on their first embassy trip, Robert was captured by his enemies. Teresa reportedly managed to save him and put to flight the attackers; for this, the Carmelite records praised her as \\"a true Amazon\\".; . Teresa and Shirley visited the Grand Duke of Muscovy Vasili IV, Pope Paul V in Rome and King Sigismund III of Poland. In Poland, Teresa lived in a convent in Kraków for some time while her husband visited Prague, where Emperor Rudolph II (1576–1612) bestowed on him the title of Count Palatine.. He arrived in Rome on 27 September 1609 and met Ali Qoli Beg, Abbas I's ambassador, with whom he had an audience with the Pope. Shirley then left for Savoy, Florence, Milan, Genoa, France, Flanders and Spain (Barcelona and Madrid).; ; . Teresa rejoined him in Lisbon via Hamburg. They then went to Valladolid and Madrid; . where Teresa came to know the Carmelite nuns, particularly Mother Beatrix de Jesus (the niece of Saint Teresa) from whom she received a relic of Teresa.; . Teresa and Shirley left for the Dutch Republic and subsequently sailed from Bayonne to England, where they arrived around the beginning of August 1611.; . Their only child, a son named Henry, in all likelihood the first English-born child of Iranian descent according to Sheila R. Canby, was born in November 1611 at the Shirley home in Sussex.. His godparents were Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, for whom he was named, and Queen Anne.; . Teresa and Robert remained in England a little over a year.. Before departing from Gravesend to Safavid Iran in 1612–1613, they decided to turn young Henry over to Robert's family in Sussex.; . He is believed to have survived until at least 1622, but to have died at a young age.; . Teresa and Shirley's two-and-a-half-year return voyage to Iran proved to be extremely difficult.. On one occasion, they were almost killed at sea. On another, during their short stop in Mughal India to meet Emperor Jahangir (1605–1627), hostile Portuguese tried to assassinate the couple.. The couple remained in Iran for a few months, before embarking on their second embassy.. Second mission On their last mission, Teresa and Robert arrived in Lisbon through Goa on 27 September 1617.. They headed towards Madrid, where they stayed until March 1622, then went to Florence and Rome.. During this last brief visit to Rome between 22 July and 29 August 1622, Anthony van Dyck (then 23 years old) painted their portraits.; ; . The couple then went to Warsaw in Poland, and perhaps Moscow afterwards, before visiting England in 1623 for the last time.; . They sailed for the Safavid Empire in 1627 on an East India Company ship with Dodmore Cotton, an envoy from the King of England to Persia and other courts.; . Teresa and Robert returned to Isfahan through Surat and Bandar Abbas.. The couple then moved to Qazvin (the former capital of Safavid Iran) where the king rewarded them with valuable gifts. Shirley and Cotton became seriously ill with fever (probably dysentery),. shortly after their arrival.. Departure from Safavid kingdom Shirley and Teresa were troubled by the jealousy of several nobles and grandees at court, who spread a rumour that Teresa was a Muslim before she became a Christian.. They disgraced her to the Shah, and it was reportedly published in the court that he intended to execute her by burning.. Fifteen days after hearing the report, Robert died of fever on 13 July 1628 in Qazvin. According to his wishes, he was buried in the Discalced Carmelite church in Isfahan.. The Shah summoned Teresa, asking her why the grandees were so opposed to her. She remained silent to protect them; according to contemporaneous accounts, the Shah advised her not to be afraid, \\"because it would be harder for him to put one woman to death than a hundred men\\".; . Some of his corrupt officials plundered her wealth. Teresa reportedly became seriously ill, and was moved to Isfahan to receive the sacraments from the priests; she recovered and decided to move to a Christian land.. In the Safavid Empire, women were prohibited from travelling abroad without permission.. So the Carmelites in Isfahan asked the governor of Shiraz, Emamqoli Khan, son of the celebrated Allahverdi Khan (one of Abbas's closest associates), for consent on Teresa's behalf.; . A favourite of Emamqoli Khan wanted to marry Teresa, and reminded the governor of the report that she had been a Muslim before she was a Christian. She was ordered to appear before a mullah (a religious judge) in a mosque, who would question her about her past and her religion.; . This was unacceptable to the Carmelites, who asked the governor to have Teresa questioned in the church of the Carmelite fathers.. The mullah rejected this, but an agreement was reached that they would meet in the home of a steward of the governor of Shiraz, who was a friend of the Carmelite Fathers.. She was questioned for an hour before she was allowed to return home.. Etching of Teresa, Lady Shirley, possibly late 18th century. Made after an illustration by van Dyck. Safavid Iran was disturbed by the death of Shah Abbas a few months after Shirley's death. Abbas's grandson, Safi (1629–1642), succeeded him; he was less consistent than his grandfather in his religious tolerance. The favourite of Emamqoli Khan, who still wanted to marry Teresa, sent his servants to the Carmelites in Isfahan to capture her. The priests denied knowing her whereabouts, and advised her to take refuge in the Church of Saint Augustine in New Julfa (the Armenian quarter in Isfahan).. The priests were brought to the favourite's house and reportedly threatened with torture before they were released.. The mullah asked Emamqoli Khan for permission to question Teresa again. Since he favoured the Carmelite Fathers, and did not want to insult the mullah, he said that the matter concerned Isfahan prefect (darugha) Khosrow Mirza.. The prefect, like the governor of Shiraz, was also a Georgian. He had Teresa arrested and brought before him; a judge questioned her about her religion. She professed her Christianity, reportedly saying that she would die \\"a thousand times\\" for it.. The judge accused her of lying and threatened to burn her alive if she did not convert to Islam. When Teresa refused, the judge threatened to have her thrown from a tower; she reportedly said that would suit her better, because she would die (and go to heaven) more quickly.. According to the Carmelites, the judge was shamed by her reminder of Shirley's service. He ended the questioning and reported to the prefect of Isfahan who allowed Teresa to return to her house and had the mullah dismissed.. The Carmelite Fathers received the necessary permission from the governor of Shiraz in September 1629.. Teresa's departure was documented in a letter from Father Dimas in the Carmelite archives in Rome: Three years after returning from her last trip, Teresa left her country of birth forever. She lived in Constantinople for three years, receiving a certificate from the commissary general of the Dominicans in the East on 21 June 1634 reportedly attesting to her pious conduct.. Around that time, she decided to retire to a convent in Rome, which was attached to the Carmelite Santa Maria della Scala church.; . Later life and death Santa Maria della Scala in the Trastevere rione of Rome, where Teresa remained for the rest of her life On 27 December 1634 she arrived in Rome and was received kindly by Pope Urban VIII, who entrusted her to the Carmelites.; . Teresa bought a house next to the church.. In 1658 she had Robert's remains transported from Isfahan to Rome, where he was reburied in the Santa Maria della Scala.; . In the Carmelite convent, she devoted herself to charity and religion until her death at age 79 in 1668.; ; . Teresa was buried in the church, where she had lived for forty years, in the same grave where she had buried her husband Robert ten years earlier.; . The headstone of Teresa and Robert Shirley in the Santa Maria della Scala She had the headstone inscribed: > Deo Optimo Maximo Roberto Sherleyo Anglo Nobilissimo Comiti Cesareo Equiti > Aurato Rodulfi II Imperatori Legato Ad Scia Abbam Regem Persarum et Eiusdeum > Regis Secundo Ad Romanos Pontifices Imperatores Reges Hispaniae Angliae > Poloniae Moscoviae Mogorri Aliosque Europae Principes Inclito Oratori. > Theresia Sampsonia Amazonites Samphuffi Circassiae Principes Filia Viro > Amatissimo et Sibi Posuit Illius Ossibus Suisque Laribus In Urbem E Perside > Pietatis Ergo Translatis Annos Nata LXXIX MDCLXVIII (Translated as \\"To God, the Best and Greatest.

Theresia Sampsonia, native of the land of the Amazons, daughter of Samphuffus, prince of Circassia, set up [this monument] for her most beloved husband and for herself, as a resting place for his bones—brought to Rome from Persia for dutiful devotion's sake—and for her own, aged seventy- nine. 1668.\\"). According to Bernadette Andrea (2017), the text demonstrates that Teresa subverted the patriarchal gender roles common to the Muslim and Christian cultures of her time.. In popular culture The adventures of Teresa and her husband, and what Andrea calls their \\"hybrid identities\\", inspired a variety of literary and visual works.; . According to Manoutchehr Eskandari-Qajar, Shirley and his \\"exotic wife with an even more exotic life story\\" sparked a great deal of curiosity and interest among their contemporaries in the West.. During her journeys between Persia and Europe, Teresa was remarked upon by contemporary writers, artists and European royal houses. Travel writer Thomas Herbert described Shirley as \\"the greatest Traveller of his time\\", but he admired the \\"undaunted Lady Teresa\\" even more, as one whose \\"faith was ever Christian\\".; ; . Teresa and her husband were invariably noted for their exotic garb. In every high-level meeting, Shirley appeared in his high-status Persian attire of silk and velvet.. He was Persianized to such a degree that contemporary playwright and pamphleteer Thomas Middleton referred to him as the \\"famous English Persian\\".; . Works inspired by the couple include two portraits by van Dyck, pamphlets in many languages, and Jacobean stage plays including The Travels of the Three English Brothers.. Lady Mary Wroth's Urania was partly influenced by Teresia Sampsonia's travels to England with her husband.; . Tuson argues that Teresa's story has been overshadowed by \\"the partly self-created myth of the Shirley's\\", who became the main subject of many of the contemporary \\"biographies as well as subsequent historical studies\\".. Carmen Nocentelli notes that the \\"figure of Teresa has been generally obscured by those of her male relatives\\".. According to Nocentelli: Nocentelli does add that the belittling of Teresa as a historic figure of importance was limited to England. Outside England, \\"Teresa Sampsonia Sherley was a figure of note in and of her own right\\".. Contemporaneous Italian traveller Pietro della Valle referred to Teresa as an \\"Ambassadress of the King of Persia\\", which Nocentelli interprets as putting Teresa on an \\"equal footing with her husband\\". In 2009, in London, there were two simultaneous exhibitions which featured Teresa and her husband: Shah 'Abbas: The Remaking of Iran (British Museum, February to June 2009) and Van Dyck and Britain (Tate Britain, February to May 2009)..

McGlashan Jr. (born November 20, 1963) is an American businessman and former international private equity investor. McGlashan founded TPG Growth, the growth equity and smaller buyout investment arm of TPG Capital, a global private equity investment firm. He is also a founder and was the initial-CEO of The Rise Fund, a social impact fund he co-founded with Bono and Jeffrey Skoll. McGlashan is a co-founder and a former board member of STX Entertainment, an American film and television studio launched in 2014 with Robert Simonds, and a cofounder and director of Evolution Media Capital. McGlashan was arrested March 12, 2019, after being caught on FBI audio recordings, for participating in a college admissions bribery scandal. He was then fired for cause by TPG. Career  Before joining TPG Capital in 2004, McGlashan was Chairman and CEO of the micro-cap company Critical Path. He joined the email service company in April 2001, three months into an accounting scandal that caused Critical Path’s stock to drop 75 percent, prompted two dozen shareholder lawsuits, and resulted in criminal charges against four executives. McGlashan was credited with keeping Critical Path out of bankruptcy, eliminating 87 percent of its debt, and settling the lawsuits within three months for $17.5 million, compared to the potential claim total of $240 million and delaying its NASDAQ delisting until shortly after his departure for failing to meet the minimum $15 million market capitalization requirement. Previously, McGlashan co-founded and was CEO of Vectis Group, a venture capital firm that invested in emerging markets. Prior to Vectis Group, McGlashan co-founded and served as CEO of Generation Ventures, which focused on developing new healthcare and technology companies in China. In 1994, he co-founded and served as President of Pharmanex, Inc. In 1998, Pharmanex was sold to Nu Skin, an herbal supplement company. Earlier in his career, McGlashan was a senior associate with Bain Capital and Information Partners. McGlashan was active on a number of boards, including Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. (as chairman), XOJET (as chairman), Creative Artists Agency, HotSchedules, Elevance Renewable Sciences, Ride, e.l.f. Cosmetics, Brava, Seasoned, and Common Sense Media. He has also been a board member at Survey Monkey, SuccessFactors, Schiff Nutrition International, AgraQuest, and WIL Research Laboratories. He has been a prolific donor to local and national Democratic candidates. Among non-profits, McGlashan has had board of director roles at Common Sense Media and is active with the Young Presidents’ Organization and the World Economic Forum, and had served on the Stanford Graduate School of Business Advisory Council. He is also the founder of The Rise Fund, a social impact fund started by TPG Growth in partnership with Elevar Equity. McGlashan was recognized for The Rise Fund, a $2 billion impact-investing initiative, in this year’s Vanity Fair New Establishment list. He was fired from his job at TPG after his arrest in the college admissions scandal was revealed.Edgecliffe-Johnson, Andrew. Bill McGlashan out at TPG after college admissions scandal, Financial Times, March 14, 2019. Education and global experience McGlashan earned a B.A. with honors from Yale University and an M.B.A. from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. As a Stanford University business student in the late 1980s, McGlashan co- founded the World Service Project. The project’s goal was to offer administrative and practical support to projects with a new model of multinational teams in such areas as environmental preservation and hunger prevention. The organization received support from U.S. Senators and Representatives, The Rockefeller Foundation, the U.S. Peace Corps and Nobel laureate Oscar Arias Sanchez. In 2013, McGlashan relocated temporarily with his family to Mumbai, India, to manage investments in India and Asia. He was said to be “the first global head of a premier bulge bracket (Private Equity) house physically making such a ‘transformative’ relocation” (The Economic Times). Legal issues On March 11, 2019, McGlashan, along with numerous others was arrested for his role in the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal. After a lengthy FBI investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice charged McGlashan with falsifying his son’s test scores and attempting to secure his son's admission into the University of Southern California by bribing officials into enhancing his son's academic and athletic abilities in a sport he never played so his son's application would be more competitive and be eligible for the school's \\"side door\\" admission. Further reports say that \\"McGlashlan allegedly paid $50,000 to the charitable arm of the college prep group with the understanding that the company would correct his son's answers on the ACT.\\" The allegation against McGlashan resulted in his being fired by the TPG. However, McGlashan claims he was \\"initially put on leave” and “already had resigned” prior to being terminated for cause. However a recent Axios article recently stated, “It seems that McGlashan just can't avoid lying: There's no way he didn't know why his bosses wanted to fire him rather than allowing him to resign.” After his arrest, investors were permitted to pull their commitments from his social impact fund, a move that could have an adverse effect on the firm's goal of raising three billion dollars by the end of 2019. Personal life McGlashan is married to Marie Rasic McGlashan; together they have three children. Together the couple donated to Dominican Sisters Vision of Hope in 2017 and 2018. They have also donated to the Marin Agricultural Land Trust. He is the nephew of the former Marin County supervisor Charles McGlashan, who died in 2011.

It has an early role in the assembly of the mitochondrial complex I assembly pathway.  Structure  NUBPL is located on the q arm of chromosome 14 in position 12 and has 18 exons. The NUBPL gene produces a 5.9 kDa protein composed of 54 amino acids. The structure of the protein includes a presumed iron-sulfur binding (CxxC) signature, a nucleotide-binding domain which has been highly conserved, and a mitochondrial targeting sequence in the N-terminal. NUBPL is required for the assembly of complex I, which is composed of 45 evolutionally conserved core subunits, including both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear encoded subunits. One of its arms is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, and the other is embedded in the organelle. The two arms are arranged in an L-shaped configuration. The total molecular weight of the complex is 1MDa.  Function  The NUBPL gene encodes a protein that is a member of the Mrp/NBP35 ATP-binding family. This protein is required for the assembly of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), the first oligomeric enzymatic complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Its role in assembly is the delivery of one or more iron–sulfur (Fe-S) clusters to complex I subunits in anaerobic conditions in vitro. The dysfunction of NUBPL results in an irregular assembly of the peripheral arm of complex I, which may lead to a decrease in activity. Knockdown of the protein also causes abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure characterized by respiratory supercomplex remodeling, christa membrane loss, and abnormally high lactate levels.  Discovery  Sheftel, et al. (2009) used RNA interference (RNAi) to delete the NUBPL gene in yeast (Y. lipolytica). They observed decreased levels and activity of mitochondrial complex I, leading them to conclude that NUBPL is required for complex I assembly and activity. Their experiments showed functional conservation of NUBPL in yeast and humans, an indication that the protein serves an important function. Sheftel, et al. observed structural abnormalities in mitochondria that were NUBPL-depleted mitochondria.  Clinical significance  The absence of NUBPL disrupts the early stage of the mitochondrial complex I assembly pathway. NUBPL-depleted cells were observed to have an abnormal sub complex of proteins normally found in the membrane arm of complex I. A decrease in the presence of complex I subunit proteins, NDUFS1, NDUFV1, NDUFS3, and NDUFA13 indicated a failure of normal complex I assembly. Mitochondrial complex I deficiency involving the dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain may cause a wide range of clinical manifestations from lethal neonatal disease to adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Phenotypes include macrocephaly with progressive leukodystrophy, non-specific encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, myopathy, liver disease, Leigh syndrome, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and some forms of Parkinson disease. High-throughput DNA sequencing was used to identify variants in 103 candidate genes in 103 patients with mitochondrial complex 1 disorders. Heterozygous variants in the NUBPL were identified in one patient. cDNA complementation studies showed that the variants can cause complex 1 deficiency. The finding in this patient is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance NUBPL-associated complex I deficiency, and supports the pathogenicity of the variants that were identified. Complex compound heterozygous variants were identified in the NUBPL gene in this patient. In exon 2, a paternally-inherited G>A point mutation (c.166 G>A) resulting in missense substitution of gly56-to-arg (G56R) was observed. Two variants were maternally-inherited: T>C point mutation (c.815-27 T>C) that caused a splicing error and a complex deletion of exons 1-4 and duplication involving exon 7. Two of 232 (1%) control chromosomes were found to have the c.166 G>A pathogenic variant. This individual identified was noted to have motor delays and developmental delay at 2 years of age. He never achieved independent walking. He developed myopathy, nystagmus, ataxia, upper motor neuron signs, and absence seizures. Brain MRI showed leukodystrophy with involvement of the cerebellar cortex and deep white matter. At age 8, he had spasticity, ataxia, and speech problems. Several patients from with early MRI abnormalities of the cerebellum, deep cerebral white matter and corpus callosum. In this small sample, it was noted that later imaging studies showed improvements to the corpus callosum and cerebral white matter abnormalities, while the cerebellar abnormalities worsen and brainstem abnormalities arise. Using whole exome sequencing, four of the patients had a mitochondrial complex І deficiency identified using other laboratory methods. All four of the patients had compound pathogenic variants in the NUBPL gene.  Interactions  NUBPL has protein-protein interactions with DNAJB11, MTUS2, RNF2, and UFD1L.

The E.P. was recorded at Guerilla Studios in Dublin and released on November 24, 2014 via Fortuna Pop! (EU) and Kanine Records (US), 11 months after the release of their debut album Cursing the Sea. Track list Recording and Release September Girls recorded Veneer following the release of September Girls first album Cursing the Sea at Guerilla Studios in Dublin. The first single to be taken from the record was the title-track which came out on October 13, accompanied by a music video directed by band member Jessie Ward. This was quickly followed by the second single 'Black Oil'. Veneer was eventually released on November 24, 2015 on record labels Fortuna Pop! and Kanine Records. Critical reception Veneer was well received by critics upon it release, with many reviewers comparing it favorably to the band's debut album Cursing the Sea. Lisa Wright of NME stated \\"Where September Girls' debut earmarked them as the latest addition to the Dum Dum Girls/Vivian Girls school of Phil Spector worship, 'Veneer' finds the Irish quintet throwing off the '60s girl-group coyness in favour of something fiercer.\\" While Chris Buckle of The Skinny (magazine) said \\"Eleven months after debut album Cursing the Sea established a September Girls-sound hewn from heavy reverb, fuzzy melodies and a moody noir complexion, Veneer steers the Dublin quintet into marginally darker and more turbulent waters.\\" The E.P also received positive reviews from the group's native city with Irish music critic Stephen White of The Last Mixed Tape stating that \\"September Girls are a band defined by their individuality and commitment to never staying in the same spot sonically or stylistically.

The company assisted in the clean-up of the apartment of Craig Spencer, who worked with Doctors Without Borders, when he contracted Ebola, as well as a bowling alley he visited in New York. History Ron Gospodarski founded Bio Recovery Corporation in 1998 out of his apartment. Previously, he was a volunteer paramedic, and worked as operations manager in a Queens district attorney’s office for six years. After Ron Gospodarski died, the company was inherited by his sister, Fran Gospodarski, who later sold off the company to a local competitor, All Island Bio Recovery and Restoration, located in Ronkonkoma, New York.  Work  Bio Recovery has cleaned accidents, suicide and homicide scenes, hoarding situations, anthrax outbreaks, sewage overflow, and other bio-hazard situations. A cleanup requires personal protective gear including a Hazmat suit or single-use non- porous suits, double-filter respirators and chemical spill boots. Bio Recovery worked on the 2000 Wendy's massacre in Flushing, Queens where five employees were killed during a robbery orchestrated by a manager and former employee. The cleanup took 65 certified technicians and two weeks to finish. The company also handled the crime scene clean for the triple murder above the Carnegie Deli in Manhattan. In 2001, Mayor Rudy Giuliani hired Bio Recovery to remove anthrax from several New York buildings. The company also cleaned anthrax from the ABC-TV headquarters. In 2003, the Regal Princess, a cruise ship struck by the Norwalk virus, was handled by Gospodarski and his team. The company worked on the beating of Glenn Moore by Nicholas \\"Fat Nick\\" Minucci in June 2005 and the murder of ex-cop Raymond Sheehan in February 2008. In January 2009, it worked on a home in Springfield Gardens, Queens when Vivian Squires, 86, was attacked by an intruder who she tried to fight off. The company has also worked for large corporations including Marriott Hotels, Burger King, and CVS Pharmacies. Ebola cleanup In October 2014, Bio Recovery worked to decontaminate the apartment in Harlem that belonged to Dr. Craig Spencer, a doctor at NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital who worked with Doctors Without Borders to treat Ebola. The doctor contracted Ebola, and the company was responsible for cleaning his apartment. The company also cleaned Gutter, a bowling alley Spencer had visited.  Controversy  Controversy later erupted after it was reported that the company's new head, Sal Pane, had a history of fraud accusations and had misled the city about his experience with bio-hazardous cleanups. Following the Ebola cleanup in New York City, revelations slowly trickled out revealing a pattern of fraud from the company. Documents released months after the cleanup, including emails with city officials, revealed that the company claimed to have had training it didn't have at the time of the cleanup. Following media investigations into the company, claims of certifications were taken down from the company's website. The company also claimed to be working for the United States Army, which was denied by the Department of Defense and army medical officials.

In the United States, the film premiered in theaters, on- demand, and digitally on January 12, 2016.  Plot  Four astronauts—Captain Theo Cooper (Routh), Dr. Emily McTier (Lotz), Bug Kieslowski (Feldman), and Cole Dvorak (Cook)—begin a 400-day-long simulation on Earth intended to study the long-term effects of space travel. As their time underground grinds on, the crew begins to deal with extreme psychological effects like paranoia and hallucination. The team settles deeper into their separate spaces, until a disheveled man finds his way into their simulated space ship. After his escape, the crew decides to exit and explore the surface world, which they discover is now dark, windy, desolate, forbidding, and covered with dust. After a long walk with minor incidents, they discover the town \\"Tranquillity\\", which is inhabited and has electricity. A man named Zell (Tom Cavanagh) invites them into his diner and tells them the moon had been struck by something which created an enormous dust cloud now covering the Earth, blocking the sun. Dvorak scoffs at this suggestion, still believing they are in a simulation, and leaves to go to the local bar, followed by the rest of the crew. After a few drinks, Dvorak leaves the bar with a young woman without telling the others. The other three return to the diner, where Zell has offered them a place to sleep. Bug takes first watch duty and soon begins hallucinating that he follows his son Sam but stomps across Zell, where the scene ends. Soon, McTier and Cooper wake up alone. When they ask Zell about their missing friends, he insists that Cooper and McTier arrived alone. Suspecting danger, the pair leaves the diner and unsuccessfully looks for their friends. The pair returns to the ship and, as Cooper closes the entrance hatch, he discovers that they were being followed by Zell and two other men. Cooper and McTier manage to neutralize their attackers. The very moment Zell dies, the 400 days have just passed, and they are informed that the simulation has ended with great success. The entrance hatch opens, and bright light shines down. Cooper and McTier grab each other's hands and anxiously await what happens next, but the film ends without showing that.

The film draws inspiration from an experiment called Mars500 (China National Space Administration, European Space Agency and Roscosmos State Corporation), as well as The Twilight Zone, classic science fiction, and puzzle films. Osterman, in his director's statement, explained that > it was my intention to create a narrative that put the viewer in the seat of > the experiment itself—one where the audience was never quite sure of whom to > trust and unsure if it was all just an elaborate ruse. The puzzle aspect of > the movie will be challenging to some, but I wanted to echo Rod Serling and > trust in the idea that it's okay for the audience to not have all the > answers—to be comfortable with the unknown. The film was shot over a period of 19 days in several locations throughout Southern California during summer 2014.  Release  Distribution of 400 Days was handled by XLrator Media as well as Syfy films, the latter for which the movie served as an inaugural release for the studio. The film was screened at the Mall of America on January 15, 2016, as a part of the Twin Cities Film Fest insider series.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that one of eight surveyed critics (13%) gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 3.9/10. Den of Geek rated it 2.5/5 stars and wrote that the story should have focused more on the intriguing premise of testing neurotic astronauts in a simulation. Michael Rechtshaffen of the Los Angeles Times criticized the film's story as not living up to the intriguing premise and wrote, \\"Lacking a viable exit strategy, the tension-free 400 Days feels like wasted time.\\" Leslie Felperin of The Guardian rated it 2/5 stars and wrote that the stock characters and predictable backstories make it seem \\"like watching Solaris performed by sock puppets\\".

In this episode, Finn and Jake are determined to reconnect with their reclusive brother, Jermaine, after Jake dreams of an encounter with him. It was written by Brandon Graham and Jesse Moynihan, who also served as storyboard artists. The episode is the first in the series to have Graham, known for his commercial and personal works in comics, as a writer and an artist. Graham reflected on his enjoyment of producing the episode, explaining that he wrote the beginning and end parts while Moynihan filled in the middle. A show driven by its artists, Graham found that working on Adventure Time left a lasting impression on the way he writes comics—most notably, his Multiple Warheads strip. Aired originally on April 23, 2015, on Cartoon Network, over a million and a half viewers watched the episode, including Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club, who gave the episode an A grade in his review for the website. Plot synopsis Jake dreams of his estranged brother Jermaine in what he realizes is mutual dream. This prompts him to visit his brother along with Finn. The two are chased by demons outside Jermaine's house, where he has built a salt barrier that stops the demons from trespassing. Finn and Jake cause chaos inside the house, much to Jermaine's dismay, who tells them he has a responsibility to protect the strange and valuable items that their father Joshua obtained from the demons, who only want to reclaim their stolen possessions. After checking the time, Jermaine rushes for the hallway and goes down a trapdoor to flip a cassette tape stuffed in a teddy bear, maintaining a force field holding Bryce, a demon like the rest. Here, Bryce has been detained since he tried to reclaim a poster Joshua stole from him. While Jermaine admits his indifference toward Bryce's grudge with his father, he has no intent to free him after all of the psychotic death threats he makes to him. Afterwards, the brothers go upstairs and fry rice for a meal. When Jermaine compliments the meal, Jake reveals that he used the salt consisting the barrier of the house. One of the demons cross through the gap Jake has made from this. Jermaine vacuums up the demon and fixes the barrier. Jermaine gets angry and reveals his jealousy toward Finn and Jake's easygoing lifestyle, while he has to stay behind and watch his parents' old treasures. He pelts Jake with random objects—one of which combusts and sets the house on fire. Jermaine continues to punch Jake, who flatulates. This causes Jermaine to laugh and realize what hoarding these possessions has done to himself. Finn tries to put the fire out, but Jermaine—who has now come to terms with his life—allows the house to burn. The demons leave later in the morning. Jermaine's watch alarm suddenly goes off, and he runs over to the trapdoor to find Bryce crawling out while clutching the poster. Jermaine and Bryce, now at peace with each other, walk off into the woods, with Jermaine nagging Bryce for being cynical and pessimistic about life. Production \\"Jermaine\\" is the thirty-third episode of the sixth season of Adventure Time. It was written by Brandon Graham and Jesse Moynihan, the latter of whom is a veteran storyboard artist on the show. Graham is an American comic book artist known for his work on Prophet (published by Image Comics), as well as his personal works such as Multiple Warheads and King City. According to Graham, the episode was worked on in 2014. Tom Scharpling provided the voice of the eponymous character, who had previously been voiced by John DiMaggio—the voice of Jake—in a cameo appearance. Jon Wurster supplied the voice of Bryce. The episode is the first to spotlight the character of Jermaine, who was only shown in flashbacks and mentioned a few times before in the show. In addition, the episode is the first to use Graham as a storyboard artist. According to Graham, he came to work on the show after meeting show creator Pendleton Ward at Emerald City Comicon in Seattle. Ward had read King City and offered him a storyboarding test, as well as proof of one's ability to draw a monster and to tell a joke. Graham said that he was aware of the show since the early seasons, which his old friend Tom Herpich has worked on. The two were part of the comic book art collective Meathaus in New York City from around 2000 to 2005. The beginning and end of the episode was written by Graham and the middle by Moynihan. The crew gave Graham a rough outline of the events in the episode, from which he would make the storyboard and associated dialog. In addition to this, he designed the title card of the episode. As a fan of Adventure Time, Graham said that having a set idea was helpful, as otherwise he would be forced cover all aspects of the episode he admires in the finished product. He described a couple of elements he put in the episode as fan art, namely BMO, even though the character has a minor part. Happy with how the episode resulted, Graham said that he likes how driven the episodes are by the storyboard artists and that \\"you can really tell who worked on what\\". He also stated that the work of the storyboard artists is similar to the \\"kind of stuff\\" he enjoys and tries to put in his own work. Regarding his Multiple Warheads comic, Graham later wrote that the episode taught him to see storytelling from a different perspective. For his comic book work, Graham entertained the idea of permitting the same freedoms with which Adventure Time is produced, such as focusing on the growth of the fictional setting apart from the story. While complimenting the Frederator Studios crew for their talent and amiability, he said he was terrified when they read through the rough passes on his computer. Later, artist Michael DeForge worked on cleaning up props Graham had designed. Graham said that it was \\"cool knowing that such an impressive artist was tweaking what I'd done\\". Release and reception \\"Jermaine\\" originally aired on April 23, 2015, on Cartoon Network. It was watched by nearly a million and a half viewers, receiving a Nielsen rating of 0.3 for adults in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. According to TV by the Numbers, it was the 94th most-watched cable television episode of its air date. The A.V. Club writer Oliver Sava gave the episode an A grade, describing the voice acting of Scharpling and DiMaggio as having a brotherly bond that fits with the episode. He called the episode a metaphor for having to let go of \\"physical reminders of the past\\" in order to truly escape from something, with Jermaine being the opposite of this. Sava praised Graham and his work on the episode, saying that he is eager to see more from him for the Adventure Time universe.

Rationale This statement relates to Socrates' understanding and attitude towards death and his commitment to fulfill his goal of investigating and understanding the statement of the Pythia (i.e. that there was no one wiser than Socrates). Socrates understood the Pythia's response to Chaerephon's question as a communication from the god Apollo and this became Socrates's prime directive, his raison d'etre. For Socrates, to be separated from elenchus by exile (preventing him from investigating the statement) was therefore a fate worse than death. Since Socrates was religious and trusted his religious experiences, such as his guiding daimonic voice, he accordingly preferred to continue to seek the truth to the answer to his question, in the after-life, than live a life not identifying the answer on earth. Meaning The words were supposedly spoken by Socrates at his trial after he chose death rather than exile. They represent (in modern terms) the noble choice, that is, the choice of death in the face of an alternative.Julian Baggini - Wisdom's folly The Guardian newspaper (Guardian News and Media Limited) Thursday 12 May 2005 Interpretation Socrates believed that philosophy – the love of wisdom – was the most important pursuit above all else. For some, he exemplifies more than anyone else in history the pursuit of wisdom through questioning and logical argument, by examining and by thinking. His 'examination' of life in this way spilled out into the lives of others, such that they began their own 'examination' of life, but he knew they would all die one day, as saying that a life without philosophy – an 'unexamined' life – was not worth living.D.M.

Preparation and ingredients Vegetable chips may be prepared with sliced vegetables that are fried, deep-fried, baked, dehydrated, or simply dried. Vegetable chips may be produced from a variety of root vegetables and leaf vegetables, such as carrot, turnip, swede, parsnip, parsley root, chervil root, celery root (celeriac), beetroot, radish, jerusalem artichoke, taro, malanga, eddoe, sweet potato, butternut squash, onion, garlic, courgette, yam, cassava, kale, spinach, fennel, and jicama, among others. Some baked versions utilize vegetables that are sliced, lightly tossed in oil, and then oven-baked until crisp. Vegetable chips prepared using this method have been described as more healthful compared to deep fried chips, particularly when prepared using \\"heart-healthy\\" olive oil. Simple versions are prepared by slicing vegetables and drying them, without any cooking involved. Sometimes a mandoline is used to slice vegetables for vegetable chips, which can accommodate thin slicing and enhance size consistency. Vegetable chips may be flavored with spices such as salt, sea salt, pepper, cajun spice, curry, allspice, chipotle powder, sweet or smoked paprika, adobo seasoning, dried chives and many others. Mass-produced varieties may contain food preservatives or monosodium glutamate. Vegetable chips can be homemade using various recipes and preparation processes.

Life  Koblmueller was born in Linz, Austria. He studied at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna with a degree in forestry. In 1978 he founded with his wife Elisabeth a mountaineering school called Bergspechte and for that gave up his secure position with the government of Upper Austria (he worked in the department of agriculture and forestry and was responsible for environmental matters, at a time when no department for these existed.) In 1991 he was caught by an avalanche in the Pyrenees and rescued by his team, but suffered knee injuries with long-term consequences. In 2005 he was completely buried by an avalanche in Abruzzo, but located and excavated by friends. In this incident, he suffered no injuries.Edi Koblmüller: Eine Bergsteigerlegende wird 60, bergsteigen.com 13. April 2006, accessed April 17, 2015. In 1999, Koblmueller's older son Michael died at the age of 24 during an ascent of the Diran (7,266-meter/23,839 ft) in an avalanche. In 2003, his wife died at age 56 during an exercise in an indoor climbing wall. Both Koblmueller and his wife were licensed mountain guides, as is their younger son Reinhard. Since 1968, Koblmueller participated in expeditions in the Andes, in the Hindu Kush, in the Karakoram and the Himalayas, and achieved important first ascents. His most important accomplishment was the first ascent of the Southeast Face of Cho Oyu (8201 m/26,906 ft) in 1978 together with Alois Furtner [3]. Koblmueller was considered one of the most successful Austrian expedition mountaineer, and reached five eight-thousanders. In the summer of 2014, he sold his shares of the Bergspechte company to a German firm operating in the same field, but remained active as an adviser. On April 10, 2015, Koblmueller led a group of nine participants in a ski expedition to Mount Kazbek (5047 m/16,516 ft) in the Greater Caucasus. During one leg of the ascent the group encountered a snow storm. Seven members of the mostly Austrian group managed to reach a hut and were unharmed. As guide, Koblmueller aided a 59-year-old Austrian participant. Both were caught in a blizzard, and were found on the afternoon of April 16, 2015 at an altitude of 4700 m having died of hypothermia.

She is an author that articulates pressing societal issues such as diaspora and neoliberalism from the perspectives of the marginalized and minorities. Kokkiri (코끼리 Elephant), which represents migrant workers’ issues through the use of mythic and archetypal symbols, is her most representative work. Life Born in 1966 in Yeoju, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea Kim moved to Seoul during her elementary school years and went to Ssangmun Elementary, Dobong Girls Middle School and Songgok Girls High School. She enjoyed writing children's poems during elementary school so much that she independently created her own collection of children's poetry. In her third year of middle school, she read Yi Sang’s 1936 short story “Nalgae” (날개 Wings)Yi Sang (1910-1937) is a Korean author.

It was because of this interest that she also later joined and became active in her high school's literary club.See video interview at the GyeongGi Cultural Foundation. “Our Fellow Authors in Korean Language Textbooks – 21. Kokkiri Author, Kim Jae- young.” GyeongGi Cultural Foundation, 31 July 2017. https://www.ggcf.kr/archives/70766 While still in high school, Kim began writing literature and in 1985 she enrolled in SungKyunKwan University where she majored in Family Management. She was primarily interested in dramatic arts, but in her junior year was deeply affected by the Workers Struggle of June 1987. She was elected president of the College of Life Sciences, but was eventually expelled from school. Kim worked for a time as an assistant for National Federation of Street Vendors and eventually married and had two sons. As she entered her thirties, she thoughtlessly began writing novels without any sort of special preparation. This was largely due to her dissatisfaction with the huildam munhak (“literature of reminiscence” or “epilogue novels”)In general terms, the phrase huildam means “epilogue”—an additional explanation added to the end of a story to serve as a special kind of conclusion. In the context of Korea, it is a critical term that refers to a specific category of works written in the early 1990s by authors reflecting on their experiences in the 1980s democratization movements. These authors tend to reflect on their rapid change into ordinary people after participating in reform movements and the gap produced by the traces of the past and its contrast with reality. Critics generally pointed out that many huildam novels are mere “narratives of disillusionment and loss” and do not go any further. See the entry on the Naver Encyclopedia of Literary Criticism Terms for huildam. https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1531185&cid;=60657&categoryId;=60657 trend that was popular in the 1990s. The author, after having directly participated in the 1980s democratization movements, stated that she felt dejected and dissatisfied in seeing the denigration of this fervor for change within huildam literature.Kim, Jae-young. “Author’s Note: To You, The Straw of Beauty.” In Sagwapai nanuneun sigan. Jaeumgwa moeum, 2018. However, huildam literature was a short-lived trend and Kim made her debut in 2000 with the short story “Tto dareun gyejeol” (또 다른 계절 Yet Another Season) which dealt with her personal experience of her father's death at a young age. She returned to university at Chungang University where she completed the professionals course, and went on to the Chungang Graduate School. Kim spent a year in New York when her husband had a visiting professorship at Columbia University. While there she wrote diasporic stories. She received her doctorate degree in 2013 and as of 2015 was teaching literature ad Chungang University, Myongil University, and Soongeui Women's College. She generally centers her novels around pressing societal issues and controversies. For instance, her 2005 novel Kokkiri deals with the human rights issues of migrant laborers and marriage migrants,The author remembers how in the 2000s, though South Korea had been thought of as an ethnically homogeneous nation, numerous migrant workers came to Korea and many people were also deported on the grounds of illegal immigration. In this manner, she started worrying about why they had to be deported, became curious about the people that lived in Korea for a long time and laid their roots with their family, and how we should treat those unfamiliar to us in order to live together.

Diaspora“Diaspora literature” refers to literature dealing with those who have left their home country and are staying in a foreign land or literature directly written by those with this experience. In the context of Korean literature, this includes literature written by those in the Korean diaspora as well as multicultural literature written by domestic Korean authors. See the entry on diaspora literature in the Naver Encyclopedia of Korean Culture. https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1821786&cid;=46645&categoryId;=46645  Kim Jae-young's early writings concentrate on the problems within and faced by the diaspora. She not only represents the diaspora population within Korea itself, such as the hardships faced by multicultural families and the realities of foreign workers, but has also expanded her writings to include the problems faced by diaspora outside of Korea largely caused by globalization. The titular short story “Kokkiri” within her 2005 collection of short stories, Kokkiri, is one of the most famous works among Korean literature portraying foreign workers written in the 2000s.The author has stated that in order to understand multicultural families for Kokkiri, she thoughtlessly visited places where migrant workers lived to directly observe them and collected related materials for over six months. See video interview at the GyeongGi Cultural Foundation. “Our Fellow Authors in Korean Language Textbooks – 21.

That is, she emphasizes that foreigners exist within Korean society and thus, their problems are also Korean problems. The use of mythic symbolism as a metaphor in representing important values that must be safeguarded within reality is one of Kim's distinctive writing methods that shape her novels.Jeong, Houng. “Commentary: The Reality of Despair and Hopelessness, A Heart of Compassion.” In Kokkiri. Silcheon, 2005. Her 2009 novel, Pokshik (Gluttony), depicts foreigners in every region of the world that have been marginalized from society. Her personal experience living as a foreigner in the United States made her realize that it is not only Korea, but all international major cities that face issues related to multiculturalism.The author lived in Manhattan, New York in the United States for one year and observed the lives of immigrants from all over the world. She once audited a Korean Studies lecture at Columbia University and the topic for that day was related to “Multicultural Families” and saw her work Kokkiri being described as “diaspora literature.” This experience caused her to think that the subject matters dealt with in her book were indeed important after all and felt a sense of gratitude.

In stories such as “Aengcho” (앵초 Primrose), where the protagonist cannot even collect her dead husband's body after the September 11 Attacks on the World Trade Center, and the titular “Pokshik,” where even though Team Leader Min is diagnosed with a rare disease from overwork, he cannot give up his job at a large multinational corporation, Kim juxtaposes the richness and abundance of cities with the wretched lives within them. The moment that foreigners are excluded from power and its cold logic, they face a world of heartless violence.See the book information page on Poksik on Aladin Books’ website: https://www.aladin.co.kr/shop/wproduct.aspx?ItemId=6042898 After the publication of Pokshik, Kim no longer represented diasporic narratives in her works because she stated that she wanted the next generation of writers, who grew up in multicultural families themselves, to portray them in their own voices.Kim, Jae-young. “Author’s Note: To You, The Straw of Beauty.” In Sagwapai nanuneun sigan.

Kim wrote the novel while she was constantly going back and forth between Jeju Island and the mainland when she was building her future home on Jeju Island. Because of this, the history and mythology of Jeju Island, as well as a concern towards nature, features prominently in the novel—such as the short story “Geu seome deulda” (그 섬에 들다 To Enter That Island). In particular, the cosmic imagination in the titular story “Sagwapai nanuneun sigan” romantically renders an optimistic energy in order to overcome the difficulties of reality with its self-reflection and introspection towards life.Lee, Suhwan. “Author Kim Jae-young’s New Work: The Publication of Sagwapai nanuneun sigan.” Digital Daily, 5 June 2018. http://www.ddaily.co.kr/news/article/?no=169515 See the book information page on Sagwapai nanuneun sigan on the Aladin Books’ website. https://www.aladin.co.kr/shop/wproduct.aspx?ItemId=148426316 Works in Translation 《코끼리》, 실천문학사, 2005 / Elephant, Literature Translation Institute of Korea e-books, 2008.Digital Library of Korean Literature - Elephant https://library.ltikorea.or.kr/node/21042 《코끼리》, 실천문학사, 2005 / The Elephant (Bi-lingual Edition Modern Korean Literature, Volume 49), Asia Publishers, 2014.See the book information page on the bilingual edition of Kim Jae-young’s The Elephant published by Asia Publishers on the Aladin Bookstore website: https://www.aladin.co.kr/shop/wproduct.aspx?ItemId=38094099 See the publisher’s introduction to The Elephant on Asia Publishers’ blog: https://blog.naver.com/bookasia/60210810020 Works in Korean 《코끼리》, 실천문학사, 2005 / Kokkiri (Elephant), Silcheon, 2005. 《폭식》, 창비, 2009. / Pokshik (Gluttony), Changbi, 2009. 《사과파이 나누는 시간》, 자음과 모음, 2018. / Sagwapai nanuneun sigan (Apple Pie-Sharing Time), Jaeumgwa moeum, 2018.

She was born, lived and died in Bern, Switzerland. Life  Alice attended the Höhere Töchterschule of Zürich, a municipal school for higher education for girls. After graduation in 1924 she studied mathematics, physics and astronomy at ETH Zurich under George Pólya. She graduated with a diploma in 1930. Her Master's thesis was titled \\"Extension of Weierstrass's Approximation Theorem to the complex plane and to an infinite interval\\". After that, she was a teacher at multiple high schools for girls in the Zurich area while continuing working with Pólya at ETH. In 1938 she became the second woman to graduate with a PhD from ETH Her PhD Thesis was titled \\"Properties of approximations and radial limits of meromorphic and entire functions\\" and was so well regarded that it received a monetary prize and the ETH silver medal. Her supervisors were Pólya and Heinz Hopf. From 1940 she was mathematics and physics teacher at Humboldtianum in Bern, a private school. It was only after her retirement in 1971 she returned to mathematical research, again in the areas of complex approximation. She published three papers on her own, as well as a shared paper with Paul Gauthier of the University of Montreal and Harvard University professor Joseph L. Walsh. In 1975, at 70 years old, she was invited to give a public lecture at the University of Montreal. In 1976 she was diagnosed with cancer, and she died the next year. Contribution to mathematics One of the main results of Roth's 1938 thesis was an example of a compact set on which not every continuous function can by approximated uniformly by rational functions. This set, now known as the \\"Swiss cheese,\\" was forgotten and independently rediscovered in 1952 in Russia by Mergelyan, and proper credit was restored by 1969. The following excerpt by her former student, Peter Wilker, appeared in an obituary he wrote after her death: \\"In Switzerland, as elsewhere, women mathematicians are few and far between.... Alice Roth's dissertation was awarded a medal from the ETH, and appeared shortly after its completion in a Swiss mathematical journal....One year later war broke out, the world had other worries than mathematics, and Alice Roth's work was simply forgotten. So completely forgotten that around 1950 a Russian mathematician re-discovered similar results without having the slightest idea that a young Swiss woman mathematician had published the same ideas more than a decade before he did. However, her priority was recognized.\\"Ulrich Daepp, Paul Gauthier, Pamela Gorkin, and Gerald Schmieder, \\"Alice in Switzerland: The Life and Mathematics of Alice Roth,\\" Mathematics Intelligencer, Vol. 27, No. 1 (2005), 41–54. Roth developed other important results during her brief return to research at the end of her life: \\"Roth's past as well as future work was to have a strong and lasting influence on mathematicians working in this area [rational approximation theory]. Her Swiss cheese has been modified (to an entire variety of cheeses)....

Born in England, Haworth immigrated to Australia in 1954. Early life and career Haworth was born on 8 June 1931 to Frank and Gladys Haworth. Both of his parents died when he was six, after which he went to live with his mother's sister in Scotland. In 1938 he returned to Lancashire, to live with his grandparents, Richard and Bertha, where he attended Hutton Grammar School, After graduation, Haworth was accepted into HMS Conway in 1946, a school for training aspiring merchant marine officers. Upon successful completion of the Conway program in 1947, Haworth accepted a position as a cadet with the South American Saint Line (SASL). He would remain with SASL for the next six years, rising to the position of Third Mate. Australia and entrepreneurship Haworth with father Frank, mother Gladys and grandfather Richard Although Haworth was offered a position with SASL to continue on that career path, he decided to immigrate to Australia in 1954. He arrived in Townsville in late 1954. Making his way to Sydney, he joined the ranks of Australian Oriental Line, which operated between Australia, Japan and the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong. In 1960, at the age of 29, Haworth become the youngest master of a vessel in the company's history, when he attained that rank on the SS Taiping. In the early 1960s, after his marriage to Geraldine Coates, he became a partner in a marine salvage firm. This was followed by his purchasing a marina in Northbridge. While operating the Northbridge marina, Haworth returned to visit the United Kingdom. On his way to his homeland, he stopped off in the United States. During his visit, he went on a sightseeing tour in New York City on the Circle Line. This excursion led him to devise a similar business plan for a waterways tour in Sydney. That plan would eventually solidify into the founding of Captain Cook Cruises in 1970. Captain Cook Cruises After his sojourn to England, and his stop-off in New York, Haworth returned to Sydney. With the idea of opening an operation similar to the Circle Line, he was approached by the owner of a British fairmile, with the idea of opening a marine tourist operation in Sydney. Understanding that most new businesses lost money during their first several years of operation, he and Geraldine agreed that they would fund the new company with the profits from their marina business. In order to take advantage of the best location in the harbour, Haworth lobbied Sydney politicians, finally being granted the opportunity to operate from the logistically advantageous Jetty 6, also known as Circular Quay. Captain Cook Cruises began operations on 26 January 1970. Initially, the line only offered sightseeing cruises around Sydney Harbour twice a week. Understanding the limitations of marketing solely to Australians, Haworth began advertising to entice international tourists to visit Sydney. Years later, the chairman of the Australian Tourism Export Council, John King, would say, \\"He understood that the development of a tourism business required the synonymous development of an industry to develop and sustain the business he was creating... The Haworths introduced to tourism in Australia a sense of style to underpin this professionalism and sense of experience – a sense of occasion perhaps not seen generally in tourism in Australia at that time.\\" This understanding led to Haworth not only marketing Captain Cook Cruises, but Australian tourism in general. The Captain Cook 2 In 1975, Haworth would suffer a setback when he contracted endocarditis, a serious heart condition which resulted in him having to undergo heart valve replacement surgery. Two years later, in 1977, he would be in a major car accident while visiting Hong Kong, wherein his driver was killed, resulting in his being hospitalised for a month. From tours around Sydney Harbor, the company expanded to touring the Murray River. This was followed by ships touring the Great Barrier Reef in partnership with Qantas, and finally, tours to Fiji in 1997. At the height of their business, Captain Cook was the leading cruise line in Australia and the Southeast Pacific. At the height of its operations, the company operated more than 25 ships. Its passenger manifest exceeded one million customers on their day/dinner cruises, plus an additional 40,000 visitors on overnight cruises. In the 1990s, Haworth began to see competition from other tour ship operators, including Amalgamated Holdings and Accor. Amalgamated Holdings brand in the area, Matilda Cruises, would be bought out by Haworth in November 2005. During the Papal visit to Australia in 2008, Captain Cook was selected as the official Papal boat service, with the company's flagship, MV Sydney 2000 being the ship on which Pope Benedict XVI toured the harbour. In 2011 Haworth sold the Sydney and Murray River businesses to SeaLink, although the company still retains their concession to the Fiji islands. Haworth served on several organisations promoting Australian tourism, including: vice-chairman of Sydney Convention and Visitors Bureau; chairman of the Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia; Commissioner of the Australian Tourism Commission; chairman of the New South Wales Tourism Commission; a Life Fellow member of the Australian Institute of Company Directors; and deputy chairman of the Australian Tourism Industry Association. He was also the chairman of the Industrial Relations Committee when the \\"Code of Good Working Practice\\" was published. He has also been a proponent for gender diversity, culminating in the \\"Women as Leaders\\" breakfast. Philanthropy Haworth was a founding member of the Sydney Cove Rotary Group in 1978, as well as being selected as a Trustee of the Lizard Island Research Foundation. Accolades On 10 June 1985 Haworth was appointed Member of the Order of Australia, and the Australian Tourism board gave him an Award for Outstanding Contribution by an Individual in 1994.

He is the founder and Senior Pastor of Living Word Christian Center, a non- denominational church in Forest Park, Illinois with over 22,000 members. Winston's teachings, writings, weekly television and radio outreach are circulated through his ministry outreach, Bill Winston Ministries and are aired worldwide via his broadcast program Believer’s Walk of Faith. Winston's sermons are also aired on several radio networks within the United States. Early life Winston was born and raised in Tuskegee, Alabama. Winston says he was inspired by the Tuskegee airmen and other local aviators. Winston met his future wife, Veronica Irene Brown, while working at IBM Corporation. They were married in 1983. Veronica Winston is a leader of Living Word Christian Center, teacher, preacher, intercessor and author. The Winstons are the parents of three children: Melody, Allegra and David; and the grandparents of eight. Winston graduated from Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama in 1967. After graduation, Winston enlisted in the US Air Force, where he served for six years. During this time, he served as a fighter pilot during the Vietnam War. In March 1971 he piloted an F-4E Phantom that struck anti-aircraft batteries deep within North Vietnamese territory. The mission won him the Distinguished Flying Cross. In January 1973, Winston joined the IBM Corporation as a Marketer. He soon was promoted to Regional Marketing Manager in IBM’s Midwest Region. Winston states that during his time at IBM he became spiritually \\"born again\\" and felt a call from God into full-time ministry. He resigned from IBM in 1985 and started attending Logos Bible School. In 1996, Winston briefly attended Oral Roberts University. Ministry In 1988, while residing in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Winston and his wife started a small ministry. They traveled to Chicago every weekend to sponsor a two-day Faith Crusades; the attendance was less than 20 people. By December 1988, Winston moved to Chicago with his family. He began a Bible training school, with services held at the Quality Inn Hotel at Madison and Halsted Streets in Chicago. In 1989, it became the “Living Word Church of Chicago.” In 1990 the name changed to “Living Word Christian Center”. From 1994 through 1997, the church rented space for services at the Chez Roué Banquet Hall in Forest Park, Illinois. Then as the ministry grew the Forest Park Mall, a 33-acre shopping mall, was purchased and the church held its first worship service at the mall on New Year’s Eve of 1997. Since then, the church and its worship facility has expanded into a multimillion-dollar, state-of-the-art worship center. The church’s auditorium is notable for its forward architectural design. Book Publishing Winston has written, authored, and self-published over 15 motivational Christian and Business books, includingTransform Your Thinking, Transform Your Life, Law of Confession, Power of the Tongue' and 'Divine Favor. He has also written mini-books and multimedia resource content. Three of his books have been published by Harrison House.

As of October 21, 2015, the video has amassed over 17 million views on YouTube and over 15 million on Facebook. Production The video was produced for Pandora by Malling Publications, a Danish advertising company. Hanne Fabricius, CEO of Malling Publications, was responsible for the idea and concept, and was also the strategic director of the video. The video was directed by Rasmus Skousen, a Danish photographer who works in the genres of fashion, advertising, and portraits. Plot The video features six mothers and their children. All the mothers stand in a line-up. One by one, the children, blindfolded, are assigned the task of identifying which of the six women is his or her mother. The children pull the women down and feel the women's jewelry, clothing, facial structure, and hair in order, and also sniff the women, in order to judge them. In the video, each child is able to successfully identify his or her mother. Reception Views As of April 24, 2015, the video had over 11 million views on YouTube and over 15 million on Facebook. Adweek ranked it #2 in its list of top five commercials for the week of April 17–24. Critical reception The video was generally praised for its theme of mother-child love as well as its execution of the theme. It was labeled a tearjerker for its ability to connect with and touch a large number of people. American actor Ashton Kutcher wrote of the video: \\"I could watch this all day.\\" Two articles on Adweek identified the video as a way for Pandora to get an early start on associating itself positively with motherhood in the weeks running up to Mother's Day, which would be observed on May 10, 2015. One wrote: \\"It underscores how irreplaceable our moms are, and how important it is to them that we know them well—particularly on days like Mother's Day. (Hint, hint, buy her some personalized jewelry.) [...] It's also a not so subtle hint to her significant other, because c'mon, that 3-year-old isn't paying for the bracelet himself.\\" Another noted: \\"While the spot contains little overt branding (one of the moms does appear to be wearing Pandora Jewelry, but it’s a quick shot), it ties the brand to the emotional sentiment while encouraging viewers to purchase Pandora Jewelry for mothers day.\\" Writing for Health, Ellen Seidman offered the following criticisms of the video: overly manipulative in its attempt to use a feel-good theme to sell jewelry, too little racial or ethnic diversity, no role for dads, and grossly inadequate in describing the wonders of the mother-child relationship.

She is also research advisor of the African Storybook and 2006 co- founder of the Africa Research Network on Applied Linguistics and Literacy. She is internationally recognized for her theories of identity and language learning and her construct of investment. A Fellow of the American Educational Research Association (AERA), she was the first recipient in 2010 of the Senior Research Leadership Award of AERA’s Second Language Research SIG. In 2016, she was co-recipient of the TESOL Award for Distinguished Research and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Biography Born in 1956 and raised in South Africa during the turbulent apartheid years, Norton learnt at an early age the complex relationship between language, power, and identity. As a reporter for the student newspaper at the University of the Witwatersrand (WITS) in Johannesburg, she investigated the draconian language policies of the state, which sought to impose the Afrikaans language on resistant African students, precipitating the Soweto Riots in 1976. After completing a BA in English and history, a teaching diploma, and an Honours Degree in applied linguistics at WITS in 1982, she received a Rotary Foundation Graduate Scholarship to do an MA in linguistics (1984) at Reading University in the UK. Thereafter she joined her partner, Anthony Peirce, in Princeton University, US, where she spent three years as a TOEFL language test developer at the Educational Testing Service, and had two children, Michael and Julia. The family moved to Canada in 1987, where Norton completed a PhD in language education (1993) at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto. Prior to her appointment at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 1996, she was awarded postdoctoral fellowships from the US National Academy of Education Spencer Foundation and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Research program Norton is centrally concerned with the ways in which language and literacy research can address larger social inequities, while supporting educational change at the grassroots level. Her research seeks to make visible the relations of power that language learners and teachers navigate in diverse classrooms and communities. An advocate for international development, her trajectory of research extends from Canada to sub-Saharan Africa, focussing on a broad range of topics including digital literacy, popular culture, health literacy, language assessment, and teacher education. In 2006, she co-founded the Africa Research Network on Applied Linguistics and Literacy, and is active in the innovative African Storybook in which her former UBC graduate students, Juliet Tembe and Sam Andema, are team members.Faculty of Education: Community Engagement The ASP is an open-access digital initiative of the South African Institute for Distance Education, which promotes early literacy for African children through the provision of hundreds of children’s stories in multiple African languages, as well as English, French, and Portuguese. Its spin-off, the Global-ASP, is translating these stories for children worldwide. In her capacity as Research Advisor of the African Storybook, Norton has worked with Espen Stranger-Johannessen, also of UBC, to initiate the African Storybook blog and YouTube channel to advance this and other projects.

The schism existed primarily between Melbourne's pre-eminent league, the Victorian Football League (VFL), and its secondary league, the Victorian Football Association (VFA). In the context of VFA history, this period is often referred to as the throw-pass era. The schism began in 1938, when the VFA introduced several rule changes, including legalising throwing of the football in general play. The changes helped to speed up the game, and promoted more run-and-carry play in an era which had previously been dominated by a long kicking style. Additionally, the VFA ended its player transfer agreement with the VFL, and aggressively recruited star players from the VFL. These changes gave the VFA for the first time in many years an on-field product which could compete with the VFL for public interest, and it made the 1940s one of the most successful periods in the VFA's history. By the mid-1940s, the VFA had copyrighted its rules, and was considered to be playing its own distinct code of Australian rules football. The VFA's actions created a division in the administrative structure of the sport in Victoria. Throughout the 1940s, the VFL and VFA worked towards ending the schism, as they both believed that a single controlling body playing under a uniform set of rules was in the best interests of football as a whole. Over several years, the VFL and VFA unsuccessfully negotiated options, including for the two competitions to be amalgamated into one. The schism ended after the 1949 season, when the VFA accepted the national standard rules, in exchange for receiving its own seat on the Australian National Football Council, which ultimately gave it a voice in the administration of the game at the national level. Although the throw-pass itself did not survive beyond the schism, other innovations from the throw- pass era helped to shape the national rules of the game. Background Australian rules football had been played in Victoria since 1858, and was initially administered in an ad hoc manner by the active clubs, who agreed upon rules and administrative matters through informal meetings of club secretaries. In 1877, the Victorian Football Association (VFA) was established to provide formal and binding administration of the game in Victoria. By 1888, the VFA had brought a formal structure to its on-field competition, including the system under which the premiership was decided, and thus the VFA was serving as both the game's administrative body and as its top senior competition in Victoria. In October 1896, eight of the VFA's thirteen clubs seceded and established the Victorian Football League (VFL). The VFL comprised the strongest clubs in Melbourne, in large part because its clubs were based in the more densely populated inner suburbs where potential gate takings were higher, while the VFA's clubs were generally based further from the city centre; thus the VFL became the pre-eminent football competition and administrative body in Victoria. The strongest VFA clubs regularly sought admission to the more lucrative VFL, and four clubs gained admission over the following decades ( in 1908; and , and in 1925), on each occasion quelling a brief resurgence in the VFA's popularity. As a matter of comparison of the two competitions' strengths, the average home-and-away crowds in the 1937 season were around 14,300 in the VFL and 2,400 in the VFA. Both the VFL and VFA played all matches on Saturday afternoons at the time, so the two were in direct competition with each other for spectators. It was widely acknowledged that the VFL was the higher standard competition, and even the VFA executive was prepared to acknowledge that only a handful of VFA players had the ability to succeed as senior VFL players. The responsibility for administration of the game at the national level fell at this time to the Australian National Football Council (ANFC). Formed in 1906, the ANFC comprised one delegate from each state, and later added one from Canberra and one representing amateur football nationwide. The ANFC was the custodian of the official laws of the game, which all of its affiliated competitions were required to use. The council's purpose was to provide a united control structure for the sport, and to help to promote the interests of the game as a whole; as part of this, it took levies from the southern states and distributed grants to the northern states to help them develop the game in rugby territory. Victoria was represented on the ANFC by the VFL. The VFA was not part of the ANFC; but, it had a formal relationship with the VFL governed by an agreement signed between them in 1931, and the terms of that agreement indirectly brought the VFA under the ANFC's influence. Establishment of the throw-pass code The mid-1930s had been a period of declining popularity for football in Victoria. Both the VFA and VFL were enduring financial problems, to the point where some of the weaker VFL teams were being kept afloat only by the dividends they received from finals gates. The VFA decided that it would make a series of rule changes to make the game more spectacular to try to reverse this trend. The first set of recommendations was made by its appointed rules committee in early October 1937, and the final decision on which rules to include was made at a meeting of club delegates in February 1938. The rule changes which were made were: *Throwing the ball – the VFA legalised throwing as a means of disposal in general play, provided the throw was with two hands and both hands were kept below shoulder height. The primary intention of the rule was to provide a faster and less skilful means of disposing of the football than kicking or handpassing, to make it easier for players to clear the ball from scrimmages – which tended to slow down the game during the 1930s. A secondary benefit of the rule was that flick-passing – a handpassing style in which the ball is propelled with an open hand instead of the traditional closed fist – had increased in usage during the 1930s, but it blurred the line between handpassing and throwing such that it was difficult for umpires to police consistently; by legalising throwing the ball, this source of inconsistency was removed. It was a bold change, since throwing the ball had been illegal throughout the history of Australian rules football, dating all the way back to the Melbourne Rules of 1859; although the idea itself was not new, and had been proposed in various forums including the ANFC without being accepted since as early as 1911. This form of disposal became known as a throw-pass – a term which in many sports would appear tautological, but reflected its distinction from the other styles of handpass. Strictly speaking, the throw was not a new form of disposal; but rather, the definition of a handpass was expanded to include throwing. *Holding the ball – amendments were made to the existing holding the ball rule. Under 1930s ANFC rules, a player would be penalised for holding the ball if he was tackled while in possession, unless he immediately kicked, handpassed or dropped the ball. In practice, players would usually drop the ball upon being tackled, which meant that a scrimmage could easily form around the ball and the tackled player; it also meant that a player could drop the ball, try to earn a holding the man free kick if the tackler did not let him go, then quickly pick the ball up again if the tackler did let him go. This was difficult for umpires to police consistently, and was the major cause of scrimmages which had both slowed down the game and had contributed to a rise in rough play during the 1930s. The Association amended the rule by eliminating the provision for the player to drop the ball: he would now have to kick, handpass or throw the ball, but would be penalised if he dropped it, meaning that the ball would be cleared away from the spot of the tackle, making it more difficult for a scrimmage to form around it. It is noted that the ANFC had previously tried to introduce this same rule (excluding the provision to throw the ball) in 1930 and had found it unsuccessful at reducing scrimmages; but the VFA believed that combining this rule with the ability to throw the ball – a much easier form of disposal than a traditional handpass – would be more successful at achieving this aim. *Boundary throw-in – the boundary throw-in was reintroduced to the game. Under the new rules, the boundary umpire would throw the ball back into play to a neutral ruck contest after the ball went out of bounds, unless: the field umpire deemed that the ball had been forced out deliberately; or, if the ball went out of bounds from a kick-in after a behind without another player touching it – in which cases a free kick would be awarded. Players contesting boundary throw-ins were made to initially stand apart from each other and were not permitted to interfere with each other. Re-introducing the boundary throw- in was a return to a set of rules which had prevailed prior to 1925. Since 1925, ANFC rules had dictated that a free kick be awarded against the last team to play the ball before it went out of bounds under any circumstances; the VFL had voted in favour of the change, but it had quickly come to be unpopular among players and spectators, and Victoria had since unsuccessfully agitated for it to be repealed. Since the ANFC rules never gained wide popularity in Victoria, many were glad to see a return to the old rules. The change opened the wings and flanks up to more play: under the ANFC rules, play had in general been much more direct down the centre of the field to avoid the risk of turning over possession by putting the ball out of bounds, but the return of the boundary throw-in lowered the risk of playing down the boundary lines. It also simplified the umpire's job, as he no longer needed to determine which player was the last to play the ball before it went out of bounds, which was often difficult if the ball was being contested at the time. *Free kicks paid for fouls committed after a disposal – the VFA introduced the rule which today is known as a downfield free kick, although that name was not in contemporary use. Under the rule, if a player was fouled after disposing of the ball, a free kick would be awarded to the nearest teammate at the spot where the ball landed, instead of to the fouled player at the spot of the foul. *Transfer of free kicks from injured players – a provision was introduced for a free kick to be taken by a teammate if the player who was originally to take the free kick was injured and unable to take it. Under national rules, a ball-up would be called under these circumstances. Another key rule which was not included amongst the original 1938 changes, but which was introduced during the 1939 season was: *Fifteen yard penalty: The VFA introduced a fifteen yard penalty for offences by the man on the mark. Specifically, when a player was awarded a mark or a free kick, if his opponent cribbed over the mark or wasted time by refusing to return the ball directly to him, the umpire could move the spot of the mark ten to fifteen yards closer to goal, and could apply multiple such penalties until the opponent complied. Cribbing over the mark, sometimes by as far as five to ten yards, was a much disliked but commonplace feature of the game by 1938, but there was no onfield penalty available to the umpire to manage it; time-wasting was a reportable offence, but reports were seldom enforced; so, the VFA introduced the rule to give the umpire the means to more directly control what had become an unattractive feature of the game. Overall, the committee believed the changes would retain the speed, long kicking and high marking which were thought to be the game's most attractive features, but reduce on-field congestion and roughness and make the rules simpler for the umpire to apply. Collectively, the rules became known as the VFA rules, Association rules, more informally as the throw-pass rules, or pejoratively as throw-ball; the traditional rules were known as the national rules, League rules or ANFC rules. Rejected rules The original proposal put forward by the rules committee had gone significantly further. Additional rules which were put forward in 1938, but were rejected by the club delegates, were: *Reducing the number of players in the run-on team from 18 to 16, to open up more space on the field and reduce congestion. It was envisioned that the ruck and ruck-rover would be the positions eliminated. This change was defeated by a single vote, with six clubs in favour and six clubs opposed. *Replacing the centre bounce with a kick-off from twenty yards behind the centre-line by the team which had just been scored upon. This rule was included amongst the original proposals because, had the rucks and ruck-rovers been removed from the run-on team, it was felt that it would no longer make sense to retain the traditional centre bounce; and it was thought that faster restarts from a kick-off could enhance the game as a tactical spectacle. Once the proposal to reduce the number of players had been rejected, this rule change was summarily rejected. *As part of the rules to re-introduce boundary throw-ins, it was proposed that only two players from each team – the rover and the nearest-placed positional player – be permitted to contest the throw-in, with the umpire directing other players away, in order to reduce the potential for scrimmages to form at the contest. When the reduction in the number of players was defeated, the boundary throw- in rule was amended to remove this aspect of the proposal. *Awarding three points if the ball hits the goal post, instead of the standard one point. *Giving umpires the power to order players off to control rough play. Early years of throw-pass football (1938–1941) Effect on the game Observers of the new rules quickly lauded them for having their intended effects of speeding up the game, reducing congestion and making the rules easier to police consistently. The Australasian sportswriter Reginald Wilmot (writing under his pseudonym Old Boy) noted that the rules helped to reward the ball- winner, compared with the old holding the ball rules which favoured the tackler. Many pundits had been worried that throw-passing would lead to a reduction in long kicking and high marking, but noted that in practice, throw- passes were seldom over a distance greater than ten yards, and long kicking remained prominent. VFL champion player and coach Dan Minogue lauded the boundary throw-in rule as encouraging more contested football near the boundary line, rather than seeing players content to watch the ball roll out of bounds knowing that they would receive a free kick. Port Adelaide secretary Charles Hayter commented that by encouraging more play along the boundary lines, the rules brought the action closer to the spectators. Several players liked that the reduced number of scrimmages would reduce the risk of injury, and a reduction in rough play and thuggery was noted. Not all were convinced about the merits of the rules, particularly the throw-pass, after seeing them in action. Many were still concerned that over time the ease of throwing the ball would reduce long kicking and high marking. Champion North Adelaide full- forward Ken Farmer feared that in the extreme case it could result in a game played by seventeen basketballers and a full-forward. Several observers thought the rule made the game too easy, and while that catered well to VFA players, the higher standard of players in the top state leagues could be equally effective with a traditional handpass or flick-pass as they could be with a throw-pass. South Australian sportswriter Steve McKee feared that allowing the throw-pass would rob the game of its individuality, which could affect its ability to compete with and distinguish itself from rival sports in the long term; and that the game would become dominated by smaller, faster players, making it impossible for larger or slower players to have a successful top level career. Wilmot lamented that the agility and evasion displayed by VFL players to avoid tackles was largely absent from the VFA code, with players instead able to execute a simple throw to avoid a tackle. Some observers saw the reduction in rough play as a disadvantage of the new code rather than an advantage, dismissing the VFA code as a \\"sissy\\" version of Australian rules football. A statistical analysis of the 1938 VFA Grand Final between Brunswick and Brighton was published and compared with the averages from ten VFL matches around the same time to illustrate the effect that the rule changes had on making the game more non-stop. It confirmed that the number of kicks had remained steady or even increased as a result of the changes, with a total of 650 kicks and 173 marks recorded in the VFA Grand Final compared with an average of 596 kicks and 160 marks in the VFL matches. It also showed that the ability to throw the ball had more than doubled the use of handpassing, with a total of 160 throw-passes recorded in the VFA Grand Final compared with only 76 handpasses in the VFL games; this extent of handpassing was unheard of under the ANFC rules, and it was not until the 1979 VFL season more than four decades later that VFL matches would average so many handpasses per game. There were only six ball-ups in the VFA Grand Final, and 38 boundary throw-ins. The average score per team per game increased by almost three goals, from 84.7 to 100.5, in the first season under throw-pass rules. Crowds at VFA games enjoyed a substantial increase under throw-pass rules. Across the first ten rounds of 1938, the average attendance at VFA games was 3,600, compared with 2,400 for the corresponding rounds in 1937. Another 22% increase in crowds was enjoyed in 1939, and club memberships likewise increased. The VFA took advantage of this new found interest by extending the season from sixteen games to twenty in 1939, moving the Grand Final to the Saturday after the VFL Grand Final and securing the Melbourne Cricket Ground as its venue; with a larger venue and no VFL counter-attraction, the 1939 VFA Grand Final between Brunswick and Williamstown attracted the all-time VFA record attendance of 47,098, despite drizzly weather. Many clubs enjoyed record home crowds over the next few years. Despite the increased crowds, overall attendances were still only about a quarter of those attracted by the VFL, which averaged between 15,000 and 16,000 to home-and-away games in 1938 and 1939. Response of other competitions The new rules generated the interest of other competitions, and to promote its new code, VFA teams played exhibition matches, including in Geelong, Camperdown and Frankston. An important match between Camberwell and a composite team of the South Australian Amateur Football League (which usually played League rules) was played in August 1938 at the Adelaide Oval to give South Australian officials the opportunity to see the new rules in action. Several small competitions in Victoria, usually the secondary competitions in their district, followed the VFA's lead and adopted the throw-pass rules for the 1938 season, even before seeing them in action: these included the Sale District Football Association, the VFA Sub-Districts Association, and the Bendigo Football Association. Interest in the new code spread, and by 1939 the Bairnsdale and Bruthen District League and the Hume Highway Football Association had adopted the rules. The Yallourn District Amateur Association had adopted the rules by 1941. Many other leagues held votes to determine whether or not to switch codes. More significantly, many of Victoria's schools associations also adopted the VFA's rules over its first few years, giving the new code a strong development ground for the future: the Secondary Schools adopted them in 1938, the Technical Schools adopted them in 1939 and the Public Schools adopted them in 1940. The new rules also gained penetration in Tasmania, particularly in North West Tasmania. Tasmanian administrators had long advocated introducing throwing the ball, having unsuccessfully raised the motion at several ANFC meetings since 1911, so that there was interest in the new code in Tasmania was natural. The first competition there to adopt them was the North Western Football Association, the second-tier competition on Tasmania's north-western coast, which adopted the rules halfway through the 1938 season. It was a boon to the NWFA, and in 1939 its size increased from five clubs to nine. The smaller nearby Wilmot and Chudleigh Football Associations also adopted the new rules, and a motion in 1940 to adopt the rules in the Darwin Football Association, also based in North West Tasmania, failed by a single vote. However, North West Tasmania's preeminent senior competition, the North West Football Union, remained loyal to the national code. In October 1938, the ANFC met and discussed whether or not to alter the national rules to incorporate the VFA's changes. The motion to legalise the throw-pass nationally was once again raised by Tasmania, but it again lapsed after no other state would second it. The delegates from New South Wales and Canberra were concerned that the change would make the game unable to distinguish itself from the rival rugby codes which were popular in their regions; and Victoria and Western Australia were strongly opposed, believing it would take the difficulty and skill out of the game; South Australia, which had expressed favour for the throw-pass, also declined to second the motion, preferring to see the rule in action in the VFA for at least another year before making a commitment. At the same conference in October 1938, the ANFC agreed to adopt two of the VFA's other key rules which had a significant effect on gameplay: altering the holding the ball rule to eliminate the provision for a player to drop the ball when tackled; and re-introducing the boundary throw-in whenever the ball went out of bounds, except when put out deliberately. Both rule changes have become fundamental to modern Australian rules football: the modern holding the ball rule, as it applies to a player who has had an opportunity to dispose of the ball prior to being tackled, is practically unchanged from the 1939 interpretation; and other than the introduction in 1970 of a free kick for kicking out of bounds on the full, the boundary throw-in rule remains unchanged. The rules the VFA had introduced to curb rough or time-wasting play were not immediately adopted by the ANFC, but were adopted over the following decades. The ANFC adopted the downfield free kick into its rules in 1945, and it adopted the fifteen-yard penalty for time-wasting or cribbing over the mark in 1954; both rules remain part of modern football, except that the distance of the fifteen-yard penalty was extended to fifty metres in 1988. Effect on full forwards The change to the out of bounds rule in the national code is often considered to have brought an end to the era of dominant full-forwards which had existed during the 1930s: century goalkickers such as Gordon Coventry and Bob Pratt in the VFL, Frank Seymour in the VFA, Ken Farmer in South Australia and George Doig in Western Australia had been common during the 1930s, but were decidedly less common over the next thirty years, generally put down to the fact that play could be more safely directed along the boundary lines, bringing the forward pockets and half forward flankers into play and resulting in a wider spread of goalkickers. In spite of this, the four VFA seasons played between 1939 and 1945 under throw-pass rules featured some of the most dominant goalkicking displays by full forwards in the game's history. George Hawkins (Prahran) won the 1939 goalkicking title with 164 goals; Ted Freyer (Port Melbourne) won the 1940 title with 157 goals; Bob Pratt (Coburg) won the 1941 title with 183 goals; and Ron Todd (Williamstown) won the 1945 title with 188 goals – all of which exceeded the then-record of 152 goals set under national rules by George Doig in 1934. Many other high totals were recorded in those four seasons. Sportswriters noted that Freyer's dominance in 1940 came from Port Melbourne adopting a straight- down-the-middle style of play in spite of changed boundary rules, but it was surmised that the sheer skill of those particular forwards playing in the much lower standard VFA teams, particularly the war-weakened teams from 1940 until 1945, was a major contributor to their dominance. These historic goalkicking feats were confined to those four seasons; outside that period, the most goals scored in a VFA season during the throw-pass era was 114, by Todd in 1946. Player transfers Permit reciprocity Within any given football competition, a player wishing to switch to a new club was required to obtain a clearance from his old club and a permit from the league's permit committee; the competition could enforce these transfer rules by issuing fines to or docking premiership points from clubs who fielded players without a valid clearance. However, these rules were inherently enforceable only within the same competition; to make a permit and clearance system enforceable between different competitions, separate legal agreements were needed between them under which each competition agreed to penalise its own clubs if they fielded players from the other competition without a clearance. Amongst the major state leagues, the ANFC provided a framework for permit reciprocity agreements as a condition of affiliation; but, since the VFA was not ANFC-affiliated, a separate agreement was needed between the VFA and VFL if clearances were to be recognised between them. Permit reciprocity was not always in the best interests of both competitions, and so such agreements had existed on-and-off between them for the previous few decades: one such agreement lasted from 1913 until 1918; the next was signed in 1923, and was broken in early 1925 as part of the competitions' 1925 expansions; and the agreement that was current at the start of the schism had been signed in 1931. The 1931 agreement was more extensive than simply covering permit reciprocity; it was intended to foster co-operation between the two competitions, and provide somewhat unified control of football in Victoria. Termination of the agreement On 15 November 1937, the VFA voted to end the 1931 agreement. The VFA recognised that it would be impractical to maintain a unified control agreement if it were playing under such different rules. The VFA had also grown frustrated with what it saw as a lack of assistance from the VFL, particularly as the VFA had been struggling in 1936 and 1937, when it felt that the agreement compelled the VFL to make its best endeavours to help – although the VFL, in its defence, was having its own difficulties at the same time. Overall, the VFA felt that it would be better able to manage its own interests if not bound by the agreement. With the agreement terminated, clubs now had the freedom to recruit players from the VFL to the VFA, and vice versa, without clearances and would have no fear of legal recourse. The situation was different for players. A player who crossed without a clearance was in breach of his contract with his original league, as the contract prohibited playing in any other football competition in Victoria without a clearance; this clause was valid regardless of whether or not a permit reciprocity agreement existed between those competitions. Both the VFA and the VFL gave three-year suspensions to any of their players who crossed to their rival without a clearance, but these suspensions were valid only in the original competition and did not prevent the player from playing and earning money at his new club. In practice, this meant that a player could switch competitions freely, but that as long as the schism persisted it would almost certainly be a permanent switch, as his suspension would prevent him from returning unless he stood out of all football for three years. The VFL considered its legal options to seek further injunctions against players who crossed to the VFA without a clearance; but it was not certain that the relevant clause in the contract would hold up in court, and decided not to proceed with legal action. Although players were permitted to cross without a clearance, not all transfers occurred in this manner, particularly in the first years of the schism; nevertheless, the changes gave players a stronger bargaining chip in negotiations. If a player demonstrated a willingness to accept a VFL suspension by crossing to the VFA without a clearance, then it was in his VFL club's best interests to grant the clearance in the hope that he might later return, rather than allow him to take a suspension which would prevent that from occurring. Not all clubs followed this pragmatic approach: South Melbourne, for example, made a point of refusing clearances to players unless they had given the club ten years of service, and it consequently lost many players without clearances. Many players still sought clearances, as they were keen to keep their options to return to the VFL open, and some turned down big VFA offers if their clearances weren't granted; Jack Dyer, for example, was denied a clearance to Yarraville in 1940, and he opted not to cross without a clearance because he harboured ambitions to return to be playing-coach of . There could be lucrative financial incentives for star players to cross from the VFL to the VFA. VFL payment laws (known as \\"the Coulter Laws\\") were very prescriptive, limiting match payments to £4 per match; and prohibiting the payment of lump sums either as inducements for players, or to their clubs to secure clearances. The VFA had no such limitations. Additionally, some clubs, such as Collingwood, had strict internal policies to pay all players equally, making it impossible for star VFL players to negotiate for higher pay even within the limitations of the Coulter Laws. This meant that VFA clubs had the ability to recruit a small number of the VFL's best players by offering much more than they could or would be offered in the VFL, and it was this which drew some of the game's star players to the new code. The end of the agreement also gave VFA players the freedom to cross to the VFL. A capable rank-and-file player would earn more in base player payments under the Coulter Laws than he would earn in the VFA, if he could command a regular senior place in the VFL. However, players who switched without a clearance risked being stuck in the VFL seconds with no ability to return to the VFA seniors if they weren't good enough for regular senior selection. Andy Angwin was the first player to transfer to the VFL without a clearance, switching from Port Melbourne to in 1938. Notable League players to switch codes The VFA's new code gained significant publicity and credibility when it was able to convince VFL players, including some of the best players of the era and even some club captains, to defect. There were four particularly significant transfers involving superstar players: *Laurie Nash ( to Camberwell in 1938): Nash was the first VFL player to announce that he would switch for big money without a clearance, doing so at the start of 1938 for £8 per week, double the payments allowed by the Coulter Laws; also a former Test cricketer and star fast bowler at district level, Nash earned £3 per week during summer to play sub-district cricket for Camberwell as part of the deal, at a time when no player would have been paid such a sum to play cricket at such a low level.\\"Naughty Nash\\", The Canberra Times, 4 April 1938. An enormous recruiting coup for the VFA, Nash was a dominant key-position player at both ends of the ground, and many observers and opponents at the time considered him the greatest footballer of his era. Aged 27 when he transferred, Nash was still in the prime of his career. He played with Camberwell for four seasons from 1938 until 1941; he finished second in both the Recorder Cup and V.F.A. Medal in 1939, and across his career with Camberwell kicked 418 goals in 74 games, including 141 goals in 1940. *Bob Pratt ( to Coburg in 1940): Pratt was one of the VFL's dominant and most spectacular marking full-forwards of the early 1930s, and was considered the best full-forward of his time by many of his contemporaries.Jack Regan Retires: Praises Star Forward, Army News, (29 January 1942), p.8.Taylor, P. \\"Pratt was the Greatest Goal-Kicker\\", The Argus, (13 July 1950), p.13. As of 2015 he still jointly holds the record for most goals in a VFL season (150 goals in 1934), and he was one of the inaugural legends of the Australian Football Hall of Fame. Pratt walked out on South Melbourne at the end of 1939; he sought a clearance to VFL club in 1940, and when it was refused he transferred to Coburg without a clearance. Aged 27 at the time of his transfer, he played at Coburg for two seasons until the war. He played 40 games and kicked 263 goals for Coburg, and led the VFA with a then-record 183 goals in the 1941 season. *Ron Todd ( to Williamstown in 1940): Todd had established himself as Collingwood's full-forward at the age of 22 in 1938 after the retirement of long-time full forward Gordon Coventry, and he was VFL's leading goalkicker in 1938 and 1939, kicking 120 and 121 goals respectively. A spectacular aerialist with a strong lead, and accurate with both snap shots and long set shots for goal, Todd was an exciting drawcard for Collingwood. Laurie Nash and Dick Reynolds both rated Todd as second only to Pratt as the greatest full forwards they had ever seen. He signed with Williamstown at the start of 1940 and crossed without a clearance; at the age of 23, he was the highest-paid footballer in Australia, earning a reported £500 flat and £5 per week for a three-year deal, more than ten times his wage at Collingwood. Todd became a significant drawcard for Williamstown, drawing ground record crowds and a substantial increase in memberships for the club. He played the remainder of his career with Williamstown until his retirement at the end of 1949. He kicked 672 goals for Williamstown in 141 matches, and kicked an all-time VFA season record 188 goals in the 1945 season. His departure from Collingwood was the most acrimonious transfer of the throw-pass era, severely damaging his legacy and reputation at the club for more than sixty years. *Des Fothergill ( to Williamstown in 1941). A young goalkicking midfielder and half-forward, Fothergill had been a joint winner of the VFL's Brownlow Medal in 1940, polling a then-record 32 votes. Aged only 20, he crossed to Williamstown without a clearance at the beginning of 1941, and dominated the competition, winning the Recorder Cup and VFA Medal with 62 votes – a record number of votes which was never broken in Division 1. Fothergill had signed with Williamstown until the end of 1944, but due to the war played there only in 1941. Other notable VFL players to switch to the VFA, with or without clearances, were: *Harry Vallence ( to Williamstown in 1939). Vallence played with Carlton for more than a decade and kicked 722 career goals, which stood as a club record until the 1990s. He first sought a clearance to serve as playing coach of Williamstown at the start of 1938, having been offered double what he could have earned under the Coulter Laws, but Carlton refused to clear him and Vallence opted to stay for another year. He obtained a clearance the following year. Aged 33 when he transferred, Vallence was still a strong player, was Williamstown's leading goalkicker from full forward for the following three years, and kicked 337 goals in 61 games. The presence of Vallence at full forward and Todd at centre half-forward in the same Williamstown team was a huge drawcard for the club in 1940 and 1941. Vallence played for Brighton after the war. *Ted Freyer ( to Port Melbourne in 1938) – a forward pocket for Essendon, Freyer had played 124 games and kicked 372 goals for Essendon. He crossed to Port Melbourne without a clearance, and was the first player to formally receive his VFA permit without a VFL clearance (Nash had been the first player to announce his move, but Freyer was the first to have it formalised). He was Port Melbourne's dominant forward for the next four years, kicking 484 goals in 84 games, and twice winning the VFA goalkicking. *Tommy Lahiff ( to Port Melbourne in 1938) – Lahiff had played for Port Melbourne from 1930 to 1934, then played for Essendon for three years. He was appointed Port Melbourne playing coach in 1938, and was granted a clearance after indicating he would cross whether the clearance was granted or not. *Jack Titus ( to Coburg in 1945) – Titus kicked 970 goals over eighteen seasons as a small forward at Richmond. At age 37, he was cleared to Coburg, where he played two seasons and kicked 119 goals. *Terry Brain ( to Camberwell in 1938) – a ten-year rover for South Melbourne during its successful period in the 1930s, Brain had initially retired at the end of 1937, but then decided to play for Camberwell in 1938. Brain was cleared by South Melbourne. *Geoff Mahon ( to Prahran in 1941) – a ruckman who had played 69 games in five seasons for Geelong, Mahon crossed to Prahran without a clearance in 1941. *Herbie Matthews ( to Oakleigh in 1946) – a follower who had played fourteen seasons with South Melbourne and tied with Des Fothergill for the 1940 Brownlow Medal. Matthews was cleared to Oakleigh as playing coach at age 32 in 1946 and served there for two seasons. *Gordon Ogden ( to Williamstown in 1939) – a ten-year back pocket for Melbourne who had spent 1938 in the country, Ogden was cleared to Williamstown as captain-coach in 1939 and served in the position until 1941. *Bill Faul ( to Prahran in 1939) – seven-year half-backman who had finished second in the 1932 Brownlow Medal, Faul crossed to Prahran as captain-coach without a clearance in 1939. He went on to coach a then-record 313 senior VFA games with Prahran, Northcote and Moorabbin. *Austin Robertson, Sr. (/Perth to Port Melbourne in 1940) – an thirteen-year senior key position player for , West Perth and Perth, Robertson had been located in Western Australia with his employer since 1937. Upon his return to Victoria, it was expected that he would return to South Melbourne, to which he was still bound; but instead he signed with Port Melbourne for a reported £6 per week, and crossed without a clearance from South Melbourne. *Alby Morrison ( to Preston in 1939) – an eleven-year half-forward, third in the 1938 Brownlow Medal and, at the time, Footscray's leading VFL career goalkicker with 345 goals, Morrison went to Preston as playing coach with a clearance in 1939. Morrison served there for two years before returning to Footscray in 1941. *Allan Everett ( to Preston in 1941) – Geelong's captain in 1940, Everett crossed to Preston in 1941 without a clearance. *Albert Collier ( to Camberwell in 1945) – the 1929 Brownlow Medallist and 1931 Leitch Medallist and six-time VFL premiership player with Collingwood, Collier was cleared to Camberwell as captain-coach at age 35 upon the VFA's post-war resumption in 1945. He led the club for two years, and took it to its most successful season in 1946 with a minor premiership and Grand Final appearance. *Harry Collier ( seconds to Camberwell in 1947) – brother of Albert, retrospective winner of the 1930 Brownlow Medal and also a six-time premiership player with Collingwood, Collier joined Camberwell as captain- coach at age 40 in mid-1947, spending only the remainder of that season with the club. *Jim Bohan ( to Camberwell in 1947) – after nine years at Hawthorn, where he represented Victoria and served as club captain for two years including in 1946, Bohan crossed to Camberwell without a clearance in 1947 and played there for seven years. *Jack Blackman ( to Preston in 1947) – a centre half-back and Hawthorn's vice-captain in 1946, Blackman crossed to Preston as captain-coach without a clearance in 1947, and went on to win the J. J. Liston Trophy in 1949. Nash, Pratt, Todd, Fothergill, Vallence, Titus, Matthews, both Collier brothers, and Roy Cazaly (who played a few games for Camberwell at age 48 while he was there as coach in 1941) are all inductees in the Australian Football Hall of Fame, with Pratt and Cazaly recognised in the Legend category. Only in Todd's case is his VFA career acknowledged in his citation. Effect of World War II Although World War II began in September 1939, its impact on football was not substantially felt until 1942, when most suburban and country leagues went into recess. The VFL and VFA both intended to continue operating into the 1942 season; but on 20 April, only a couple of weeks out from the opening round, the VFA decided to cancel the season, citing the unavailability of grounds (many were being used to support the war effort), the lack of players due to enlistments, and the lack of committeemen due to the increased workload required to support the war effort. The 1943 and 1944 seasons were also cancelled, resulting in a three-year hiatus from competition. The VFA's committee continued to operate in an administrative capacity during this time. The VFL continued to stage its premiership uninterrupted throughout the war, with the only exception being that was unable to compete in 1942 and 1943 due to travel restrictions. All of the smaller competitions which had adopted the VFA's rules were also in recess, so League rules was now the only form of Australian rules football being played in Australia, putting an abrupt halt to the growth of the VFA code after only four years. With the VFA in recess, many VFA players sought to play in the VFL. Although there was still no long-term reciprocal clearance agreement between the bodies, the VFA and VFL agreed to a system of temporary clearances to last during the war, whereby any players cleared by the VFA to the VFL would be required to return to VFA when it reformed; the VFA granted around 200 temporary clearances under this agreement. However, players who had been disqualified from the VFL for crossing to the VFA without a clearance before the war remained ineligible to cross back to the VFL during the war; Todd, Fothergill and Wilson all made appeals to have their VFL disqualifications overturned in 1943, but their appeals were dismissed. Resumption after the war The VFA resumed competition under the throw-pass rules in 1945. In accordance with their wartime agreement, VFL permits for VFA players were revoked; however, as there was no other reciprocal clearance agreement between the bodies, there was nothing to prevent the VFL from immediately issuing new permits to those same players if they wished to remain in the VFL and were willing incur a suspension from the VFA. Both the VFA and the VFL increased their suspensions for players who switched competition without a clearance from three years to five years. Additionally, the VFA lost many of the star pre-war recruits it had secured without clearances back to the VFL. Under the terms of their suspensions from the VFL, the players were required to stand out of all football, not just VFL football, for three years before their VFL suspensions could be lifted. Had there been no war interruption, it is unlikely that any suspended players would ever have met this qualification; but with the VFA in recess for three years, all such players were now eligible to return to the VFL. One stumbling block to this was the VFL's treatment of games arranged within the armed services during the war: in 1943, the VFL had ruled that such games were considered competitive, and therefore a player who had played in a services game was deemed not to have stood out of football during the war; but this ruling was overturned in March 1945, which on the eve of the season made around forty players who had played only in services matches suddenly eligible to return to their original VFL clubs. After the war-time hiatus, the VFA clubs had less money to offer star players, and so many opted to take the opportunity to return to the VFL. Of the VFA's four superstar recruits, Nash, Fothergill and Pratt all returned to the VFL; Todd remained in the VFA for the rest of the throw-pass era. Other competitions which had played under the VFA rules before the war also resumed playing in 1945 or 1946, but some reverted to League rules, including the North Western Football Association, which had been the code's second-most prominent competition and its main foothold in Tasmania, and Victoria's public schools, a key development competition. This left the VFA with significantly reduced market penetration for its rules. The King Island Football Association, the small and remote league on the Bass Strait island of King Island, adopted the Association rules in 1946, but otherwise growth of the VFA code after the war was minimal. Final years of throw-pass football Between 1945 and 1949, the VFA continued to operate under throw-pass rules. Two notable rule changes were made in 1947: a free kick was introduced for \\"kicking in danger\\" – that is, kicking recklessly at the ball where there is a strong risk of kicking an opposing player in the process, even if no contact is made with the opposing player – and shepherding was banned in ruck contests. The VFA continued to court country leagues in an attempt to spread its code, and to that end staged exhibition matches in country Victoria and small interstate markets from 1945 until 1947, which included games in Broken Hill, Launceston, Bendigo, Hamilton, Echuca, Bairnsdale and Mooroopna. Games were not always supported by proponents of the ANFC code; the Tasmanian Australian National Football League, for example, petitioned the North Tasmanian Cricket Association not to stage its 1946 match between Williamstown and Coburg, fearing popularity could be gained by the rival code. Even though the Association code did not grow further, the VFA continued to enjoy local success. The VFA continued to draw the best crowds in its existence during the first few years after the war. A record home-and-away crowd of 21,000 was drawn to a June 1945 match between ladder-leaders Coburg and Williamstown. The average crowd in 1947 was 4,200, almost double the crowds from ten years earlier. Not all of this increase was attributed to the throw-pass rules: part is attributed to petrol rationing, which began during the war and continued until 1950, as it reduced the mobility of Melburnians, making it more difficult for suburban dwellers to attend VFL games or pursue other Saturday afternoon leisure activities. Organisationally, by the end of the 1940s the Association employed a full-time secretary and managed a players provident fund, none of which existed prior to the throw-pass era. By 1949, sportswriters commented that positional play had reduced and more players were now following the ball, resulting in crowded play and less speedy open play, which was countering the original intent of the throw pass. VFA crowds were beginning to wane, having dropped from 4,200 in 1947 to 3,380 in 1949, and the VFA's rules were gaining no further penetration into minor markets, nor support from the ANFC leagues. Some VFA club delegates felt that the throw-pass had outlived its novelty, and was no longer serving as an effective drawcard for the VFA. The 1949 Grand Final on Saturday 1 October was the final senior VFA game played under throw-pass rules: Williamstown 10.5 (65) defeated Oakleigh 8.14 (62) at the St Kilda Cricket Ground before a crowd of 40,000. Football control Control structure during the schism Having created a new code of football which was being adopted by other bodies, the VFA took on the role as the governing body and administrator for the throw-pass code. Leagues which adopted the rules split from their traditional governing bodies and entered affiliations with the VFA, paying an affiliation fee for the privilege. The NWFA, for example, ended its affiliation with the North Western Football Union in 1938 to enter an affiliation with the VFA; and competitions in country Victoria were forced to leave their governing body, the Victorian Country Football League, to affiliate directly with the VFA. In September 1946, the VFA was registered as an incorporated company, and it obtained a copyright of its code of rules. Despite the schism between the VFL and VFA, the two bodies still had a working relationship and collaborated on areas of mutual interest. For example, since 1934 the VFL and VFA had jointly sponsored and managed the Victorian Football Union, which was the administrative body for junior and suburban football leagues within metropolitan Melbourne, including managing permit and clearance arrangements; and the two bodies continued that arrangement despite the schism. With the VFA and VFL refusing to recognise each other's permits, playing under different codes of rules, actively promoting their own codes, and operating under different player payment structures, Australian rules football was enduring a schism analogous to the divide which existed for a century, and from an on-field perspective still exists, between the league and union codes of Rugby football. Desire for united control Even before the 1938 season began, the VFL, VFA and ANFC all recognised that operating under divided control and under substantially different codes of rules was not in the interests of Australian rules football as a whole. The lack of a united front made it difficult to effectively promote the game in New South Wales and Queensland – where rugby was more popular – or to defend Victoria from other football codes, particularly as the trafficking of players from one body by the other was undermining public opinion. It was also recognised that unifying control by allowing the VFL to use its size and influence to push the VFA out of the market altogether was not in the interests of football, as the VFA served the functions of promoting football in Melbourne's outer suburbs, and in occupying those suburbs' best quality grounds to keep other sports from using them. Even though it would almost certainly force it to give up the throw-pass which had driven its new popularity, the VFA was willing to negotiate towards a solution for unified control. The VFA and VFL began reunification discussions at the start of 1938, and negotiations were ongoing throughout the schism – including during the World War II years when the VFA executive committee remained active in negotiation despite the competition being in recess onfield. Proposals for united control Early negotiations, and in particular the negotiations which took place from 1944 until 1945, focussed on a scheme under which the VFL and VFA would amalgamate into a single competition. The VFA stated on several occasions that it was prepared to \\"sink its identity\\" into the VFL if its clubs were given the opportunity to contest the Victorian senior premiership. However, the two bodies never agreed to terms, with a number of sticking points preventing a compromise: * Competition structure: the initial structure put forward by the VFA for an amalgamated competition in 1938 would have seen the establishment of two tiered divisions, with VFA to commence as a second division, and with promotion and relegation between them, such that the second division's top two clubs replaced the first division's bottom two clubs, but the VFL rejected the scheme; a 1940 scheme proposed likewise, with only one team promoted and relegated each year, but also proposing a further third division incorporating teams from other sub-district competitions. In 1944, the VFL offered a similar scheme in which the second division's top two clubs played off for promotion against the first division's bottom two clubs; but by this stage, the VFA favoured a system of complete amalgamation into a single league with a single premiership. *Zoning: a significant impediment to combining the competitions was the fact that VFL clubs had recruited players under a zoning/district scheme since 1915, whereas VFA clubs did not. Amalgamating the competitions would require significant re-alignment of zones to be agreed to by the VFL clubs; the VFL's zoning committee saw this as unachievable, particularly in places where VFA and VFL clubs were neighbouring, because VFL clubs had always been very protective of their zones. In 1945, the VFL proposed an amalgamation in which the VFA would serve as the second eighteens competition for the VFL, which would have been workable within the existing zoning system; but the VFA was not willing to take on an amalgamation in which its clubs were not granted senior status. *Grounds standard: most VFA grounds were well short of VFL standard, and unless there were significant and expensive upgrades by all of the councils in VFA territory, this would be a serious impediment for any VFA club promoted to the top division. *Financial considerations: the smaller VFA clubs had weaker financial means and lower fanbases than the VFL clubs. VFL clubs were concerned that an amalgamation would weaken their own financial position, by reducing gate takings at matches played against a former VFA opponent, and by spreading more thinly the league's annual dividends – indeed, this was a major motivation for the VFL's original secession from the VFA in 1897. *Rules: the VFA was keen to incorporate as many of its own rules into an amalgamated competition, but the VFL was bound by its affiliation with the ANFC to play under the national rules. Although at times the VFL and VFA executive committees made progress on negotiations, both bodies required constitutional changes to be ratified by a vote of their club delegates; even if the committees had agreed to an amalgamation, there is no guarantee that the clubs would have voted in favour. As an alternative to amalgamation, it was thought that a new single control council could be established to manage football in Victoria, which would answerable to the ANFC and which would comprise delegates from the VFL and VFA as well as schools and junior competitions. Another proposal, investigated in 1940, saw a VFL zoning sub- committee investigate a scheme to admit four to six of the VFA's twelve clubs; this scheme was reminiscent of the VFL's 1925 expansion, which would have seen the VFL admit the VFA's strongest clubs, leaving only the VFA's weaker clubs playing under the throw-pass code, which would have halted the new code's growth and possibly killed off the VFA altogether. Nothing came of either scheme. Control in Tasmania Although the Association's rules were played only by very small leagues in Tasmania after the war, they were still important in off-field control discussions during the late 1940s. Tasmania was represented on the ANFC by Hobart's Tasmanian Australian National Football League; but Launceston's Northern Tasmanian Football Association and the coastal North Western Football Union, which were leagues of similar standard, were dissatisfied with football being controlled from Hobart, and they sought to establish a statewide council to provide them with equal representation in control of football in Tasmania. The fact that the NTFA and NWFU had a feasible option of switching their affiliation to the VFA, underpinned by the fact that the throw-pass code had enjoyed pre-war success in the NWFA, was used by the two greater northern leagues leverage when negotiating with the TANFL for united control in the late 1940s. The northern leagues were ultimately unsuccessful in establishing a council, and did not follow through with their threat; the TANFL continued to serve as Tasmania's sole voice on the ANFC, although its relationship with the NTFA and NWFU improved in the early 1950s. Resolution Efforts to reunite control stagnated for a few years after 1945, but they were reinvigorated in 1948 by the ANFC. The ANFC had a revived enthusiasm for spreading Australian rules football to other parts of Australia and the world, as it saw a strong opportunity at that time to promote the game in the United States of America. The ANFC and many of its delegates considered it very important that the VFL–VFA schism be ended and the control of football be unified to achieve these aims. ANFC president Walter Stooke called in 1948 upon the old adage that \\"a house divided against itself is easiest upset\\" when describing the importance of reunification. One of the overarching aims of the VFA throughout its negotiation was that it wanted to be represented in the control and administration of the game, and it had rejected solutions under which the VFL retained unilateral control in Victoria. Under the new proposals put forward in 1948, the ANFC offered to grant the VFA a position on the ANFC executive. This new solution would force the VFA to adopt the national rules and permit reciprocity agreements, but would give the VFA the powers of control it desired, and allow it to remain independent from the VFL. The proposal was first put forward to the VFA in late 1948, and although it was initially rejected – largely because the VFA wanted a full voting position on the council, which was not offered – it began to herald the end of the schism. In March 1949, the VFA and VFL signed a new clearance reciprocity agreement, ending eleven seasons of player trafficking; and by the end of the season, both the VFA and VFL had agreed to lift any active suspensions which players had received for switching codes without a clearance. The ANFC and VFA continued to negotiate an affiliation agreement through the season, which included the ANFC offering the VFA a period of temporary trial affiliation to encourage it to join. Finally, on 8 August, the VFA agreed to affiliate with the ANFC, with the motion succeeding by a vote of 18–7 at the VFA Board of Management. Under the terms of the affiliation: *The VFA received a seat on the council, which had full rights except that it could not vote on council matters. The Association delegate had full rights to raise motions and put forward its views relating to other motions – privileges which were not enjoyed by any other affiliated non-voting member of the ANFC. *The VFA would need to abandon its own rules, including the throw-pass, and play under ANFC rules. *The VFA would be beholden to the ANFC's reciprocal transfer agreements with interstate leagues. *The VFA could send a representative team to play in interstate carnivals and other sanctioned interstate games, meaning that Victoria would be represented by separate VFL and VFA teams in these interstate competitions. *The VFA would share the benefits of ANFC programs such as advertising, development programs, etc. *As it had no vote, the VFA was not initially required to pay a levy to the ANFC. The VFA began its affiliation and began playing under ANFC rules from the 1950 season, bringing an end to the schism. It began paying levies and contributing to ANFC funds from 1951. It still wanted a full voting position on the ANFC, but it could not initially be granted due to a stipulation in the ANFC constitution that no state could have more than one vote; it began agitating for the necessary change to the constitution, and was finally granted the vote in July 1953. This gave the VFA a formal say in the control and administration of Australian football at the national level, and made Victoria the only state represented by two delegates on the council. Aftermath After taking on the national rules, support of the VFA declined steadily throughout the 1950s. Although the VFA had always been of a lower standard than the VFL, the throw-pass had given it a notable point of distinction which it could use to attract fans in spite of that; without that, the VFA was firmly viewed as Victoria's second-rate competition. At the same time, the end of petrol rationing in 1950 and increased affordability of motor cars during the 1950s freed up suburban dwellers for other activities, or to attend VFL matches, on Saturday afternoons, and the introduction of television to Australia in the late 1950s affected attendances at the social nights which were vital for VFA clubs' finances at the time. Within only a few years, weak clubs such as Northcote, Camberwell and Brighton struggled to the point of being unable to pay their players; even a club like Williamstown, which had strong community links and won five premierships in six years between 1954 and 1959, saw its adult membership drop from 1562 to only 416 between 1950 and 1960. It was not until the 1960s, when the VFA expanded into the growing outer suburbs and began playing games on Sundays that it began to re-establish itself as a competitive part of Melbourne's football culture. In 1951, as crowds dropped, the VFA tried to reintroduce the throw-pass rule. It put a motion to the ANFC to either change the national rules to allow throwing the ball, or to allow it as a \\"domestic rule\\", i.e. a rule which was permitted within the national rules, but on which individual leagues had discretion. The motion was rejected by a 7–1 majority, with only Tasmania supporting it and the VFA not yet having the right to vote. Some VFA clubs wanted to break away from the ANFC to allow the throw-pass to be reintroduced, but this never gained majority support. The VFA remained affiliated with the ANFC until March 1970. Its relationship with the ANFC began to strain in 1965, when the VFA stopped recognising its 1949 permit reciprocity agreement with the VFL. Clearance disputes, particularly related to transfer fees, between the VFA and VFL persisted over the next five years, before finally the VFA was expelled in 1970 for refusing to submit to an ANFC ultimatum to establish and recognise a new permit agreement. It did not re- introduce the throw-pass after its expulsion from the ANFC.

The plot revolves around the extent to which education system in India holds practically among students, and that the revision of curriculum is obligatory for a healthy teacher-student connect, accentuating the argument that students should lead discerning and forbearing lives rather than being coerced to study only to acquire a degree. It stars Kishore in the lead role as Vascodigama, a Kannada lecturer emphasizing his students on the above point; and Parvathy Nair as Shanthi, an English lecturer in the same college, in the lead roles. Ashwin Vijaykumar and Suchendra Prasad feature in supporting roles. Ashwin Vijaykumar also produced the film under his production house Ashwin Creations. The cinematography was done by Karm Chawla, and was edited by Srikanth. The soundtrack was composed by Poornachandra Tejaswi, who collaborated with B. Ajaneesh Loknath to score the background music. The film was released on 23 October 2015 to positive reviews from critics, who acclaimed the theme of the film and the acting performance of Kishore. Cast * Kishore as Vasu D.

The Times of India carried a report that Komal was cast to play the role of a college lecturer and the film would be a comedy, carrying \\"a deeper message on the importance of education\\". Ashwin Vijaykumar, then recently graduated with an MBA degree, told Bangalore Mirror of his plans of having wanted to enter cinema for two years which materialized with Vascodigama. He produced the film also appearing in a supporting role as a student. Kishore was cast in Komal's place as the male lead and Parvathy Nair, who had previously appeared in a Kannada film Story Kathe (2013), was cast opposite him as the female lead. Filming was done extensively in Sullia, in the Dakshina Kannada region of Karnataka for 95 days, before completion in March 2015. It was reported in July 2015 that a dancer Ajisha Shah, who had hitherto appeared in an item number in the 2014 Hindi film Happy New Year, filmed with Vascodigama for a dance sequence at Rockline Studio in Bangalore. Niranjan, who is well known for his role as Thiruna on the Tamil serial, Azhagu (TV series) makes his debut in this film. Soundtrack Poornachandra Tejaswi composed the film's soundtrack and B.

It was released officially on 9 April 2015 in Bangalore. Critical reception Upon theatrical release, the film received positive to mixed reviews from critics. They applauded the theme of the film and the acting performance of Kishore, and criticized the \\"over-the-top\\" features of his character. Reviewing the film for The New Indian Express, A. Sharadhaa wrote, \\"A not so often-told tale on education gets a good rendering here. It’s also an example of how comedy can be an effective medium in raising awareness about education.\\" and added, \\"Vascodigama might elicit some mixed reactions. Whether or not they agree with Madhuchandra’s point of view, this film, which also explores the rewards and challenges that come with a lecturer’s position, is sure to get parents and students thinking.\\" She concluded writing praises of the acting performances and cinematography. Shyam Prasad S. of Bangalore Mirror rated the film three out of five, drew comparisons to the 2009 Hindi film 3 Idiots, and wrote, \\"Unlike its message that asks students to spread their wings, the film confines itself to a restricted visual range.\\" Commending on the acting performance of Kishore, he concluded writing, \\"The director manages to 'tell' his ideas but all the emotions that needed to be conveyed as part of the package are missing.\\" Shashiprasad S.

In fact, during this period Syria did not exist, it was Northern Region of the UAR. Political parties were dissolved. Communists were the first to be purged. The Ba’ath Party, despite being the champions of unity and the most natural political allies of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, was also removed from the positions of influence during 1959-1960. Syrian officers felt threatened in their previously secure positions. Hundreds of Syrian officers were either posted in far-away Egypt or sent into retirement. In their place came Egyptian administrators and officers. Syria was ruled by the secret police of Abdel Hamid al-Sarraj. Economy During the first months of 1961 state control over the Syrian economy was greatly increased. The governor of the Central Bank of Syria resigned at the end of January, warning about the dangers of nationalization and planned currency unification (Egypt and Syria still had their own currencies). On February 5 currency control was introduced, all foreign currency deposits were frozen, and the export of currency over 100 Syrian piasters from Syria was prohibited. The official goal was to increase currency reserves and to prevent the flight of capital, in reality just the opposite occurred as capital started to flee the country. On February 10 existing import licenses were revoked and importers had to reapply for new ones. On March 4 all banks had to become joint stock companies owned by UAR Arab citizens. Of the 16 banks operating in Syria at this time, 6 were UAR- Arab owned, 6 were owned by non-UAR Arabs and 7 were owned by non-Arabs. From February 20 until March 8 1961, Nasser was on his fifth and final visit in Syria, where he made speeches denouncing liberal economy and promoting a more socialist, state controlled model. He also promised that more factories and industrial infrastructure would be developed in the still largely agricultural country. In early July government seized grain from storage and announced increased import of cattle in order to meet food and meat shortages that were caused by severe drought that had plagued Syria for three years. In July 1961 Nasser announced his Second (Social) revolution by promoting a number of laws that nationalized most of the industries, toughened the agrarian reform, introduced employee management participation and profit sharing rights. As usual for Nasser, these laws were not discussed beforehand. Syrian elites were united in the realization that they were about to lose everything. This was coupled with the increasing dissatisfaction among army officers. Regional government abolished On August 16 the Northern Executive council, the regional government of Syria since 1958, was abolished and all executive power was concentrated in Cairo. Syrian executives were transferred to Cairo and given positions of in the unified government. On August 30 the Northern Region was divided in 11 governorates with governors appointed by Nasser and accountable to the Minister of the Interior. Syria had become just another Egyptian province. Sarraj crisis Abdel Hamid al-Sarraj was the last Syrian with real power in Syria. He was President of the Northern Executive Council, Secretary General of the local branch of the ruling National Union, Syrian Minister of Interior and the long-time head of the secret police. Already in June 1961 Nasser had told Sarraj about his plan to liquidate the local administration. As a way of removing him from the power, on August 17, 1961 Sarraj was made one of UAR's Vice Presidents with responsibility over internal affairs and moved to Cairo. On August 13 Nasser sent his confidant Abdel Hakim Amer (in the role of Inspector General) to take control in Damascus. On August 26 Amer and Sarraj both went to Cairo for a government meeting. On September 15 Sarraj returned to Damascus, and on September 16 he convened a meeting of Northern region's National Union Executive committee meeting. On September 16 Amer announced that Sarraj no longer had authority to convene such meetings to which Sarraj replied that as an elected Secretary General of the regional National Union he remained in power until the next Secretary General was elected. The National Union at that time was the UAR's ruling party and, at least in theory, had control over the government. To eliminate this conflict, on September 18 Nasser ordered the merger of Egyptian and Syrian National union branches. A struggle over Sarraj's power base, the secret police, started. During September 16–17 Amer ordered the dismissal or arrest of leading security officers. On September 17 Amer published a decree prohibiting the arrest of any person without a warrant from the Attorney General. This curbed the freedom of the secret services to arrest anyone at will. At the same time, it was decided to unite the Egyptian and Syrian security services, bringing them under Cairo's control. Amer also tried to rebuild positive contacts with Ba’ath politicians, including Salah ad-Din al-Bitar, who were enemies of Sarraj but supporters of Nasser's socialism, by awarding pensions to the former Ba’ath ministers on September 17. The struggle between Amer and Sarraj had caused further consolidation of all power structures in the hands of Cairo. As the week progressed, some underground parties started street demonstrations against increased Egyptian control and the army was brought out to guard key buildings in Damascus. On September 20, 1961 Sarraj and Amir went to Cairo for a crisis meeting with Nasser. Sarraj was expected to continue in his duties, but on September 26 he submitted his resignation from all posts. Nasser ordered Amir to return to Damascus immediately. During this tumultuous time amongst the UAR leadership, the coup plotters were able to plan and launch their coup unnoticed. The coup At 4am on September 28 an armoured column under the command of Lt-Colonel Abd al-Karim al-Nahlawi, the chief of Amir's bureau in Syria and Desert Guard units under the command of Lt-Colonel Haydar al-Kuzbari entered Damascus and met with the troops of the Damascus garrison and air force. Army HQ, the radio station and airport were seized, checkpoints established and tanks patrolled the streets. The Syrian Army's commanding officers and Amir were arrested. Sarraj was placed under house arrest. Just before his arrest at 4am, Amir had time to order Egyptian Major General Anwar al-Qadi to move a Field Artillery brigade from its base 40 km away from Damascus to the city and to suppress the uprising. While the Egyptian officers, ignoring Syrian complaints, dutifully obeyed the order, en route to Damascus these troops were met by their Syrian commanding officer who ordered them back to the base and arrested all the Egyptian officers. At 7:25am Damascus radio broadcast communique #1 of the Supreme Arab Revolutionary Command of the Armed Forces (SARCAF) in which they announced that army has taken steps to remove corruption and tyranny and to restore the legitimate rights of the people. Communique #2 was more political and listed complaints against “the oppressive, corrupt clique” that had discredited the union between the Arab peoples. Socialist laws that had been introduced in July and plans to purge Syrian officers were also criticized. Communique #3 announced that SARCAF was in full control and asked to treat all Egyptians with care. Communique # 4 announced the closure of all airports and harbours. While SARCAF at this time did not announce the break-up of UAR or secession from it, most Syrians had had enough of the Egyptian dictatorship and despite the never ending professions towards the goal of Arab unity, they were happy to regain their traditional freedoms. At 9:07am Nasser took the unusual step of responding to the rebellion via live radio broadcast. He announced that he would not dissolve the UAR (this was to be done by Anwar Sadat in 1971), that the rebellion in Damascus was small scale and that he had given orders to the Syrian army to suppress it. Meanwhile, Amer, along with other arrested Syrian army commanders and ministers spent the day negotiating with the rebels. Amer was certain that the UAR could be saved by meeting the rebel demands for greater local autonomy, softening the July laws and through agrarian reform. It is still unclear if Amer was sincere during these negotiations or was simply playing for time and awaiting Egyptian troops. Amer was allowed to get in touch with Nasser via shortwave radio and to get his approval for this agreement. On this conciliatory note, SARCAF communique #9 was broadcast at 1:26pm in which it was announced that SARCAF wanted to preserve Arab unity and that Amer had “made the necessary decisions to safeguard the unity of the armed forces of the United Arab Republic. The army matters had been restored to their normal course”. Radio Damascus once again identified itself as the “radio station of the UAR in Damascus”. While for a few hours it seemed that the UAR was saved, both sides were far from agreement. By early afternoon the rebels had received support from nearly all the Syrian army units and felt certain of victory. Nasser followed the logic of every autocrat and refused to negotiate with the rebels or to change his policies in Syria. At 5:20pm Amer and a group of Egyptian officers and loyalists were put on a plane to Cairo, this was announced in communique #12 at 5:45pm. At 6:55pm Nasser went on radio once again. He refused to negotiate and called on the armed forces to do their duty by crushing the rebels. In fact, at around 9:30am that morning, Nasser had ordered some Egyptian troops to Syria in an effort to suppress the rebellion. As Egypt and Syria shared no land border, airborne paratroopers and some seaborne troops were ordered to leave for Latakia and Aleppo, where army bases were still loyal to Nasser. However, a short time before the Egyptian forces reached these bases they were taken over by rebel troops. The fewer than 200 Egyptian paratroopers who landed in Latakia were surrounded by the rebel troops and later returned to Egypt. Nasser called off the whole operation. On November 2, 870 Egyptian officers and soldiers were sent home while 960 Syrians returned home peacefully from Egypt. Later in the evening of September 28, rebel radio announcements started attacking Nasser personally, calling him a tyrant. A curfew was imposed on Damascus from 7pm until 5:30am. If during the day it was unclear if rebels want greater freedom for Syria within UAR or restoration of total independence, when Radio Damascus ended its last broadcast for that day after midnight with the Syrian national anthem it was clear that they had chosen independence. Secessionist government period (September 29, 1961 – March 8, 1963) At 7:30am on September 29, Radio Damascus announced that SARCAF has entrusted Maamun al-Kuzbari (a relative of one of the coup organizers) to form a new government which consisted of the old National Party and People's Party politicians. It was government of the traditional Syrian elites, but it promised to maintain some of Nasser's progressive and socialist policies. On the same day Jordan and Turkey recognized the new regime.The Separatist period in Syria, 1961-1963 During that day, Major-General Abd al-Karim Zahreddine, a Druze, who was not involved in the planning of the coup, was appointed the army's commander-in-chief. He was a compromise figure and survived in the post until the March 8, 1963, coup. The restored republic kept the flag and anthem of the old Syrian Republic but changed its name the Syrian Arab Republic (to demonstrate its commitment to the Arab nationalist cause). In a speech on October 5 Nasser recognized the fact of Syrian secession and said that he would not block Syria's renewed membership in the UN and League of Arab States which Syria re- joined on October 29. However, this did not mean that Nasser was going to be friendly towards the new regime. The Egyptian-Syrian propaganda wars started in October with Egypt calling the Syrian politicians “capitalists, reactionaries and feudalists”. Instead of talking about the dictatorial nature of the UAR police state, the Syrians constantly had to respond by stating that they were not reactionaries, western agents and traitors against Arab unity. After SARCAF appointed Zahr as-Din, the new communiques were issued under his name. A new National Security Council was established which included the Army commanders, the President and five key ministers who supervised the government. This system was the source for the instability of the secessionist regime. While the parliament and government were composed of largely traditional, right of centre politicians, the military wanted to retain and to implement many of the UAR era socialist reforms and gains aimed at improving conditions for the poor and creation of a state controlled economy. The military were not democrats, but rather wanted to implement their local version of UAR-style one party military rule.The Near East since the First World War: A History to 1995 Abd al-Karim al-Nahlawi established a National Security Council, which served as a tool for continued army control over the civilian government. UAR era restrictions on political and individual freedoms were retained. Political parties were still banned and control over the media was retained. Those who were purged from their posts under the UAR regime, were not reinstated. The traditional infighting and instability resumed. This was aided by the fact that the main coup leaders had different political leanings and also business interests (through their extended families). Al- Kuzbari was arrested already in November 1961 and al-Husseini in January 1962. While the traditional parties fully supported the restored Syria, the Ba’ath party was split. Akram al-Hawrani and his socialists were against the UAR, while both founders Michel Aflaq and Salah ad-Din al-Bitar sent confusing signals. Aflaq refused to support secession, while al-Bitar initially had supported it, but withdrew his support under the pressure from the party. Many party members in the provinces had kept the party alive during the UAR period and were against Aflaq, who had proclaimed the dissolution of the Ba’ath party without any consultation with party members. This period of confusion increased the determination of the Ba’ath Military Committee to achieve its goals. While the new Constitution was being drafted and not yet approved, the Constitution of 1950 was in force. On October 17 Syria abolished the July laws that had nationalized large sectors of economy. After the December elections, Peoples Party leaders Maarouf al-Dawalibi and Nazim al-Kudsi became Prime Minister and President, respectively. Maamun al-Kuzbari was elected Speaker of the Parliament. During the first months after the coup, the government succeeded in reducing the number of coup supporters in the leading army positions and at the same reduced UAR socialist laws and regulations. Instead of maintaining strong relations with Egypt's ally, the USSR, better relations were established with West Germany and Iraq. On March 16, 1962 President Nazim al-Kudsi met with Iraq's Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim. During the spring of 1962 the pressure grew in parliament for the restoration of full democratic freedoms. Parliament requested al-Dawalibi's resignation, restoration of all liberties and establishment of National Unity Government. Al-Dawalibi resigned on March 27. Between March 28 and April 2, 1962 Syria was racked by coups and counter coups. The first attempt was made by Abd al-Karim al-Nahawi, whose forces now included Ba’athists and Nasserites. He wanted to regain his lost influence in the army and government. Al-Nahlawi's forces arrested government members and dissolved the parliament after which President al-Qudsi resigned in protest. On March 30 general Zahr ad-Din and leading army officers from the Damascus region announced that this coup was a continuation of the September 28 coup and would return the country to its original goals. Meanwhile, on March 31 Nasserites and Ba’athists led by Jassem Alwan rose in revolt. While their goals were different, they were united in their opposition to al- Nahlawi's coup in Damascus. Alwan's forces and Ba’athists from the Military Committee rebelled in Aleppo, Homs and Deir ez-Zor. They called for the restoration of the UAR and for Egypt to send supporting troops.Asad of Syria: The Struggle for the Middle East On April 1, 1962, army chief Abd al-Karim Zahreddine held talks in Homs between all the army factions, during which a secret compromise was reached: # Both al-Nahlawi, Alwan and his leading supporters were exiled. # President al-Qudsi and the civilian government were reinstated. # New elections and a referendum about the union with Egypt would be organized in the near future. # Army ranks would be reorganized so that Nasserites obtained their share of posts. # The UAR's land reform and nationalization policies would be reintroduced. # It would be ensured that Jaseem's Aleppo garrison adhered to these agreements. Syria's army had fractured along political, regional and religious lines, but it was unified in its wish to retain the control over the government, to prevent return to a full democracy and to continue on a more socialist course of development. On April 3 a group of mutinous officers was exiled to Switzerland. On April 4 Abd al-Karim Zahreddine made new appointments in the ranks. On April 13 President al-Qudsi resumed his duties. On April 16 a new government of technocrats, led by Dr. Bashir al-Azma was sworn in. Abd al-Karim Zahreddine was the new Defence minister. This government reintroduced the nationalization of large enterprises, banks and restarted land reform. Meanwhile, Nasserites and Ba’athists, with Egyptian support, planned another coup for the restoration of UAR, which was to take place on July 28, 1962, but was discovered and suppressed by the government. Syria demanded that the Arab League look into the matter and during a meeting publicly accused Egypt of wanting to annex Syria. The Egyptian delegation left the meeting and suspended Syrian participation in the Arab League for a year. On September 17 a new National Unity Government, led by Khalid al-Azm, was sworn in and the parliament dissolved. The new government began to implement socialist policies and restore full democratic liberties. The state of emergency was lifted on December 22, 1962. Benefiting from the new liberties, Abd al-Karim al-Hahlawi returned to Syria and demanded reinstatement in the army. The machinations and conspiracies in the army continued and eventually led to the coup of March 8, 1963, organized by junior officers from the Ba’athist Military Committee.

It is a wholly owned subsidiary of World TV, an Asian language television, print and radio company, and consists of three station set up between 2003 and 2010. It produces more than 80 hours of local content each week, including live talkback on news stories, migrant issues, political developments and dealing with New Zealand Government agencies. The stations also broadcast imported talk and music programmes from China and Hong Kong. Chinese Radio FM 99.4 , Auckland's only Cantonese language radio station, focuses on news and programmes from Hong Kong, but is also geared towards Cantonese-speaking communities from Canton, Singapore and Malaysia as well. AM936, New Zealand's only Mandarin-language radio station, aims to appeal to New Zealanders of Chinese heritage regardless of their age, class, gender, employment status occupation or interests. Chinese Radio FM 104.2, an English language and Chinese language radio station, broadcasts news with a Chinese worldview, information about modern China and documentaries about the modern world. The network broadcasts worldwide online, nationwide on Sky TV, and in Auckland on terrestrial radio frequencies. It claims to reach 150,000 New Zealanders of a Chinese origin. It has accepted a role in broadcasting public messages to Cantonese and Mandarin speaking communities during Civil Defence emergencies. The Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management runs Chinese language advertisements on the network, reminding people to be prepared for natural disasters and other emergency situations. This is part of the Get Ready Get Thru programme, which aims to reach the widest possible reach of people living in New Zealand. History 2003-2010 Chinese Voice's parent company, World TV, was set up in June 2000 to take advantage of the infrastructure and viewing quality of the recently launched Sky TV digital platform, and reach the country's growing Asian population. The proportion of New Zealanders of Asian origin doubled between 1991 and 2001, with the fastest increase being in Auckland's Chinese population. More than 80,000 New Zealanders speak Chinese and at least one other language, including almost 36,000 who speak Yue dialects like Cantonese. Almost 32,000 New Zealanders can only speak Chinese, including 10,000 who can only speak Yue dialects like Cantonese. Many are multilingual. The company set up Chinese Voice stations over several years as it acquired new terrestrial radio frequencies in Auckland. Cantonese language radio station Chinese Radio FM 99.4 was launched as Real Good Life in 2003, and Standard Chinese station AM936 was launched as New Supremo in 2004. Chinese Voice Broadcasting was set up to run both stations. Chinese Radio FM 104.2, an English language and Chinese language radio station, began as Radio 9 in 2010 . It is a joint venture between World TV and Chinese state-owned international broadcaster China Radio International, but operates as part of the Chinese Voice network. 2010-2014 Bevan Chuang, an Auckland Chinese community leader born in Hong Kong, was a Chinese Radio FM 104.2 host between 2011 and 2013. During the 2013 local elections she interviewed candidates for Auckland Council positions, like Orakei ward councilor Cameron Brewer, on her radio programme. At the same time she was serving as chairwoman of the Asian Women and Family Trust, was a member of the council's Ethnic Peoples Advisory Panel, and was standing for the Albert-Eden Local Board. After the election, it emerged she was also in a sexual relationship with Auckland mayor Len Brown, in what was described as \\"the biggest sex scandal in New Zealand public life\\". Brown had been reelected for a second term as mayor, while she had failed to win election to the local board. Chuang revealed to blogger Cameron Slater she had been a mistress to the mayor, who was married and had children. This had followed her public appeal for a sperm donor, in an effort to conceive a child during the Year of the Dragon. 2014- In 2014 the Broadcasting Standards Authority rejected a privacy complaint against Chinese Radio FM 99.4, over the NZ Life talkback programme. The complainant told the radio station about her young daughter's experience of having her tooth extracted. The woman said the dentist would not allow her to be in the operating room with her daughter, did not wear a mask, pinched her daughter, and told her to swallow blood after the tooth extraction. She also asked the station not to identify her or her daughter. During one show, the hosts relayed the complainant's account and described the dentist's conduct as inappropriate. During another show, one host said he had visited the dentist, described a recording he had seen of the consultation and operation, and said he no longer believed the dentist had acted inappropriately. The complainant argued the disclosure of treatment details was a breach of privacy. She further argued the host had misled the audience by providing untrue information about her daughter's experience. She believed Chinese Radio FM 99.4 had been inaccurate and unfair in its coverage of the story, had breached responsible programming standards, and had excluded her viewpoint on a controversial issue. The authority found there had been no breach of privacy as the woman and her daughter were never personally identified, and the complainant had failed to raise these other issues with the broadcaster. It found the dentist's disclosure of treatment information to the radio host was better dealt with by other agencies. Stations Chinese Radio FM 99.4 The Chinese Radio FM 99.4 logo.

It is a distinctive shrub, recognised by its tiny, crowded leaves, corky bark and pink flowers that appear along lengths of leafless parts of the branches.habitfruit Description Melaleuca suberosa is a small shrub with grey, corky, furrowed bark and which grows to a height of . Its branches and leaves are glabrous except when very young. The leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide, crowded near the ends of the branches, very narrow oval in shape, oval in cross section and with small lumps or tubercles on the upper surface. The flowers are a shade of deep pink to purple and are arranged on the sides of older branches and partly buried in them so that only the petals, style and stamens appear above the wood. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers and each bundle contains 9 to 15 stamens. Flowering occurs between July and January and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long, roughly spherical in shape, arranged along the branches. Taxonomy Calothamnus suberosa was first formally described in 1844 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Plantae Preissianae. It was placed in the present genus as Melaleuca suberosa in 1931 by Charles Austin Gardner in Enumeratio Plantarum Australiae Occidentalis. The specific epithet (suberosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"corky\\" referring to the corky bark of this species. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca suberosa occurs between the Albany district and the Cocklebiddy district in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in sandy, stony or gravelly soils on plains, swampy flats and low ridges. Conservation This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Mullins (born 1932) is a retired pediatric cardiologist who practiced at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital. He is known for advancing cardiac catheterization techniques to treat congenital heart defects, and has been referred to as the father of modern interventional pediatric cardiology. Early life Mullins was born in Washington, D.C. He graduated from Princeton University and George Washington University Medical School. He completed residency training at Walter Reed Army Medical Center; the residency was in adult cardiology, but most of the cardiac catheterization patients at Walter Reed were infants and children with heart defects. He became the U.S. Army's first pediatric cardiologist. For this service, Mullins received a U.S. Army Commendation Medal and an oak leaf cluster. He left the army as a lieutenant colonel. Career After leaving the military, Mullins came to Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) and Baylor College of Medicine. He was the first director of the pediatric intensive care unit at TCH. Mullins became known for his work with cardiac catheterization. Before Mullins' work, catheterization labs had been primarily used to image the heart. Mullins worked to advance interventional cardiology, using cardiac catheterization to repair heart defects. University of Chicago cardiologist Ziyad Hijazi said that Mullins is \\"the father of modern interventional pediatric cardiology\\". Mullins created a sheath and introducer system for carrying out cardiac catheterization and he pioneered the use of endovascular stents to treat children with heart defects. In late 2005, Mullins performed his last cardiac catheterization procedure. He retired in 2006. Mullins authored Cardiac Catheterization in Congenital Heart Disease: Pediatric and Adult in 2006. The book was reviewed in the journal Circulation. Honors and awards The American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery gave Mullins its Founders Award in 2004. The cardiac catheterization lab at TCH is named for Mullins. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions has established the Mullins Lecture, which is the keynote address at the organization's annual scientific sessions.

Ahn directed the Korean dramas Roses and Bean Sprouts (1999), Ajumma (2000), Behind the White Tower (2007), How Long I've Kissed (2012), Secret Affair (2014), and Heard It Through the Grapevine (2015). He also directed the film Over the Border (2006).  Career  Ahn Pan-seok was born in Seoul in 1961. He graduated from Sejong University with a degree in English Language and Literature. In 1986, he and fellow cinephiles from Sejong collaborated on the 22-minute short film In Praise of Idleness; the crew consisted of Yoo Ha as the director, Kim Sung-su as cinematographer, Ahn handled the lighting, and poet Jin Yi-jeong wrote the screenplay. Ahn was hired by MBC's drama production division in 1987, then worked as an assistant director on Humble Men in 1991 and My Mother's Sea in 1993. He made his directorial debut in 1994 with Love Greetings, part of the single-episode anthology MBC Best Theater; he would go on to direct eight Best Theater episodes throughout the 1990s. His first series as a production director (or \\"PD\\") was the weekend morning drama Partner (1994-1998), which was followed by the popular family dramas Roses and Bean Sprouts (1999) and Ajumma (2000-2001), and the romantic comedy I Love You, Hyun-jung (2002). He resigned from MBC in 2003 and became a freelancer, working on A Problem at My Younger Brother's House for SBS. After fifteen years in television, Ahn directed his first film in 2006. Over the Border (titled South of the Border in Korean) was a melodrama starring Cha Seung-won as an orchestra horn player from Pyongyang who defects, then later re- encounters his North Korean sweetheart (Jo Yi-jin) but he's already married to a South Korean wife (Shim Hye-jin). Ahn said, \\"Our society has greatly matured―enough not to ban the use of the North Korean flag or portraits of Kim Il-sung in movies. The audience should have fun watching images of a North Korea they've only heard about.\\" Over the Border received good reviews, but was unsuccessful at the box office. Back on the small screen in 2007, Ahn next chose a Korean TV adaptation of the Japanese novel Shiroi Kyotō by Toyoko Yamasaki, which had previously been adapted into a well-regarded Japanese film and two Japanese television dramas. Unlike typical contemporary Korean dramas, Ahn's medical drama Behind the White Tower eschewed any romance elements, focusing instead on the hospital politics and power struggles surrounding an ambitious and brilliant surgeon played by Kim Myung-min. White Tower drew high ratings and critical acclaim, and Ahn won Best Television Director at the Baeksang Arts Awards. In May 2007, he became the co-CEO of JoongAng Media Network's then-newly-launched production company Drama House. One of the inaugural dramas of newly launched cable channel jTBC was Ahn's How Long I've Kissed in 2012. Kim Hee-ae played the protagonist, a middle-aged housewife who struggles with the unforgiving expectations of her husband (Jang Hyun-sung) and his status-obsessed family, then finds a kindred spirit in her son's dentist (Lee Sung-jae). Praised for its richly drawn characters and the realistic depiction of affluent Korean parents' obsession with their children's academic achievements, the show was a hit, reaching 4% viewership ratings. In 2013, Ahn directed The End of the World based on Bae Young-ik's novel Infectious Disease, about a Center of Disease Control and Prevention scientist (played by Yoon Je-moon) who works to figure out a mysterious pandemic threatening mankind. Despite critical raves, the show's low ratings led to jTBC drastically reducing its episodes from 20 to 12. He reunited with How Long I've Kissed screenwriter Jung Sung-joo and lead actress Kim Hee-ae in 2014 with Secret Affair. Kim played an art foundation director who embarks on a passionate affair with a poor but talented pianist 20 years her junior (played by Yoo Ah-in), and the series also explored the hypocrisy and corruption amid the ranks of upper-class intellectuals. Ahn, Jung and the cast again received accolades, which included a second win for Best Television Director at the Baeksang Arts Awards. Ahn returned to network TV in 2015 with Heard It Through the Grapevine, a black comedy dissecting the class divide as the teenage son of a wealthy, powerful family brings home his pregnant girlfriend (played by Lee Joon and Go Ah-sung).

Given that his son was a Doctor and Jordan Scholar in 1926, it seems more likely that the correct year of his birth is 1860 as stated by Wright. Cheah was the proprietor of the more than 3,400-acre Eng-Moh-Hui-Thye-Kee estate in Semelin (Kedah) that, in 1907, was planted with over 20,000 coconut trees and 30,000 rubber trees. At that time the estate, which employed 300 men, was selling about 10,000 coconuts a month. He began working life at his brother Cheah Tek Soon's firm, Sing Eng Moh & Co, and served many years as the Secretary of the Penang Khean Guan Insurance Company.

May, Gan Ngoh Bee, Leong Lok Heng, Chung Thye Phin, Yeoh Guan Seok, and Lim Eow Hong. He was part of the group who met in January 1902 and decided upon a separate \\"Queen Victoria Memorial\\" for Penang. Cheah seconded the motion that the memorial be situated in a park. The suggested site, comprising between eight and ten acres, lay between Burmah and MacAlister Roads, to the east of Madras Lane, and was estimated to cost at least $50,000 at that time. At that meeting, attended, among others, by the Resident Councillor. Dr. Brown, Messrs. Bryant, Ross, and Yeats, Mr Adam pointed out that unless the Chinese could be induced to come forward in a most substantial manner, there would be an end to this.

She leaves the slums and a twist of fate – she is run over but survives – puts her into the employ of the engineer who ran her over, as a cleaner in South Africa's secret nuclear weapons facility.

The duo is composed of bassist Mike Kunka and drummer Dan Haugh, who had grown up together in Moorhead, Minnesota. They were known for their loud \\"wall of sound\\" live performances, which were full of raging drums, screaming and a gigantic heavy bass sound. Mike employed many effects pedals and a large wall of amps to create his thunderous sound. The group's sound is considered to be damaging, for both members of the band experience discomfort from the low bass tone of their music. History godheadSilo originally started in 1991 as a three-piece, with Phil Leitch playing guitar. Leitch left the band after their first show at Fargo's Moose Lodge. From then on, the band recorded and performed as a two-piece. Their debut was their contribution to the Moo Bob Records compilation album Nodak: Distorted Hallucinations with the track \\"Pull\\" from 1992. The group relocated to Olympia, Washington and were signed to local indie label Kill Rock Stars. They recorded and released their debut The Scientific Supercake L.P. in 1994 for Kill Rock Stars. The album is notable for its production; When played with the bass settings set to maximum, the album can cause damage to speakers and stereo systems. After going through with a five-week long tour with Sebadoh, the group were signed to Sub Pop, who subsequently released their next two full-lengths Skyward in Triumph in 1996 and Share the Fantasy in 1998. Although the band has been on hiatus since the release of Share the Fantasy in 1998, Mike and Dan joined forces with Murder City Devils vocalist Spencer Moody in a band called Smoke and Smoke, releasing the album Love Suffers Long in 2004. \\"Godheadsilo never really broke up,\\" says Haugh, who lives in New Orleans. \\"I had a horrible accident, lost my ability to play drums for several years, and it was just kind of like a fade-away kind of thing.\\" \\"I had an accident where my hand was almost cut off completely,\\" Haugh says. \\"The doctors were like, 'You'll never play drums again.' A few years of intense physical and occupational therapy got it working again. It's still pretty wonky, but it can hold a drumstick just fine.\\" In 2015, godheadSilo reunited to play a concert in commemoration of Ralph's Corner, a Moorhead, MN music venue that closed in 2005. On April 1, 2016, Three Men and a Baby, a collaborative album between the Melvins and Mike Kunka, was released by Sub Pop. The album, which the Melvins recorded their parts back in 1998, was shelved and uncompleted until recently when Kunka and the Melvins finished it. The band did a short US Tour in January 2017. Only 10 shows were planned. When asked about the future of the band, both members gave mixed responses. Haugh showed interest in recording while Kunka did not.

Rashkind (February 12, 1922 - July 6, 1986) was an American cardiologist. Rashkind worked at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He is best known for his contributions to the treatment of congenital heart defects. He introduced the Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy to treat transposition of the great vessels. Biography Rashkind was born in Paterson, New Jersey, and he attended the University of Louisville School of Medicine. He was a physician at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He is best known for the balloon septostomy procedure. In this technique, a cardiologist feeds a catheter into the heart of a patient with transposition of the great vessels. This catheter is advanced into the patient's right atrium, across a flap known as the patent foramen ovale (PFO) and into the patient's left atrium. There is a balloon on the end of the catheter. The balloon is inflated and then pulled back across the PFO, creating a hole in the heart through which oxygenated and deoxygenated blood can mix. Rashkind introduced his balloon septostomy procedure in 1966. In May of that year, LIFE Magazine profiled Rashkind and described his procedure on a young boy named Bobby. The procedure had required only local anesthesia and the patient's color improved immediately thereafter. Describing the medical community's response to the Rashkind procedure, pediatric cardiologist Charles Mullins later said, \\"The initial response to this report varied between admiration and horror but, in either case, the procedure stirred the imagination of the 'invasive' cardiologists throughout the entire cardiology world and set the stage for all future intracardiac interventional procedures – the true beginning of pediatric and adult interventional cardiology.\\" Writing about Rashkind's balloon innovation, pediatric cardiologist Jacqueline Noonan said that Rashkind could legitimately be referred to as \\"the father of interventional pediatric cardiology.\\" In 1986, Rashkind died of cancer at home in Marion, Pennsylvania.

It has fibrous bark and pink to purple flowers in spikes, mostly on the side branches. Description Melaleuca subfalcata is a shrub which grows to a height of and has rough, fibrous bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are long, wide, linear to narrow elliptic in shape and curved, so that they are almost sickle-shaped. The flowers are a shade of pink to purple, arranged in a spike on the sides of the branches and sometimes on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering. The spikes are up to in diameter and contain 5 to 30 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flowers mature. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle with 11 to 22 stamens. Flowers appear from November to March and the fruit which follow are woody capsules, long, sometimes arranged in clusters.ANBG Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca subfalcata was first formally described in 1847 by Nikolai Turczaninow in \\"Bulletin de la classe physico-mathematique de l'Academie Imperiale des sciences de Saint-Petersburg\\". The specific epithet (subfalcata) is from the Latin word falcatus meaning \\"curved\\" or \\"sickle-shaped\\" and the prefix -sub meaning “under” in reference to the leaves being curved, almost like a sickle. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in and between the Ongerup, Lake King and Israelite Bay districts in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in sand or clay over laterite on undulating plains and rocky hillsides.

In the collection of the National Academy of Design James Hamilton Shegogue (sometimes styled Shégogue) (February 22, 1806 – April 7, 1872) was an American painter. He was described as a \\"man of unusual education, a proficient linguist, and a scientific explorer\\" by one contemporary. Shegogue was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and was of French extraction; little is known of his training, though it has been said he traveled in Europe and studied there in his early years. Around 1833 he exhibited a painting titled An Old Straw Hat, currently unlocated, at the American Academy of Fine Arts; this was the first piece he showed publicly. Among the artists whose notice it attracted was John Trumbull. In 1839 his name was listed on the register of students at the National Academy of Design, but he is known to have already developed a reputation as an artist. In 1846 he traveled to Europe for a year of study, prompting a critic for the Literary World to observe that he had already seen \\"no small degree of success as a painter of portraits in fancy dresses, with an occasional fancy face.\\" He returned to Europe for other painting trips during his career; on one of these a copy of Guido Reni's Aurora which he painted in the Palazzo Borghese for a New York client won praise from the Princess Borghese. Shegogue participated in the artistic life of New York City, holding membership in the Old Sketch Club, the Artists Sketch Club, and the Century Association. He was quite prolific as a portraitist, but produced history paintings, landscapes, and genre works as well. He became a member of the National Academy, and later served as that organization's corresponding secretary, from 1849 to 1852. He was adjudged quite successful, and made a good deal of money during his career. Tiring of city life, in 1862 he moved to Warrenville, Connecticut, where he died; he continued to paint up until a few weeks before his death.James Hamilton Shegogue Two portraits by Shegogue are in the National Academy collection, a self-portrait and one of James David Smillie; the former is recorded as having been shown at the Academy's annual exhibition in 1844, suggesting that it was painted to mark his elevation to full member status. Three watercolors are owned by the National Gallery of Art, and an oil portrait is in the collection of the Morris Museum of Art in Augusta, Georgia. The portrait of Davy Crockett is at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. Other pieces are owned by the City of New York, the New York Historical Society, and the Brooklyn Museum.

It was rebuilt in place of the old ride by the same name, which burned down in a fire in 2018. The ride was built by Mack Rides in 1987 and was situated in a large hall at the Dutch themed area, which was designed as a typical Dutch clinker brick building from the outside. Although located in the Dutch area, its theming is largely based on Indonesia (then the Dutch East Indies), in which the Dutch colonized.  Theming  The ride is set during a pirate raid on Jakarta (known as Batavia until 1942) in the 17th century at the beginning of the Dutch colonization of Indonesia.  Ride  The building of the ride was characterized with a banner labeled with \\"Piraten in Batavia\\" in golden letters and a Jolly Roger. The station was situated on the first floor. On their way to the station, visitors were introduced to the backstory, while learning about the history of the Dutch colonisation of Indonesia, shown in different animated scenes. Mural paintings showed the Java Sea, including the maps of Sumatra, Borneo and Java. At the station the visitors got on one of the boats, each with a capacity of 16 riders. The first scene showed a cave in the Indonesian jungle, which was inhabited by different animals and humans. After a wide bend, the boat went down a waterfall and passed through a battle scene, in which a pirate ship attacked a nearby fort. The scene was dominated by screaming pirates and gunfire. Through a break in the fortification wall, the boat arrived in Batavia, which was full of marauding pirates. In the following scenes the visitor experienced how the pirates won over the native women, staving off their hunger by eating exotic animals and getting drunk. The ride carried on passing a hidden temple in the jungle, a burning fort, a fishermen's village and a jail. Just before the end of the ride, the boats passed a show venue on the right, which was embedded into the setting, and the themed restaurant Bamboe Baai.  Fire  On 26 May 2018, Pirates in Batavia burned to the ground in a fire that destroyed the main themed area of the Scandinavia portion of the park. The cause of the fire is unknown, but a fireball erupted in a storage hall and spread towards the ride building resulting in high flames and a smoke plume stretching for miles. At first, the area was evacuated, but this was later revised to include the whole park. The park re-opened on Sunday, albeit with the Scandinavia and Norwegian sections of the ride closed. Two attractions, the 'Fjord-Rafting' and the 'Dschungel- Floßfahrt' remained closed, as firefighters had used water from those attractions to battle the fire.

Life Denison had come from a simple background; his parents were of low ranking and little means in West Yorkshire. Definitive information is not available as to exactly how his fortune was made but seemingly he travelled to London where he became associated with the Heywood family of bankers, later becoming a partner in the company. Richard Vickerman Taylor described the immense wealth accumulated by Denison as being gained through \\"unabated industry and the most rigid frugality\\". Five years after purchasing Denbies, the Seamere estate, near Scarborough, Yorkshire, was added to his portfolio after he acquired it from the Duke of Leeds. Denison had a son, William Joseph, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Anna Maria, from his second wife. By the time of the Regency era the family were the personification of prosperity and social status. Legacy Denison died on 12 December 1806 and the estate and all other properties were inherited by his son. He is buried at Bunhill Fields with his second wife; a Grade II listed monument is on their tomb.

He is portrayed by Jason Statham in the first three films, Chris Vance in the television series, and Ed Skrein in the reboot. He initially serves as a reluctant hero. He is portrayed as a former Special Air Service operative who was a team leader of a search and destroy unit. His military background includes operations \\"in and out of\\" Lebanon, Syria and Sudan. He retires from this after becoming fatigued and disenchanted with his superior officers. In simple terms, he got tired of seeing his best efforts turned to nothing by the same people paying him to do the job, so he puts his skills to action as a private driver for hire. Background His country of origin is unclear—throughout the franchise, Statham seems to speak with a Cockney accent, mixing his own Estuary English accent with a European and also with perhaps a generic Appalachian American accent, suggesting he could be European, British or American, but who may have spent considerable time in another country. In The Transporter, Frank Martin is shown to have received the Bronze Star. In the television series, it was revealed that he was enlisted in the British Army and later transferred to Special Air Service. It is also stated in the second season of the television series that Frank lost his father below the age of ten, whereas in the reboot film, The Transporter Refueled, his father, a parental namesake called Frank Martin Sr. is alive and well, revealed to be a former British spy, who retired away from London to renovate his fatherly relationship with his son. Frank has already established a good reputation in his secondary, secretive line of work, all the while maintaining an apparently legitimate life living off of his army pension. However, he did manage to attract the suspicions of the police in France, where he had been living quietly near the coast. Later life In the second season of Transporter: The Series, it was revealed that Frank had a firm and close relationship with a UN Diplomat named Zara Knight whose abduction was orchestrated by a rival transporter and Frank's archenemy, Olivier Dassin. Zara, at the time, was in negotiation of peace settlement when she came to an arms dealer's attention, Armand Burton, who was playing both unnamed sides for fools and peace was going to cost him billions of dollars. She was forced to disappear and work for Burton in exchange for the protection of a child who was revealed to be her and Frank's son, unbeknownst to him. Attributes and abilities Possibly through his military background, Frank is portrayed as having expertise with explosives, surveillance, hand-to-hand combat and evasive driving. Emphasis is given to his skills as an accomplished driver, able to conduct seemingly impossible maneuvers while retaining perfect control of his vehicle. Frank often engages in hand-to-hand combat, having to improvise using unconventional weapons against his opponents. Martin is also an accomplished sharpshooter. Rules Frank Martin carries out his business according to strict rules,Plot summary for The Transporter which he is loath to break, and expects his clients to adhere to them or face a breach of contract. His rules are: # \\"Never change the deal\\" # \\"No names\\" # \\"Never open the package\\" # \\"Never make a promise you can't keep\\" While at first these rules may seem unnecessarily strict, their importance is illustrated when Frank is hired to transport three men, but four arrive, straight from a bank heist. Explaining to them that the deal was for a precise number of passengers with specific weight and that fuel and suspension were specifically set to reach the destination, the gang is forced to remove their extra man or face being caught. Frank's breaking of his own rules is the central theme in The Transporter. Rules of the car: # \\"Respect a man's car, and the man will respect you\\" # \\"Greet the man\\" # \\"Seat belt\\" # \\"Never drink coffee in the car\\" # \\"If you take care of the car, the car will take care of you\\" By the second season of Transporter: The Series, an aging Frank Martin unveils that he no longer lives by making rules but one, which oversees him carrying out the job he's taken from any client from start to finish. However, Rule No. 3 is mentioned once when Frank expresses a brief regret over not checking the validity of the package he was supposed to deliver. Appearance Frank Martin maintains a uniform of sorts, consisting of a black suit, white shirt, and a black tie. He wears Panerai Chronograph watches as well, utilizing a PAM 74 in the first film, a PAM 196H in the second film, and a PAM 212 in the third film. Martin also puts great emphasis on precise timing and punctuality. He regularly maintains anonymity from his clients, going by the aliases Transporter, or more simply Driver, in accordance with his second rule. Cars Throughout the films and television series, Frank Martin has been portrayed to prefer large, powerful German sedans: * A 1999 BMW 7 Series E38 and Mercedes-Benz W140 in The Transporter.

He served as spymaster and head of the KGB stations in the United Kingdom and Denmark during the Cold War. Early life and family Lyubimov was born in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukrainian SSR. His father, Pyotr Fyodorovich Lyubimov, joined the Cheka-OGPU in 1918. In 1938, he was arrested during the Great Purge but released, and returned to military intelligence in the Carpathian and Volga Military Districts. Lyubimov graduated from high school in Kuybyshev (now Samara) in 1952. He then attended the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, graduating in 1958. He wrote a doctoral thesis titled English National Character and Its Use in Operational Work. Career After his graduation, Lyubimov was sent to Finland to work at the Soviet embassy's consulate office. In 1959, he was recruited into First Chief Directorate of the KGB. Two years later Lyubimov went to the United Kingdom, where he worked in the Soviet residency in London as Second Secretary of the Embassy, he was an ordinary field officer. Lyubimov worked under the guise of being the press attaché, allowing him to associate socially with the British elite and political officials. He was dubbed \\"Smiley Mike\\" by his British counterparts. In 1964, Lyubimov's cover was blown in a failed attempt to recruit a cipher machine operator to spy for the Soviets. The British tried to recruit him, he refused, was declared persona non grata and was recalled to Moscow, where he continued as spymaster of the British section. Lyubimov was next sent to Copenhagen, Denmark from 1967 to 1969. In 1974, he became Deputy Chief of the Anglo-Scandinavian Department. At that time he worked closely with Kim Philby. In 1976, he was sent back to Copenhagen, where he corresponded by mail with Philby. The collection of their letters is now archived at Georgetown University. After four years in Denmark, he returned home to Moscow and retired from the KGB in 1980. Writing Lyubimov's first book was The Life and Adventures of Alex Wilkie, Spy in 1989, about a Russian agent in London trying to trying to find a mole leaking intelligence to the Americans. A 2015 Russian film directed by Vladimir Bortko, Soul of a Spy, was adapted from it.

These rice grains were first identified in Japan in 1964, after the research was interrupted by World War II. The first of the yellowed rice strains has been linked to shoshin-kakke (heart-attacking paralysis). Citrinum yellow rice and Islandia yellow rice are not known to have caused any adverse effects in human populations.  Discovery   Yellow rice (P. citreonigrum)  In 1891, Junjiro Sakaki began studying molded rice and inferred that mycotoxins contained in the rice were linked to paralysis. In 1937, the research was taken over by the Rice Utilization Institute. Although research was interrupted by World War II, it was resumed afterward and in 1964 the mycotoxin citreoviridin was isolated. Kenji Uraguchi at The University of Tokyo then used the isolated compound to induce heart- attack paralysis in laboratory animals.  Islandia yellow rice (P. islandicum)  In the aftermath of World War II, Japan was forced to import approximately 1 million pounds of rice from various countries. A large portion of this was from Egypt, in which a new form of yellow rice was discovered. This led to a team of six researchers—Yoshito Kobayashi, K. Uraguchi, Masashi Miyake, Mamoru Saito, Takashi Tatsuno, and Makoto Enomoto—to pool resources in order to study this new type of yellow rice. After seven months, they discovered the presence of two different mycotoxins, one with a distinct yellow pigment, the other colorless and odorless. Chemical structure of mycotoxin luteoskyrin Chemical structure of mycotoxin cyclochlorotine The first mycotoxin was researched further by Tatsuno and Shoji Shibata at the University of Tokyo and was eventually named luteoskyrin. The second toxin was much more difficult to assess, given its scarcity in comparison to luteoskyrin in the rice samples. Both Tatsuno and Shingo Marumo of Nagoya University proposed chemical structures for this elusive mycotoxin and upon further discussion, it was found that the two researchers had, in fact, discovered the same compound and subsequently named it cyclochlorotine (islanditoxin).  Citrinum yellow rice (P. citrinum)  Hiroshi Tsunoda discovered a third strain of yellow rice in 1951 and by 1954 had identified it in rice from China, Vietnam, Burma, Iran, Spain, America, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Japan. The mycotoxin that infected the rice was isolated from Penicillium citrinum and was found to be a secondary metabolite called citrinin. According to Tsunoda, P. citrinum was the most common fungi of the Penicillium species found in imported rice, with 20% of imports being contaminated.  Impact   Yellow rice (P. citreonigrum)  Mycotoxins in rice was not an unknown problem in Japan before the discovery of Penicillium. Several mycotoxins had already been discovered, but these were grains that infected rice in the field rather than after harvest, such as citreonigrum. The discovery of mycotoxins in rice led to the reinforcement of rice hygiene standards. This led to a drastic decrease in shoshin-kakke cases in Japan in the early 20th century. Initially, this decrease was thought to be the discovery of vitamins, but vitamins were not introduced completely into the medical community until ten tears after the fact.  Islandia yellow rice (P. islandicum)  In order to test the effects of the Islandia Yellow Rice, a study was conducted at the University of Tokyo by the researchers Kobayashi, Uraguchi, Miyake, Saito, Tatsuno, and Enomoto. These six researchers found that upon long-term ingestion of rice tainted with the mycotoxins luteoskyrin and cyclochlorotine, laboratory rats suffered from acute liver necrosis and tumorigenic effects due to the luteoskyrin, fibrosis and cirrhosis from the cyclochlorotine. Chemical structure of mycotoxin citrinin  Citrinum yellow rice (P. citrinum)  Due to the high rates of citrinin found in rice, it was recommended to the Japanese government by the National Institute of Health of Japan that grain with greater that 1% contamination of P. citrinum should not be sold. There is no current worldwide legislation or guidelines on how much citrinin is allowed to be in grains due to its instability in foodstuffs. The lack of regulation of citrinin may also be due to the fact that while studies have shown that it does act as a nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic agent, it is less toxic than other mycotoxins such as aflatoxin and ochratoxin. Citrinin does, however, have deleterious effects on the kidneys and is thought to be one of the culprits involved in the Balkan endemic nephropathy. Despite the lack of regulations, there have been various studies on how to reduce the growth of citrinin producing fungi and the subsequent production of citrinin. These studies have mainly focused on the thermal decontamination and detoxification of citrinin and the effects of herbs and spices on toxicity. While thermal detoxification has shown promising results (heating citrinin with water at 130 °C can significantly decrease its effects), heating it too much can actually stimulate the production of more toxin chemicals. Spices, on the other hand, have been used for most of human civilization as antimicrobial agents. This has led to several studies investigating whether spices and herbs can affect mycotoxins such as citrinin. One study has revealed that in the presence of Mentha arvensis (mint) extract, citrinin production was inhibited by 73%. Clove has also been studied for its antimicrobial properties. In a 2013 study, a clove solution was shown to decrease citrinin production by approximately 60%. Not all spices and herbs have had this effect on citrinin production. Piper betle (betel) extract was actually shown to stimulate citrinin production in some samples.  Overview  Despite the lack of international regulation on mycotoxins in rice, the contamination scare following World War II did influence Japan's food safety guidelines. The discovery of P. citreonigrum led to the strengthening of rice hygiene standards by the Rice Utilization Institute, which later became the Food Control Bureau Institute. The collaborative investigations that followed the discoveries of each of the three yellow rice strains resulted in the founding of the Japanese Association for Mycotoxicology in 1973. Due to these extensive efforts by researchers, no human deaths have been reported as a result of Islandia Yellow Rice or Citrinum Yellow Rice.

Stripes are a group of such lines. Usage and appearance As a pattern (more than one stripe together), stripes are commonly seen in nature, food, emblems, clothing, and elsewhere. Two-toned stripes inherently draw one's attention, and as such are used to signal hazards. They are used in road signs, barricade tape, and thresholds. In nature, as with the zebra, stripes may have developed through natural selection to produce motion dazzle. Stripes may give appeal to certain sweets like the candy cane.  Fashion  For hundreds of years, stripes have been used in clothing. Striped clothing has frequently had negative symbolism in Western cultures. Historian Michel Pastoureau explores the cultural history of these design decisions in the book, The Devil's Cloth. Stripes on garment first appeared in the Medieval times. During that era, only prisoners, criminals, clowns, prostitutes, hangmen, etc. were seen wearing a black and white striped garment. However, by the end of the nineteenth century, a new definition of stripes was created by Queen Victoria. The queen dressed her son in a sailor suit during a Royal Yacht boarding event. Stripes were no longer just associated with “someone evil.” Stripes were then connected with words such as “marine” and “sea”. Navy blue and white stripes were adopted by swimmers on their bathing suits. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the stripe fashion became mainstream again. Coco Chanel was inspired by the workers’ uniform during her trip to the French Rivera, and she started to apply the “Navy and White Stripes” into her designs. In the ’50s, movie stars were seen wearing striped shirts through the media. During the ’60s and ’70s, more and more people started to wear striped shirts as the garment was seen as a symbol of rebellion.

Its simplest level of meaning is that love needs food and wine to thrive. It was sometimes shown in art, especially in the period 1550–1630, in Northern Mannerism in Prague and the Low Countries, as well as by Rubens.Bull, 218–219 It has been suggested that the concentration of images by the Haarlem Mannerists reflects the patronage of the powerful brewers of Haarlem.Santos, especially p. 21 onwards  Proverb The phrase derives from Terence's comedy Eunuchus, in which Chremes says to Pythias in the fifth scene of the fourth act (732), verbum hercle hoc verum erit \\"sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus\\" (That saying, \\"Without Ceres and Liber, Venus freezes\\" is absolutely true!\\"). Thus the phrase was probably a well-known proverb at the time as well. Chremes makes use of it to declare how Pythias seems even more beautiful than usual to him during the rowdy partying after a large meal.Erasmus, 178 Liber, the son of Ceres and god of human prosperity (and also of wine), was later replaced with Bacchus. The phrase is found in a similar form in Cicero,Rhetorica ad Herennium 4.32.43 who quotes it as an example of the stylistic device of metonymy.De nat. deor. 2.23.60, cited after Gerd Hagenow: Der nicht ausgekehrte Speisesaal (PDF; 3,5 MB), note 7 In later times it was universally attributed to Terence. In the Middle Ages, Caesarius of Heisterbach used it in his work, Dialogus miraculorum to warn against luxury and frivolty and to advocate an ascetic lifestyle.Dialogus miraculorum 112 Martin Luther quoted it in this sense as well, in a 1518 sermon against the Seven Deadly Sins.WA 1,519 With the arrival of Renaissance humanism, the proverb was included with a broader sense in various compilations, such as the Adagia of Erasmus.Adagia 1297 = II.3.97 The earliest German use is in a compilation from Klagenfurt dating to 1468: An wein und brot Leidet Venus not (Without wine and bread, Venus is not in good stead).Singer, pp. 453f. Further German variants include: * Ohne Wein und Brot ist Venus tot. (Without wine and bread, Venus is dead) * Ohn Speis und Trank ist Venus krank. (Without cheer and ale, Venus is frail) * Ohne Kost und ohne Wein kann die Liebe nicht gedeihn. (Without food and without wine, love cannot shine)Publius Terentius Afer: Lustspiele, translated by Christian Victor Kindervater. Leipzig: Frommann, 1799, p. 175 (Digitised) Shakespeare's line in Twelfth Night, \\"Dost thou think because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale\\", may be an inverted reference.Twelfth Night 2.1.123, Sir Toby Belch to Malvolio; see Erasmus, 178  Subject in art  Venus Frigida, Rubens 1615, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp. Venus and Cupid are freezing, as a satyr arrives with a fruit bowl Depictions in art divide into those showing Venus, typically with an accompanying Cupid, either \\"freezing\\", without food and drink (or much in the way of clothing), or more comfortable when supplied with them, usually by the other gods in person.Bull, 218–219 The latter type is more common, but Bartholomeus Spranger and Rubens are among the artists who used both types.Bull, 218–219 Like the Feast of the Gods, another subject popular among the Northern Mannerists, the subject offers the combination of a relatively obscure classical reference and the opportunity for plentiful nudity. The subject appears in paintings, drawings and prints, and compositions are often copied between these media, and between artists. Initially the depiction of this motif were closely tied to text and was found mostly in emblem books, with the first appearance in the Picta poesis of 1552, by Barthélémy Aneau.Santos, fig. 3, pp. 12–13 The Mikrokosmos, an emblem book of 1579 by the Dutch poet Laurentius Haechtanus may be the first depiction of the shivering Venus, as Ceres and Bacchus walk away.Bull, 218 The Latin text makes clear that the motif is to be understood as a warning against excessive feasting and drinking because they stimulate sexual desire. Explain, Cytheran Venus, and Cupid too: Why do you warm your own feet, warm your own hands? Perhaps because eloquent Iacchos is not helping you? Isn't dusty Ceres around either? Where sobriety reigns, harmful lust freezes and no war is waged against the curier.i.e. the moderate man Wherever powerful drunkenness and excess reign, the mother of adultery begins her ruthless war. Abraham Bloemaert, early 17th century The motif was especially favoured in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries in the Netherlands and in the circle of mannerist artists at the court of Emperor Rudolf II in Prague.Hinz, pp. 380–394 Early examples of the motif as the subject of an independent painting are Spranger's pair of paintings of about 1590,Metzler, 126-129 and Hans von Aachen's Bacchus, Ceres und Amor (1598), all painted for Rudolf II. The Spranger was turned into a print in Amsterdam in about 1597 by Jan Harmensz Muller.British Museum, Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus (Without Bacchus and Ceres, Venus grows cold), object listing Hendrik Goltzius produced at least 10 versions of the subject,Bull, 219 including a monumental work in the unusual technique of pen and limited colour on canvas, here highly effective (illustrated here). This was also (probably) in Rudolf's collection, then in the royal collections of Sweden and England, and is now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.Phildalephia Museum of Art; \\"The Picture That Spurred A Splendid Exhibition\\", by Edward J. Sozanski, Inquirer Art Critic, November 24, 1991, philly.com (The Philadelphia Inquirer) A different work on the subject in the same technique is in the Hermitage, which includes a self-portrait by Goltzius in the background.Review in New York Times of exhibition in Philadelphia in 1992; Santos, 34–35, fig. 28 Cabinet painting, about 1605, by Joachim Wtewaellot notes, Sotheby's, New York. Sale \\"Important Old Master Paintings Including European Works of Art\\", 24 Jan 2008, Lot 3 Especially in Goltzius' version, the undertones of danger and the moral point of the allegory are still clear, although the motif later moved far from a narrow moral message about personal moderation.Hinz, pp. 380–394 Several of the print versions carry the proverb text, which it was presumably felt needed stating for a wider public. Reference to the motif is uncertain in some works, or groups of works,Santos, 20 but it is at least arguable that any combination of the three gods, with or without Amor, carries a reference to it, as there is no other context that brings this particular group together. Two different sets of prints by Goltzius showed each of the three gods in turn; in one set, engraved by Jan Saenredam, each is surrounded by worshippers.Santos, 16–18, figs 8–10 and 15–17; Bull, 219 Two late paintings by Joachim Wtewael show half-length portraits of Bacchus and Ceres, and it is presumed that a Venus is missing to complete the set; another small painting by Wtewael shows the three gods, and Amor, together.Clifton, J.; Helmus, L. & Wheelock Jr. A. (2015) Pleasure and Piety: The Art of Joachim Wtewael, last two entries, Princeton University Press, Rubens employed the motif repeatedly in different ways, including the visibly freezing Venus frigida, a version with Amor who desperately attempts to start a fire, and one with Venus at the Moment maßvollen Erwärmens und ruhigen Erwachens (Moment of modestly warming and quietly waking) in which she hesitantly accepts a wine cup from Bacchus.Hinz, p. 389 Italian artists rarely depicted it, whether because it came from the mainly northern tradition of emblem books or because the subject had less resonance in a warmer climate.Bull, 219 Exceptions are a painting by Pietro Liberi and a print by Agostino Carracci after one by Goltzius.British Museum, object page; Santos, fig. 5, pp. 13–14 After the baroque period the motif no longer appears often. Haarlem brewers' propaganda Rubens 1612/13, Staatliche Museen, Kassel The Calvinist Dutch Republic had complex and conflicted attitudes to both sex and alcohol. Several prominent painters had problems with drink, and the issues were discussed by the biographer and artist Karel van Mander, as part of much wider discussions in Dutch culture.Santos, especially 21–28 A paper of 2012 by R. de Mambro Santos discusses the motif in this context, and proposes that the depiction of the subject was greatly affected by the big brewers of Haarlem.Santos, especially p. 21 onwards According to Santos, van Mander can be seen to connect excessive drinking with wine, while beer is presented in his writings and art as a safer and more wholesome product.Santos, 29–31 Both Bacchus, as by extension the god of all alcoholic drinks, and Ceres, as the goddess covering the raw materials, were symbolic of beer, and a metaphor used by van Mander placed Venus and Cupid as representing the transformative process of actual brewing, by boiling the ingredients; the fire appearing in many images was a further necessity for brewing.Santos, 30–36 According to Santos, at the period when the subject is found in the art of the Haarlem Mannerists, \\"the economic life of Haarlem was mainly based on the production of beer\\", and brewers dominated the government of the city, having \\"assumed the role previously played by the nobility as a leading group in the administration of the town\\".Santos, pp. 27–28, each quoted in turn Brouwershofje, an almshouse complex in the city, has more information on the Haarlem brewers' guild.Santos, 29 In particular Jan Mathijsz Ban was a leading brewer, a friend of artists and a significant collector, spending many weeks touring Italy with Goltzius. With another brewer, he was the dedicatee of the central part of van Manders' Schilder-boeck. Van Mander praises the taste and knowledge of the Haarlem brewers at various points,Santos, 26–27 and \\"Both Van Mander’s text and Goltzius’ images present Bacchus as a sober, elegant divinity, a gentle and polite god not associated at all with excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages\\", contrary to much previous imagery.Santos, 29 File:Bartholomäus Spranger 015.jpgBartholomäus Spranger, c. 1590, for Rudolf File:Hans von Aachen 010.jpg1598, Hans von Aachen: Bacchus, Ceres und Armor File:Goltzius Sine Cerere.jpgVersion of print by Jan Saenredam, after a design by Abraham Bloemaert, c. 1600Version in reverse of this print (British Museum page) File:Rubens Sine Cerere 1.jpgRubens 1614, Gemäldegalerie der Akademie der Bildenden Künste, Wien File:Jacob Hoefnagel - Sine Baccho et Cerere friget Venus.jpgJacob Hoefnagel, early 17th century File:Jan Miel - Sine Cerere et Baccho Friget Venus (Without Ceres or Bacchus, Venus would freeze).jpgJan Miel, 1645 Lord Byron Lord Byron expanded on the proverb in Don Juan Canto II, sections 169–170: :... some good lessons :Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus :Without whom Venus will not long attack us. :While Venus fills the heart (without heart really :Love, though good always, is not quite so good), :Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli, - :For love must be sustain'd like flesh and blood, - :While Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly.

His war-time photographs were not included in the illustrated magazines. After the war he was an inspector at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. He founded the Cinematographic Department in Thessaloniki. War Years As a graduate of Zajecar gymnasium, Stojadinović contacted fellow countrymen in Belgrade, members of the University Association of Bloodbrothers who recruited young people to liberate the Christian population in Old Serbia, then under Ottoman occupation. At the age of 19 in the spring of 1905, he left with voivode Doksim Mihailović to across the Ottoman-occupied border and participated in the Fight on Čelopek. After this fight, he continued as a freedom-fighter in the Kumanovo area under the command of Đorđe Skopljanče and later in the Veles and Prilep region under the voivodes Rade Radivojević, Jovan Babunski and Vasilije Trbić until 1908. In the skirmish with Bulgarians in the village of Drenovo near Makedonski Brodhttp://www.maplandia.com/macedonia/brod/makedonski-brod/drenovo/ on 14 June 1907, he shot the rifle off the hands of VMRO voivode Stefan Dimitrov. After 1908 he enrolled in law school studies, which he completed in good time. In 1911, as a famed crack shot, he was chosen by the French rifle club l'Union des Tireurs Serbes in Belgrade to participate in a European rifle shooting competition in Rome where he took first prize. He defended the title until 1914. In the wars of 1912 up until 1918, he participated as a reserve officer in the 13th Hajduk Veljko Infantry Regiment. During the Balkan wars, he became more involved in recording the bellicose events as a photographer and cinematographer. After the war, he published a photo album of photographs from the Balkan wars and the Arnaut rebellion. By order of the Supreme Command in 1916, he became head of the Cinematographic Section of the Supreme Command of the Serbian Army. Many important war events were recorded due to the outstanding organization of Serbian war photographers and cameramen who were under his watch. After the war, he still continued to record important happenings and events.[Projekat Rastko] Stevan Jovicic: S kamerom i puskom - Dragisa M.

Work  TransCultural Exchange has worked in more than sixty countries to produce cultural exchanges, exhibitions, and public art works. All of these have involved artists from different cultures, working across disciplines and, typically, include artist exchanges and collaborations as key components. In 2002, UNESCO awarded TCE sponsorship and it became the first US project to receive it since the US mission rejoined UNESCO. The organization also sponsors artists for residency and exchange programs. In 2013, Boston University announced that it will be collaborating with TransCultural Exchange on multiple projects through 2016.  Projects   The Coaster Project and The Coaster Project, Destination: The World  In the year 2000, TransCultural Exchange launched its first Coaster Project at the 2000 London Biennale, followed by a second, international version in conjunction with their show in 2002 at New York City's Trans Hudson Gallery and a 10th anniversary of the project at Toronto's 2012 BIG on Bloor Festival. For the first version, the members of TransCultural Exchange made artworks in the form of coasters that were exhibited and then distributed, free of charge, under drinks at London's Cynthia's Cyberbar and New York's Telephone Bar. Subsequently, the organization used the Internet and collected 10,000 coasters from various artists from different countries. These coasters were given away around the world at bars, restaurants, museums and cafes, including the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Palais de Tokyo in Paris, Chicago Cultural Center and National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad.Gallerie, India, \\"The Coaster Project, Destination: The World, feature article, 2000.

Agriculture is the predominant occupation of the people living here. Agriculture primarily depends on seasonal rainfall and the water coming through the river 'ManiMuthar'. Close to South Mampatti, there are 11 more villages situated which are administered and culturally linked to South Mampatti. Name of the 11 villages are 'Oppilanpatti, Santhirapatti, Thumbaipatti, Idaiyapatti, Kilukiluppaipatti, Thirupathipatti, M.Valaiyapatti, Kachapatti, Kalungupatti, Thoppupatti and Indira nagar'. Among this South Mampatti is the mother village for all (Tamil: தாய்க் கிராமம்). Everyone knows the festival Deepavali/Diwali(Tamil: தீபாவளி), which literally means \\"row of lights\\" celebrated by Hindus across the world and is the most important festival in Hinduism. It is the celebration of good over evil, and light overcoming darkness. Regarding Diwali, astounding fact of this villages is that they never celebrate this festival. No new clothes, sweets or firecrackers here. For residents of the villages, Diwali has never been an occasion for celebration. For the past six decades, the villagers have shunned the festival. The reason behind this is that they faced a severe drought on that period and also the festival occurs at the wrong time of the year during October November, where everyone will be in the midst of Samba Season where they incur agricultural expenses. While the entire village was suffering due to drought and agricultural expenses, few affluent families celebrated the festival, as usual indifferent to the plight of others. It hurt many of the people in villages, particularly the kids. That was when they decided not to celebrate it, by swears to the village deity Sri Kadukavalar Swamy. Everyone in the villages strictly adhere to the resolution adopted during a village meeting held 60 years ago(1958) headed by the Ambalakarar(President of an assembly)'Sevugan Ambalam' in order to maintain unity among villagers. Even those who moved from the village to settle elsewhere have not violated this unwritten diktat of the village. Also many youths from villages moved to foreign countries for survival as no good spell of monsoon rains in this regions for a continuous time. Now the villagers' economic condition improved for some extent. But, they continued to shun celebrations. Youth who marry girls from this village are told about the practice in advance so that they do not expect to be honored during 'Thalai diwali'(Tamil: தலை தீபாவளி), the first diwali after marriage. However, the villagers celebrate Pongal in a grand manner wearing new clothes and preparing sweet Pongal along with the engagement of a bull taming sport called Manju Virattu(Tamil: மஞ்சு விரட்டு). Apart from the above, Goat rearing(Tamil: வெள்ளாடு வளர்ப்பு) is also prohibited here in order to protect and safeguard smaller plants, flags and trees around the villages to preserve the village ecosystem. Only 'Sheep' culture(Tamil: செம்மறியாடு வளர்ப்பு) is allowed here. 56 ஆண்டுகளாக தீபாவளியை துறந்த கிராம மக்கள்: பரபரப்பு இல்லாத 12 பட்டி கிராமங்கள்பொருளாதாரத்தில் ஏற்றத்தாழ்வு: 53 ஆண்டுகளாக தீபாவளியைப் புறக்கணிக்கும் கிராமம்http://www.dinamani.com/all-editions/edition- madurai/sivagangai/2017/oct/18/சிவகங்கை-அருகே-60-ஆண்டுகளாக-தீபாவளி-கொண்டாடாத-12-கிராமங்கள்-2792149.html Temples Sri Kadukavalar Swamy Temple Sri Kadukavalar temple during sunset There are many temples around Mampatti.

The only vessel of her class, Charlotte was the last sailing warship built for the German navy. She was armed with a battery of eighteen guns. Charlotte spent her career as a training ship, responsible for the training of naval cadets and apprentice seamen. This duty frequently took the ship on overseas cruises, and on one such cruise in 1897, she and the corvette participated in the Lüders affair, a diplomatic humiliation of Haiti over the arrest and jailing of a German national. Charlotte also took part in other diplomatic initiatives, including in 1899 the first visit of a German warship to French ports since the Franco- Prussian War. The ship remained in service until May 1909, when she was stricken from the naval register and thereafter converted into a barracks ship and tender. She served in these capacities to the outbreak of World War I in July 1914; in August, she was briefly reactivated, the only time in the history of the German navies that a vessel that had been stricken was re- commissioned. In October, she was again removed from service and returned to barracks ship duties. In 1921, after the war, she was sold to a firm in Hamburg and hulked; her ultimate fate is unknown. Design After the Franco- Prussian War of 1870–1871, the Kaiserliche Marine began an expansion program to strengthen the fleet to meet the demands imposed by Germany's increased economic activities abroad and to prepare it for a potential future conflict with France. Through the mid and late 1870s, the German fleet ordered twelve corvettes of the and es; these vessels had limited combat capabilities, emphasizing long range cruising rather than engaging hostile cruisers. This program began under the direction of General Albrecht von Stosch, the chief of the Kaiserliche Admiralität (Imperial Admiralty); he was replaced in 1883 by General Leo von Caprivi. Caprivi believed that all new cruisers should have a more balanced design that placed greater emphasis on combat power. Nevertheless, he authorized two new corvettes that were laid down in 1883, Charlotte and a smaller vessel, . The design for Charlotte had been prepared in 1881–1882, essentially as a repeat of the Bismarck design, though she was slightly larger and carried a heavier armament. Due to the time the ship was built, a transitional period between traditional sail-powered ships armed with slow-firing breech-loading guns and modern cruisers armed with quick-firing guns and powered solely with steam engines, Charlotte emerged as an anachronism compared to contemporary cruising vessels in other fleets. But the German navy still placed an emphasis on training its sailors to use sails, so the full rigging was retained, making Charlotte the last vessel of the Kaiserliche Marine to be equipped with a sailing rig. In addition, despite Caprivi's insistence that new cruisers should be capable of combat, Charlotte was designed with the role as a training ship in mind, which was better suited to the characteristics of the earlier corvettes. Characteristics Charlotte was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of forward and . She displaced normally and up to at full load. The ship's hull was constructed with transverse iron frames with one layer of wood planks, which were sheathed with Muntz metal to prevent biofouling on extended cruises abroad, where shipyard facilities were not readily available. She had a double bottom below the engine room and her hull was divided into ten watertight compartments. The ship's crew consisted of 20 officers and 486 enlisted men, though as a training ship later in her career, her complement amounted to 20 officers and 475 sailors, of whom 50 were naval cadets and 230 were Schiffsjungen (apprentice seamen). She carried a variety of small boats, including one picket boat, two launches, six cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy. Steering was controlled with a single rudder. The vessel was a good sea boat, but she made bad leeway in even mild winds and she was difficult to maneuver. She lost a significant amount of speed in a head sea, and she had limited performance under sail. Machinery Illustration of Charlotte underway The ship was powered by a pair of 2-cylinder marine steam engines that were coupled together driving a single shaft with one 2-bladed screw propeller. Steam was provided by eight coal-fired fire-tube boilers, which were ducted into two retractable funnels. The ship had a top speed of at . Coal storage amounted to . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of , though this fell to at . As built, Charlotte was equipped with a full ship rig to supplement their steam engines on overseas cruising missions, but this was later reduced to a barque rig. In 1903–1905, Charlotte was modernized, which involved the removal of the second engine and two of the boilers. The remaining six boilers were replaced with newer equipment. This reduced her speed to from , though her cruising range was increased to at her maximum speed. Armament Charlotte was armed with a battery of eighteen L/22 breech-loading hoop guns, six of which were later removed in 1899; these were supplied with a total of 1868 shells for her guns. These guns had a range of . She also had two SK L/30 quick-firing guns and six Hotchkiss revolver cannon. In 1899, her secondary armament was revised to a pair of SK L/35 guns, sixteen of the 8.8 cm SK L/30 guns and four of the Hotchkiss cannon. Service history Construction The keel for Charlotte was laid down on 2 April 1883 at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven, under the contract name Ersatz , as a replacement for the older corvette. She was launched on 5 September 1885; this was delayed significantly by budget cuts from the Reichstag (Imperial Diet). At her launching ceremony, then-prince Wilhelm christened the ship for his sister, Princess Charlotte. The corvette was commissioned on 1 November 1886 and she began sea trials, which ended on 28 January 1887, though she remained out of service for more than a year. 1888–1898 Thiele during the Lüders affair Charlotte was commissioned for active service on 22 September 1888 to replace the corvette , which was in need of repair. Charlotte took her place in the Training Squadron, and she took aboard her first contingent of 50 cadets and 230 Schiffsjungen from the 1887 crew year. She joined the rest of the Squadron for a training cruise to the Mediterranean Sea, leaving Wilhelmshaven on 29 September. While on the cruise, Charlotte participated in a celebration commemorating the 25th anniversary of King George I of Greece from 27 October to 5 November in Piraeus. The ships of the squadron also visited ports in Austria-Hungary, Italy, and in the Levant in the course of their voyage. They arrived back in Kiel, Germany on 16 April 1889, after which Charlotte moved to Wilhelmshaven, where she was decommissioned on 25 April. She underwent an overhaul and then remained in reserve for nearly a decade. On 22 April 1897, Charlotte was reactivated for additional training duties. She took part in training exercises in the Baltic Sea before joining the main fleet to accompany now- Kaiser Wilhelm II's yacht, Hohenzollern on a visit to Kronstadt, Russia, where he met Czar Nicholas II in early August. Later that month, Charlotte took part in the annual fleet training exercises. She embarked on a cruise to Central America on 16 September. While in Charlotte Amalie in St. Thomas, Charlotte met the corvette on 29 September; both ships were ordered to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, where a German national, Lüders, had been arrested and sent to prison. Since the Haitian government refused demands for his release from the German ambassador, the two corvettes were sent to secure Lüders's release, resulting in the Lüders affair. Charlotte and Stein arrived on 6 December, where Charlottes commander, August Carl Thiele, issued an ultimatum to pay an indemnity of 20,000 dollars, suspend Lüders's conviction, and protect him while he was still in the country, to be completed within thirteen hours. The Haitian government refused the demands, so Charlotte and Stein went to battle stations and prepared to open fire on the Haitian naval vessels in the port, the fortress protecting the harbor, and the Government Palace in Haiti. After the German ships fired a warning shot, the Haitian government acquiesced, though it requested an extension of two hours to arrange the payment of the indemnity. To gain leverage to secure the payment, German sailors went aboard the three Haitian naval vessels in the port to neutralize them. Once the terms of the ultimatum were fulfilled, the German commanders went ashore to make a formal visit to the government, and on their departure, the Germans fired salutes as a sign of good will. The United States informed the German government that it would take action against the German corvettes if they made further demands on Haiti or attempted to annex the country, but the issue came to nothing. Charlotte left the West Indies on 10 January 1898, having been replaced by the unprotected cruiser . 1898–1903 Charlotte, c. 1902 After arriving back in Germany, Charlotte underwent an overhaul, which was completed on 31 May. Her training activities were interrupted by an outbreak of measles among the cadets and Schiffsjungen, which lasted until early July when she began a cruise in the Baltic. In August, she joined the temporarily-formed V Division for the annual fleet exercises. Charlotte embarked on another major training cruise on 8 September in company with the corvette . They visited several islands in the Atlantic before proceeding to Tangier, Morocco in January 1899, since civil disturbances in the country threatened German interests. There, they forced the Moroccan government to pay an indemnity it had agreed to pay and then delayed repeatedly. At the time, Franco-British relations had soured, leading to a rapprochement between France and Germany, the first time relations between the two countries had thawed since the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. In a show of good will, Charlotte and Stosch were sent to visit French ports in North Africa, including Oran, Algiers, and Tunis, where they received a friendly welcome. The ships then visited Spanish cities before returning to Germany; Charlotte arrived in Kiel on 23 March. Charlotte then went into the shipyard for a modernization that included a revision of her armament. She then went on a short cruise in the Baltic before beginning the next overseas training cruise in July. This trip went to the southern Atlantic Ocean, as far south as Rio de Janeiro, and she arrived back in Kiel on 23 March 1900. The ship made two short cruises in the Baltic and to Norway in May and September, respectively, before beginning the year's major cruise to the Mediterranean on 18 September. This trip included stops in Moroccan ports and Alexandria, Egypt. While in Corfu on 17 December, Charlotte was ordered to steam to Málaga, where the corvette had been wrecked in a gale. Charlotte arrived on 22 December, along with the British ironclad , which helped to remove the remains of crewmen who had been killed in the accident and salvage valuable equipment. This work lasted until 12 January 1901, after which Charlotte left to transport the German ambassador to Morocco from Mogador to Tangier. She then visited ports in Italy before returning to Kiel on 9 March. The ship had another overhaul in March and returned to service on 18 April and embarked cadets from the 1901 crew year, which included Price Adalbert, the Kaiser's son. Charlotte participated in a survey of the Adlergrund in the aftermath of the grounding of the pre-dreadnought battleship , which had been badly damaged in the accident. Charlotte then went on a cruise to Kronstadt, followed by another cruise to the Mediterranean on 14 August. During the voyage, she stopped in Piraeus, Constantinople, and Trieste, before arriving back in Kiel on 16 March 1902. After another overhaul, she went on a training cruise in the Baltic from 12 May to 12 July before starting another major cruise to South American waters. She visited Brazil and Uruguay before being recalled to Venezuela late in the year during the Venezuelan crisis of 1902–1903; she did not take an active role in the conflict and she was used to support the more modern German warships in the East American Cruiser Division. She was detached from the unit on 19 January 1903 and sent home, arriving in Kiel on 23 March. 1903–1920 Charlotte underway In addition to periodic maintenance, additional modernization work was carried out beginning in early 1903, including the installation of new boilers, the removal of the rest of the 15 cm guns, and the reduction of her sailing rig. Charlotte returned to service on 1 April 1905, and she began an overseas cruise on 18 July, first visiting Scotland and then cruising in the Atlantic and stopping in Mogador, before entering the Mediterranean. The cruise ended on 30 March 1906 in Kiel, and the cruise of 1906 followed a similar to the 1905 voyage. During this trip, she took part in a memorial service in Málaga in remembrance of those killed in the sinking of Gneisenau. Charlotte arrived back in Kiel on 23 March 1907; the rest of the year was filled with a long cruise in the Baltic and another major voyage to the West Indies that lasted until 16 March 1908. The 1908–1909 cruise also went to the West Indies, during which her crew helped suppress a fire in Santiago de Cuba. Charlotte, the last sailing ship of the Kaiserliche Marine was decommissioned on 31 March 1909 in Kiel. Charlotte was stricken from the naval register on 26 May 1909 and converted into a barracks ship and tender for the old ironclad , which was used as a training ship for cadets, beginning in 1910. Following the outbreak of World War I and the general mobilization of forces in 1914, Charlotte was reinstated into the Navy List under the command of Andreas Fischer on 20 October, to replace König Wilhelm, which had been redeployed as a depot ship in the Elbe; this was the first and only time a warship of the Kaiserliche Marine that had been stricken from the register was replaced on it. This proved to be short-lived, and the naval command ordered that Charlotte be stricken once again on 4 November, when König Wilhelm returned. In 1917, Charlotte was replaced as König Wilhelms tender by the light cruiser . Charlotte was sold to a private company in Hamburg in 1921 and was subsequently used as a storage hulk. Her ultimate fate is unknown.

A native of Orkney, he also held office for ten years as a member of parliament (MP) for Orkney and Shetland.  Early life and family  Honyman was born in about 1765, the oldest son of Patrick Honyman of Graemsay, Orkney. His mother Margaret, a daughter of Patrick Sinclair of Durwin, was his father's second wife. His older half-brother William Honyman, Lord Armadale was a Lord of Justiciary. The family claimed maternal descent from Sir Robert Stewart, an illegitimate son of King James V of Scotland. He married before 1808 Margaret Henrietta Knight, the granddaughter of Admiral Sir John Knight. They had one son and one daughter.  Royal Navy  Honyman joined the Royal Navy in 1782, becoming a midshipman in 1783, and being promoted to lieutenant in 1790. While serving under Captain Theophilus Jones on in 1796, he was promoted to commander, and commanded the sloop Tsiphone in 1797 when she captured the French privateers Le Cerf Volant and Le Prospere. He was promoted to post-captain in December 1798. In 1800 Honynman took command of , initially on service in the English Channel. He sailed Garland to the Caribbean Sea in June 1801, bringing Rear-Admiral Robert Montague to Jamaica, where the ship was wrecked the following year. Honyman returned to England in October 1802 in command of . In early 1803 he took command of the 38-gun frigate , taking part in several engagements of the Napoleonic Wars. In 1806 Honyman took Leda on Sir Home Popham's squadron in the occupation of the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the South Atlantic to take part in the unsuccessful invasion of the Río de la Plata. Leda returned to England in late 1807, and on 31 January 1808 she was wrecked in a storm near the entrance to Milford Haven. Honyman was court martialled for the loss of his ship, but he and his crew acquitted of all blame. Honyman then commanded the 64-gun , and two successive 74-gun ships and . He retired from active service in the navy in 1816, and was promoted to Rear Admiral of the Blue in 1825, Vice Admiral of the Blue in 1837, and full Admiral of the Blue in 1847.  Parliament  In the 1780s, Honyman's father Patrick had passed the family estates to Robert's older half-brother William, a successful lawyer whose career had advanced under the patronage of the Tory minister Henry Dundas (later Lord Melville). Orkney's electoral politics were in flux, as William expanded challenged the power of the previously dominant family of Sir Lawrence Dundas of Kerse, who in 1766 had bought out the Earl of Morton's estates and privileges in Orkney. Sir Lawrence's son Sir Thomas, who succeeded his father in 1781, had neglected his Orkney estates and also fallen out with the Balfours of Trenabie. Sir Thomas's cousin Colonel Thomas Dundas had won the Orkney and Shetland seat in 1784. However at the 1790 election, the Balfours and Honymans combined to oust Col Thomas, electing John Balfour by 19 votes to Dundas's 13. However, Balfour felt let down by the lack of the government patronage which he had expected in return for his support, and refused to stand again. After much negotiation, William Honyman put forward Robert, who was returned unopposed. At the next election, in 1802 Robert was again returned unopposed in William's interest, this time in his absence. Robert was on active service with the navy for nearly all his decade in Parliament, and appears to have never voted or spoken in the House of Commons. He stood down at the 1806 election, when his nephew Robert Honyman (Sir William's oldest son) was elected unopposed.  Death  Honyman died in Paris on 31 July 1848.

He invented the Brotherhood engine used for torpedoes as well as many other engineering products. With his son he built a large engineering business in London bearing his name, Peter Brotherhood. His son Stanley moved the works to Peterborough in 1903 where their engineering business continued to grow. On 30 October 2015 Hayward Tyler Group PLC completed the acquisition of the trade and assets of the Peter Brotherhood business from Dresser-Rand Company Ltd, a Siemens-owned company. Family of engineers Peter was the second son of the fourteen children of Rowland Brotherhood (1812-1883), a British engineer, and his wife Priscilla Penton. He was born in Maidenhead, Berkshire 22 April 1838 and raised in comfortable circumstances in Chippenham, Wiltshire near his father's engineering works. He spent the years when he was aged 13 to 18 studying applied science at King's College School. After practical experience including a period at the Great Western Railway works at Swindon he joined the leading marine engineering works, Maudslay, Son & Field in Lambeth in their drawing- office. He is said to have had a \\"mechanical instinct\\" which allowed him to design machinery without resorting to calculations or formulae. He also had a passion for experiment. Peter married Eliza Pinniger Hunt, daughter of a contractor to the Indian railways, on 19 April 1866 and they had five children but only Stanley (1880-1938) and two daughters outlived them. Peter died at his home 15 Hyde Park Gardens on 13 October 1902. Engineering firms Coldharbour Kittoe & Brotherhood In 1867 before he had reached the age of 30 Peter became a partner in the engineers and millwrights business of Kittoe and Brotherhood in Clerkenwell when their main product was brewing machinery. A restored Kittoe and Brotherhood beam engine of 1867 can be seen at the Coldharbour Mill museum in Devon - it was originally supplied to the Whitechapel Albion brewery. Kittoe retired in 1871 and the firm became Peter Brotherhood.

He obtained a short vocational business education and was proficient in English, French, German and Russian. Lied was also a noted athlete, for instance in 1906 together with Erik Ole Bye he won the Lyle Cup for double sculls. He established The Siberian Steamship, Manufacturing & Trading Company (the Siberian Company; Norwegian: Det siberiske kompani) in 1912 with the purpose of importing and exporting goods through a new northern shipping lane and the Ob River and Yenisei River.Kjersem, Jakob: «Mannen bak handelsruten til Sibir.» Fylket, 24 December 1991. He obtained Russian citizenship with the help of Grand Duke Alexander, but regained Norwegian citizenship in 1931 when he left the difficult times in the Soviet Union. According to the Russian tradition, he long used the signature \\"I.G. Lid\\" (Jonas Hansson Lied) after his father Hans (\\"Gans\\" in Russian). The first expedition through the Kara Sea was completed in 1913 with explorer Fridtjof Nansen and Siberian industrialist Stephan Vostrotin as prominent passengers. The journey was a great success and the international press reported from the trip. Both Nansen and Lied gave several lectures. Lied lectured in Russian in St. Petersburg, in French at the Société Nautique, and in German at the geographical society in Hamburg. Nansen published a Through Siberia.Fridtjof Nansen: Through Siberia - the land of the future. London: Heinemann, 1914. In 1914, Lied photographed British naval vessels in the port of Newcastle and was for this arrested according to the Defence of the Realm Act 1914. According to his autobiography, he wired Secretary of Trade Walter Runciman for help, and the charges were dropped.  The Siberian Company  Journey of Lied's ship \\"Correct\\" and ice conditions in 1913. From Through Siberia. The Land of the Future (1914) by Fridtjof Nansen. Lied's ship «Correct» and Russian boats at Yenisei, 1913 Lied's idea for a sea route to Yenisei came from the English businessman Alfred Derry and from Joseph Wiggins’ book on the Northeast passage. Lied terminated his employment with the Burroughs Adding Machine Company and in 1912 founded The Siberian Steamship, Manufacturing & Trading Company). The company’s main office was in Krasnoyarsk and eventually offices in St Petersburg (26 Nevsky Prospect across the street from Kazan Cathedral), London, New York, Moscow, Novosibirsk og Arkhangelsk. The initial share capital was 142,000 NOK, and gradually expanded to 8 million in 1917. Lied’s plan was to transport goods through the great rivers of Siberia, and exchange goods to West European ocean vessels at these rivers' arctic mouth. From Krasnoyarks the Yenisei is 2500 km og there was at that time no roads or railways along the river. Because of ice this northern route could only be used July through September. In the summer of 1914 Lied organized the transport of river steam ships built in England and Germany to Siberia. The small convoy that should gather at Tromsø also included cargo ships with 30,000 barrels of cement to the Transsiberian railway. By late July 1914 Lied was still waiting for the last documents and instruments to be able to leave Cuxhaven. In bad weather on 30 July the boats left the German harbour even if the low river boats could hardly travel across the open ocean. The Tsar awarded Jonas Lied honorary citizenship of Russia for this bold operation. In Tromsø the German crew discovered that they were at war and they were replaced by Norwegian sailors. In Murmansk slight panic occurred as the small convoy of cargo ships was mistaken for German navy. At Dikson Island Lied encountered Otto Sverdrup that had run aground with his ship Eclipse. Sverdrup was on a search and rescue mission for the missing Sedov and Brusilov. Sverdrup's ship was pulled free with the help of Lied's boats. In 1916 he set up a complete \\"Bolinder\\" saw mill from Sweden in the town of Maklakovo (now Lesosibirsk) at Yenisei. About 200 men were employed there when Lied set the saw mill in operation. On the same site one of Russia's largest saw mils are still in operation. In 1917 one of his ships were sunk by a submarine and Jonas' brother Hjalmar perished. His Russian citizenship allowed Lied to take control over Russian companies, including the shareholder majority for all private boats on Yenisei and some 50 river boats and 140 barges on Ob. Lied also built a fish canning factory in the same area. On a trip to the US in March 1917 he had meetings with Theodore Roosevelt. Lied planned to invite Roosevelt on an expedition to Siberia, just like he had done with Nansen a few years earlier. In the meantime the February Revolution took place. The plan involving Roosevelt was never completed.  Revolution  Lied resided in Petrograd (St Petersburg) at the time of the October revolution. He had meetings with Lenin and Trotsky at the Smolny Institute in 1917 and describes the unusual experience in his autobiography. During the meeting Trotsky had a constant grip on the pistol in his pocket, according to Lied's autobiography. The purpose of the meeting was to reach an agreement with the new regime for his Siberian company, but with no result. Lied then wanted to sell the company's assets, but the board of directors in Kristiania hesitated og Lied then resigned as CEO in February 1918. The company's assets where seized by the Bolshevik regime after the peace treaty with Germany in 1918. Lied together with the British intelligence planned to rescue the Tsar and his family from their house arrest at Tobolsk. The plan involved the use of the Siberian company's boats on the Siberian rivers, the operation was called off by a nervous king George.«Han ville smugle ut tsarfamilien», ‘’Aftenposten’’, October 6, 2005. Lied's diary mentions a meeting with Arthur Balfour on March 5, 1918, and with Robert Cecil on March 6, later also with Reginald Hall (head of MI6) and Michael Romanov (the tsar's cousin exiled in London). It is not clear if Lied initiated the plan himself or if he was merely invited by the British help with logistics. According to Anthony Summers, Lloyd George hesitated because he wanted to improve relations with the new regime in Russia, while king George insisted that his relatives should be rescued.Summers, Anthony (1978). Mordet på tsarfamilien: nytt lys over Romanovenes skjebne. Oslo: Aschehoug. . Lied's own account of this bold plan has been confirmed by later research. In an attempt to capture some of the company's assets he travelled via Vladivostok to Omsk in 1919 and had meetings with the leader of the counter-revolution Alexander Kolchak. In May 1919 Lied was commissioned by Kolchak to negotiate with Winston Churchill (then UK defence minister) about supplies to Kolchak's Siberia, the plan was not implemented.  After the Revolution  In February 1920 Lied again travelled to Russia when there was still a civil war. In Petrograd (St Petersburg) he met with Grigory Zinoviev then continued to Moscow. On the return trip he, according to the autobiography, was invited to Maxim Gorky's residence. Gorky wanted Lied's help to get Nansen and H.G. Wells send relief to the starving people of Petrograd (Nansen that summer travelled to Russia). After the revolution the properties of the Siberian company was nationalized by the new regime. Lied then established himself in Moscow as an independent businessman during Lenin's New Economic Policy from 1921. He was, among other activities, agent for the US aluminum company Alcoa. On behalf of Alcoa he was searching for bauxite as well as access to hydro electric power for aluminum production. Lied met with Trotsky on several occasions and traveled widely together with geologists within the Soviet Union. He also explored the possibilities of developing hydro power at Dneprostroi. Around 1930 the surveillance by the secret police and the pressure from the Soviet authorities made life increasingly difficult for Lied. The secret police tried to enroll him as an agent to obtain information about the international aluminum industry. In February 1931 he was arrested and released after four hours interrogation. A few weeks later he secretly regained his Norwegian citizenship and left the Soviet Union with his Soviet passport in May 1931. According to his autobiography he had lost all his money. He soon continued an international business career as senior vice president of Aluminium Union Limited.  Legacy  Sølsnes (now in Molde municipality) where Jonas Lied was born and spent his old age. In 1946 Lied retired from international business and settled on the small Sølsnes ancestral farm. Lied wrote detailed diaries from 1907 to 1966. During this period he had resided 15 years in Norway, 21 years in England, 20 years in Russia, two years in France and to years in Germany. Lied's Return to Happiness was translated to eight languages and became an international bestseller. Lied wrote the autobiography in London during the second world war and he dedicated the book to «Norway by a loyal son». He left behind a notable collection of Russian icons and other art (largely compiled during 1920 to 1924), some originated from the Winter palace. After the revolution there was a burglary in Lied's apartment in Petrograd and additional art may have disappeared. The art collection includes a portrait of Lied by Yury Annenkov (also known as Georges Annenkov). Lied befriended Annenkov in Moscow and met again by coincidence in Paris in 1933. At Sølsnes Marit Werenskiold discovered a previously unknown portrait of King Oscar by Konstantin Makovsky and several portraits purchased from count Sheremetev. There is also a disputed portrait of the author Ivan Krylov.Klassekampen: «From Russia with love», December 9, 2005. Lied donated diaries and records about the Siberian company to the Norwegian Maritime Museum, other archival material is now kept at Romsdal Museum.

It was built in 1823, and is a two-story, five bay by three bay, brick dwelling with Federal style design elements. It sits on a low brick foundation and has two interior chimneys on the rear facade and one on the front facade. The building had three entrances when originally built, but at a later date, one of the entrances was redone to be a window. The attic of the house is unfinished. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. During the time in which it was nominated to be added to the National Register of Historic Places, Ben Summers and his wife owned the property.  Significance  John Morris patented 185 acres in what is now Rutherford County in 1769. This was perhaps his first grant in what was then known as Tryon County. To this land he added 250 acres in 1771 and an additional 200 in 1774, his homestead then amounting to 635 acres. The story is told that Morris's home place on this land was called Fox Haven (also the name of the present dwelling) because of a service rendered by an Indian to the early settler. The Indian, who called himself \\"Fox,\\" gave warning of a planned raid on the area and thereafter had to take refuge on Morris's plantation which then came to be called Fox Haven. John Morris was active in the early phase of the American Revolution and was elected by the freeholders of the county to the Tryon County Committee of Safety in 1775. In the same year, he was present at the meeting of the committee when it resolved to subscribe to an association against \\"the tools of ministerial vengeance and despotism for the subjugating of all British America ...... \\" John Morris is said to have died in 1783, leaving the plantation to his son, James Morris, also a soldier in the American Revolution. According to family tradition, James Morris built the present brick house in 1823 and used the plantation as a horse farm. In his will of 1855 he left \\"the home plantation, with the mansion in which I now live .. .. containing six hundred and thirty-six acres more or less\\" to his son, James B. Morris. The estate also included twenty-eight slaves. Fox Haven remained in the Morris family until it was sold in 1941 to W. S. Green. The present owners, Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin H. Sumner, bought the property, now 432 acres, in 1948. Because of its unusual plan and chimney placement, Fox Haven is one of the more interesting examples of the two-story brick houses constructed in western North Carolina in the early nineteenth century. The house, which is in excellent condition, is distinguished by the well-executed Federal details of its entrance and lunettes.

Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries was a legal case against a cake shop in Gresham, Oregon, in the United States. The cake shop gained widespread press attention in January 2013 when it turned away customers who wanted cakes for a same-sex wedding, who then made a complaint to the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries, claiming their civil rights under the Oregon Equality Act had been infringed. Case history On January 17, 2013, a woman and her mother were invited to a Gresham, Oregon bakery called \\"Sweet Cakes by Melissa\\" (owned by couple Melissa Elaine Klein and Aaron Wayne Klein) for a scheduled wedding cake tasting appointment. The woman selected the bakery after having been a customer previously. Upon introductions, Aaron Klein asked for the names of the \\"bride and groom,\\" at which point the customer said there were actually two brides. On hearing this, Klein informed them that the bakery does not make wedding cakes for same-sex weddings because of their religious beliefs. When the woman's mother tried to object, Klein responded by quoting Leviticus 18:22, which refers to male homosexual sex as an \\"abomination.\\"Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries- Findings of Fact The customer subsequently filed a complaint with Oregon's Bureau of Labor and Industries, alleging the bakery had discriminated against her and her fiancée because of their sexual orientation. Aaron Klein responded by posting a copy of the complaint's first page on their Facebook page, which contained the full names and contact information of the customer and her fiancée. When the couple discovered this, they had their lawyer contact Klein, who then removed the posting. While only up for a single day, this posting ultimately resulted in death threats against the couple and their family. On February 1, 2013, news media became aware of the case despite the couple's efforts to avoid public attention. A few weeks after, a demonstration occurred outside the bakery criticizing their refusal to make the cake, though it was organized by individuals with no association with the original couple, and the couple did not attend it. After receiving extensive criticism on Facebook and in the news, the Kleins closed their storefront in September 2013, switching to operating the business from their home. In April 2015, an administrative court made a preliminary decision to fine the business $135,000. The Kleins in turn opened a GoFundMe page, \\"Support Sweet Cakes by Melissa\\", which raised over $100,000 before it was shut down by GoFundMe, who stated that the campaign violated their terms of service. Go Fund Me later released a statement saying that the Kleins would receive all the donations. In a statement, GoFundMe confirmed that the funds raised before the appeal was shut down would still be available for withdrawal. The administrative court's decision was confirmed in a final order by the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries in July 2015. The final text of the order reads as follows: The cease and desist order has been widely described as a gag order, and has brought national attention to this case on first amendment free speech grounds. However, this part of the order was consistent with another Oregon state law (ORS 659A.409) which prohibits businesses from advertising an intention to discriminate against customers, including on the basis of sexual orientation. The Kleins stated that they would contest the Bureau's decision. However, after appealing for 6 months, Aaron Klein paid the final order with interest, though still stating he would continue to appeal the order on free speech grounds. In December 2017, an appeals court upheld the amount of the penalty, as well as making a determination that the original decision did not violate the Kleins' freedom of speech, as it simply \\"requires their compliance with a neutral law.\\" The opinion issued by the court contained several interpretations on matters of contention. First, the court rejected the Kleins' argument that there was a distinction between sexual orientation and \\"gay conduct\\" (i.e. a same-sex wedding) and found \\"we hold that their refusal to serve the complainants is the type of discrimination 'on account of sexual orientation' that falls within the plain meaning\\" of the state law. Second, the court found the Kleins' failed to demonstrate their wedding cakes are protected speech, art, or expression under the First Amendment. Third, it rejected their argument that the state's statute violates the Free Exercise Clause. Fourth, the court rejected the Kleins' argument that the commissioner issuing the original order was biased and that the fine was excessive. The final part of the opinion concluded that there was insufficient evidence the Klein's violated a specific state law (ORS 659A.409) regarding threatening or advertising they would unlawfully discriminate against persons in the future, though there was no fine associated with this specific charge. In March 2018, the Kleins filed an appeal to the Oregon Supreme Court. In June 2018, the Oregon State Supreme Court refused to hear the case allowing the lower court rulings to stand. The Kleins then filed an appeal to the United States Supreme Court. In June 2019, the Supreme Court granted the writ of certiorari and vacated the standing ruling by the Oregon Appeals Court, requiring that court to rehear the case in the light of the Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission decision in 2018.  References  Opposition to same-sex marriage Restaurants in Oregon Gresham, Oregon 2013 in Oregon ","title":"Klein v.

Although the title of Shakkanakku designated a military governor, the title holders in Mari were independent monarchs, and nominally under the vassalage of the Ur III dynasty. Some Shakkanakkus used the royal title Lugal in their votive inscriptions, while using the title of Shakkanakku in their correspondence with the Ur's court, and it is certain that Hanun-Dagan used the royal title.

The loss of this land led Cuffe to abandon plans to settle large numbers of Dutch settlers on part of his estate.MacCarthy- Morrogh p.198 The first Munster Plantation was almost entirely destroyed during Tyrone's Rebellion, and Cuffe's estate was overrun. Cuffe took charge of the garrison at the besieged town of Kilmallock during the early stages of the fighting.

Davidson was a nationally acclaimed expert in folklore, especially that of Colorado and the West. He was born in Eureka, Illinois May 16, 1894, one of four children. Because his grand uncle was past-President of Eureka College, a Christian seminary, Davidson was reared in the school's shadow with the option of becoming either a teacher or a preacher. He chose teaching and was awarded his B.A. from Eureka in 1915. A year later he received his A.M. degree from the University of Illinois where he received Phi Beta Kappa honors. In 1917 he earned his M.A. in social science and history at Harvard University. __During World War I, he served with the Tenth Infantry of the Forty-Sixth Division and also served as an army sergeant in Intelligence. Davidson and his wife Mary, also a graduate of Eureka, were married in 1918. At the end of the war, Davidson simultaneously taught and studied at the University of Michigan where he earned a Ph.D. in languages and literatures in 1922. He arrived in Denver later that year and began teaching at the University of Denver. Before arriving in Colorado, his academic specialty was eighteenth century England. Once in Denver, he realized that Western literature and folklore would be his life work. Davidson taught at the University of Denver until his death in 1957. His course topics ranged from studies of Shakespeare and other English literature, to folklore in the West. He began teaching news writing and eventually founded the journalism department at the University as well as the board of publications and the press club. He was the first faculty member elected to serve as president of the University Senate. In 1940 he became head of the English Department and from March to August 1953 he served as interim Chancellor. At the time of assuming his post, he remarked: There is hardly an organization on campus that I have not been connected with at one time or another. Davidson was named University Lecturer for 1956. Davidson was a director of the Colorado State Historical Society, the Modern Languages Association, the American Folklore Society, and the American Dialect Society. He was a charter member of the Denver Posse of the Westerners, an organization devoted to western folklore. In spare moments, Davidson conducted research, wrote outlines for plays, and authored a large number of articles. He contributed to a wide range of magazines from Western American to Shakespeare Quarterly. Additionally, Davidson authored several books on folklore. The most widely recognized is Rocky Mountain Tales, which presents regional folklore as well as true accounts of early events in the area. Levette Davidson died May 14, 1957.

In 1905 the Lehigh Valley Railroad station opened directly across the Genesee River from the Erie Depot. Following the economically difficult years of the Great Depression, passenger service terminated in 1941. The station was demolished in 1947 although the tracks remained for a while after and continued to be used by the Erie Railroad through the 1950s. The area has become a parking lot for the Blue Cross Arena.

Grahamona was specially designed to serve on the shallow waters of the upper Willamette River. It was one of the largest steamboats ever to operate on the upper Willamette. In 1920, Grahamona was sold and the name was changed to Northwestern. In 1939, the vessel was sold again, and transferred to Alaska for service on the Kuskokwim River. Construction Grahamona under construction in 1912. Grahamona was built for the Oregon City Transportation Company (O.C.T.C.) at the Joseph Supple yard on the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon. The Graham brothers were the sole owners of O.C.T.C. Originally the vessel was to be named Graemona, but it was changed to Grahamona on May 1, 1912. The O.C.T.C. was commonly referred to as the Yellow Stack Line. The names of all of the steamers of the Yellow Stack Line ended with -ona. As of May 3, 1912, drafting work was underway for the new boat. Materials for the boat were ordered from the concern of Inman-Poulsen. By June 30, 1912, the lower part of the cabin structure (called the \\"house\\") was complete, and work was progressing on the upper house. As launch day approached, Capt. Arthur W. Graham, one of the principals of O.C.T.C., announced that there would be no refreshments, commonly known as a \\"keg of nails\\" distributed to guests at the launching of the Grahamona. Graham actually would have preferred to have no have no public announcement of the launching at all. Some people were calling the new boat the Grandmother. The launch was scheduled for 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday, September 4, 1912. The launch was made on time, without any christening or other ceremony. The launch was effected without problem, and the boat slid smoothly into the water. Dimensions, design, engineering and cost Dimensions The official registry dimensions for Grahamona were length, measured over the hull, ; beam, again measured over the hull, measured over hull, and depth of hold, . Measurements over the hull did not necessary reflect the full length of the vessel, for example the extension of the main deck over the stern to mount the paddle wheel was not included in the hull length measurement. The overall size of the vessel was measured in tonnage or tons, which for this purpose was a unit of volume and not of weight. Grahamona was 443 gross tons and 413 net tons. Design Grahamona was built to run on the Willamette River in conjunction with another O.C.T.C. boat, the Pomona. Grahamona and Pomona would work to provide daily passenger steamboat service between Portland, Albany and Corvallis. According to a contemporaneous newspaper report, Grahamona included accommodations for 30 crew. The official U.S. steamboat registry listed the number of crew as 12. The official registry number was 210453. Grahamona was reported to be introducing a number of design innovations, including white enameled bunks and walls in the crew's quarters, a combination dressing table and life-preserver receptacle in the woman's cabin, and lockers in each officer's stateroom. The walls, the ceiling and the cabin exterior were all built of kiln-dried cedar for lightness of weight. Grahamona was said to have been \\"the best boat in every way that has been placed on the upper river run\\" and \\"fitted in every way as a high class river boat.\\" The boat was 150 feet long, 30 foot beam and 4.6 depth of hold. According to one source, Grahamona could carry 443 passengers. According to another source, the steamer' was licensed to carry 308 passengers on a regular basis, and 412 on excursions. Grahamona could carry 300 tons of cargo while drawing only 3 feet of water. Draft light (carrying no cargo) was 18 inches. Engineering Grahamona was driven by two twin horizontally-mounted steam engines turning a sternwheel that was 17.2 in diameter and 18 feet wide. Each steam engine had a single- cylinder, with each with a bore of and stroke of . The engines and boiler developed 700 indicated horsepower. The engines and wheel were estimated to be able to propel the vessel at a speed of 15 miles per hour. Cost Grahamona cost about $28,000 to build without fittings. With fittings the cost was about $35,000. Placed into service Advertisement for run to Corvallis, January 2, 1913. Grahamona was scheduled to begin service running between Portland and Dayton, on the Yamhill River, on September 20, 1912. Service in fact began on Monday, September 24, 1912. The water level in the Willamette was then too low to permit Grahamona to reach Corvallis, so the Portland- Dayton route was selected instead. Pomona was to be withdrawn for maintenance work once Grahamona was placed in service. The work on Pomona was done at the Supple yard. Capt. Arthur W. Graham was to be the first master of Grahamona, but the permanent captain was intended to be Clyde Rabbe. First run to Salem On Thursday, October 24, 1912, the Willamette had risen sufficiently for Grahamona to make its first trip to Salem, Oregon, calling at the O.C.T.C's dock at the foot of Trade Street. The first run to Salem was to be an excursion for businessmen, with the regular run starting Friday, October 25, 1912. The following Sunday, October 27, 1912, Grahamona took 200 Salem residents on an excursion from Salem south to Lincoln, a small settlement and steamboat landing about 6 miles south of Salem. The local newspaper praised Grahamona and urged residents of Salem to patronize the steamer. First run to Corvallis On Saturday, November 9, 1912, Grahamona was scheduled to depart Portland, from the O.C.T.C's dock at the foot of Taylor Street, for its first trip to Corvallis. Grahamona arrived in Albany for the first time at 3:00 a.m. on Tuesday, November 1912, and proceeded upstream to Corvallis later the same morning. O.C.T.C. planned to have one steamboat, either the Grahamona or the Pomona depart downstream from Corvallis each day, while another departed upstream from Portland, so that there would be daily service each day in both directions. The Oregona would be placed on the run between Dayton, on the Yamhill River and Portland, which would relieve Pomona and Grahamona from having to make stops at landings between Portland and St. Paul. T.E. Coleman was appointed the O.C.T.C.’s agent in Albany, south of Salem, and he opened up an office and the dock to handle winter traffic for the company. Problems on the Corvallis run Service to Corvallis required a sufficient level of water in the river. As of December 4, 1912, with recent rainfall the river was 4 feet above low water level, considered, by M.P. Baldwin, of O.C.T.C., to be insufficient to allow Grahamona to proceed further upstream than Salem. As a result, only one boat, Pomona, was running all the way from Portland to Corvallis. Grahamona went only as far as Salem. Oregona ran from Salem to Corvallis. By December 17, 1912, the river had deepened sufficiently. Following a one-day delay caused by a mechanical failure, the company was able to put Grahamona on the full Portland-Corvallis run. As of January 2, 1913, the company was advertising regular daily service on the Portland-Corvallis route. However, business in Corvallis soon proved to be insufficient to justify daily steamer service. On January 16, 1913, O.C.T.C. withdrew Pomona from the Portland-Corvallis run, leaving Grahamona alone on the route, making tri-weekly trips. At the same time, the company withdrew Oregona from all service, temporarily as it turned out, and assigned Pomona to the Portland- Salem run, serving the city of Dayton, in Yamhill County, on the return trip to Salem. The company's recent decision to construct a third, and expensive boat, the Grahamona, appeared not be supported by sufficient business. On December 26, 1913, the steamer Oregona collided with the anchored barge Champoeg 12 miles upriver from Portland, causing a hole in the Oregona’s hull. As a result, Oregona filled with water and sank, with the upper deck a foot below the surface of the water. There was no loss of life, and with the aid of Grahamona, most of the cargo was salvaged.  Business falls off sharply By early 1914, business had fallen off so sharply that O.C.T.C. saw no prospect of revival. Arrangements were then under way for the government to purchase the Willamette Falls Locks and operate them on a toll-free basis. O.C.T.C would be the primary beneficiary of this arrangement, but company officials said it would not be enough. Captain A.B. Graham of O.C.T.C. was quoted in February 1914: Last years of the Yellow Stack Line Grahamona at or near Salem, sometime between 1912 and 1918. Ice at Salem The O.C.T.C.’s dock at Salem was located in a slough off the main river. On December 18, 1914, the entire slough was frozen over with ice 2 to 3 inches thick. To keep the channel open out to the main river, the company had to deploy a launch to keep breaking up the ice every 15 minutes as it formed. The temperature the night before was 19 degrees above zero, lower than the previous lowest temperature recorded, which was 22 degrees. Precipitation falling as snow and freezing into ice in December 1914 also contributed to a lower water level in the river, which compelled O.C.T.C. to use the smaller Oregona for service between Portland and points in the Willamette Valley. The ice conditions continued until December 26, 1914, when the steamers were able to resume normal operation. Service to Peoria By mid-January 1915 the water in the river was high enough to allow Grahamona, then the only steamer on the route, to proceed further upriver from Corvallis, to Peoria, on Sunday, January 17, 1915. O.C.T.C. later applied for a government permit to remove trees overhanging the Willamette upriver from Corvallis, as these were said to be a threat to navigation. On Sunday, February 28, 1915, Grahamona was again able to reach Peoria, where it loaded 100 tons of grain. As of March 3, 1915, there was said to have been 800 tons of wheat and oats accumulated at Peoria awaiting transport to Portland. Labor dispute A widespread strike against shipping firms on the West Coast began in early June, 1916. At about 9:30 p.m. on the night of June 6, 1916, when Grahamona pulled into the O.C.T.C. dock at Salem, Oregon, several persons, apparently sympathetic to the strike, threw rocks at the crew of Grahamona. One deckhand was struck on the harm and seriously injured. Captain Chris Bluhm (c1869-1947) was also injured, when a rock struck him on the leg. Members of Grahamona’s crew grabbed clubs and axes, and pursued the rock throwers. Low water problems On September 3, 1914, when Grahamona passed through the Oregon City locks, fortunately with little freight aboard, there was only 19 inches of water in the locks, and Grahamona drew 18 inches of water at the time. The water was reported to have been at an unusually low level, which was compounded by the use of water to power the electric turbines at the power plant at Willamette Falls. It was reported that some water would be diverted from the turbines to raise the level in the locks by 4 or 5 inches. Low water was also reported as the \\"principal\\" reason for paring back the Corvallis run by Grahamona to one trip a week in late November 1914, rather than three times a week. As of November 27, 1914, Grahamona would proceed as far as Albany on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and would go to Corvallis only on Saturdays, returning to Portland the following Monday. Government takeover of the locks Oregon shipping interests had been pressing for a government takeover of the Willamette Falls Locks. This would act in effect as a subsidy to the shipping interests, as the government would operate the locks on a toll-free basis. In 1915, the government did purchase the locks at Willamette Falls, but the prospect of increased business for steamers never materialized. In 1915, the only vessels regularly using the locks, aside from some cordwood barges coming downriver, were the O.C.T.C. boats, Grahamona, Pomona, and Oregona. Damaged by Morrison Street drawbridge Damage to Grahamona following collision with swinging portion of Morrison drawbridge; note Hawthorne Bridge in backgournd. On Monday, May 8, 1916, Grahamona was seriously damaged while passing through the draw of Morrison Street bridge in Portland. The Morrison bridge at that time was a swinging structure, pivoting on a caisson to allow river traffic to draw. Grahamona was half-way through the draw, when the swinging-structure, which, if properly functioning, would have stopped when fully open, continued to swing around. Although the steamer attempted to escape, the bridge structure struck the vessel, destroying several staterooms and ripping up much of the right side of superstructure, including the pursers office, as well as tearing out hog posts, partitions and the upper deck. Damage was estimated at $4,000.A photograph showing the damage to Grahamona was published in The U.S. Steamboat Inspection Service conducted an investigation into the incident. Pomona took Grahamona’s place while repairs were being effected. According to one report, the accident was blamed on a strong wind and a worn out gear in the bridge machinery. Multnomah County agreed to repair the boat, but the damages during out to be more than $4,000. On Saturday, May 13, 1916, Grahamona was shifted over from O.C.T.C.’s Taylor Street dock across the Willamette river to Joseph Supple’s boatyard for the repairs to be done. To expedite repairs, Supple would handle the work on a \\"day-labor basis.\\" Grahamona was back in service by Saturday, May 27, 1916, when the steamer was charted by the Portland Royal Rosarian booster club for an excursion trom Portland to Oregon City. The total repair bill turned out to be less than originally estimated, $2,129.23, representing $1,281.11 for the costs of materials plus $40 per day for every day the steamer was off the run, plus $848.82 for labor charges. Grounded on Eola Bar On Saturday, June 24, 1916, at about 10:00 pm., just after leaving Salem for Corvaliis, Grahamona struck a snag on the Eola Bar, about 4.5 miles upriver from Salem. At 2:00 a.m. on June 25, 1916, the Spaulding steamer Grey Eagle went to the assistance of Grahamona. Grahamona had a hole in the hull under the firebox, which made it difficult to patch. Water had risen on board sufficiently to prevent the boiler from being able to raise steam, so Grahamona’s steam pumps were not capable of being operated. The water was shallow, so the deck stayed above the surface of the water. Grey Eagle pumped out enough water so a patch could be placed on the hole, but its position under the firebox made this a difficult task. Grey Eagle took the freight off Grahamona, including the livestock, and returned with it to Salem, then went back to the Eola bar. By 6:00 pm. on Monday, June 26, 1916, the crew of Grahamona stretched a canvas over the hole, pumped out the hull, and brought the vessel down to Salem. The repair plan at the time was to bring the boat down to Portland, patch the hole, and return the vessel to service on the Corvallis run by the next Saturday, July 1, 1916. Wheel diameter to be reduced On August 3, 1916 it was reported that Grahamona’s wheel would be replaced with one of a smaller diameter, so that the \\"dip\\" in the water would be decreased by 8 inches which would make a difference at some points in the river. According to the August 3 report: Navigation to Corvallis had already been suspended on July 20, 1916 due to low water in the Willamette, with Albany then being the farthest point upriver to receive steamboat service. Carriage of hop pickers  Grahamona in the Willamette Falls Locks, sometime between 1912 and 1918. For many years the Yellow Stack Line provide transportation for hops pickers seeking work in the hop yards of the Willamette Valley during the early fail. Grahamona and Pomona provided transportation during the harvest seasons in 1914, 1915, and 1916. Low water levels during hops season made navigation on the river difficult. The boats would carry hop pickers, their luggage, tents and family members to Butteville, Champoeg, Newburg, and private landings along the Willamette and Yamhill rivers. The upriver transports general occurred all in one week, while the returns downriver were spread out over three weeks or a month. Once, with Capt. Clyde Raabe in command, Grahamona carried 800 pickers on the boat, far more than the boat's licensed capacity of 300 passengers on regular runs. 1914 season In the 1914 season, on the morning of Saturday, August 29, between 500 and 600 pickers departed from O.C.T.C's Taylor Street dock for the hops fields in the Willamette Valley. The day before, Grahamona had carried 300 pickers, and both vessels had been \\"thronged\\" during that week. According to a newspaper report: 1915 season In the 1915 season, on August 31, Grahamona transported about 300 pickers to hop yards along the upper Willamette. The next day, September 1, 1915, Grahamona transported more than 400 pickers upriver to the hop yards. Low water again proved to be an issue in the 1915 season. In early September 1915, Grahamona found just 1.8 feet of water over the sill at the Willamette Falls Locks. Capt. A.B. Graham of the Yellow Stack Line said that the lack of water in the locks was due to the diversion of the river's flow through nearby hydroelectric power generators. Graham said that the use of water by the generators ought to be regulated, particularly at the time of year when there was such a demand for transport of pickers to reach the hop yards. According to one report, during the 1915 hops season, on one trip carrying 200 pickers in the first few days of September, the water level in the locks was too low for them to be used at all. Grahamona arrived at the locks, but the water was too low to allow it to transit the locks. The passengers had to be landed and wait on the banks of the river three hours for a steamboat to take them down river. 1916 season In 1916, on Saturday, September 2, Grahamona and Pomona transported 700 pickers upriver from Portland. Drowning of a returning hops picker On September 15, 1916, while returning from the hops fields, a boy aged 15, named Arleigh Hauvenmen (also spelled Huovinen), fell overboard from Grahamona and was drowned According to one report, the boy had been playing on a pile of sacks when he fell off the boat. Captain Bluhm, in charge of the vessel, stopped the steamer and tried to find Hauvenmen, who was seen to come up above the water and then go down and not come up again. The boy was the sole support of his widowed mother, and had on him a check for $27 representing his earnings from picking hops. Six days later, on September 21, 1916, when passing near the spot where the boy had fallen in, the crew of Grahamona found the boy's body. On January 8, the boy's mother, Mrs. Ida Huovinen, sued O.C.T.C. for $30,086. The allegation was that the boat was overcrowded, and the boy was forced to stand too close to the edge of the deck. Termination of upper Willamette service Advertisement for sale of Yellow Stack Line boats, August 3, 1919. On May 2, 1918, it was reported that O.C.T.C. would be permanently terminating all steamboat service to Corvallis because of high costs and insufficient business. Grahamona’s last run from Corvallis on Monday, May 6, 1918 would be the last commercial steamer to depart from that city. O.C.T.C. proved to be unable to compete with steam and electric rail lines in the Willamette Valley. In the year prior to the withdrawal from service, Grahamona had carried only an average of 35 tons of freight per trip, when the boat was capable of loading 200 tons. The revenue from the freight carried was insufficient to pay the expenses of the boat. The three vessels in the fleet, Grahamona, Pomona, and Oregona, were to be sold or leased, the company's dock in Portland at Taylor street would be given up, and the company's labor force would be discharged. According to the Morning Oregonian: Placed on Portland-Lewiston route Lewiston service by Grahamona, June 17, 1919. On May 1, 1919, Capt. C. Raabe of O.C.T.C. announced Grahamona would be placed on a running from Portland, Oregon to Lewiston, Idaho. Lewiston was the farthest point that could be reached on navigable waters on the west side of the Rocky Mountains. The run from Portland to Lewiston was reported to have been 500 miles, one of the longest in North America. On this route, Grahamona would use the Celilo Canal, then recently completed by the government at a cost of $4,000,000. The first run was to originate from Portland on Wednesday night, at 10:00 p.m., June 11, 1919, under two very experienced captains, Clyde Raabe, and Art Riggs. Reportedly 100 tons of freight had been assembled at Lewiston awaiting pick up and transport downstream by Grahamona. Before the trip, now reported to be 388 miles in length, was undertaken, Grahamona was overhauled, with additional keelsons installed and converted to a coal burner. Conversion to oil-firing was considered but rejected as it was thought the cost would be too great on the Lewiston route. The shallow draft of Grahamona was thought to give some advantage on the Snake River. Grahamona was only able to make two trips to Lewiston that year. Coming back down river from Lewiston, the boat hit a boulder off Haunted House shoal in the Snake River and as a result had to be beached. Grahamona’s crew was reported to have built a bulkhead around the hull breach, so that the steamer could return to Portland for repairs. At that time, O.C.T.C. officials believed that only one more trip could be made to Lewiston before low water in the Snake river prevented navigation. For the trip, the company secured the steamer Nespelem to replace the damaged Grahamona. Sale to the Inland Empire Company On January 5, 1920, it was reported that articles of incorporation would be filed that day for the Inland Empire Boat & Truck Company. The new company would take over the O.C.T.C.’s steamers, including Grahamona, and would commence operations on March 1. The business plan would be to operate truck lines from the principal landings on the Columbia and the Willamette Rivers, with Grahamona serving on the Columbia. The steamers were to have been converted to oil burners. Capt. A.B. Graham, formerly of O.C.T.C., would be manager of the new company, of which he was also an incorporator. Capt. Clyde Raabe would be superintendent of the steamboat service. The trucks would act as feeders, collecting freight and bringing it to depots on the river, with the objective of beating the shipping rates charged by railroads by 10%. On the Columbia, the steamboat landings and collection points would be at Kennewick, Pasco, Wallula, Umatilla, Blalock, and Rufus. No stops for freight would be made west of the Celilo Canal. However, this formula, which had worked on Puget Sound, did not work on the Columbia and Willamette river systems, and it was soon given up. Sale to Portland Navigation Company On April 1, 1920, a newly incorporated concern, the Portland Navigation Company, bought Grahamona and acquired options to purchase Pomona and Oregona. Capt. Clyde Raabe was to be general manager of the new company and was one of its incorporators. Grahamona had not been converted to oil-firing, and was intended to burn coal on the route. Raabe was going to negotiate with the oil companies, and if a sufficient supply of oil fuel could be obtained, the conversion would proceed. As of the date of the company's incorporation, April 1, 1920, the route for Grahamona had not yet been determined. Grahamona resumed service on the Willamette on April 19, 1920, running from Salem to Portland, carrying a \\"heavy cargo of merchandise and produce and several passengers.\\" Docking facilities at Salem were donated by the Spaulding Lumber Company. Lack business forced cancellation of the Portland-Salem service on May 13, 1920. Renamed and leased to telephone company Sometime between April 19 and May 27, 1920, the Portland Navigation Company renamed Grahamona as Northwestern. On May 27, 1920, Northwestern was scheduled to depart Portland for Lewiston under Capt. Clyde Raabe, resuming the service that had been interrupted after only two trips the year before. As of November 27, 1921, Northwestern was leased by the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph to transport its line crews on the Columbia river. The lease was reported to run until February 1923, with Northwestern carrying both men and material for the telephone company, on both the Columbia and Snake rivers, with Captain Raabe in command.  Return to the Willamette On September 2, 1923, Northwestern was leased by Captains Chris Bluhm, J.E. Exon, and J.L. Bacon who intended to resume service from Portland to Salem. On June 11, 1926, Northwestern, then operating between Portland and Salem, was reported to have been grounded on a gravel bar just down river from the Wheatland Ferry, about 10 miles north of Salem. By 1928, Northwestern was owned by the Salem Navigation Company. Northwestern operated on the Portland-Salem run in conjunction with a rare newly built sternwheeler, Stranger (built 1928), to provide service from Portland to Salem. Northwestern was forced off the Portland-Salem route in about 1934 by competition from highway trucks. Excursions to Bonneville Dam Cascades (right) and Northwestern (left), at waterfront at Portland, Oregon, August 16, 1936. In the late 1930s, Northwestern carried tourists on excursions up the Columbia Gorge to the Bonneville Dam, a 120-mile round trip from Portland. In 1936, Northwestern was chartered by businessman Ralph J. Staehil, to run on excursions up the Columbia River to view the newly built. Bonneville Dam These excursions carried capacity loads of passengers, which was fortunate, or so it at least it was claimed, for Northwestern, which, having been built for shallow water, required a considerable load before its sternwheel would even touch the water. Northwestern worked with the sternwheeler Cascades for these excursions. On August 16, 1936, the two steamers carried a total of 500 people from the Portland sea wall on the 110 mile round trip to Bonneville. That day, Cascades and Northwestern were rafted up together as passengers boarded, presenting a scene that had not occurred in Portland in many years. Although the excursions themselves were popular, overall Northwestern was only seldom employed in the late 1930s, and had had little financial success. Annual reunions at Champoeg In 1932, 1935, and 1938, the Association of Veteran Steamboatmen chartered Northwestern to carry its members from Portland to its annual meeting at Champoeg. These reunions were well attended during the 1930s, with for example 6000 people present for the 1932 meeting. As the place where the provisional government was declared in 1843, Champoeg was considered to be the most historic spot in the state of Oregon. Prior to the 1938 excursion, which took place on June 28, Northwestern had been lying idle along Northwest Front Avenue, at Marine Ways, Inc., since the close of the tourist season the previous summer. Considerable volunteer work by river professionals was necessary to restore the boat to a condition where the it could pass an inspection to be permitted to carry passengers. This was done, and the boat was expected to carry 300 people to the annual gathering, at a price of $1 per person to cover expenses. Captain A.B. Graham was one of the passengers on Northwestern on the 1938 trip, which took 4.5 hours to reach Champoeg, including one hour to clear the locks. Among those attending and giving remarks at the event was Brigadier General George C. Marshall, then commandant of the Vancouver Barracks. The excursion to Champoeg was one of the last local trips of the Northwestern. Transfer to Alaska Sale to Alaska interests In 1939, Northwestern was sold and transferred to Alaska for service on the Kuskokwim River. The purchaser was the Alaska Rivers Navigation Company, a concern owned by Capt. Wallace Langley (1866-1946), of Seattle, who also owned the Santa Ana Steamship Company. With Northwestern gone, the only steamer service above Willamette Falls was provided by the occasional trips of the Claire. Northwestern would be towed from the Columbia River to the mouth of the Kuskokwim River, which was on the Bering Sea, about 100 miles south of Bristol Bay and about 200 mlles south of the mouth of the Yukon River. Preparation for tow Northwestern, with reinforcing timbers added, departing Willamette River, May 17, 1939. Shaver tug Cruiser on left, Hawthorne Bridge in background. During the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898, two attempts to tow sternwheelers from the Columbia to the mouth of the Yukon river, also in the Bering Sea, had failed, when the towed steamers were badly damaged in a storm. To prevent this from happening to Northwestern, workers at the Portland Shipbuilding company bolted layers of heavy timbers over and under the hull, on top of the deck, and around the bow. They also reinforced the house (the cabin structure) with additional bracing. This work was personally overseen by Captain Langley. The River Boiler Works, at the foot of Southeast Taylor Street, in Portland, carried out boiler repairs. A special length of rope 10 inches in circumference and 240 feet long was prepared for use in the tow. This rope was to be used between the steel towing cables, because it was more elastic than steel, and would prevent jerking which could damage the towed steamer. A two-way radio telephone was installed in the wheelhouse of the steamer to allow ready communication with the tug and other vessels during the course of the tow. Route to Alaska The projected towing route was to bring the Northwestern to Puget Sound, and then tow the steamer north through the protected waters of the Inside Passage to Alaska. There would still be a long distance to cover after that, and the tow would have to cross open ocean around the Alaska Peninsula and through the Aleutian Islands to the town of Bethel, at the mouth of the Kuskokwim. The tow to Alaska would be long (2,611 miles from Clallam Bay and hazardous. A small crew would remain on the Northwestern while under tow, to keep steam up in the boiler and steer the vessel. When the boat departed Port Townsend, a few days after leaving Portland, there was a crew of 10 on board, including seven persons from Portland and three from Seattle. Departure On Wednesday, May 17, 1939, Northwestern departed Portland in tow of the diesel tug Cruiser, owned by the Shaver firm. At Astoria, Oregon, the Arthur Foss was scheduled to take over for the rest of the voyage. However Arthur Foss was not available, and as of May 19, 1939, Northwestern was waiting at the Port of Astoria terminal for another tug. On Saturday, May 20, 1939, the two vessels reached Port Townsend, Washington at the northernmost part of Puget Sound. Northwestern and the tug departed Port Townsend three hours later. (Another source gives the point of departure as Clallam Bay.) Early in the morning on Friday, May 26, 1939, the tug and tow were reported to have been at the Wrangell Narrows, a distance of about 935 miles from Portland according to the route followed. (Another source indicates the departure point was to have been Port Angeles. As of June 14, 1939, Northwestern and the tug had last been reported seen at Goodnews Bay, which is about 120 miles south of Bethel. However, no direct communication from the tow had been communicated either to Wallace Langley or to the tow boat operator. The steamer had encountered no real difficulties on the tow until it reached the vicinity of Kodiak Island. Rough sea conditions there began to seriously damage the boat, breaking the hog chains and twisting the upper cabin structure out of shape. Water flooded the lower deck and the crew were compelled to wear life preservers for two days. The tug and tow reached the harbor at Chigoik, Alaska where repairs were made. Service on the Kuskokwim River Northwestern on Kuskokwim River, offloading lumber at Sterling Landing, intended for use at Yankee Camp, ca. 1948. Northwestern was intended to run on a route between Bethel and McGrath. Bethel was the head of navigation for ocean-going vessels. The length of Bethel-McGrath route has been reported differently. Sources say it was 500, 550 or 650) miles long. After Northwestern arrived at Bethel in 1939, the steamer was put on the route up river to McGrath. Steamers of the Santa Ana Steamship Company brought cargo from Seattle to Bethel to be distributed to McGrath and inland points en route by sternwheelers on the river. 1939 season Northwestern made three round trips before the close of the 1939 summer river transport season due to ice on the river. Northwestern operated with another sternwheeler, the Langley Working with three barges, the two steamers moved 3100 tons of freight between Bethel and McGrath. McGrath was the headquarters of the new owner's river service. In 1939, it had an airfield with regular air service to Seward and Fairbanks, Alaska. Northwestern's first master on the river was Capt. George M. Walker, who was succeeded by the (apparently unrelated) Capt. Eli M. Walker. In October 1939, Northwestern was placed into winter storage at McGrath. 1940 season During the 1940 season, government construction of air fields and radio beacon stations created a lot of business for Northwestern. Northwestern made 5 and 1/2 round trips, of 550 miles one way from Bethel to McGrath, in the 1940 season, which lasted five months and ended October 1, 1940. According to Robert W. \\"Bert\\" Kern, chief engineer and a Portland resident, \\"we pushed two barges most of the time, hauling mining machinery, caterpillars, bulldozers, dredging outfits, ready-built houses to be put together at McGrath, and anything else you can imagine they might need. The airfield at McGrath was almost midway between Anchorage and Nome, and 8 to 10 planes were landing there every day during the summer of 1940. 1941 season Northwestern made six round trips between Bethel and McGrath, each time pushing two barges and transporting 600 tons of freight. During the 1941 season, and throughout its Alaska service Northwestern was operated by officers and a number of crewmen from Portland. They would fly into and out of the airfield at McGrath at the beginning and end of the season. Alaska riverboat owners sought personnel with Columbia and Willamette steamboat experience because of similarities in the river systems of the two areas. Wages were also higher in Alaska, which made Alaska service attractive to employees. Later years In its later years of operation, Northwestern was commanded by Roy Atkins, a resident of Portland, who was also master of Langley as well during the summer shipping season. Northwestern was rebuilt in the 1946 season and did not operate on the river. Langley was hard- pressed to transport that season's cargo without Northwestern. 1947 season Preparations for the 1947 season began in early April, when Chief Engineer R.W. \\"Bert\\" Kern deported Portland for Alaska. In April, the boats were still locked in solid ice. Temperatures the previous winter had reached 68 degrees below zero. To free the hulls from the ice, without pulling out the oakum caulking between the planking, the crews had to fill the hulls with water, then heat the water by running steam lines through it. The heat generated by the warmed water would gradually melt the ice on the outside of the hull, without tearing out the oakum. After this, the boats still had to be kept out of the main flow of the river until the May ice jams had passed. During the 1947 season, Northwestern made five round-trips on the Bethel- McGrath route. Each trip the steamer pushed or towed a steel barge, and together both vessels loaded about 1,000 tons of freight at Bethel. They arrived at McGrath with about 600 tons of freight, having off-loaded the rest at various landings along the 600 mile route. Oil fuel conversion postponed Both Northwestern and Langley were still wood-burners at the start of the 1947 season. They depended on Native Alaskans to cut and sell cordwood to them. Prices for the marten furs trapped and sold by Native Alaskans had dropped to $15 a pelt, down from the 1946 high of $100. With fur prices down, to earn money the Native Alaskans supplied wood in 1947 in such supply that owners of Northwestern and Langley were able to postpone conversion to oil-firing. At the end of the season, the steamboats were taken to a slough away from the main river, where they would be protected from damage from ice during the spring breakup. The steel barges were hauled ashore, to be painted the next spring. The season ended two weeks early due to the early arrival of the cargo steamer at Bethel that year. Abandonment According to a non-contemporaneous source, Northwestern was still in service on the Kuskokwim River as of June 1949. However, according to contemporaneous source, as of June 25, 1949 Northwestern was \\"virtually abandoned\\" on bank of the Kuskokwim river near McGrath.

Following his terminal prognosis for melanoma, he became an activist and fundraiser, setting up an eponymous appeal to educate children about the illness. Early life and media career Bloomfield was born in Montford Bridge, Shropshire. His father Lawrie was the first managing editor of BBC Radio Shropshire after it was founded in 1985. He attended Bicton School, The Corbet School in Baschurch, Shrewsbury Sixth Form College and the University of Central Lancashire in Preston. Bloomfield spent ten years working at BBC Radio Derby. A fan of his local team Shrewsbury Town, he was best known for his radio coverage of Derby County, but also presented content on other issues, including interviewing the Prime Minister, David Cameron. Illness In 2001, Bloomfield discovered changes in a mole, which turned out to be a malignant melanoma. It was removed from his leg, and he was given an all-clear in 2006. However, in 2013, it returned. The following year, after it metastasised to his lungs, he was told that he had months to live. He remained open and optimistic despite his illness. In February 2015, he initiated the Colin Bloomfield Melanoma Appeal in conjunction with BBC Radio Derby, the Derby Telegraph and charity Skcin. The appeal aims to educate children on prevention of melanoma. On 31 March, it reached its initial target of £45,000 after a £10,000 donation from the city's Freemasons, and a new target of £75,000 was set. Derby County had raised £14,000 for it with £10 from every away ticket sold for their fixture against Norwich City. Former England footballer and manager Kevin Keegan gave a presentation at Derby County's Pride Park which raised £600 for the appeal in April. Former footballer Jimmy Greaves and comedian Bobby Davro also gave performances for the appeal. The Derby Brewing Company made a new beer in honour of former Derby County player Dave Mackay, who had died earlier that year, with some of the profits going to the appeal. Death Bloomfield died at a hospice near his family home on 25 April 2015, aged 33. Later that day, Shrewsbury Town achieved promotion to League One, which they dedicated to Bloomfield and to Lloyd Burton, an eleven-year-old fan who had died of a brain tumour earlier that week. Bloomfield's funeral was held on 13 May, at St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, with his coffin endowed with a Shrewsbury Town flag and Derby County scarf. Shrewsbury manager Mickey Mellon read from the Bible, and former Derby player Roger Davies and Derbyshire-born Olympic swimmer Ross Davenport were among the mourners. By the time of his funeral, Bloomfield's appeal had raised over £100,000. It operates a free mobile mole-checking service around the Derby area, and of 500 people it had checked, 28 were given urgent referrals to doctors.

It was previously the home of composer and musical artist Harald Sæverud and his wife Marie Hvoslef. Harald Sæverud Museum Siljustøl  History  Harald Sæverud (1897–1992) and Marie Hvoslef (1900–1982) had received the property as a wedding gift from her mother, Madsella Steen Hvoslef, when they married in 1934. Marie Hvoslef was the daughter of sea captain and ship broker, Frederik Waldemar Hvoslef (1861–1926) and granddaughter of Church of Norway Bishop, Waldemar Hvoslef. The composer and his wife moved into Siljustøl upon completion of the residence in 1939. The main building at Siljustøl was designed by architect Ludolf Eide Parr in cooperation with Sæverud. To preserve nature as intact as possible, Sæverud chose to place the house on the outskirts of the currently 176-acre property. Originally he envisioned a yard with many small houses around it. Thus for Sæverud was a mountain farm the world center, half natural, half cultural. Sæverud was inspired by old storehouses and farmhouses from Telemark and Setesdal. He wanted it simple and beautiful. The timber should be naked so that the wood found. Walls should not be sanded and with oblique angles which gave more life to the rooms. In 1984 the property and part of the house was bequeathed to a foundation with the name \\"Marie Hvoslef and Harald Sæverud Foundation for the promotion of Norwegian music and the visual arts\\". This foundation according to the will, would ensure \\"Siljustøl to retain its allure as mountain farm\\". In 1993, the property and museum part of the house was transferred to Bergen municipality. Museum and concert activities are placed under the Edvard Grieg Museum Troldhaugen. The museum works partly to promote knowledge of the life and music of Harald Sæverud. Harald Sæverud Museum Siljustøl was officially opened in connection with Sæverud's 100th birthday on 17 April 1997. The grand piano in Sæverud's study and his personal belongings were placed as he left them when he died. The adjacent outdoor area was an important inspiration for Sæverud's creative activity. Today, the property with its many hiking trails are open to the public. The museum is open on Sundays during the summer and offers concerts related to Sæverud birthday and other occasions.

Its species have been described as \\"attractive, small, cushion plants\\". Description All the species of Benthamiella are low-growing cushions or mats, with small overlapping leaves, and flowers with short or no stems, appearing within or just above the leaves. The flowers are typical of those of the Solanaceae (nightshade family), being tubular with five free lobes at the end. Most species have white or pale yellow flowers, although deeper yellows are found and Benthamiella nordenskioldii may have flowers tinged with violet. Taxonomy The genus was first described in 1883 by Carlo Luigi Spegazzini. The name commemorates George Bentham, whose great work (with Joseph Dalton Hooker), Genera Plantarum, setting out the \\"Bentham & Hooker system\\", was completed in that year. Two species, Benthamiella azorella and Benthamiella spegazziniana, were at one time placed in a separate genus Saccardophytum, on the basis of two rather than five exserted stamens (i.e. stamens appearing outside the flower tube). They are now considered to be part of Benthamiella. Species , The Plant List accepts the following species: *Benthamiella azorella (Skottsb.) C.Soriano *Benthamiella azorelloides Speg. *Benthamiella chubutensis C.Soriano *Benthamiella graminifolia Skottsb. *Benthamiella lanata C.Soriano *Benthamiella longifolia Speg. *Benthamiella nordenskioldii Dusén ex N.E.Br.

Benthamiella species are found in treeless areas of open countryside, ranging from low-lying areas of central Patagonia to areas above . Most receive of rain a year. Only B. nordenskioldii is found in the alpine zone. Cultivation , four species were in cultivation: B. azorella, B. longifolia, B. nordenskioldii and B. patagonica.

In young life he assisted his father in the preparation of his important Survey of Suffolk, which took the form of a volume (1735) entitled The Suffolk Traveller, an extensive gazetteer in which the parishes and towns, and the principal landowners, seats, advowsons, antiquities and industries of the two counties of West and East Suffolk were described, the text counterpart of John Kirby's County Map published in 1736.J.M.

In 1739 Joshua married Sarah Bull, and his children Sarah (afterwards Mrs. Sarah Trimmer) and William soon followed. From an early age he was very studious, but, showing special aptitude as an artist, he settled down to work as a painter in Ipswich and accepted commissions. He was particularly interested in Perspective, and began to prepare a Treatise on the subject before discovering the work of Dr. Brook Taylor.Gentleman's Magazine 78, January 1808, pp. 4–5 Making the friendship of Thomas Gainsborough he became interested in landscape, and with the encouragement of the antiquary Sir Joseph Ayloffe (who was developing materials for an extensive History of Suffolk) he prepared illustrations of ancient buildings and monuments in the county.Sidney Lee, 'Ayloffe, Joseph, in L.

In 1751 he issued proposalsIpswich Journal, 21 September 1751. for a quarto volume on Brook Taylor's Perspective, made easy, both in Theory and Practice, to have a frontispiece by William Hogarth. By its title Kirby claimed less than his share of credit for its originality.Gentleman's Magazine 78, January 1808, pp. 4–5 The first edition appeared early in 1754.Ipswich Journal, 17 February 1754. In this period he frequently visited London. He was admitted an honorary member of Hogarth's instructional project, the St Martin's Lane Academy, where he lectured on perspective. By 1754 he had already received so much encouragement from distinguished artists that his first edition was over- subscribed,Ipswich Journal, 9 February 1754. and, with 50 copper plates, a second issue was made the following year, price (to Subscribers) one guinea.

The Prince thought so highly of him that he instructed Kirby to produce architectural illustrations, and with his liberal support in 1761 Kirby published them (including one by the Prince himself) in his masterly new two-volume work, The Perspective of Architecture.Gentleman's Magazine 78, January 1808, pp. 4–5 It embodied 'new principles for a complete system of the perspective of Architecture, both as it relates to the true delineation of objects, and the doctrine of light and shadow'. The first part described the use of the Architectonic Sector, an instrument invented by the Earl of Bute, and the second, 'a new Method of drawing the Five Orders, elegant structures, etc., in Perspective'. It was much admired.Monthly Review, Vol. XXV, p. 454. On his ascent to the throne His Majesty appointed Kirby Clerk of Works at Kew, in which his son William Kirby joined him. In 1763 Joshua and his brother William Kirby (Attorney at Law, of Witnesham, Suffolk, and father of the Revd. William Kirby,) issued subscription proposals for a new edition of their father's work, and the second, enlarged edition of The Suffolk Traveller appeared in 1764 and the Map in 1766.Blatchly, John Kirby's Suffolk 2004, pp. xx–xv. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1767, and also Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. Fresh editions of the Method of Perspective made Easy were produced in 1765 and 1768, and this remained a popular standard work until superseded by that of Thomas Malton, published in 1771. From 1768 to 1771Freeman, Life of William Kirby 1852, publishes a letter apparently dated 1760 referring to this appointment. Kirby was President of the Incorporated Society of Artists, a divided organisation in the decline of which the Royal Academy was planned and formed,Gentleman's Magazine 78, January 1808, pp. 4–5 in which he declined to accept a Professorship of Perspective. Kirby, a devout and somewhat modest man, had great pride in his son William, who was sent to Italy to study for three years 1768–71 at the King's personal expense, and returned full of promise. However William died suddenly, soon after his return to England.Freeman, Life of William Kirby 1852, p. 11.

Det frivillige Skyttervesen can be compared to the American Civilian Marksmanship Program.  History  Shooting sports in Norway can be traced back to Det bergenske Skydeselskab (Bergen Shooting Club) which was founded in 1769. During the 1800s, the defense oriented shooting movement began, and in 1861 this form of shooting was gathered under the Centralforeningen for Udbrædelse af Legemsøvelser og Vaabenbrug (later The Norwegian Confederation of Sports). In 1882, the shooting sports in Norway was split with the founding of the Folkevæpningssamlags as a competing organisation to Centralforeningen. In 1893, the Norwegian Civilian Marksmanship Association (Det frivillige Skyttervesen) was founded, with all the shooting clubs in the Centralforeningen and Folkevæpningssamlags being gathered under one organisation with the goal to strengthen Norway's defense capabilities, especially by training the people in shooting and by ensuring that modern firearms became widespread.folkevæpningssamlag – Great Norwegian Encyclopedia  Mission statement  The mission of Det frivillige Skyttervesen is to promote a healthy gun culture and marksmanship skills, as well as to secure a decentralization of shooting ranges, for the benefit of the Norwegian Armed Forces and the Norwegian society.  Competitions  DFS competitions are only shot with rifles, and the competition formats are the following. * Bullseye shooting (baneskyting), the most popular discipline in DFS with some similarities to NRA High power. Shot at a 10 ring target at the distances of 100 m for juniors and veterans, and 200–300 m for seniors. * Field shooting (feltskyting), a long range shooting discipline arranged outside in the terrain in the winter. Targets are scored either hit, inner hit or miss. Juniors and veterans shoot at 100 m, while seniors shoot at varying unknown distances up to 600 m. * Field rapid shooting (felthurtigskyting) is a speed shooting event where the shooter has to engage three different targets placed at different unknown distances with one shot each in the shortest time possible. * Small-bore shooting indoor at 15 m for all classes with .22 lr rifles at a 10 ring target, popular in the winter. * Nordic field biathlon skifeltskyting), a form of biathlon in the winter with skiing and shooting. * Nordic shooting with cross-country running (skogsløp or springskytte), a form of biathlon in the summer with running and shooting. * Stang shooting (stangskyting), a speed shooting competition where the shooter has two periods of 25 seconds to get as many hits as possible on a target at an unknown distance, with an unlimited number of rounds.

It aired on April 23, 2015 on ABC in the United States. The episode was written by showrunner Shonda Rhimes and directed by Rob Hardy, making it the first episode Rhimes has written since the season eight finale \\"Flight\\". The installment marked the death and final appearance of the series’ male lead character, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), who had starred on the series since its inception. In this episode, Shepherd is involved in an accident while attempting to help the victims of a car accident. He is later pronounced brain dead, in part due to the surgeons not providing him with a timely CT scan. Only six regular cast membersEllen Pompeo, Patrick Dempsey, Chandra Wilson, Kevin McKidd, Sarah Drew and Caterina Scorsone appear in the episode. \\"How to Save a Life\\" also marks the first appearance of Dr. Penelope Blake (Samantha Sloyan). The episode's original broadcast was watched by 9.55 million viewers and registered the show as the week's highest-rated drama and third-highest rated scripted series in the 18–49 demographic. It received mixed reviews from the critics who were divided on the show's handling of Shepherd's death. However, they were largely laudatory of Pompeo, with critic Rick Porter deeming it the best performance of her career. Plot The episode opens with a flashback of a five-year-old Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) lost in a park. In the present, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), is on his way to Washington to resign from the President's brain mapping project. He witnesses a road accident and pulls over to help the victims. He rescues a young girl named Winnie (Savannah Paige Rae) and helps her mother, who has a dislocated leg. With assistance from Winnie, he rescues another couple involved in the accident. Paramedics arrive at the scene and transport the victims to a nearby medical facility at Dillard. Just as Derek is about to drive away, he is hit by a semi-truck, and is rushed to the ER at the closest hospital. He is unable to speak as the doctors examine him, with him subconsciously telling the doctors to order a head CT. However, Shepherd is rushed into surgery. One of the surgical residents, Dr. Penelope Blake (Samantha Sloyan), who wants to perform a CT is dismissed by her attending and by the time the doctors discover his blown pupil, Shepherd realizes that he will die. He is eventually declared brain-dead after the neurosurgeon arrives too late. Grey is brought to the hospital by the police authorities and is informed by the surgeons that Shepherd is brain dead; she immediately points out that they should have ordered a head CT, much to Blake's dismay. She reviews all of her options with the doctor in-charge of Shepherd's case, before signing the papers to authorize the removal of his life support. Blake tearfully apologizes to a forbearing Grey, who then returns to Shepherd's room to say a final goodbye. This is accompanied by a montage of the heyday from their relationship. Production \\"How to Save a Life\\" was written by showrunner Shonda Rhimes and directed by Rob Hardy. It was the first episode that Rhimes had written since the show's season eight finale \\"Flight\\". Filming took place both at the studio in Los Angeles and outdoor locations over a span of three weeks. Samantha Sloyan, Larry Cedar, Mike McColl, Allie Grant, and Savannah Paige Rae made guest appearances in the episode; Sloyan reprised her role in the show's 250th episode \\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\\" and was subsequently promoted to a recurring character for the twelfth season. The soundtrack for \\"How to Save a Life\\" featured covers, recorded by Sleeping at Last, of such previously used tracks as \\"Today Has Been OK\\", originally by Emilíana Torrini and \\"Chasing Cars\\", originally by Snow Patrol, and the originals \\"Sedona\\" by Houndmouth, \\"Gulls\\" by David Gray, and \\"Into the Fire\\" by Erin McCarley. Speculation about Dempsey's exit from Grey's Anatomy began in November, 2014, when Dempsey casually mentioned during an interview that he might be leaving the series very soon. Despite signing on for two more years at the end of the tenth season of the show, he disclosed that he would make his final appearance in the eleventh season. The official statement was released on April 23, 2015, just a few hours before the airing of \\"How to Save a Life\\". Dempsey went on to share further details on his character being written out of the show, saying that it happened very quickly and in an organic way. The developments leading up to the impending exit, he said, had begun in February, 2015. The episode marked the death of Derek Shepherd played by Patrick Dempsey. Amidst speculation of a rift between Dempsey and Pompeo, and the show runner Rhimes, Dempsey maintained his stance of leaving in a \\"very good\\" place with his co-star of ten years. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Dempsey explained that if his exit had been a result of a conflict with the production team, it would have had happened at the end of the tenth season, when his previous contract had expired. He added that though the death of the character might be viewed as a surprising decision, he \\"[liked] the way it has all played out.\\" On his relationships with Pompeo, he said: \\"it’s beautiful. We’re like a married couple [it has been] 10 years, and it was magic from the beginning” Rhimes asserted on the importance of Dempsey's character in the statement she released at his departure: Pompeo posted on Twitter to react to the death of Shepherd, writing that she was honored and excited to tell Meredith's story \\"in the face of what feels like the impossible\\". She encouraged fans to continue watching the series, saying, \\"I hope you will all join me on her journey.” It was the first time that Pompeo spoke publicly about Dempsey's much publicised exit. Reception Broadcast \\"How to Save a Life\\" was originally broadcast on April 23, 2015 in the United States on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). The episode was watched by a total of 9.55 million, up 23 percent from its last years telecast airing around the same time. In the key 18-49 demographic, the episode scored a 2.8 in Nielsen ratings, up 22 percent from last year, scoring the best ratings since the eleventh-season premiere. It was the second best TV show in the 8.00 pm slot, beating Bones, The Vampire Diaries and a rerun on The Blacklist, but was beaten by The Big Bang Theory. The 9.55 million people tuned into the episode marked a 24 percent increase from the previous episode (7.60), in addition to the installment's 2.8 Nielsen rating in the target 18–49 demographic marked a 33 percent increase from the previous episode (2.1). The Nielsen score additionally registered the show as the week's highest rated drama and third-highest rated scripted series in the 18–49 demographic, only behind CBS's The Big Bang Theory (3.6) and ABC's Modern Family (3.0). Critical reception  The episode received mixed reviews by critics who gave a polarised view on the writing and handling of Shepherd's death. Ashley Bissette Sumerel of TV Fanatic gave the episode the highest praise in a 5 out of 5 star review highlighting the \\"interesting possibilities\\" that the death would offer for the show. However, she stated, \\"I'm beyond heartbroken. [...] We've seen tragic deaths and lost beloved characters, but never quite like this. I don't think I'll ever get over it.\\" She also acknowledged the show's emotional connect with its audience and its courage to attempt the \\"inconceivable\\". Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly took the opportunity to reminisce the early years of the show saying that it is the compelling characters that have made committing to Grey's \\"irresistible\\". She added that despite some \\"weak moments\\" that the series suffers from, characters like \\"Meredith or Derek or Webber will have a moment that reminds me why I keep watching, why I never stopped— so watching one of those characters die hurts. It really, really hurts.\\" In a mixed review for the episode, a Spoiler TV writer criticized the plot calling it a \\"self- indulgent episode\\", contrasted it with \\"well crafted departure of Mark Sloan, or by Lexie Grey\\". Also criticizing the absence of the series' major cast from the episode the review said, \\"The presence of so many inconsequential and uninteresting characters was continually in danger of swamping the dreaminess of Derek.\\" However, appreciative of Pompeo's character, the reviewer remarked, \\"the writing of Meredith was completely on point. She was clinical, as we would expect her to be.\\" Pompeo's performance was a major point of praise among critics. Pompeo garnered widespread acclaim from television critics for her performance in the episode; Rick Porter of Zap2it was largely laudatory of Pompeo's performance which he thought \\"made all the difference in the episode\\". He wrote highly of her role in the arc saying, \\"Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances in her long time on the show, \\"How to Save a Life\\" would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode\\". He noted that although it might not be the \\"ideal Emmy-submission episode\\" for Pompeo, because of the amount of time that she spent on screen, it was among the best work she's ever done on the show.\\" Robert Bianco of USA Today thought of the episode as \\"a showcase for Pompeo\\", agreeing that although she didn't play a prominent part until the later half of the episode, but some memorable and well-played scenes: \\"from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are, to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life.\\" Alexandria Ingham Guardian Liberty Voice was also impressed with Pompeo’s \\"range of emotions\\", which she described similarly, as going through many stages, including anger, resignation compassion. Shepherd's death came as a shock to the audience and was a major topic of discussion among critics, who gave polarising views on the character's exit. Janalen Samson, a contributing Writer for BuddyTV noted the episodes generation of shock in the times of the omnipresent media saying, \\"Genuine surprise is a rare occurrence in television viewing these days\\", and added, \\"Imagine my amazement, then, when I sat down to watch [...] \\"How to Save a Life\\"\\". Calling the death a \\"lightning bolt\\" David Hinckley of New York Daily News wrote, \\"In one of the most stunning moments from a high-mortality television season, \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" [...] killed off Patrick Dempsey's Dr. Derek Shepherd\\". Also talking about the shock value Shepherd's death in her New York Post review Lindsay Putnam wrote, \\"“Grey’s Anatomy” did the unthinkable, killing off one of the few remaining original cast members\\", additionally putting up the question of the future of the series asking, \\"with Derek out of the picture, what will become of the rest of the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital family? Is there still a future for Grey’s Anatomy?\\" The sentiment was echoed by Slate writer Aisha Harris who weighed heavily upon importance of the death and its impact saying that despite the show’s ensemble cast, \\"Meredith has always remained the central figure of Grey’s, so this death marks a very important turning point in the show\\". Optimistic of the prospects for the show, she added, \\"if anyone can come out of this tragedy as a tougher, better character than ever, it’s Meredith Grey.\\" References External links 2015 American television episodes Grey's Anatomy (season 11) episodes ","title":"How to Save a Life (Grey's Anatomy)"},{"id":"46517546","text":"The Battle of Taghit was the siege of a fort held by a contingent of the French Army of Africa against Moroccan tribesmen during the South-Oranese Campaign. Background In the 1890s, the French administration and military called for the annexation of the Touat, the Gourara and the Tidikelt, a complex that had been part of the Moroccan Empire for many centuries prior to the arrival of the French in Algeria. An armed conflict opposed French 19th Corps Oran and Algiers divisions to the Aït Khabbash, a fraction of the Moroccan Aït Ounbgui khams of the Aït Atta confederation. The conflict ended with the annexation of the Touat-Gourara-Tidikelt complex by France in 1901. Aftermath, France faced numerous incidents, attacks and looting by uncontrolled armed groups in the newly controlled areas to the south of Oran. Under the command of General Lyautey, the French army's mission was to protect these areas newly occupied in the west of Algeria, near the poorly defined Moroccan boundaries. This loose boundary, between French Algeria and the Sultanate of Morocco, promoted incursions and attacks by Moroccan tribesmen. The battle  On the 17 August 1903, Assou ou Basslam, at the head of 4,000 tribesmen from the Guir and Tafilalt, followed by 5,000 non-combatants of all ages, arrived at the military fort of Taghit. During four days they besieged the outpost and its French troop, but the fierce defense of the garrison and the several sorties ordered by Captain de Susbielle forced the tribesmen to flee and disperse in the desert.

The tunnelling units were occupied in offensive and defensive mining involving the placing and maintaining of mines under enemy lines, as well as other underground work such as the construction of deep dugouts for troop accommodation, the digging of subways, saps (a narrow trench dug to approach enemy trenches), cable trenches and underground chambers for signals and medical services.The Tunnelling Companies RE , access date 25 April 2015 Background By January 1915 it had become evident to the BEF at the Western Front that the Germans were mining to a planned system. As the British had failed to develop suitable counter- tactics or underground listening devices before the war, field marshals French and Kitchener agreed to investigate the suitability of forming British mining units. Following consultations between the Engineer-in-Chief of the BEF, Brigadier George Fowke, and the mining specialist John Norton-Griffiths, the War Office formally approved the tunnelling company scheme on 19 February 1915. Norton-Griffiths ensured that tunnelling companies numbers 170 to 177 were ready for deployment in mid-February 1915.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 49. In the spring of that year, there was constant underground fighting in the Ypres Salient at Hooge, Hill 60, Railway Wood, Sanctuary Wood, St Eloi and The Bluff which required the deployment of new drafts of tunnellers for several months after the formation of the first eight companies. The lack of suitably experienced men led to some tunnelling companies starting work later than others. The number of units available to the BEF was also restricted by the need to provide effective counter-measures to the German mining activities.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 165. To make the tunnels safer and quicker to deploy, the British Army enlisted experienced coal miners, many outside their nominal recruitment policy. The first nine companies, numbers 170 to 178, were each commanded by a regular Royal Engineers officer. These companies each comprised 5 officers and 269 sappers; they were aided by additional infantrymen who were temporarily attached to the tunnellers as required, which almost doubled their numbers. The success of the first tunnelling companies formed under Norton-Griffiths' command led to mining being made a separate branch of the Engineer-in-Chief's office under Major-General S.R. Rice, and the appointment of an 'Inspector of Mines' at the GHQ Saint-Omer office of the Engineer-in-Chief. A second group of tunnelling companies were formed from Welsh miners from the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Monmouthshire Regiment, who were attached to the 1st Northumberland Field Company of the Royal Engineers, which was a Territorial unit. The formation of twelve new tunnelling companies, between July and October 1915, helped to bring more men into action in other parts of the Western Front. Most tunnelling companies were formed under Norton-Griffiths' leadership during 1915, and one more was added in 1916. On 10 September 1915, the British government sent an appeal to Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand to raise tunnelling companies in the Dominions of the British Empire. On 17 September, New Zealand became the first Dominion to agree the formation of a tunnelling unit. The New Zealand Tunnelling Company arrived at Plymouth on 3 February 1916 and was deployed to the Western Front in northern France.Anthony Byledbal, \\"New Zealand Tunnelling Company: Chronology\\" (online ), access date 5 July 2015 A Canadian unit was formed from men on the battlefield, plus two other companies trained in Canada and then shipped to France. Three Australian tunnelling companies were formed by March 1916, resulting in 30 tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers being available by the summer of 1916. Unit history 177th Tunnelling Company was formed at Terdeghem in June 1915, and moved into the Ypres Salient into a wide area facing Wijtschate. From its formation until after the end of the war the company served under Third Army.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 20. St Eloi Mining activity by the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers at St Eloi had begun in early 1915. The Germans exploded mines under the area known as The Mound just south-east of St Eloi in March 1915 and in the ensuing fighting the British suffered some 500 casualties. A month later, on 14 April 1915, the Germans fired another mine producing a crater over in diameter. Much of the British tunnelling in this sector was done by the 177th and the 172nd Tunnelling Company. Mining and counter-mining at St Eloi continued at a pace until the Battle of Messines. Menin Gate Dugouts In autumn 1915, the 177th Tunnelling Company moved into Ypres itself, where it built tunnelled dugouts in the city ramparts near the Menin Gate from September to November 1915. These were the first British tunnelled dugouts in the Ypres Salient.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) pp. 216–218. Hooge 1915 – 1917 Soon after the Menin Gate Dugouts had got underway, the 177th Tunnelling Company left the city and moved to the front line at Hooge to build new dugouts beneath the Menin Road. Between November 1915 and August 1917, the unit was stationed in the Railway Wood-Hooge-Armagh Wood area of the Ypres Salient, where it was engaged in mining activities against the Germans on the Bellewaerde Ridge near Zillebeke. The area at Hooge where the old Ypres-Roeselare railway crossed the Ypres-Menen road belonged to one of the easternmost sectors of the salient and was the site of intense and sustained fighting between German and Allied forces for much of the war. In the Hooge sector, the opposing front lines were almost within whispering distance of each other. With its ruined village and a maze of battered and confusing trench lines, the area was regarded as the hotspot for the infantry, where snipers abounded and trench raids were frequent. Both sides saw Hooge as a particularly important area and a key target for heavy artillery bombardment.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) pp. 148–154. British and German army engineers attempted to break the stalemate of trench warfare by tunneling under no man's land and laying large quantities of explosives beneath the enemy's trenches. Major S. H. Cowan, commanding officer of 175th Tunnelling Company, described the situation at Hooge in June 1915: \\"There is some urgent [mining] work to be done at once in a village on a main road east of Ypres. We hold one half and the job is to get the G[ermans] out of the other, failing that they may get us out and so obtain another hill top from which to overlook the land. It is a significant fact that all their recent attacks round Ypres have been directed on hill tops and have rested content on the same, without trying really hard to advance down the slopes towards us.\\" Cowan's unit fired a large mine on 19 July 1915, enabling the British infantry to take Hooge, but on 30 July, the Germans took back all and more of the ground they had lost. Royal Engineers' grave Hooge Crater Cemetery with location of a deep dugout made by 177th Tunnelling Company When 177th Tunnelling Company arrived in November 1915, underground warfare at Hooge was far from over. Aerial photographs clearly show the proliferation of mine warfare in the Railway Wood sector during the unit's presence there, with craters lying almost exclusively in no man's land between the British and German trenches.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 123. With both sides trying to undermine their enemy, much of 177th Tunnelling Company's activity at Railway Wood consisted of creating and maintaining a shallow fighting system with camouflets, a deeper defensive system as well as offensive galleries from an underground shaft.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 119. On the morning of 28 April 1916, a German camouflet killed three men of 177th Tunnelling Company, including Lieutenant C. G. Boothby (see below). In June 1916 the Germans blew three charges close to 175th Tunnelling Company's crater of July 1915, planned as part of a surprise offensive which captured the ruins of Hooge village as well as the neighbouring Observatory Ridge and Sanctuary Wood - the only high ground on British hands in the whole of the Ypres Salient. Canadian units later regained Observatory Ridge and Sanctuary Wood, but not Hooge. While tunnelling at Hooge during the defence of Ypres, the 177th Tunnelling Company also built a forward accommodation scheme in the Cambridge Road sector along the rear edge of Railway Wood, halfway in between Wieltje and Hooge. The Cambridge Road dugout system was located within of the front line. It was connected to the mining scheme beneath Railway Wood and eventually became one of the most complex underground shelter systems in the Ypres Salient. Its mined galleries were named after London streets for easy orientation. Further projects involved 177th Tunnelling Company constructing new dugouts beneath the Menin Road in the centre of Hooge, located in between 175th TC's July 1915 mine crater and the stables of the destroyed Château de Hooge.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 150 (see the trench map there). Parts of these dugouts now lie beneath the Hooge Crater CWGC Cemetery opposite the \\"Hooge Crater Museum\\". 177th Tunnelling Company also built the Birr Cross Roads dugout and dressing station beneath the Menin Road further west of Hooge,Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 262. and the Canal Dugouts along the Ieperlee.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 228. Somme March 1918 saw the Company working alongside 173rd Tunnelling Company on construction of the Fifth Army's Green Line near Templeux on the Somme, when the German Spring Offensive (21 March – 18 July 1918) began. After this the company was engaged in Somme bridge demolition, and other defensive activities. Commemoration Memorial at Railway Wood RE Grave, Railway Wood, a memorial to men of the 177th Tunnelling Company A memorial dedicated to 177th Tunnelling Company and its activities is RE Grave, Railway Wood, maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC). It is located in the former Ypres Salient, on the Bellewaerde Ridge near Zillebeke, about 4 kilometres east of Ypres. The memorial marks the site where twelve soldiers (eight Royal Engineers of the 177th Tunnelling Company and four attached infantrymen) were killed between November 1915 and August 1917 whilst tunnelling under the hill near Hooge during the defence of Ypres. The men were trapped underground and their bodies not recovered, and after the war, the memorial was erected on the hill.www.wo1.be accessed 19 June 2006wo1.be , accessed 19 June 2006 Lieutenant Boothby's letters The officer mentioned on the Cross of Sacrifice at RE Grave, Railway Wood was Second Lieutenant Charles Geoffrey Boothby (13 December 1894 – 28 April 1916), service number 147252, from near Birmingham. He first attended Clayesmore School, then Christ College, Brecon, between 1909 and 1913. In the autumn of 1913, he entered Birmingham University, and spent a year studying dentistry. He was just short of his 20th birthday when he applied for a commission in December 1914. A year later he was seconded from 8th Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment to the Royal Engineers. Also in 1915, when he was twenty-one, Boothby had just met eighteen-year-old Edith Ainscow. They exchanged love letters over a period of 18 months until Boothby was reported missing in action in spring 1916, having been blown up by a German mine at Railway Wood on the Bellewaerde Ridge near Ypres. The letter exchange between Boothby and Ainscow survived the war and was eventually published by Edith's son, University of Oxford professor Arthur Stockwin, in 2005.Arthur Stockwin (ed.), Thirty-odd Feet Below Belgium: An Affair of Letters in the Great War 1915-1916, Parapress (2005), (online) See also * Mine warfare References An overview of the history of 177th Tunnelling Company is also available in Robert K.

S. Arunachalam joined the magazine's board following Thamotheram's resignation. In its early years the Tamil Times became a crucial source of news about the Sri Lankan Civil War for the growing Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora, particularly as the Sri Lankan government heavily censored local media outlets. The Sri Lankan government published the free- circulation Sri Lankan Times to compete with the Tamil Times. In the 1990s new news outlets started appearing among the diaspora community. Many of these were controlled or influenced by the militant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) which had a strong presence among the diaspora.

Bred, owned and trained by a farming family in rural Ireland he was offered for sale as three-year-old but was rejected after failing a medical examination. His early racing career was unremarkable but he made steady improvement and eventually retired with a record of thirty-five wins and nineteen places from sixty-five races. He was best known for his durability and his performances in long-distance hurdle races and usually raced from the front. He began by running in National Hunt Flat races and was unplaced in his first four starts before winning two minor races and was then switched to novice hurdles, winning one of his next six starts before the end of the 1997/98 National Hunt season. In the following season, he improved through the handicap hurdle ranks, winning seven of his ten starts. In the 1999/2000 season he emerged as a top-class performer, winning eight races including the Morgiana Hurdle, Hatton's Grace Hurdle (beating Istabraq), Christmas Hurdle, Bank of Ireland Hurdle and Boyne Hurdle. In the following season he was tried over fences and won the Irish Field Novice Chase, Craddockstown Novice Chase as well as repeating his previous wins in the Bank of Ireland Hurdle and the Boyne Hurdle. Limestone Lad returned to hurdling in the 2001/02 National Hunt season and won six races including a second Morgiana Hurdle, a second Hatton's Grace Hurdle, a third Bank of Ireland Hurdle and the Champion Stayers' Hurdle. In his final season he won another five races including the Lismullen Hurdle, a second Christmas Hurdle, a third Morgiana Hurdle and a third Hatton's Grace Hurdle. At the end of his racing career he was described as \\"Ireland's most famous racehorse\\". Background Limestone Lad is a bay gelding with no white markings, bred and owned by James Bowe of Gathabawn, near Johnstown, County Kilkenny. He was the most successful horse sired by Aristocracy, who won at least five races in Ireland between 1976 and 1978 including the Whitehall Stakes. Limestone Lad's dam, Limestone Miss, was an unraced mare who also produced Miss Lime, a winner of three races, including a fifteen length defeat of Dorans Pride at Thurles. Limestone Miss was a daughter of Miss Kiln, who was in turn a daughter of Kinneagh, a mare bought by James Bowe for about 100 guineas. Kinneagh's other foals included Drumgora, who won the Champion Chase in 1981. Kinneagh was a great-granddaughter of the broodmare Simone Vergnes, whose other descendants included The Oaks winner Why Hurry and the Champion Stakes winner Marguerite Vernaut. Limestone Lad was scheduled to be offered for sale as a three-year- old gelding at Tattersalls Ireland in June 1995, but was withdrawn from the auction after the auctioneer's vet found that he had an abnormal heartbeat. The gelding was officially trained throughout his racing career by James Bowe, although the day-to-day handling was managed by his son Michael on the family farm which was also home to 60 cattle and 150 sheep. Commenting on the process of training the horse Michael Bowe said \\"Everything you taught him, you had to do it slowly and carefully – but once he picked it up he would die or do it. He was so genuine, all he wanted to do was to please you\\". He was often subjected to demanding schedules, with few breaks: Bowe explained the strategy by saying \\"He is happiest racing frequently and the more you take him racing the more he likes it\\". Racing career Early career Limestone Lad began his racing career competing in National Hunt Flat races, also known as \\"bumpers\\". On his debut at Naas Racecourse on 12 February 1997, he started at odds of 20/1 and finished ninth of the twenty four runners, eighteen lengths behind the winner Mount Druid. He was well beaten in further bumpers at Naas (behind the future Grand National winner Amberleigh House), Cork and Thurles, before recording his first success in a race confined to female riders at Limerick Racecourse on 27 December. Ridden by Aileen Sloan-Lee he won \\"easily\\" by nine lengths from thirteen opponents at odds of 6/1. Michael Bowe later recalled \\"I suspected we had something exciting on our hands when he won that day. My lasting memory after that race was holding him in the car park, giving him a piece of grass with a band playing in the background. They were playing Perfect Day – and it was\\". In January 1998 he finished a distant third at Navan Racecourse and then finished sixth of the ten runners at Gowran Park. On his final appearance in a bumper, the gelding led from the start to win an eleven-runner contest at Naas, beating the mare Our Meg by two and a half lengths. Limestone Lad was then switched to hurdles and ran six more times before the end of the season. On his debut over obstacles he finished fifth at Navan, and then finished second at Limerick and at Clonmel Racecourse before running fifth at Cork in April. Later that month, he started at odds of 9/2 for a novice hurdle over two and a half miles on heavy ground at Clonmel. He led from the start and won by nine lengths from the favourite Almira. On his final appearance of the season he was matched against more experienced opponents in a handicap hurdle at Clonmel and finished fourth of the seventeen runners behind Micko's Dream. Hurdles =1998/1999 National Hunt season= In the 1998/1999 National Hunt season, Limestone Lad began his campaign with three consecutive wins in handicap hurdles: he won by four and a half lengths at Naas in November, by six lengths at Navan on 12 December and by six lengths at Leopardstown Racecourse sixteen days later. After the gelding finished second to Le Coudray at Naas in January, James Bowe was greeted with laughter by the press when he claimed that Limestone Lad would have won if he had not missed three days' work because the trainer was away at a cattle mart. He then led from the start to win a handicap at Leopardstown on 7 February. In the Red Mills Trial Hurdle two weeks later he made most of the running before finishing second to Nomadic. On 7 March he won a handicap at Leopardstown by a neck from Gentle Mossy, conceding thirty-five pounds to the runner-up, and then won at Naas a week later, leading for most of the way and winning by thirteen lengths under top weight of 161 pounds. Seven days later at Leopardstown he won again, carrying 164 pounds and leading from the start before coming home ten lengths clear of his four opponents. On his final appearance of the season, Limestone Lad was dropped back in distance for the Grade 1 Punchestown Champion Hurdle over two miles in which he was matched against the dual Champion Hurdler Istabraq in what was described as a \\"David- against-Goliath\\" task. He led until the second last before finishing third behind Istabraq and Decoupage, beaten eight and a half lengths by the winner. =1999/2000 National Hunt season= In the following season, with Shane McGovern as his regular jockey, Limestone Lad won eight races and finished second three times in a twelve race campaign which saw him emerge as a leading staying hurdler. In October he won a minor hurdle at Cork, finished second to Istabraq at Tipperary and then finished runner-up to Le Coudray in the Grade 2 Lismullen Hurdle. On 6 November at Naas he won the Brown Lad Handicap by nine lengths from Lord Dal, conceding twenty-eight pounds to the runner-up, and a week later he recorded his first Graded race success when he won the Morgiana Hurdle, leading from the start and beating the four-year-old Golden Rule by four and a half lengths at odds of 4/7. On 28 November, Limestone Lad faced Istabraq for the third time in the Hatton's Grace Hurdle over two and a half miles at Fairyhouse. Istabraq had won eighteen of his last nineteen races and started at odds of 1/7 with Limestone Lad, on 13/2, was the only one of his four opponents to attract any real support in the betting. Limestone Lad took the lead from the start as usual and opened up a clear lead but the favourite moved up to challenge at the second last. On this occasion, however, Limestone Lad drew away again in the closing stages and won by five and a half lengths, with a gap of more than thirty lengths back to the Welsh challenger Master Beveled in third. The Independent's correspondent described the result as the biggest upset of the year, whilst Istabraq's trainer, Aidan O'Brien offered no excuses, commenting, \\"Take nothing away from the winner, he is a very good horse\\". Limestone Lad recorded two more wins before the end of the year: he defeated his old rival Le Coudray by twenty lengths in a handicap at Navan on 11 December, and then won the Grade 2 Irish Christmas Hurdle over three miles at Leopardstown, beating Boss Doyle by more than thirty lengths at odds of 1/6. The latter race saw the jockeys of the beaten horses fined by the racecourse stewards under the \\"non-triers rule\\", but the verdict was quickly reversed on appeal in what became briefly known as the \\"Limestone Lad Affair\\". The gelding was dropped back in distance for the Grade 1 Irish Champion Hurdle at Leopardstown in January, but his winning run came to an end as he was outpaced in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Istabraq, Stage Affair and Knife Edge. Limestone Lad was back in action a week later at Naas, when he won the two and a half mile Bank of Ireland Hurdle by eight lengths from Dorans Pride. In the three mile Boyne Hurdle at Navan on 20 February he led from the start and won easily by twenty lengths from Sallie's Girl, conceding fourteen pounds to the runner-up. In March 2000, Limestone Lad was sent to England for the first time to contest the Stayers' Hurdle over three miles at the Cheltenham Festival and started the 3/1 second favourite behind the mare Lady Rebecca. He did not make the running as he had done in most of his previous races, but overtook the leader Bacchanal to gain the advantage approaching the last. He jumped poorly however and lost the lead to Bacchanal on the run-in, finishing second by a length. Michael Bowe was reportedly \\"philosophical\\" about his horse's defeat and explained to a BBC journalist that the gelding had reacted badly to the journey from Ireland and had not eaten or drank since his arrival at Cheltenham. By the end of the season, his popularity rivaled that of Istabraq and Danoli. Steeplechasing =2000/2001 National Hunt season= Limestone Lad began the 2000/2001 National Hunt season by finishing second to Bannow Bay in a hurdle at Cork on 1 October and was then switched to compete in novice steeplechases. He was ridden in his next five races by Barry Cash. On his debut over larger obstacles he won at Cork on 15 October and followed up at the same track six days later, beating the Sefton Novices' Hurdle winner Sackville by three lengths after what was described by the Racing Post as \\"a rousing battle\\" with Limestone Lad rallying after being headed at the fourth last. After the race, Cash described the winner as \\"easily the best horse I've ridden\\". In November he was stepped up in class for two Grade 3 races at Punchestown. He won the two and a half mile Irish Field Novice Chase by eleven lengths and then dropped to two miles for the Craddockstown Novice Chase thirteen days later and won by fifteen lengths from the mare Generosa. In December he started favourite ahead of four opponents in the Grade 1 Drinmore Novice Chase at Fairyhouse, but after leading until the third last he was overtaken and finished fourth behind Sackville, beaten eight lengths by the winner. After the race, Michael Bowe said that the horse had \\"run his heart out\\", but admitted that he was \\"nowhere near as confident jumping fences as he was hurdles\\". In early 2001, Limestone Lad returned to hurdles and won the Bank of Ireland Hurdle at Naas, before beating Boss Doyle by three and a half lengths to take the Boyne Hurdle for a second time in February. He was unable to contest the 2001 Cheltenham Festival as the meeting was abandoned owing to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. At Fairyhouse in spring he finished third to Bannow Bay in the Champion Stayers Hurdle. In his final steeplechase he finished second to Sackville in the Powers Gold Cup at the same course nine days later. Return to hurdles =2001/2002 National Hunt season= Limestone Lad, began the next season by making his debut in a flat race, finishing third in a two-mile maiden race at Navan and then finished second to the mare Liss A Paoraigh in the Lismullen Hurdle at the same track on 3 November. A week later he won the Brown Lad Hurdle again at Naas, leading all the way and winning by six lengths when conceding more than twenty pounds to his five opponents. Seven days later he attempted to record his second win in the Morgiana Hurdle and started third favourite behind Ned Kelly who was unbeaten in seven races over hurdles including the Herald Champion Novice Hurdle, and Youlneverwalkalone who had won the Hatton's Grace Hurdle in 2000. Limestone Lad led until overtaken by Ned Kelly at the second last but rallied to regain the lead on the running and won by half a length. On 7 December, the gelding, ridden by Paul Carberry won the Hatton's Grace Hurdle for the second time, making all the running to win from Liss A Paoraigh, Ned Kelly and Bannow Bay. After the race, Michael Bowe named the Stayer's Hurdle at Cheltenham as his horse's main target but said that he would consider a run in the Champion Hurdle if the ground was soft. He ran twice more before the end of the year, winning a minor event at Navan from the Willie Mullins-trained Catch Ball and then finishing second to Bannow Bay in the Christmas Hurdle. In January Limestone Lad won the Bank of Ireland Hurdle for the third time, beating Commanche Court by ten lengths whilst conceding sixteen pounds to the runner- up. Plans to contest the Stayers' Hurdle at Cheltenham had to be abandoned after the gelding injured muscles in his back in a paddock accident later that month. Michael Bowen said \\"I'm devastated that we might not make it. I'm sorry for all the people in the locality who have booked trips to the Festival\\". On 7 April, Limestone Lad returned in a two-mile flat race at the Curragh and finished third behind Ned Kelly and Beef or Salmon. Eighteen days later, he started 4/6 favourite for the Champion Stayers Hurdle at Punchestown. He took the lead from the start and drew away from his opponents from the fourth last to win by six lengths from the Ted Walsh-trained Bob Justice. On his final appearance of the season he finished second to Holy Orders in a flat race at Navan in May. =2002/2003 National Hunt season= Limestone Lad began his final season when he finished unplaced in a flat race at the Curragh in October. On 3 November he won the Lismullen Hurdle, reversing the previous year's form to beat Liss A Paoraigh by two lengths after leading from the start. Ten days later he confirmed his superiority over Liss A Paoraigh as he recorded his third win in the Morgiana Hurdle, beating the mare by eleven lengths. On 1 December Limestone Lad was matched against his old rival Ned Kelly as well as the Herald Champion Novice Hurdle winner Scottish Memories in the Hatton's Grace Hurdle. Ridden by Barry Geraghty, he led from the start, went clear of his rivals approaching the last and won the race for the third time, beating Scottish Memories by eight lengths despite being eased down in the closing stages. Two weeks later he won the Giltspur Scientific Hurdle at Navan, conceding fifteen pounds to Liss A Paoraigh and winning by six lengths. After the victory, which was loudly cheered by the crowd, Michael Bowe said that the horse was \\"better than ever\\". On 26 December, Limestone Lad faced Bannow Bay again as he attempted to repeat his 1999 success in the Christmas Hurdle. Ridden by Carberry he made all the running, went clear at the second last and won by nine lengths from Boss Doyle, with Bannow Bay two and a half lengths back in third. In January he started 15/8 second favourite for the Irish Champion Hurdle but after leading for most of the way and rallying strongly on the run-in he was beaten a head by the mare Like-A-Butterfly. On 13 March 2003 Limestone Lad made his final racecourse appearance when he ran for the second time in the Stayers' Hurdle at Cheltenham. His preparation for the race had been disrupted after he had suffered from a respiratory infection which forced him to miss an intended run in the Boyne Hurdle. He started joint-favourite with the French gelding Baracouda, and led until being overtaken at the last flight and finishing third behind Baracouda and Iris's Gift. Bowe commented, \\"He was actually devastated after the race. They know when they've been beaten and I've never seen him as put out. There was no consoling him. It took a couple of days for him to cheer up\\". There were plans to run the horse at Punchestown later that spring, but he never ran again. Retirement At the end of the 2002/2003 National Hunt season Limestone Lad was retired to the Bowe's farm in Tipperary. His owner and breeder James Bowe died in 2009 at the age of 77 having relinquished his training licence to Michael two years earlier. In February 2013, Michael Bowe said of Limestone Lad \\"He's probably in as good a health now as he ever has been. He's enjoying a well-earned retirement and sometimes you'd love to go and throw a saddle on his back\\". In November 2017 Michael Bowe reported that Limestone Lad was \\"...still with me, alive and well. He has the rug on him out in the field and he's probably doing better than I am with age!\\". Assessment and honours The Bank of Ireland Hurdle, which Limestone Lad won in 2000, 2001 and 2002, was renamed the Limestone Lad Hurdle in 2009 and elevated to Grade 3 level two years later.

The electric service ended on December 1, 1934 when the Erie switched to gas motorcars for passenger service to reduce costs. Passenger service in Avon began to discontinue before and after electric service ended. Service between Attica and Avon ended on April 30, 1933.

At the same time, Munich celebrates another traditional street festival, which connects to the Streetlife festival to the north: the Corso Leopold. On the European Car-Free Days in September 2000, the first Streetlife Festival was held, at this time from Königsplatz to Odeonsplatz. The festival is held in its current location since 2002. In 2003, a second festival weekend was implemented around the May / June time frame. In 2012, more than 500,000 people attended the two Streetlife Festivals. The aim of the festival is to provide information on sustainable mobility. In which this includes alternative uses of public space, particularly of road space, are introduced and practiced. Clubs, associations, companies, restaurants and citizens have the opportunity to temporarily transform the otherwise heavy traffic areas. Streetlife wants the participants to be active and present their ideas to a wide audience. Motto: Life in the city that is not dictated by traffic. In 2008, the child and youth newspaper Sprachrohr published for the first time a festival newspaper.

Interior of the church Relics of Saint Margaret History The church was originally the site of a small oratory dedicate to San Basilio, and built by Camaldolese Monks in the 11th century. Damaged during the 1258 siege of the town by Arezzo, the church and adjacent convent were rebuilt in 1288 by efforts led by Margherita di Cortona herself, a Franciscan nun, and dedicated to Saints Basil, Egidius, and Catherine of Alexandria. It was then still called an oratory and measured only 15 meters long, and was adjacent to a small chapel of St Basil. Margaret died in 1297 in a room behind the old church where she had lived the last years of her life; the room roughly corresponded to the present site of the 3rd altar on the left of the nave. She was buried in a wall of the chapel of St Basil. By 1330, the Cortonese had constructed a larger church and designed by Giovanni Pisano, in part to house her relics, disinterred in 1456, in that had become a source of veneration. The old church now became part of the nave of the newer, 30 meter long, structure. The saint was canonized in 1728.Cortona Web entry.Cortona antica: notizie archeologiche storiche ed artistiche, by Alberto Della Cella (1900), page 132-155. Fragments of a fresco from the church, attributed to Pietro Lorenzetti, is now conserved in the Diocesan Museum. Other 14th-century frescoes such as ones by Barna da Siena have disappeared. Many of the canvases once in the interior have been dispersed or moved. The church underwent major enlargements and reconstructions in 1738 and in 1874-1878; only the choir and two vaults, the second and third of the central nave, remain from the original church. The present Gothic Revival architecture style church is the work of Enrico Presenti and Mariano Falcini. The facade was designed by Domenico Mirri (1856-1939), and completed by Giuseppe Castellucci. The rich marble mausoleum on the left of the transept by the Sienese workshops and the saint's silver casket (1774) at the main altar, displaying her incorrupt body, was designed by Pietro Berrettini.Della Cella, page 137. The main altarpiece once held a large Deposition by Luca Signorelli, now in the Diocesane museum.Della Cella, page 139. The marble statue (1781) of the saint in a niche on the right was sculpted by Vincenzo Pacetti.Della Cella, page 140. The second altar on the right has an altarpiece depicting Virgin and St Elizabeth of Hungary, by Jacopo da Empoli.Brought here from church of Sant'Agostino, Cortona, Della Cella, page 137. On an altar on the right there is a 13th-century wooden crucifix, originally from in the church of San Francesco, Cortona. It is said St Margaret prayed before this crucifix. On the right side walls there are relics and captured standards donated by the Knights of Malta stationed in Cortona.Della Cella, page 140-141. On the left nave we see a large chapel in memory of those Cortonese fallen during the war, with frescos by Osvaldo Bignami.

Cover athlete EA decided not to have players vote for the cover athlete through a traditional bracket, but rather through collectible cards in Madden NFL Mobile, or through Ultimate Team on the console devices. On May 4, 2015, the four finalists were announced for the 2016 game cover: New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, Arizona Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson, New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown. The two finalists were announced on May 12 as Gronkowski and Beckham Jr. On May 13, Beckham Jr. beat Gronkowski for the cover of Madden 16. Beckham Jr. also became the cover athlete for Madden NFL Mobile following the vote, succeeding Madden 15 cover athlete Richard Sherman. Soundtrack In June 2015, EA revealed that EA Trax would be re-integrated into the game, having been absent in the previous three installments. The soundtrack was also available for streaming on Spotify. The original score of Madden NFL 15 composed by Mark Petrie could also be played in game via the EA Trax option. Reception Madden NFL 16 received positive reviews from critics, with many noting its improvements to the passing game, as well as the addition of the new Draft Champions mode.http://www.gaming-age.com/2015/08/madden-nfl-16-review-for- xbox-one-and-ps4/ References 2015 video games EA Sports games Madden NFL PlayStation 3 games PlayStation 4 games Video games developed in the United States Video games set in the United States Xbox 360 games Xbox One games Video games set in 2015 Works by Junkie XL ","title":"Madden NFL 16"},{"id":"46517852","text":"Len Kent (born 16 June 1930) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Footscray in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

However, these domains are on the nano-length scale, unlike conventional ferroelectrics domains that are generally on the micro-length scale, and take less energy to align. Consequently, Relaxor Ferrolelectrics have very high specific capacitance and have thus generated interest in the fields of energy storage.

The Church of England established November 20 as a holy day to celebrate her work. Life Priscilla Lydia Smith was brought up in Grosmont in Monmouthshire, but she was born on 21 March 1821 in Hampstead. Her mother died when she was a small child.Peter G. Cobb, ‘Sellon, (Priscilla) Lydia (1821–1876)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 26 April 2015 Her father, Commander Richard Baker Smith, who was in the Royal Navy married again and had eleven more children. In 1847 her father was left an inheritance by his maternal aunt and as a consequence the family name was changed to Sellon. In 1848 Henry Phillpotts, Bishop of Exeter, placed an appeal in the weekly Anglican newspaper \\"The Guardian\\" which appeared in January 1848 for help for the poor of Devonport. Phillpotts's request was for new churches and education for the population who had outgrown the local facilities. This request was answered by Sellon who was just about to travel to Italy for her health. Sellon contacted Edward Bouverie Pusey whom she knew and he introduced her to a local clergyman. Sellon and Catherine Chambers who was a family friend took advice from the local clergy and they worked in a local school. With her father's support Sellon quickly created more new institutions. An industrial school for girls, an orphanage for sailors' children, a school for the starving and a night school for teenage boys. She started work in Devonport looking after the poor. Philpott's inspiration of Sellon led to the formation of an Anglican order which Sellon led as after a number of years there were several women working with Sellon and she founded the Devonport Sisters of Mercy. Although this was not the first Anglican sisterhood, she had the consolation of merging with the Sisterhood of the Holy Cross which had been founded in 1845 in London and Sellon led the combined organisation. Even before the organisations merged they worked together. When Florence Nightingale travelled to the Crimea in 1854 she took 38 nurses and fourteen of these were nuns from what would become Sellon's organisation. One of their important early actions was to tend to the victims if the 1849 cholera outbreak which started around Union Street. (online at Google Books) Sellon led the new Society of the Most Holy Trinity from 1856 and by 1860 they had the first purpose built convent, Ascot Priory, built for the new order. The cost of this new building was said to be largely borne by Dr Pusey but another source considers that it was Sellon who paid the bills. The autocratic Sellon would sometimes use a Crosier and she was known as the abbess. The order still had St Dunstan's Abbey in Devon. In 1864 the sisters were asked to use their skills to improve the education of children in what is now Hawaii by Queen Emma.History , Ascot Priory, accessed 25 April 2015 She died in West Malvern in 1876 following fifteen years of being paralysed. Legacy The Church of England sets aside the holy day of November the 20th to remember the life of Sellon as a Restorer of the Religious Life in the Church of England.Holy Days, Church of England, retrieved 25 April 2015 The sisterhood continued through the twentieth century and the last member of the sisterhood died in 2004 and she was buried at Ascot Priory.

It makes use of magnetic reluctance to trigger a passing train to take some sort of action. The system was developed in the 1920s by the General Railway Signal Company as an improvement on existing mechanical train stop systems and saw limited adoption before being overtaken by more advanced cab signaling and automatic train control systems. The system remains in use after having been introduced in the 1920s.  Overview  San Diego Coaster F40PH The technology works by having the state of a track mounted \\"shoe\\" read by a receiver mounted to a truck on the leading locomotive or car. In the standard implementation the shoe is mounted to the ties a few inches outside the right hand running rail, although in theory the shoe could be mounted anywhere on the ties. The system is binary with the shoe presenting either an \\"on\\" or \\"off\\" state to the receiver. In order to be failsafe when the shoe is energized it presents an \\"off\\" state to the receiver, while the non-energized state presents an \\"on\\" state which triggers an action. This allows things like permanent speed restrictions or other hazards to be protected by non-active devices. The receiver consists of a two coil electromagnet carefully aligned to pass about 1.5 inches above the surface of the inductor shoe. The inductor shoe consists of two metal plates set into a streamlined housing designed to deflect impacts of debris or misaligned receivers. The metal plates are connected through a choke circuit in the body of the shoe. When the choke circuit is open magnetic flux in the receiver's primary coil is able to induce a voltage in the receiver's secondary coil which in turn triggers an action in the locomotive. When the circuit is closed the choke eliminates the magnetic field and the voltage induced by it allowing the locomotive to pass without activation. Where unconditional activation was desired specially shaped metal plates could be used in place of a fully functional shoe, however the design of the system can result in accidental activations when the train passes over switches or other metal objects in the track area. The most common use case for the ATS system was to alert the railroad engineer of an impending hazard and if the alert was not acknowledged, stop the train by means of a full service application of the brakes. When attached to signals the shoe would be energized when the signal was displaying a \\"Clear\\" indication. Any other signal indication would de- energize the shoe and trigger an alarm in the cab. If the engineer did not cancel the alarm within 5–8 seconds a penalty brake application would be initiated and could not be reset until the train came to a complete stop.http://www.railpac.org/2008/10/02/a-look-at-automatic-train-stop-ats/ Unlike mechanical train stops or other train stop systems, IIATS was not generally used to automatically stop a train if it passed a stop signal and in practice could not be used for this purpose as the shoes were placed only a few feet from the signal they protected and would not present sufficient braking distance for the train to stop. On Bi-directionally signaled lines two \\"shoes\\" would be needed, one for each direction of travel as locomotives would only have a sensor to detect the shoes on one side of the train. The receivers can also be designed for easy removal to prevent damage when operating in non- equipped territory or to cut costs when only a small portion of the railroad requires ATS equipped locomotives. \\"Inert\\" inductors are sometimes placed in advance of certain speed restrictions as an alert or at engine terminals to test the functionality of the ATS system. On a few light rail lines IIATS has been employed in a manner similar to mechanical train stops, stopping the train if it passes an absolute stop signal. It is useful where light rail shares tracks with mainline railroad trains as mechanical trips may be damaged by or interfere with freight operations and because light rail vehicles can be brought to a stop much more quickly than a mainline railroad train without requiring complex signal overlaps  Use  IIATS shoe in service on the NJT RiverLINE to enforce absolute stops at interlockings. Starting in the 1930s the US Interstate Commerce Commission, in its role as a federal railroad regulator, encouraged railroads to adopt new safety technologies to decrease the rate of railroad accidents. IIATS was offered by the General Railway Signal Company of Rochester, NY as one such technology and it was adopted by the New York Central railroad for use on its high speed Water Level Route between New York and Chicago and on a number of other lines. The Southern Railway also chose to adopt ATS on most of its main lines eventually covering 2700 route miles. In addition the Chicago and North Western Railway installed the system on some of its Chicago area commuter lines. After the Naperville train disaster caused by a missed signal, the ICC required additional technical safety systems for any train traveling at or above 80 mph with the rule taking effect in 1951. Those railroads still interested in high speed operations IIATS met the minimum ICC requirements with a lower cost compared to other cab signaling or automatic train control systems, however with rail travel facing increased competition from cars and airplanes most railroads simply choose to accept the new speed limit. Only the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe choose to fully equip its Chicago to Los Angeles and Los Angeles to San Diego main lines in support of the Super Chief and other premier high speed trains. IIATS installations reached their peak in 1954 with a total of 8650 road miles, 14400 track miles, and 3850 locomotives equipped with the system. However, with the collapse of long distance passenger rail travel and the general North American railroad industry malaise in 1971, the bankrupt Penn Central was permitted to remove IIATS from its Water Level Route along with the Southern and other railroads with test or pilot IIATS systems. Even the ATSF and successor BNSF were gradually allowed by regulators to remove IIATS from parts of previously equipped lines due to the reduced passenger traffic. At the dawn of the 21st century the only IIATS equipped lines were the MetroLink and Coaster line between San Diego and Fullerton, parts of the former ATSF Super Chief route in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas and Missouri and the former Chicago and North Western Railway North Line, Northwest Line out of Chicago operated by Union Pacific on behalf of Metra When the New Jersey Transit RiverLINE opened in 2004 it featured a new IIATS system. This is a light rail systems running on shared track with main line freight traffic and IIATS is used to enforce a full stop at equipped signals instead of as a warning system.

These zero tolerance racing cars were milled, as it were, from solid billet.The Auto Car 1921 July 9 pp. 74–75 Racing program was extensive; tailor-made alternative lightweight bodies, specific axle ratios and engines to suit each event were formed. The driving force behind the S.T.D. and its racing program was the charismatic and ingenious Breton Louis Coatalen. Designer, engineer and racer Coatalen was inspired by the belief that \\"Racing improves the breed\\". Whilst catapulting S.T.D. to the highest echelons of the sport, with numerous successes still legendary today, the costly racing policy may have ultimately led to the demise of the once mighty S.T.D. Combine. Its subsequent merger with the Rootes Group was less than glorious. Conversely it may be that S.T.D.’s loss of direction and withdrawal from racing in the late Vintage period was the real source of their demise. Coatalen famously held that ounces off the engine translate to pounds off the car; this simple design principal together with fastidious balancing, cooling and lubrication produced truly elegant engines.The Auto Car 1921 March 26 p. 563 Coatalen's chassis behavior is near magical and this together with sophisticated technical support and the greatest racing talents had led the company to a golden age of racing successes, the likes of which were not to be seen in Britain for many decades. During its pre 1930s heyday S.T.D. was consistently and fully committed to international racing at the highest level and was synonymous with British Racing. Design 1920 November 3, S.T.D. Experimental Department Order EXP.273 (4 nos. Grand Prix Chassis) and EXP. 271 (7 nos. straight-eight- cylinder engines).Experimental I.P.s’. 6-5-21 EXP/271 and EXP/273 both dated 3/11/20, EXP/305 dated 14/12/20 EXP/412 dated 20/4/21 at the Heal Archive Project cost £50,000 (about £5,000,000 in 2010). These were the first new post Great War Grand Prix chassis to be constructed by S.T.D. Designed by the S.T.D. Experimental Department possibly in both Wolverhampton and Sureness,The British Competition Car, Cyril Posthumus, 1959 p. 52 the highly advanced 1921 straight-eight engine is unmistakably influenced by Ernest Henry's pre-war work for Peugeot and his immediate post-war work for Ballot where the resemblance is particularly noticeable. The highly flexible chassis, was likewise the latest in design and benefited from Louis Coatalen's profound understanding.Motor Sport 1948 March, Cecil Clutton p. 78 Presaging the future of racing, these were the first British racing cars ever to be fitted with brakes on all four wheel, a feature which no doubt contributed to their successes. These 1921 Grand Prix chassis were amenable to changes of both engine and body. Two engines were used in competitions; the 1921 3-litre straight-eight dohc and the 1916 4.9-litre. Body types included two-seaters and single-seater with pointed tails, slanted tails or exposed fuel tank. Bonnets were adjusted according to the type of carburettors and engines used. In addition, radiators and badges of the three firms constituting S.T.D. were interchangeable. The Works selected the most appropriate combination of body, engine and radiator for each speed event. The cockpit arrangement as well as car dimensions were arranged according to each pilot's specific requirements; resulting in tailor-made cars for the Works team drivers. The chassis in all these permutations is the same and can be called the 1921 G.P. chassis. Body type can be called G.P. type (pointed & slanted tails) and T.T. type (exposed tank).

Compression ration 5.8:1, 152 bhp at 3,200 rpm. Two speed gearbox was tried but four speed gearbox with cone clutch generally used; Hotchkiss drive with bevel back axle. Revolution counter driven by the camshaft. The engines mounted in a 1914 G.P. Sunbeam chassis were entered in 1916 in a number of American events; racing having ceased in Europe during the war but continued in America prior to the USA entering the conflict. In the careful hands of J Christiaens who suggested their construction, his car regularly finished ‘in the Money’ winning large prizes including $3,000 (4th) in that year's Indianapolis 300-Mile. The cars also performed well in the hands of Galvin and Louis Chevrolet achieving a number of third places. In 1919 the 4.9-litre engines were mounted in two 1914 T.T. Sunbeam chassis; Josef Christiaens was killed demonstrating one of the cars at Wolverhampton and they were subsequently entered at that year's Indianapolis 500 for J Chassagne and Dario Resta. In the event, they were withdrawn without explanation said to be in excess of 300 cubic inch limit. Mounted in the 1921 Grand Prix Sunbeam chassis this engine proved competitive and effective at Brooklands until 1929 and in Southport well into the thirties; indeed William B. Boddy noted that one of the cars had \\"the best run of successes by any Brooklands car over such a period\\". Some of the greatest drivers of the period achieved fine results with the combination of the 4.9 l in a 1921 G.P. chassis including HOD Segrave, Malcolm Campbell and Kaye Don.(See footnote below.)  Carburetion (3-litre engine)  Various carburettor configurations were used depending on the event, including four horizontal Claudel Hobson (1921 Indianapolis 500), four Zenith carburettors (1921 Grand Prix de l’A.C.F.); however, in the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy two racing CZC vertical Claudel Hobson carburettors 42 choke were used.

Body The lightweight all aluminum body consisted of a bonnet riveted to reinforcing copper and brass straps, scuttle on angled steel, seats tub and tail. Both narrow staggered two-seater and single-seater> were constructed by the Works. Sunbeam did not construct new bodies for each event but modified and evolved bodies from one event to another to accommodate change in branding, carburettors, engine type and fuel capacity. The side blisters on the bonnet were modified to accommodate different carburettor configurations; a hatch on scuttle was formed when a 1916 4.9 l engine was used; alternative tails and radiators were used as needed. Flared front offside wing were used during the 1922 IoM T.T. Approximate frontal area without the wing 11 1/2 sq.ft, with wing and riding mechanic 13 1/2 sq.ft.

In the IoM tourist Trophy the following were used: Jaeger rev counter, Sunbeam oil pressure gauge, fuel air pressure, twin magneto switches, twin glass oil restrictors. Speed events 1921 Indianapolis 500 The 1921 ninth International Sweepstakes Indianapolis 500 was held on 30 May and was attended by 135,000. The 23 strong field was composed of the best of Europe (Ballot, Peugeot, S.T.D.) and America (Dusenberg, Frontenac, Miller). The drivers were equally impressive including Jimmy Murphy, Tom Milton, Roscoe Sarles, Albert Guyot and Jean Chassagne. Three cars were entered by S.T.D. – two Sunbeams for Rene Thomas (no.17) and Ora Haibe (no.16) and one Talbot Darracq for Andre Boillot (no.11); the three cars were identical but for the shape of the radiator and badge. The S.T.D. team was instructed to save the horses for the French Grand Prix. Ralph de Palma on a similarly designed Ballot dominated the race at 93 mph for 112 laps when he retired with bearing trouble. For the rest of the race, it was mostly the American Frontenac and Dusenberg which excelled and of only nine cars to finish the 200 laps, eight were American who invariably also won the race with a 1,2,3 win for Frontenac (89.621 mph & 85.025 mph) split by a Dusenberg (88.609 mph). The talented American Ora Haiba in the Works Sunbeam was the only European car to finish and was placed fifth (84.277 mph) winning a purse of $3,000. The Talbot Darracq suffered big-end failure on 41st lap due to jammed oil pump; Rene Thomas held 4th place until lap 144 when water connection broke. 1921 French Grand Prix de l’A.C.F.  The 1921 French Grand Prix de l’A.C.F was the premium international motoring sporting event on the calendar; the 1921 event was the first Grand Prix in seven years, marking the long-awaited return to normality after the Great War. It was held to great fanfare on 25 July. The thirty lap 321.68 mile race was run on the same circuit that was to become famous 1923–1928 as the Le Mans ‘24 hours Endurance’. The event attracted a strong field of international teams and the latest cars from France, Britain and the USA. S.T.D. envisaged seven entries but only weeks before the event the cars were not ready and an attempt to withdraw was made; this met with resistance from the designated pilots and after considerable effort by the S.T.D. Works at Sureness, four cars were made ready. Three of these were the very cars which only weeks earlier participated in the 1921 Indianapolis 500. Taking advantage of its international manufacturing base, S.T.D. fitted two cars as Talbot and two as Talbot Darracq – all mechanically identical. The Talbot was distinguished by its colour, the Talbot radiator and a slanted tail mounted diagonally with two spare wheels. The Talbot car were given race no. 10 and no.4 and were designated to newcomer H. O. D. Segrave in his first ever Grand Prix and the experienced K. Lee Guinness, of the eponymous stout dynasty and KLG sparkplugs. Two additional cars were fitted with Talbot-Darracq radiators and pointed tail similar to the configuration used at the Indianapolis 500. The two Talbot Darracq were entered for French aces Rene Thomas (no.5) and Andre Boillot (no.15). All four S.T.D. cars were modified from their Indianapolis configuration and fitted with both front and rear brakes. The competitors were started in pairs at half minute intervals. Rene Thomas retired on lap 24 after a ricocheted stone holed his oil tank. Andre Boillot drove carefully and his pit-work was methodical and quick; he had to change seven tyres during the race but nevertheless achieved the best S.T.D. result at fifth place. Guinness had to change nine tyres on his Talbot to finish eighth. The road circuit was badly cut out and covered with large sharp stones one of which knocked Segrave's riding mechanic Jules Moriceau unconscious for the whole of half a lap. The race was to be plagued by tyre problems for S.T.D. as a result of both road condition and insufficiently cured tyre rubber Despite having to change fourteen covers by himself through sheer determination H.O.D. Segrave was still able to average 62.6 mph, finishing in 5:08:06.0 and achieving ninth place. This performance convinced Coatalen to offer Segrave a position in the Sunbeam Works team, which soon took him to extraordinary fame, success and knighthood. The race was predominantly a struggle between the Ballot and the Dusenberg: Jimmy Murphy who was injured in practice and was nursing fractured ribs throughout the race, winning in the latter for the USA – the first such win and the last for 46 years. Ballot took the other podium places with S.T.D. best at fifth place. 1921 Shelsley Walsh The four cars were repatriated to Wolverhampton England; the two Talbot were fitted with Sunbeam radiators and entered at the 1921 September 9 Shelsley Walsh – the premium annual hill-climb in the United Kingdom. The 1921 event is notable as the first time Raymond Mays, still a Cambridge undergraduate, took to the hill in a self tuned Hillman (82.2sec). The event described in contemporary literature as ‘the best yet held’ enjoyed a warm autumn sun and 5,000 attended. H.O.D. Segrave's green 1921 G.P. no.10 with its distinct nearside leverUnder My Bonnet, G. R. N. Minchin, 1950 p. 124 now race no.14 was put in the hands of the inimitable Count Zborowski of Chitty Bang Bang fame; the 1921 G.P. Talbot no. 4 now race no.15 was designated for George H. Day with Bill Perkins as riding mechanic. The event was well attended and fully supported by the Works engineers and drivers. The full Le Mans Grand Prix road-racing trim, high gears (3.61:1) and no flywheel precluded a fast start and neither G H Day 4th (62.8sec) nor Count Zborowski 7th (65.8sec) impress that day. However, once the car got its \\"revs\\", it was \\"a delight to watch, and magnificent on the corners, and undoubtedly the crowd was delighted to have the opportunity of seeing these very latest examples of the Grand Prix type –road-racing machine in action in this country\\". Fastest time of the day was achieved by C.A. Bird with a 1916 Indianapolis 4.9 l Sunbeam (52.2sec). 1922 Isle of Man Tourist Trophy The 1922 R.A.C. Tourist Trophy held on 22 June at 9:30 a.m. was the first in eight years and the last motorcar Tourist Trophy to be contested on the Isle of Man.Motor 1922 June 21 pp. 785–786 The formula was consistent with the 1921 Grand Prix and Indianapolis 500 formula for 3 l capacity and 1,600 lbs minimum weight. An 'International 1,500 Trophy' race for voiturettes up to 1,500cc (1,000-lb minimum loaded weight) was run off together on the same course. The road racing Mountain Course was part macadam, part tar, part stone; 302 miles (8laps of 37.75miles) for the Tourist Trophy and 6 laps (226.5miles) for the ‘International 1,500 Trophy’. The main 3 l T.T. event attracted three modified race-prepared cream and red-coloured Bentleys; Bentley III driven by W.O. Bentley himself;The Motor, 1922 June 27 p. 786 three specially designed Harry Ricardo scarlet-red racing Vauxhalls and three modified dreadnought grey 1921 G.P. type Sunbeams. The ‘1,500 Trophy’ attracted three blue Talbot-Darracqs which were smaller version of the Sunbeams with one cylinder block instead of the two that made the bigger cars; three Crossley-Bugattis came from France for the first time; a peacock-blue Enfield-Allday driven by A C Bertelli; Hillman and three Aston Martin though only one (‘Bunny’) reached the start line. Sunbeam Experimental department modified four 1921 G.P. chassis for a team of three cars and a reserve. The weight was reduced, 30 gallon bolster tank fitted, two BTH magnetos replaced the Delco coil ignition, two CZC Claudel Hobson carburettors fitted and compression raised to 6.3 to 1 resulting in 112 bhp. Jean Chassagne also had his signature ‘Rene Thomas’ laminated sprung steel steering wheel. The T.T. was preceded by two weeks practice on closed roads 4.30a.m. to 7a.m.Carbooks Volume 21 1922, Michael Frostick (editor) p. 66 The event was held in appalling weather, wind, heavy rain and mist reducing visibility to less than 20 yards; later the winner Chassagne described the conditions as \\"a nightmare in sea of mud\\".Tourist Trophy, The History of Britain’s Greatest Motor Race, Richard Hough, 1957 pp. 78, 80 Cars were dispatched at one minute intervals.

Lee Guinness's private steamship yacht Ocean Rover for a long and unpleasant cruise to Spain and hence to Sicily for the Coppa Florio. The 268.43 miles Coppa Florio took place on 19 November 1922.Rapiditas Vol5 1922–1923 p. 54 J. Chassagne had race car no.1, registration number DA6752; H.O.D.

The surface of the 69-mile circuit was rough and included over 1,600 corners. Upon inspecting the circuit, Louis Coatalen exclaimed \\"Quel spectacle de desolation!\\". There were nine starters: two Sunbeams, two Peugeot, three Diatto and a couple of O.Ms (Officine Meccaniche). The cars were dispatched under the gaze of the ex-King Constantine and ex-queen of Greece at five- minute intervals; only four cars finished – the two Peugeot and the two Sunbeam.Targa Florio, W F Bradley p. 82 The steep gradient of the course caused oil to collect at the back of the Sunbeam engine sump, which resulted in oiled up plugs, the change of which caused delays. Segrave was further delayed during the race helping extricate Meregalli and his riding mechanic who were pinned underneath their overturned Diatto; the driving mechanic died of his injuries – the first fatal accident to occur on the Sicilian circuit. Notwithstanding this and other delays, Segrave finished in second after 8hr 15min and 07 sec (32.351 mph) to Boillot winning Peugeot.Rapiditas Vol5 1922–1923 p. 60 On the last but one lap, high up in the Madonie Circuit Mountains in the vicinity of Polizzi a stone fractured the oil pipe of J Chassagne's mount.Targa Florio, W F Bradley p. 83 Unruffled Chassagne replenished the car with sufficient Olive oil purchased from a nearby village shop. He finished in fourth place. Other speed events Brooklands was used by the S.T.D. Combine to promote the marque through racing success, test new racing cars prior to international events, which were the main thrust of the S.T.D. racing program and display the abilities of redundant racing cars offered for sale by the Works usually after a ‘cooling period’ of several years. The 1921 G.P. chassis participation in Brooklands event followed this pattern. The prototype 1921 G.P. chassis was tested at Brooklands 1921 March 21 Easter scratch race still unpainted and fitted with four Zenith carburettors; H.O.D. Segrave winning in 94.64 mph. After a cooling period chassis no.3 was entered at the 1923 August Brooklands 100 mph long handicap \\"was a great race, Ropner’s Vauxhall winning…Perkins in a 3 litre straight- eight Sunbeam, equaled Ropner’s best lap – 101.02mph\\"; it was sold not long after.The History of Brooklands 1906–1940, William Boddy, 1957 p. 113 Chassis no.4 with a 4.9 l engine was purchased by Malcolm Campbell, painted blue, liveried ‘Blue Bird’ and proceeded to successfully take part in numerous Brooklands events in several hands over many years.Motor Sport 1986 May pp. 535–537 and this article ‘History of Works Team Cars’ The 1921 G.P. chassis were also entered in other events notably, Southport where Sunbeam IX had a great deal of success in the hands of privateer J G Jackson well into the thirties. Two of the cars were purchased by intentional privateers and performed well in 1920s events in FranceFuerza Libra 1919–1942 Grand Prix, Spots Car &Specials; Racing in the Pampas, Guillermo Sanchez pp. 288–290 and New Zealand.Flat to the Boards A history of Motor Car Sport in New Zealand From 1901 to 1940, Dick Messenger and Douglas E Wood, 1985 pp. 63–72 History of Works Team Cars Whilst the registration by S.T.D. for seven participants in the 1921 Grand Prix de l’A.C.F may suggest that at least seven Grand Prix cars were envisaged; only four cars were ultimately entered. There is no direct evidence that more than these four cars and an additional fifth ‘Experimental’ car were ever constructed. A single-seater body 1921 G.P. chassis 4.9 l car appeared in 1922 for an attempt on the 24 hour record and subsequently used by Dario Resta 1924 March 29 at Kop Hill Climb where it did second fastest time of day (29.2sec). It is however possible that one of the other chassis (possibly the Experimental car) was temporarily fitted with a single-seater body for these two events.Carbooks Volume 21 1922, Michael Frostick (editor) p. 69 In any case, no further record for this car exists. The 1921 G.P. chassis proved versatile and their appearance were modified by S.T.D. Works to suit the many events they were entered in with different colour and different radiator badges (Sunbeam, Talbot or Talbot Darracq) in an early attempt at badge engineering. Engine types (3-litre and 4.9-litre), break system, body configurations, fuel tanks and axle ratios were also changed from one event to another making the essentially identical cars appear potentially different. Construction of the four cars was instructed towards the end of 1920; first car was tested at Brooklands March 1921; in May, three cars were entered (two Sunbeams and one Talbot Darracq) in the 1921 Indianapolis 500. Back in Sureness, the three Indianapolis cars were fitted with front wheel brakes and entered in that year's July French Grand Prix (two as Talbot Darracq, one as Talbot plus a fourth car again as Talbot). After the Grand Prix, Boillot had an accident in one of the Talbot Darracq at the Spa Hill Climb; subsequently, the car was probably rebuilt. The Two Talbot were entered in Shelsley Walsh Hill Climb in September; this bringing the racing activities of these cars for 1921 to a close. The four cars were modified to ‘1922 IOM’ configuration and entered (as Sunbeams) in the 1922 Tourist Trophy – three Team car and one reserve. Two of the T.T. cars still as Sunbeams and still painted IOM Dreadnought Grey were entered later that year at the Coppa Florio with 4.9 l engines; this was the last international Works entry for these cars.Rapiditas Vol5 1922–1923 p. 59 p. 135 During this period, a fifth car performed well at Brooklands with a 4.9 l engine. A cooling period followed during which the cars made competitive appearances before being sold to privateers. Of the five cars, four survive: *Two of the T.T. cars (Segrave's and Chassagne's winning car) remain largely unmodified in their 1922 configuration; both in the UK. *One of the T.T. / Coppa Florio became a M Campbell ‘Blue Bird’; it went through many transformations before it was dismantled in the 1950s and in 1988 it was resurrected as a standard T.T car. *The fourth T.T. car competed extensively in UK sand racing before being dismantled in the 1950s and subsequently lost. *The fifth car retained its 1922 4.9 l configuration and was later sold to an Argentinean privateer who re-bodied it in 1927 as a single-seater after a crash and it remains essentially in this configuration in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum. Whilst the Sunbeam Works records showing chassis and engine numbers against a team driver did not survive, considerable information some published and some in private hands remains including some records of chassis numbers in Brooklands. Sunbeam racing bodies can only be fitted to the chassis for which they were made without modifying either body or chassis; accordingly identifying a body amounts to identifying a chassis. Research of the history of individual cars was predominantly carried out and published by Dick Messenger, Peter Hull, Graham Vercoe and George Begg. Some information is still missing on some of the cars. The experimental car *Engine: 4.9 l; 1935 -Bentley 4.5 l; 1960s – Lincoln V12 engine; 1965 – original Sunbeam 4.9 l no. 3 with Claudel Hobson carburettors reinstated. *Body: Pointed G.P tail two seater; 1927 – McAlister Co. aluminium single-seater. *Livery: 1922 unpainted bonnet; 1922 unpainted bonnet liveried ‘Sunbeam’; 1924 – painted bonnet liveried ‘Sunbeam’ on bonnet; 1927 -Alzaga ‘signature’ white stripe on the scuttle; 1960s – grey body, red chassis; today – green no.3. The Works history of this car (1921–1924) cannot be confirmed however; the suggestion below is likely; subsequent history is documented. Notable for being the prototype for the effective combination of a 4.9 l engine with a 1921 G.P. chassis, the car had achieved considerable success for S.T.D. Works in Britain. Subsequently, purchased by self-proclaimed \\"first and only Argentinean playboy\\" Alzaga Unzue, in whose hands it participated in the 1924 French Grand Prix and obtained the first international victory for Argentina.Fuerza Libra 1919–1942 Grand Prix, Spots Car &Specials; Racing in the Pampas, Guillermo Sanchez – ‘Martin Maximo Pablo Macoco Alzaga Unzue’ The same year it crashed in the Spanish Grand Prix, the engine was successfully used for motor-boat racing before it was reunited in 1927 with the chassis now in a single-seater form. It was imported to Argentina where it continued to race with various engines before it was put on display in 1965 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum where it remains with its original 4.9 l engine.

After an engine failure in 1934 it was fitted with a Rolls Royce 14.2 l Falcon engine (or 20/25-h.p.).

Modified by the Works for H.O.D. Segrave for the 1922 T.T. it achieved fastest lap both in practice and during the race but did not finish due to magneto problem. Fitted with lights, self-starter and flywheel for road use by Sunbeam before it was sold in 1925. It remained largely unused until purchased by Sunbeam expert Anthony S. Heal who had Len Gibbs in 1946 comprehensively rebuild the car and paint it British Racing Green; non-original rigid pattern steering wheel fitted. It was subsequently used occasionally on the road before it was sold to the Rootes Motor Museum in 1956. In the 1960s it passed to John T Panks (Rootes General Manager) and was restored in New York; a pair of Solexes replaced the original Claudel Hobson carburettors. In the USA it participated in various vintage speed events before it was repatriated by Panks to the U.K. where it took part in similar V.S.C.C. events. Purchased by Bentley enthusiast Guy Shoesmith in 1968 who commissioned Donald McKenzie to carry out bare chassis full mechanical restoration; new dashboard using the original instruments was made. Further V.S.C.C. events were undertaken before the car was housed in the Donington Collection. It was offered via a Phillips auction in 1988 and purchased for a private collection based in the UK. =History= *1921 May 30, Indianapolis 500, Ora Haiba Sunbeam no.16, 5:57:46, 83.86 mph, 5th place, winning $3,000 *1921 July 25, French Grand Prix de l’A.C.F.

Segrave first ever Grand Prix mount and the first car to bring international racing success to Britain after the Great War. After retirement from the S.T.D. Works, it spent most of its life in a few long-term ownerships in New Zealand where it remained an effective, iconic and well-liked racing car both before and after the War; displayed in a motor museum for many years before it was recommissioned and repatriated to the UK. =Registration= *1921 French Grand Prix XH1385 (London registration) *1922 Isle of Man Tourist Trophy MN2041, MN2042, MN4043, MN4044 were used by the team temporarily on the Isle of Man *1922 Coppa Florio DA6752 (Wolverhampton) *1926–1990 registered in New Zealand where registration numbers changed annually e.g., in 1938: 40–749, 1954: 120–833 *1999 SV7968 *2010 DA6752 =History= *1921 S.T.D.

Works Team car, the history of this car is bound with speed ace Malcolm Campbell and is one of his ‘Blue Bird’ cars. During his two-season ownership, Campbell used the car in a variety of speed events, achieving many Brooklands and Hill Climb firsts. ‘Blue Bird’ was then sold to Dunlop and driven by racing driver Paul Dutoit, erstwhile riding mechanic to H.O.D. Segrave, in Brooklands for one season, tyres testing together with another illustrious Brooklands racing car – the 200 mile Alvis; the cars nicknamed ‘Firefly I’ and ‘Firefly II’ respectively. New ownership in 1926 has given the aging racing car a second lease of life and launched it onto years of remarkable Brooklands racing success, described by William Boddy as \\"the best run of success by any Brooklands’ car in such a period\\". Racing success continued well into the 1930s when with a replacement engine it became known first as ‘the Munday Special’ and later in 1934 ‘the Bainton Special’. It was dismantled in the 1950s and later in 1988 resurrected as a 1922 Sunbeam T.T. no.1 and displayed at the Donnington Grand Prix Collection from where it passed to private collections. =History= ; 1922 *June IoM TT Sunbeam straight-eight three- litre *19 November Coppa Florio 268.5 miles (4laps) T.T. body 4.9Lt, race no. 5, 8:15:7 (32.5 mph), H O D Segrave, 2nd ; 1923 *23 June Fanoe Island Denmark Speed Trials, 6-litre Class two-way (fs) mean speed 100 mph, M.

Suresnes Works for the 1,500 Voiturettes class. These were in effect a smaller version of the Sunbeam 3-litre Grand Prix cars – their near identical engines built around one of the two blocks used by the G.P. cars with similar though shorter chassis. Painted blue and entered in the premium events for their class, these cars continued to dominate Voiturette racing for six years, winning every raceThe British Competition Car, Cyril Posthumus, 1959 p. 53 and A Souvenir of the Great Darrqcq Victory in the J.C.C. 200 Mile Race September 1924 and earning the appellation \\"The invincible Talbot- Darracq\\". In a sensational debut in the 1921 French Grand Prix des Voiturettes held at Le Mans, they finished first, second and third – the second time in Voiturettes racing history this has happened (the first occasion having been Sunbeam in the 1912 Coupe de l’Auto). During 1921 and 1922 these ultra- reliable cars run in six races and won every one of them, regularly finishing 1-2-3. In 1923 they were fitted with a V. Bertarione designed engine in which form with some modifications they continued to compete in eleven further events to 1926 again winning all of them. None of the three cars is known to survive. Chassis Wheelbase 8; 0\\", track 3’ 7\\"; four speed gearbox; four wheel brake; differential-less rear axle; dry weight 1,456 lbs.; Hawker- built streamline bodies for the 1921 Brooklands J.C.C. 200-mile Race. Engine The 1,486cc engine was half a 3-litre G.P. engine (for full specification see 3-litre engine above). Compression was 6.4 to 1 producing 53b.h.p. at 4,000r.p.m. Unlike the Grand Prix engine, this engine was directly mounted on the chassis at four points with no sub-frame. A single Claudel Hobson carburettor was used and later a single Solex. Ignition by coil fed by a battery. Maximum speed 95m.p.h.

The Works identity (1922–1924) is deduced from cross-referencing event details against known histories of other cars and from photographs where details in bonnet and tail can be examined (also listed below) and is therefore conjectural. Frontal image could suggest that this car was C A Bird in 1922 July 29 at Shelsley Walsh but this cannot be confirmed without a further image from a different angle. Converting two-seater cars to single-seater and rapidly back was not unusual for S.T.D. Works and it may be that this car was so converted for Dario Resta at 29 March Kop Hill Climb. *Sunbeam Racing Cars, Anthony S Heal, 1989 p. 131–133, 137, 140, 178, Appendix III *Fuerza Libra 1919–1942 Grand Prix, Spots Car &Specials; Racing in the Pampas, Guillermo Sanchez – entries for *‘Sunbeam’ and ‘Martin Maximo Pablo Macoco Alzaga Unzue’ *Motor Sport 1986 May ‘The 4.9-litre Sunbeams, William Boddy pp. 535–537 *The Shand Archive ref. 0260-7/5/88 *1995 S.T.D.

Post–works it is interlinked with the privateer George J Jackson; in 1934 the engine failed and was replaced with a 14.2-litre Rolls-Royce Falcon or 20/25 hp (depending on source); car subsequently dismantled and by 1950s lost; all as detailed in the sources listed below: *Sunbeam Racing Cars, Anthony S Heal, 1989, pp. 290–292, 341–363 *The History of Brooklands 1906–1940, William Boddy, 1957, p. 290 *The Shand Archive ref. 0037-23/9/57 *Motor Sport 1943 April pp. 80–81 Sunbeam II (the Segrave T.T. car) It is stated that this car participated in the 1921 Indianapolis 500 for O. Haibe. It then participated in the 1921 French Grand Prix but the identity of the driver is not known; it was thought to have been H.O.D. Segrave but this is no longer believed to be the case as the car today retaining its original body does not resemble Segrave's car in the Grand Prix. The attribution to H.O.D. Segrave in the 1922 T.T. is derived from the shape of the bonnet blister, scuttle guard and the extended sitting position.

It is likely that this car participated in the 1921 Indianapolis 500 but this cannot be confirmed. Presented by Sunbeam in period as Chassagne's ‘winning Sunbeam’ in the Isle of Man T.T., the particular body shape including the distinct bonnet blisters, as well as, the no.10 grinning under Chassagne's winning no.7 also identify this car as the H.O.D. Segrave 1921 Grand Prix no. 10). Period documents identify Segrave's and Chassagne's T.T. cars as Sunbeam II and III respectivelyMotor 1922 June 21 p. 786 and it may not be a coincidence that the chassis of these two cars are stamped No.2 and No3 respectively. This car has a distinct scuttle hatch associated with the use of a 4.9 l engine;A classic world and when the engine roars: a tale of three T.T. sunbeams, 1999, G Begg p. 158 cross-referencing event details shows that the only event in which this car could have taken part in with a 4.9 l engine is the 1922 Coppa Florio; this is further corroborated by a distinct lever on nearside scuttle – also visible on the Zborowski car in the 1921 Shelsley Walsh – other body details such as tail shape and seats confirm this identification. William Boddy 1947 Brooklands records identify this chassis (No.3) as the car Bill Perkins raced in 1923; a photograph of Bill Perkins with the car in that event confirms this.The TASO Mathieson & K Taylor Photographic and Document Archive courtesy Keith Taylor A letter from R.F. Fuggle with accompanying photograph confirms the car liveried ‘Sunbeam VII’ (in acknowledgment of its 1922 T.T. winning race no.7) was sold in 1925 to M Wills of New Zealand.The Shand Archive ref.0218 Subsequent owner of this car 1928–1946 Dick Messenger recorded that the actual liveried 1922 T.T. number 7 was revealed in 1930 under later paint;1957 June, Beaded Wheels ‘A wolf in sheep’s clothing’, A.R.E. (Dick) Messenger he also pointed out that the fixed driving position which cannot be modified without substantial changes to the car's body, was for a small man which Chassagne was known to be; it is of interest that conversely, Sunbeam II (Segrave's mount) is fixed for a tall man which Segrave was; Segrave, in turn, recorded that each car was tailor-made by the Sunbeam Works for its driver ‘so much so that A often cannot drive B’s car or vice versa’. It is possible that this car was owned and raced by J G Jackson during the period 1923–1925 but this has not been verified. The originality of this car was safeguarded unwittingly by Dick Messenger who removed in 1930 the racing body and carburettors for safe keeping whilst using the car on the road with alternative body; immediate post war racing was undertaken with yet another body before Messenger in 1951 assisted Rob Shand to reunite the racing body and carburettors with the car.The Shand Archive ref. 0015–0025 The car was displayed in the Donington Museum with a replica bodyA classic world and when the engine roars: a tale of three T.T. sunbeams, 1999, G Begg p. 166 but this was discarded and the original body is back on the car;Octane, 2014 September, ‘Only Original Twice?’ Mark Dixon dated Works gearing ratios stamps for 1921 and 1922 were exposed in 2010.

This car may have participated in the 1921 Indianapolis 500 and likely in the 1921 French Grand Prix but this cannot be confirmed. It did participate in the 1922 Tourist Trophy but it is not known which of the cars (team or reserve) this car may have been.

The winner would have the right to challenge Alan Bond's syndicate and the Royal Perth Yacht Club for the 1987 America's Cup in Fremantle, Western Australia. The 12-Meter racing yacht White Crusader began life named as Crusader and was renamed after a £1 million pound advertising investment by British businessman Graham Walker of White Horse Whisky fame who added the word White to the boats name as part of the sponsorship deal. The America's Cup potential challenger was officially named by HRH Diana, Princess of Wales at the 1985 Earls Court Boat Show, London. White Crusader competed in the 1987 Louis Vuitton Cup.http://www.americas-cup-history.at/english/lvc%2087.htm in Australia. Onboard leadership for the challenge was the skipper Harold Cudmore and his tactician was Chris Law. The British campaign built two boats - White Crusader (K-24) which was a traditional design and White Crusader 2 (K-25) which was a radical design by David Hollom. The more radical boat was used as a trial horse by the British so that White Crusader could have competition to train against whilst in preparation for the Louis Vitton challenger series. During the series White Crusader was modified with several new keel designs and at one point the bow section was replaced with a higher freeboard design for the rough Freemantle sea conditions. White Crusader met fierce opposition mainly from Chris Dickson with the New Zealand entry Kiwi Magic KZ-7 and Dennis Conner in Stars and Stripes 87 US-55, the latter winning the series and in due course the America's Cup itself from the Australians. Since 1993 K-24 has reverted to her original name of Crusader. The boat is owned by Richard Matthews and has been moored at Ipswich on the River Orwell. The boat has been refitted since the America's Cup challenge and has competed in several Fastnet Races.

It provides upscale Lao cuisine and showcases traditional Lao dance and music performances to its clientele.  Location and History  The Kualao Restaurant compound occupies an area of approximately 2200 square meters in Xiengyeun Village, Chanthabouly District, Vientiane. This location is known as the That Dam Intersection as its namesake, the ‘Black Stupa’, sits at the center of the nearby roundabout. The restaurant itself is housed in a two- story colonial villa. The public areas of the compound consist of a large, high-ceilinged room that serves as the main dining hall, a VIP room and two function halls. The building has been adapted to allow it to function as a restaurant while retaining certain elements of its colonial character. Oral histories and a map of 1963 Vientiane Capital suggest that the Royal Lao Government made use of the colonial villa as a Tax Department. Until 1993, the house had been the government-owned residence of former Lao Deputy Minister of Education, Khampong Phankongsa, who had been residing there for a number of years (a convenience offered to civil servants for their public service). After an agreement was reached between the Ministry of Finance (responsible for managing state property) and the Deputy Minister, Kualao Restaurant was granted an operating license by the Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism in 1994. It was opened by the Lane Xang Travel Company, along with Hotel Lao, to meet the Government of Laos’ requirement, at that time, for all travel and tour companies to provide a full-service tourism operation, including a hotel and a restaurant, in order to obtain a tourism business license. Kualao Restaurant was founded and is currently owned and managed by Manola Daravong.  Cuisine  Sticky rice at Kualao Restaurant Vegetarian or- larm stew at Kualao Restaurant Kualao Restaurant employs ethnically Lao chefs and produces traditional Lao dishes using local ingredients. The restaurant serves many typical Lao dishes, including sticky rice (also called glutinous rice), which is steamed in a woven bamboo basket, larb, a minced meat salad which is widely regarded as the ‘national dish’ of Laos and the Pakao, a large set menu served on a traditional rattan platter that includes small portions of many of the most common Lao dishes. Local desserts, such as Nam Vaan, a sweet fruit salad mixed with rice balls and coconut milk and served in a coconut shell, are also included on the menu.  Public and Media Reception  Kualao Restaurant is frequented by tourists, international visitors and Lao eaters. Certain travel forums, such as TripAdvisor, have generally favorable reviews of the restaurant and, whilst many tourists appear to appreciate the opportunity to experience Lao food and entertainment in a clean and modern environment, some reviewers feel it is an overpriced ‘tourist trap’ and note that there are other restaurants serving similar dishes in Vientiane at lower prices. Some customers have also questioned the authenticity of Kualao Restaurant’s food as traditional Laotian fare. Critics cite the inclusion of Thai and Chinese dishes on the menu and the inclusion of monosodium glutamate (MSG) in some dishes as key factors affecting authenticity. In 2011, Kualao was named ‘Restaurant of the Year' by the Tourism Alliance Awards at the International Travel Expo, in HCM, Vietnam.  Media Coverage  Kualao Restaurant was featured in the #1 New York Times Bestselling book 1,000 Places to See Before You Die by Patricia Schultz. Fodor’s Travel referred to Kualao Restaurant as “one of Vientiane’s best Lao restaurants.” The New York Times featured Kualao Restaurant in an article in 2007 entitled ‘The Centuries-Old Allure of Laos’s Relaxed Capital’ where journalist Daniel Altman wrote \\"some colonial gems have also reached an international standard, like Kualao.\\" Frommer’s Southeast Asia (7th Edition) has also mentioned Kualao Restaurant. AOL Travel mentions that the restaurant \\"is a must for all food travelers and connoisseurs.\\" J&C; Expats Article Contributor, Russell J. Peterson has described the cuisine served at Kualao as \\"exceptional.\\" It has been mentioned on premier Laos-based English-language online news site, The Laotian Times, that Kualao Restaurant is \\"a nice place, conveniently located. And it has parking…on a first come-first serve basis, of course.\\" A picture of the famous Pakao set menu was taken by a London-based blogger and featured in The Guardian. Champa Meuanglao, the official inflight magazine of Lao Airlines, featured Kualao's famous matsutake mushrooms in its July–August 2017 edition.  Noteworthy Clientele  Kualao Restaurant has played host to many high- ranking dignitaries and state officials from Laos and beyond. These have included Japanese Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe, Yoshihiko Noda, Junichiro Koizumi and Keizo Obuchi, Japan’s Imperial Highness Fumihito, Prince Akishino, Vaclav Klaus, former President of the Czech Republic, Helen Clark, former President of New Zealand and S.R.

Native to screes in northern Patagonia, it has divided greyish or reddish green leaves and large white or pink flowers. Description C. semiverticillata is a strong-growing perennial with a deep rhizome. It has finely divided (dissected) leaves, greyish or reddish green in colour, up to across. The leaves do not fully develop until after the flowers appear. The flowering stems are violet-purple and carry one or more large flowers, up to across. Each flower has five white, purple-marked sepals and 10–20 petals, longer and narrower than the sepals, usually white but sometimes pink. It has been described as \\"arguably the most beautiful buttercup in the world\\". Taxonomy The species was first described in 1861 by Rodolfo Amando Philippi as Ranunculus semiverticillatus. It was transferred to the newly created genus Callianthemoides in 1992 by Michio Tamura. The ending -oides means \\"similar to\\" or \\"resembling\\", so that Callianthemoides means \\"resembling Callianthemum\\". Article 62.4 of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants explicitly states that genus names ending in -oides are feminine, so the correct name of the species when transferred to Callianthemoides is Callianthemoides semiverticillata. However, Tamura incorrectly used the masculine ending -us (i.e. C. semiverticillatus), which some sources have copied. The adjective verticillatus means \\"whorled\\", so that the epithet semiverticillata means \\"half or partially whorled\\". Distribution and habitat Callianthemoides semiverticillata is native to the northern part of Patagonia (Chile and Argentina). It grows in bare, often loose screes in mountains, at , emerging from the ground in spring at the edge of the melting snow. Cultivation Callianthemoides semiverticillata is grown by gardeners specializing in alpine plants. It is grown in pots under glass and in raised beds and containers outside, but has produced smaller flowers than in the wild. It has been described as \\"choice\\" but \\"difficult to cultivate\\".

Born into a wealthy family from the islands of Murano, he and his family moved to Venice around 1767, but after a few years he moved to Treviso. He married in 1780 and having already met Giacomo Casanova and Lorenzo Da Ponte, started work as a librettist.Armellini, Mario (2008). \\"Mazzolà, Caterino Tommaso\\". Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Vol. 72. Treccani. Online version retrieved 3 May 2015 . After 1780, Joseph Schuster helped Mazzolà to be appointed as Dresden's court poet; he held the post until 1796. During this period, he worked with Da Ponte and met Antonio Salieri, who suggested that Mazzolà could write the libretto for an opera buffa entitled La scuola de' gelosi which premiered in 1778. In 1783 the opera appeared in Vienna.Rice, John A. (1991), W. A. Mozart: La Clemenza Di Tito, pp. 31–33. Cambridge University Press Early in 1791, Mazzolà briefly became the Viennese court poet through Da Ponte and Salieri. Later that year he significantly revised Metastasio's text for Mozart's new setting of La clemenza di Tito (originally created in 1734, on a music by Antonio Caldara). Da Ponte and Salieri had suggested that Mazzolà would be a suitable poet for Count Rosenberg, the court theatre director. However, Giovanni Bertati replaced Rosenberg, and Mazzolà retreated to Dresden. In 1796, he returned to Venice, but Friedrich August III of Dresden helped Mazzolà to engage in diplomatic work, and requested that some of his writings should be sent back to the Saxon court each year. Mazzolà's librettos are mostly opere buffe and set by the Dresden composers Johann Gottlieb Naumann, Joseph Schuster and Franz Seydelmann. Seydelmann's best Italian opera was Il turco in Italia (1788), described by Constanze Mozart after a performance in Vienna in 1789. Mazzolà's libretto was reworked by Felice Romani for Rossini's Il turco in Italia which also premiered in 1788.Senici, Emanuele (2004). The Cambridge Companion to Rossini, p. 54.
