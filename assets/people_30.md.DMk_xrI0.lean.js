Biography = Early life and education = Virgil Clarence Blum was born on March 27, 1913 in Defiance, Iowa, one of twelve children of John and Elizabeth Blum. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1934 and was ordained to the priesthood in 1947. In 1938 Blum received a bachelor's degree in Latin and English from St. Stanislaus Seminary at Florissant, Missouri. In 1945 he earned a master's degree in history and political science from St. Louis University. Blum returned to St. Louis University in 1950 for doctoral studies, earning a Ph.D. in political science and U.S. history in 1954. His area of expertise was American constitutional law and interest-group politics.http://www.marquette.edu/library/collections/archives/SuperC/C-1-14s2-VCB.htm = Teaching career = From 1953 to 1956 Blum taught at Creighton University. In 1956 he joined the political science faculty at Marquette University, receiving promotion to associate professor in 1958 and full professor in 1961. Blum served as chairman of the political science department from 1962 to 1974. In 1978 he was named professor emeritus. During his years at Marquette, Blum served on many important university committees, and he received the institution's Teaching Excellence Award in 1966. A prolific writer, Blum published twelve books and nearly 400 articles. = Civil rights activism = Embodying the Jesuit ideal of the \\"contemplative in action,\\" Blum pursued public advocacy on behalf of educational reform and religious and civil rights. He was an indefatigable champion of parental choice in education through school vouchers for students in private schools. In 1961 Blum helped to found the Wisconsin chapter of Citizens for Educational Freedom (CEF), and he was also active in the national organization, serving on its board of directors and executive committee and, for a time, as its national executive director. A popular lecturer, Blum traveled the United States giving talks to civil and religious groups, and he often contributed editorials to newspapers throughout the country. In 1973 Blum founded the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights and served as its president until 1989. Modeled on the American Civil Liberties Union and Anti-Defamation League, the Catholic League sought to safeguard the religious freedom and free speech of Catholics. In 1983 Pope John Paul II recognized Blum's service by naming him a Knight of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem.http://www.marquette.edu/library/collections/archives/SuperC/C-1-14s2-VCB.htm = Later life = In 1989 Blum was diagnosed with cancer, and he died on April 5, 1990, in his room at Marquette University's Jesuit Residence. = Archival collections = Rev. Virgil C. Blum, S.J., Papers, 1947-1990 The collection documents Blum's service activities both within and outside Marquette University. It contains no materials from his life prior to ordination in the Society of Jesus. The university-related papers make up only a fraction of the whole: a majority of the collection pertains to Blum's involvement in Citizens for Educational Freedom (CEF) and The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights. The collection also contains manuscripts of Blum's articles and presentations as well as copies of his published articles, mostly from popular journals and newspapers. Many of the manuscripts are undated. The collection also contains a variety of audiovisual materials, including some sound recordings of Blum's speaking engagements and video recordings of his television appearances. Blum was a voluminous correspondent, and letters are the most abundant type of document in the collection. He mixed his incoming and outgoing correspondence, and he appears to have maintained several different filing schemes for his letters. Correspondence is scattered throughout the collection. Because Blum's personal and professional lives were so closely intertwined, researchers will find correspondence related to his public advocacy efforts among files labeled as personal correspondence.

It received the rare \\"Film of the Nation\\" distinction.Erwin Leiser, Nazi Cinema p116 It was part of a popular cycle of \\"Prussian films\\". The film is a depiction of the F√ºhrerprinzip, with the analogy to Adolf Hitler being so clear that Hitler sent a print to Benito Mussolini, and Joseph Goebbels warned against the drawing of the comparison in print, in particular, because of the pessimistic mood that opens the film.Erwin Leiser, Nazi Cinema p113-4 After a sergeant gives an unauthorised order, the king orders him simultaneously promoted and punished. His decision to desert after this results in his death, because no disobedience is justified. Goebbels declared that the parallels were not a matter of propaganda, but an obvious result of the parallels of history.Pierre Aycoberry The Nazi Question, p10 Pantheon Books New York 1981 Goebbels also regarded it as instructive that current sufferings would be a source of strength.Cinzia Romani, Tainted Goddesses: Female Film Stars of the Third Reich p93 Goebbels had some difficulty with the Army High Command over this film, because it depicted the king left in the lurch by his general.

Armstrong first exhibited his work in 1977 and had one-person shows in New York City, Boston, Berlin, Paris, Rome, Zurich, D√ºsseldorf, Lisbon, Munich, and Amsterdam. His work was included in numerous group museum exhibitions including Visions from America: Photographs from The Whitney Museum of American Art, 1940-2001 in 2003, Emotions and Relations at the Hamburger Kunsthalle in 1998, and the 1995 Whitney Biennial.David Armstrong Matthew Marks Gallery, New York/Los Angeles.Whitney Biennial, (New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1995) Personal life Armstrong was born in 1954, in Arlington, Massachusetts, one of four sons of Robert and Irma Armstrong.Paul Vitello (October 31, 2014), David Armstrong, Photographer of Subcultures, Dies at 60 The New York Times. He graduated from the Satya Community School, an alternative high school in Lincoln, Massachusetts, where he met Nan Goldin at the age of 14.Jane Harris, \\"Home-Work: Photographer David Armstrong Talks About His Latest Monograph, 615 Jefferson Avenue\\", 19 December 2011. Accessed 15 December 2017. On October 26, 2014, at the age of 60, he died in Los Angeles, California due to liver cancer. Career Armstrong entered into the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston as a painting major, but soon switched to photography after studying alongside Goldin, with whom he shared an apartment. He attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts and Cooper Union from 1974‚Äì78, and he earned a B.F.A from Tufts University in 1988 and Judy Ann Goldman Fine Art in Boston. During the late 1970s, Armstrong became associated with the \\"Boston School\\" of photography, which included artists such as Nan Goldin, Mark Morrisroe and Jack Pierson. Their aesthetic was based on intimate snapshot portraits in saturated color. Armstrong first received critical attention for his intimate portraits of men, either lovers or friends, in sharp focus.David Armstrong, \\"The Silver Cord\\", (New York: Scalo, 1997) In the nineties, he began to photograph cityscapes and landscapes in soft focus to contrast with the resolution of his portraits. Street lights, electric signs and cars are reduced to a sensual mottled blur, complementing the vividness and tactility of his portraits. In 1981, Armstrong created a series of black-and-white portraits which he showed at PS1's New York/New Wave exhibition. In 1996, Elisabeth Sussman, curator of photographs at the Whitney Museum, enlisted Armstrong's help in composing Goldin's first retrospective. She gained such respect for Armstrong‚Äôs eye, she acquired a few of his pieces for the Whitney permanent collection and he was subsequently featured in the Whitney 1994 biennial. Armstrong‚Äôs work has also appeared in publications such as Vogue Paris, L'Uomo Vogue, Arena Homme +, GQ, Self Service, Another Man and Japanese Vogue and he has worked on the advertising campaigns of companies such as Zegna, Ren√© Lezard, Kenneth Cole, Burberry, Puma, and Barbara Bui. He once shot editorials for Wonderland, Vogue Hommes and Purple. Although his primary subjects include portraits of young boys and men, Armstrong also released a book of land and cityscapes in 2002, entitled All Day, Every Day.

Edwards performs and records under the name Vertonen, and is a member of Anatomy of Habit, Startless, Burrow, and sseepage. The label is known for discovering and supporting artists who are relatively unknown, or who are just starting in their careers. It also publishes work by the artists who inspired Edwards, such as Z'EV, The Hafler Trio, and Crawl Unit. Incremental Press C.I.P. began in 1988 as a chapbook press in order to self-publish art and poetry by Blake Edwards. Seven chapbook titles were produced between 1988 and 1991. Editions were kept very small, and never went above 40. In December 1996, The publication side of C.I.P. was revived as Incremental Press (with crippled intellect press as an imprint) with the purchase of an ISBN number and the publication of loquedeeshes, by Sherman Johnson. Early Releases In the Fall of 1992, C.I.P. began publishing 7\\" records by Blake Edwards' solo project, Vertonen. The first releases still had ties to poetry, with spoken words and small booklets of text inserted into the sleeves. CD publishing In 1998, C.I.P. published its first CDs, taking a major step away from the label's initial self-publishing focus. Marked by a high production quality and professional look, C.I.P. reissued on CD a rare cassette by uns, an alter ego of the percussionist Z'EV, with an accompanying booklet containing extensive liner notes by the artist. This was followed by a CD titled \\"Everyone Gets What They Deserve\\" by Crawl Unit, as the sound artist Joe Colley was then known. With the label now firmly established, C.I.P. began taking risks by producing new titles by artists from deep underground, including a musique concrete group from Connecticut called Brutum Fulmen, Nuisance Beacon, and a long-lived yet under-documented artist from San Francisco, Skozey Fetisch. The label did continue to publish work by Edwards, who received grants from the City of Chicago Arts Council. These albums including Edwards' strongest work to date: Return of the Interrobang (a title which suggests his interest in language); the drone album Orchid Collider (with cover art by Jason Talbot); and a live album called Stations.

The site of the Gull Lake Dam has particular prehistoric archaeological significance. Under the site there have been found at least 12 burial mounds as well as several partial mounds. All are thought to originate from the Woodland American Indian tribes, which resided in the area from 800 B.C. to A.D. 200, returning later to inhabit the area from A.D. 600 to A.D. 900. The National Register of Historic Places recognizes these burial mounds. The site of St. Columba Mission on the eastern side of the lake is also listed on the National Register.

Speed Limitations In North America, the C3's top speed is limited by the factory via a washer on the end of the boss shaft of the V-belt transmission. This washer limits how close the belt sheaves can come together, thus limiting the potential front diameter of the belt at full throttle. Removal of the washer is possible with simple tools and will increase the top speed to an RPM limited of 40 mph, although damage caused by modification is excluded from the Yamaha warranty. In Europe the Giggle Primary sheave variator (Part No 15PE76200000 ) is different from its US C3 version (Part No 3XYE7620010). This limits the Giggle to 31 MPH, even down hill. However the US version is freely available in the UK, NL & Germany. With no further modification it will allow the Giggle to get to 38MPH on level roads and >40 mph down hill. The effect of removing the tiny washer that sits between the two 'cones' is a gain of 1-2 mph however research has shown that moving the washer behind the primary Sheave has the same effect and improves the geometry of the V-belt. These modifications may contravene the law in certain EU states and void insurance ! The Giggle also has a slightly lower rev limit.

The word \\"Brahacharanam\\" is a corruption of the Sanskrit word Brhatcharanam (). Many Brahacharanam follow the Advaita Vedanta philosophy propounded by Adi Sankaracharya. However, some Brahacharanam are staunchly Saivite unlike followers of Adi Sankaracharya, or else adhere to \\"Sivadvaita\\" so to speak. The Brahacharanams, along with the Vadamas, form the major portion of the Kerala Iyer community.  Etymology  The word bruhat in Sanskrit means \\"great\\", \\"vast\\" or \\"significant\\" and the word charanam refers to feet. The name Brahacharanam can be thus literally translated as \\"feet of the greats\\" referring to the status of a Guru, and the Brahacharanam being those who follow in the footsteps of the Greats. Another interpretation for Brahacharanam provided by K.A Nilakanta Sastri in his 'History of South India' is the 'Great Migration'. Sastri notes that this could be taken as evidence of one of the earliest migrations of people from North India into South, especially given that many Brahacharanam sub-sects have names such as Satyamangalam, Mangudi etc. - all names of villages hugging Western Ghats, and thereby denoting the route taken from North to South. It is to be noted however that Sastri considers this interpretation to be too speculative, given there is no direct evidence for the same.  Origins  Their exact origins are not clear but their presence in the Tamil Kingdoms extends back at least to the reign of Parantaka Chola II, who is said to have brahmarayars as ministers. Many of the agraharam villages of the Brahacharanam also have very ancient origins. According to some, they made their way into the Tamil country through the Satyamangalam Pass.Kongunadu  Sub-groups  The Brahacharanam are divided into the following subgroups: * Kandramanickam * Milaganur * Mangudi * Malanadu * Pazhamaneri * Musanadu * Kolathur * Marudancheri * Mazhavanattu * Sathyamangalam and * Puthur Dravida. A significant number of Brahacharanams have migrated to Kerala, where they are part of the Kerala Iyer community. They have also migrated in large numbers to Puttur in Andhra Pradesh where they form the Puthur Dravida community.  Culture  Most Brahacharanam are worshippers of Shiva, and they cover their forehead with sacred ashes. Some used to wear Vibhuti in the Shape of the Sivalinga on their foreheads due their strong adherence to Lord Siva and no other. However, the Sathyamangalam group have some members who wear the vaishnava mark. Women also dress like other Iyers. In the ancient times, the cloth worn by the women used to be of little more than a knee's length. Among the Milaganur Brahacharanam, the Adrishya Pondugal ceremony is celebrated in which four women, a widow and a bachelor are invited to a feast. This was done in order to propitiate four women who disappeared due to the ill treatment of their mothers in law. It has been documented that some Bracharanam who lived in places like Mangudi were such rigid Saivites that they would not even utter Govinda's name and lived a life of stern austerity.  Traditional role  The traditional function of Brahacharanams is to study and impart Vedic knowledge or officiate as priests in religious functions. However, there is evidence that in ancient times, they might have also served in the army or in civil and administrative services. During the Chola period, members of the community (especially the Pazhamaneri Brahacharanam) even served as army commanders. Senapathi Krishnan Raman was the Commander-in-chief of the Imperial Chola army of Rajendra Chola I. Brahacharanam also consider themselves to be among the first followers of Adi Shankaracharya.

After graduation from Harvard and the University of Chicago, he served in the Third Marine Division to fight at Guadalcanal Island and Iwo Jima. As World War II ended, he left in 1945 for Hiroshima as a member of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS). He visited Japan again in 1955 as a researcher of the Ford Foundation, to study Japanese industrial organization and personnel practices. Abegglen lived permanently in Japan with his Japanese wife after 1982 and took Japanese nationality in 1997. Abegglen served successively as professor and director of the Graduate School of Comparative Culture at Sophia University, chairperson of Asia Advisory Service K.K., and dean emeritus of Globis University in 2006. He taught \\"Management of Japanese Enterprises\\" at that school until his death from cancer on May 2, 2007.  Work  Abegglen's academic interests centered on Japanese enterprises and economic systems and their priority to western capitalism. = The Japanese Factory = The Japanese Factory, published in 1958, pointed out the following features of employment and the strength of their mechanism in Japanese corporations: * Lifetime employment: Employment extends over the whole working life of the employee * Seniority-based wages: Compensation is determined by the number of years of employment in the company * Periodic hiring: Employing young people fresh out of school * In-company training: Employing workers based on personal qualities rather than job suitability, providing on-the-job training after hire * Enterprise union: one labour union for each enterprise Those employment practices, in strong contrast with the West, often at first startled and intrigued people in the United States, thus his book became a best-seller.  Criticism  Abegglen was widely regarded as a reliable guide to Japan by Western business interests in the post-war era. Critics like Eamonn Fingleton argue, however, that he \\"regarded his principal function as doing public relations on behalf of the Japanese establishment,\\" that he misled Western leaders and the Western public about the openness of Japanese markets, and that he kept his change of nationality secret.Eamonn Fingleton, In the Jaws of the Dragon: America's Fate in the Coming Era of Chinese Hegemony (New York: Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press, 2008), 313.

The construction era for branch lines lasted from 1872, when the first route, from Siegelsdorf to Langenzenn, was opened, to 1930, when the last section of the branch from G√∂√üweinstein to Behringersm√ºhle went operational.  History  The first German railway line was opened in Bavaria in 1835. This was the Ludwigsbahn (Ludwig's Railway) from Nuremberg to F√ºrth which opened on 7 December 1835. This was the start of a railway building frenzy, which rapidly spread across the state. The second Bavarian railway line, from Munich to Augsburg, soon followed. The early railways were private lines, but from 184?, the Bavarian state oversaw the construction of railways, through its state-owned railway company, the Royal Bavarian State Railways. The most important routes were established first, of course, and became the 'main lines', the backbone of the Bavarian railway network which has lasted to the present day. = The First Branch Lines - Vizinalbahnen = The first branch lines to appear in Bavaria ‚Äì indeed in Germany ‚Äì were the so-called Vizinalbahnen ('neighbourhood lines'). This was a legal term and envisaged the costs of real estate acquisition and line construction being raised locally, whilst profits would be shared between state and district, in accordance with the statuted dated 29 April 1869. The first line to be built was the 5.5 kilometre stretch from Siegelsdorf to Langenzenn opened on 25 May 1872. Over the next seven years a further 14 Vizinalbahnen were built, including the Bavarian Ostbahn route from Wiesau ‚Äì Tirschenreuth. Compared to the main lines, the regulations for these branch lines were relaxed. Steep inclines (up to 1:25), tight curves (100 m) and a narrower subgrade were permitted; as were lighter rails (or used main line rails), lighter vehicles and lower speeds. All the lines were standard gauge. Narrow gauge lines were much rarer in Bavaria than in other states. = The Sekund√§rbahnen = Because the Vizinalbahnen did not generate the returns expected and the state had to bail them out to a large extent, a new statute appeared on 28 April 1882 which introduced a new category of branch line the Sekund√§rbahn ('secondary line'). These would be constructed at state expense. In fact, only one true Sekund√§rbahn was built ‚Äì the line from Gem√ºnden to Hammelberg, now part of a single-track main line. Nevertheless, the name stuck and passed into Bavarian folklore, continuing to be used to refer to branch lines. Although not an official Sekund√§rbahn, the line from Erlangen to Gr√§fenberg and its locomotives were nicknamed the Seekuh. The story goes that a railway inn called the Sekund√§rbahn was having its sign painted. It was left half-finished overnight with only the letters 'Seku' completed. Hence the nickname. = The Age of the Branch Line - Lokalbahnen = By the 1880s, the Bavarian main line network was largely completed and attention now turned to its expansion into the hinterland. On 21 April 1884 the first Bavarian Lokalbahn ('local line' also spelt Localbahn) law was passed. This went back to the premise that funding for land purchase and construction would be a local affair, although earthworks would be paid for by the state. However, the state would also take the profit. To make them viable, the Lokalbahnen were to be built and operated as simply as possible. Structures too were to be simple. This led to the widespread use of standard buildings and structures; nevertheless branch lines and their stations still retained a lot of individual character based on the region and local material available for construction. The real boom period for branch line construction in Bavaria was from 1894 to 1910, a time when more than half of all branch lines were completed. The average time to build was four years and the construction cost worked out at about a fifth that of main lines per kilometre. Everyday speech saw the introduction of another name in Bavaria for the Vizinal-, Sekund√§r- and Lokalbahnen: the Nebenbahn, the usual German word for a branch line. = The Deutsche Reichsbahn Era = On 31 March 1920, the state railways (L√§nderbahnen) were formally merged into the new 'imperial' railway company, the Deutsche Reichsbahn and the branch line network in Bavaria, less a few privately run lines, transferred to the ownership of the German Reich and thereby became part of the Reichsbahn railway network. But the aftermath of World War I, the state of the economy and rampant inflation brought a halt to any significant further expansion. Of the 52 routes envisaged in 1920, only the stub from Zwiesel to Bodenmais in 1928 and the link from Kinding to Beilngries in 1929 were built. = The Post-War Years = The demise of much of the Bavarian branch line network came after the Second World War when competition from the road network and increasing car ownership hit first passenger, then goods services. Around half the original branch lines had closed by the mid-seventies and the trend has continued since, albeit at a slower pace.  Branch Line Structures = Trackbed = The Vizinalbahnen used old mainline rails or lightweight, Vizinalbahn rails laid on wooden sleepers. For Lokalbahn lines, the lower speeds enabled a lighter superstructure to be used, for a wheel load of /. By the 1930s, the superstructure of Bavarian branch lines generally consisted of 6 m rails, supplied by the Maximiliansh√ºtte at Haidhof, fixed to iron base plates and wooden sleepers with massive rail spikes. The result was a special ‚Äì lightweight ‚Äì Bavarian Lokalbahn rail profile. = Track Layout = Although track layouts varied, there were certain standard layouts that were common: * A halt with a loading loop served by a combined end- and side-loading ramp. * A terminal station with a kick-back loading siding, served by a ramp at one end and the goods shed at the other. There was a run-around loop for the engine and a crossing loop from which the engine shed and any industrial siding could be accessed. Any industrial sidings had to be built and maintained by the industries concerned. =Halts= Many halts just had a name board; sometimes there was a simple shelter with a bench provided by the local council. The railway administration permitted railway 'agents' to operate on many stations, and the standard design of single-storey, wooden, agency building can still be seen today in many places. One side handled the passenger traffic, with a waiting room, ticket office and earth toilet. The other half was the office, goods shed and loading ramp. In epoch 3, these buildings were sometimes extended and more solidly built. =Stations= Station buildings were often of stone or brick and many appear to be far too large for the villages and towns they serve. In the early days, a standard cubic shape, the so-called W√ºrfel was common, later the design was more variable. Station names could be painted in large letters or carved into long sandstone ashlar slabs on the walls of the building. At the front there is often a shed roof to provide some shelter for waiting passengers on the 'home' platform. The goods shed was often attached. = Engine Sheds = The engine shed was not just a building for housing locomotives. It was a combined 'stable', workshop, office and servicing area, often with living accommodation integrated. There were external locomotive facilities such as cleaning pits, water cranes and nearby coaling bunkers. Inside there were sanding facilities. There was a work table and vice, an office with the duty roster, regulations, operating instructions and other reference material as well as clothes lockers and washing facilities for the staff. Oil was kept in the cellar. Coaling was carried out by hand from coal bunkers. Coal was shovelled onto a platform and from there into the locomotive's coal tank. Later simple cranes or derricks were installed. For major repairs, however, the engines were sent to the depot (Bahnbetriebswerk or Bw) and a replacement locomotive provided. Locomotives Typical Bavarian branch line locomotives in Epoch 1 include the: * Class D XI, the classic branch line engine of which over 100 were delivered. * Class GtL 4/4, a common goods train locomotive for branch lines. * Class PtL 2/2, nicknamed the 'glass box' (Glaskasten), an unusual design for one-man operation on short lines. * Class BB II, a Mallet locomotive designed for winding, hilly routes with tight curves. In Epoch 2, former light main line tank engines were cascaded to the branch lines including the: * Class Pt 2/3, which became the classic branch line motive power for Epochs 2 and 3. * Class D XII, which was deployed in small numbers to some lines. They were joined by new Einheitsdampfloks built for the DRG in the late 1920s and 1930s: * DRG Class 64, nicknamed Bubikopf ('bob' hairstyle). * DRG Class 86, its larger cousin. Goods Wagon Classification The Bavarian railways, at different times, had three different classification systems that roughly correspond to the early, middle and late period of the state railway era in Bavaria, i.e.: = Epoch Ia (1867‚Äì92) = The early period from 1867 to 1892. Capital letters were used to indicate the type of wagon, e.g. G = open wagon with low sides, short; H= log wagon. Photographs suggest that this system took time to develop and was not fully established until after the Bavarian Ostbahn had been merged into the State Railway in 1877. Roman or Arabic numerals were used additionally to indicate the age of the wagon, e.g. an A I was an old, 6-wheeled, goods van for a load of , whilst an A¬≥ was a 10 m long 'modern' van for load ( was 'normal') and an H2 was a log wagon built between 1860 and 1880. The owner inscription was K.Bay.Sts.B. with a rather square, crowned Bavarian coat of arms (white and blue lozenges). = Epoch Ib (1893‚Äì1912) = Epoch Ib may be viewed as the middle period from 1893 to 1912. The K.Bay. Sts.B. continued to capital letters to indicate the overall category of vehicles, but changed the meanings in some cases to make them more 'intuitive'. For example, G became a covered (Gedeckter) goods van, S were flat wagons (Schienenwagen = rail-carrying wagon) and V were livestock vans (Viehwagen). In addition, lower case letters were used to further define the class of vehicle, indicating e.g. the maximum load, height of the sides etc., and additional axles were indicated by doubling or tripling the letters. So Xm was a departmental wagon with a maximum load over and SSml was a long, eight- wheeled flat wagon capable of carrying over 10 tonnes. The owner inscription was just K.Bay. Sts.B. without any coat of arms. = Epoch Ic (1913‚Äì1920) = In 1909, the German state railways founded the German State Railway Wagon Association (Deutscher Staatsbahnwagenverband or DSV) in order to enable the free interchange of goods wagons and reduce production and maintenance costs. At the same time standardized wagon numbering, based on the Prussian system, was introduced. In Bavaria, this appears to have been delayed until 1912/13. In addition, Bavaria introduced a naming scheme. Departmental wagons were given the name of their railway division, but others received the name of a Bavarian division depending on their age, type and location. So a modern covered goods wagon with over 15 ton maximum load was designated Gm M√ºnchen. More strikingly, the DSV wagons were supposed to be painted red-brown from 1 January 1911. However this was delayed at least a year in Bavaria and it is likely that green wagons were still around for some time afterwards. Epoch Ic ended with the merging of the state railways into the Deutsche Reichsbahn in the aftermath of World War I. However Bavarian livery could probably continue to be seen for some time afterwards.

He also wrote under the pseudonym Pavle Sedmak. Biography Bevk was born in the mountain village of Zakojca (Coizza during Italian rule, now part of the Municipality of Cerkno) in the County of Gorizia and Gradisca of what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now in Slovenia. He was the oldest of eight children born to the tenant farmer and shoemaker Ivan Bevk and his wife Katarina (n√©e ƒåufer).Information display at the France Bevk home in Zakojca. Bevk attended school in Bukovo until 1904, and then in Kranj (1905), Koper (1908), and Gorizia (1909), and became a teacher in the Slovene Littoral. His first teaching position was in the village of Orehek. During the First World War he was a soldier on the Eastern Front and for a while at a military school in Hungary. After the war he worked for various newspapers in Ljubljana. In 1920 he moved to Gorizia dedicating himself to cultural and political activism in the Slovene Littoral, then under Italian rule. He was frequently prosecuted by Italian Fascist authorities and interned for his activities. In 1935 he had to leave the Julian March and moved to Ljubljana, in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. There, he came in contact with the vibrant cultural life of the Slovenian capital, becoming friends with figures such as the painter Zoran Mu≈°iƒç, writer Vladimir Bartol, political activist and author Lavo ƒåermelj, literary critic Josip Vidmar and art historian France Stele. After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, he was imprisoned by the Italian occupation authorities due to his public Anti-Fascist stance. In 1943, he escaped from prison and joined the Slovene Partisans. After the end of World War II, he moved to Trieste and later back to Ljubljana. In 1953 he became a member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts.Helga Glu≈°iƒç, Sto Slovenskih Pripovednikov (Ljubljana: Pre≈°ernova dru≈æba, 1996) He received the Pre≈°eren Award, the most prestigious award for artistic achievements in Slovenia, twice, in 1949 and in 1954. He died in Ljubljana on his 80th birthday.  Work  Bevk started writing at the age of sixteen with encouragement from the influential feminist editor Zofka Kveder. In his early poems, Bevk was influenced by the vitalist poetry of Oton ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç and Maurice Maeterlinck. After the experience of World War I, he came under the influence of Christian expressionism which represented a strong literary and artistic current in interwar Slovenia. Some of its most talented representatives, such as the poet Jo≈æa Lovrenƒçiƒç and Ivan Pregelj, came from Bevk's native region of Gori≈°ka. At first, he followed their examples, but later moved to social realism. He became known in the 1930s with his novels describing the struggle of the Slovene people from the Julian March to maintain their identity against the Fascist Italianization. His best-known work was the novel Kaplan Martin ƒåedermac (The Vicar Martin ƒåedermac), in which he described the inner struggles of a Roman Catholic priest in the westernmost Slovene ethnic region known as Venetian Slovenia. The novel was published under a pseudonym by the publishing house Slovenska matica in 1938 and soon became a best-seller. The term ƒåedermac is still used in Slovene to refer to the Roman Catholic clergy in the Slovene Littoral that struggled to defend the Slovene identity of their flock under the Italian Fascist regime. His realist literature pay attention to topics of land ownership, arranged marriage, alcoholism and conservativism in rural settings. Later in his life, Bevk devoted himself largely to children's literature. He was a very prolific author: when a complete bibliography was made on the occasion of his 70th birthday, it was determined that Bevk had written over 100 books.  Legacy  Although Bevk is still revered as the author of the popular novel The Vicar Martin ƒåedermac, he is mostly remembered as an author of children's literature. The regional library in Nova Gorica is named after him, as well as the central square in the town.

Today, it is produced in many rural communities and sold in stores and by street vendors in Jamaica and abroad. Bammies have been consumed since pre-Columbian times and is believed to have originated with the native Arawak people. For centuries, it was the bread staple for rural Jamaicans until the cheaper, imported wheat flour breads became popular in the post-World War II era. In the 1990s, the United Nations and the Jamaican government established a program to revive bammy production and to market it as a modern, convenient food product.Bammy bread bounces back. Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations Bammy is made from bitter cassava (also called yuca and manioc in other American cultures). Traditionally, the cassava is grated and placed in a press bag (woven with thatch leaves) and placed in an outdoor press where heavy stones are loaded on. Once completely drained, but still a bit moist, the cassava is beaten in a mortar then sieved to a fine flour texture. Salt is then added to taste. The actual baking of bammies varies across Jamaican communities. Traditionally, it is made by spreading a handful of the flour evenly in a baking ring on a flat iron or griddle on the open fire. While baking, the top of the bammy is patted with a flat board and then turned over. The baking process takes about 3 minutes and the final product is a thin, foldable bread about 10\\" in diameter. This is similar to traditional tortillas of Native American cultures. It can then be eaten with whatever fillings are desired. The more modern (and popular) approach is to bake thicker bammies about 6\\" in diameter. These are often mass-produced in factories. When home-baked, the flour may be store-bought or made by hand- pressing. The bammy can be baked on griddles or in baking pans on a stove top. Some choose to bake it inside an oven, and to add butter and other spices before baking. Baking takes longer due to the thickness, and the final product is then cut into halves or wedges for freezing. When ready to eat, the wedges are soaked in coconut milk and then fried to a golden brown, and served with meat, fish, avocado, or other side dishes. Bammies, like wheat bread and tortillas, are served at any meal or consumed as a snack.

Early life and education Derry was born in Cairo, Egypt, where his father, Dr Douglas Derry, was Professor of Anatomy at Royal Egyptian University. Dr Derry was the first anatomist to be involved in the examination of Tutankhamun's mummy, after the discovery of the tomb in 1925. Derry attended Dragon School in Oxford and Charterhouse School. In his youth, Derry developed a keen interest in bird watching and often attended motor races. Military career Shortly after the outbreak of World War II, he left school to enlist as a wireless operator and air gunner in the Royal Air Force. In 1942 he received a commission and the following year trained (in Canada) as a pilot. His operational career began late in 1944 when he joined 182 Squadron, flying Hawker Typhoons on close support to the Allied armies in the Low Countries. After serving also with 181 Squadron, he was given command of 182 Squadron shortly before the end of the war. Test pilot career In 1947 Derry joined de Havilland as a test pilot, working largely on the de Havilland DH 108 aircraft. He is widely believed to have exceeded the speed of sound on 6 September 1948, when he lost control of his aircraft and the Mach meter supposedly 'briefly showed' supersonic speeds in a shallow dive from 12,195 m (40,000 ft) to 9,145 m (30,000 ft). Despite lack of substantial evidence (the recording apparatus was switched off during the flight), the news was promoted by the British press as having broken the sound barrier. Also in 1948, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Aero Club. Tom Wolfe's book The Right Stuff referred to this claim, but referred to another test pilot, Geoffrey de Havilland, Jr.,Wolfe, Tom (1979), The Right Stuff, 1980 reprint, New York: Bantam, Ch. 3, \\"Yeager\\", p. 49, . who had been killed in a previous test flight, when his DH 108 broke up at about Mach 0.9. As a demonstration pilot, Derry developed a new type of aerobatic manoeuvre which became known as the \\"Derry Turn\\". It consists of a reversal of bank during a steep turn which is performed with the aircraft passing through the inverted rather than upright attitude. Death Derry was killed in the 1952 Farnborough Airshow DH.110 crash (the DH 110 went on to become the de Havilland Sea Vixen) when his aircraft broke up because of a design fault resulting in catastrophic structural failure, with 31 fatalities including himself, his flight observer Tony Richards, and 29 spectators. The jury at the inquest returned a verdict that the pilot and observer died of accidental death and the deaths of the spectators was also accidental. In popular culture Derry's DH 108 historic test flight was used in dramatized form in the 1952 film The Sound Barrier directed by David Lean. John Justin plays Philip Peel, a test pilot who brings his plane through the sound barrier and out of the speed-creating dive by the untried technique of applying reverse direction to the control column.

History There had always been a large number of Christians in the service of Raja Scindia at Gwalior State. In its heyday the Catholic community was reckoned to be one thousand strong. They were scattered in three main camps under the command of three Christian officers.'(Vannini Fr. Fulgentius ofm cap. : Hindustan - Tibet Mission) They were the Lashkar camp, called by the Indians Kampoo, commanded by Colonel Filose; then Sikander Kampoo, commanded by colonel Alexander; thirdly, the Jacob Camp commanded by colonel Jacob. Colonel Filose and Colonel Alexander were Catholics, but Colonel Jacob was an Armenian. Due to political disturbance and the Napoleonic Wars, the missionaries coming to India were reduced to 12 in 1770, 8 in 1800 and from 1817 to 1822 there were only three missionaries working at different places. Fr. Angelo of Caraglio was working at Agra, Sardhana and Gwalior between the years 1817 - 1822. With this we can trace that Gwalior was a visiting station from 1817; but from the letter of John Baptist Filose to the Capuchin fathers working at Surat, requesting them to send a chaplain to Gwalior, we can conclude that Gwalior had a visiting chaplain even before 1803 (ibid p. 272). It seems that due to lack of missionaries, people who were willing to become Christians were baptized without sufficient instruction to the catholic faith. Therefore, missionaries coming after them had a difficult time. There was another group of Christians who had come from Goa in search of employment in the Scindia dominion. The present church of St. John the Baptist was built by John Baptist Filose, roundabout the year 1828. Fr. Constant Fernandez, a Goan Diocesan Priest was the first residing chaplain of Lashkar and he laboured from 1832 to 1844. He was succeeded in August 1844 by Fr. Anastasius Hartmann, a Swiss Capuchin. He worked 18 months at Gwalior. During his stay he opened a school for the education of poor children, established an industrial centre for the employment of young girls and widows, provided the station with a burial ground and education uplift of his flock. His whole idea was to make the Christians better, to get them to lead a real Catholic life. He was appointed Bishop of Derne and First Vicar Apostolic of Patna on 30 September 1845. It was during this year that Agra Mission was divided into two separate Vicariates: Agra and Patna. Before this the whole of North India, known as the prefecture Apostolic of Tibet & Hindustan, was constituted into the Vicariate Apostolic of Agra, in 1820. The list of the Chaplains at Gwalior is rather long. There have been 33 Chaplains from 1832 till it was dismembered from the Agra Archdiocese (established in 1886) and added the diocese of Jhansi on 5 July 1954. The priests who were involved as parish priests at Gwalior were Fr. Roger ofm Cap., Fr. M. Joseph, Fr. Alphonse C., Fr. Abraham Palakudy, Fr. Joseph, Palakudy and Fr. John C. Kedari, Fr. P. Martin, Fr. Eugene. Six districts of M.P. cover within the diocese of Gwalior. They are Bhind, Datia, Gwalior, Morena, Sheopur and Shivpuri.

He spent much of his seven-year (1964‚Äì70) professional career in the Red Sox organization, although Boston would lose him on waivers once, trade him twice, and reacquire him twice in the space of four seasons. An outfielder, Schlesinger was signed by Boston in 1963 out of the University of Cincinnati, where he graduated with a degree in education.Spink, C.C.

Thus began the \\"yo-yo\\" nature of his career. After parts of two seasons in the Athletics' farm system, the Red Sox reacquired Schlesinger in 1966 and he played the entire 1967 campaign with the Double-A Pittsfield Red Sox, belting 21 home runs.Baseball Reference minor league page Then, during the winter meetings on November 30, 1967, he was traded with cash to the Chicago Cubs for pitcher Ray Culp.

He then began 1969 with Boston's Louisville Colonels affiliate. After only 50 at bats in Louisville, the parent Red Sox traded him again, this time to the Philadelphia Phillies for veteran outfielder Don Lock.

Two attacks were repulsed by the local clans of Clan Sutherland and the Murrays of Aberscross. Background In 1462, John MacDonald of Islay, Earl of Ross had entered into a secret treaty, in which he agreed to become a vassal of Edward IV of England in return for help in conquering northern Scotland. When James III of Scotland discovered this agreement in 1476, he stripped John of his possessions on the mainland. John spent the next few years trying to reclaim the land he thought was his. When he lent most of his forces to his kinsman Donald Balloch of Islay to ravage the West Coast, John took 500-600 men around the north of Scotland to the Dornoch Firth on the east coast. It's not clear what his intention was, but he landed a few miles from Dunrobin Castle, home to Clan Sutherland who controlled much of the far north of Scotland. Battles At first the MacDonalds camped in front of Skibo Castle, a possession of the Bishop of Caithness. John, 8th Earl of Sutherland sent a force under Neill Murray to watch the islanders. MacDonald began to ravage the country, so Murray attacked, driving off the invaders who lost a captain named Donald Dubh-na-Soirn, and 50 men. In response to this defeat, MacDonald sent some of his men and \\"a company of men from Ross\\" up the coast to Loch Fleet, just south of Dunrobin. Sutherland sent his brother Robert and some men to meet the attackers \\"on the sands of Strathfleet\\". After a \\"fierce and bloody struggle\\", the island men and their allies were defeated \\"with great slaughter\\" and the survivors pursued as far as Bonar. Aftermath This was to be the final conflict between the MacDonalds and Sutherlands, as Sutherland married MacDonald's sister Margaret soon afterwards, sealing an alliance. However this heavy defeat may have been a factor in the conflict between John MacDonald and his son Angus Og, which resulted in the Battle of Bloody Bay in 1480 or 1483.

The benzene molecule is composed of six carbon atoms joined in a planar ring with one hydrogen atom attached to each. As it contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms, benzene is classed as a hydrocarbon. Benzene is a natural constituent of crude oil and is one of the elementary petrochemicals. Due to the cyclic continuous pi bonds between the carbon atoms, benzene is classed as an aromatic hydrocarbon, the second [n]-annulene ([6]-annulene). It is sometimes abbreviated PhH. Benzene is a colorless and highly flammable liquid with a sweet smell, and is responsible for the aroma around petrol (gasoline) stations. It is used primarily as a precursor to the manufacture of chemicals with more complex structure, such as ethylbenzene and cumene, of which billions of kilograms are produced annually. As benzene has a high octane number, aromatic derivatives like toluene and xylene typically comprise up to 25% of gasoline (petrol). Benzene itself has been limited to less than 1% in gasoline because it is a known human carcinogen. Most non-industrial applications have been limited as well for the same reason. History=Discovery= The word \\"benzene\\" derives from \\"gum benzoin\\" (benzoin resin), an aromatic resin known to European pharmacists and perfumers since the 16th century as a product of southeast Asia.The word \\"benzoin\\" is derived from the Arabic expression \\"luban jawi\\", or \\"frankincense of Java\\". An acidic material was derived from benzoin by sublimation, and named \\"flowers of benzoin\\", or benzoic acid. The hydrocarbon derived from benzoic acid thus acquired the name benzin, benzol, or benzene. Michael Faraday first isolated and identified benzene in 1825 from the oily residue derived from the production of illuminating gas, giving it the name bicarburet of hydrogen. On pages 443‚Äì450, Faraday discusses \\"bicarburet of hydrogen\\" (benzene). On pages 449‚Äì450, he shows that benzene's empirical formula is C6H6, although he doesn't realize it because he (like most chemists at that time) used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12). In 1833, Eilhard Mitscherlich produced it by distilling benzoic acid (from gum benzoin) and lime. He gave the compound the name benzin. In a footnote on page 43, Liebig, the journal's editor, suggested changing Mitscherlich's original name for benzene (namely, \\"benzin\\") to \\"benzol\\", because the suffix \\"-in\\" suggested that it was an alkaloid (e.g., Chinin (quinine)), which benzene isn't, whereas the suffix \\"-ol\\" suggested that it was oily, which benzene is. Thus on page 44, Mitscherlich states: \\"Da diese Fl√ºssigkeit aus der Benzo√´s√§ure gewonnen wird, und wahrscheinlich mit den Benzoylverbindungen im Zusammenhang steht, so gibt man ihr am besten den Namen Benzol, da der Name Benzo√Øn schon f√ºr die mit dem Bittermandel√∂l isomerische Verbindung von Liebig und W√∂hler gew√§hlt worden ist.\\" (Since this liquid [benzene] is obtained from benzoic acid and probably is related to benzoyl compounds, the best name for it is \\"benzol\\", since the name \\"benzo√Øn\\" has already been chosen, by Liebig and W√∂hler, for the compound that's isomeric with the oil of bitter almonds [benzaldehyde].) In 1836, the French chemist Auguste Laurent named the substance \\"ph√®ne\\";Laurent, Auguste (1836) \\"Sur la chloroph√©nise et les acides chloroph√©nisique et chloroph√©n√®sique,\\" Annales de Chemie et de Physique, vol. 63, pp. 27‚Äì45, see p. 44: \\"Je donne le nom de ph√®ne au radical fondamental des acides pr√©c√©dens (œÜŒ±ŒπŒΩœâ, j'√©claire), puisque la benzine se trouve dans le gaz de l'√©clairage.\\" (I give the name of \\"ph√®ne\\" (œÜŒ±ŒπŒΩœâ, I illuminate) to the fundamental radical of the preceding acids, because benzene is found in illuminating gas.) this word has become the root of the English word \\"phenol\\", which is hydroxylated benzene, and \\"phenyl\\", the radical formed by abstraction of a hydrogen atom (free radical H‚Ä¢) from benzene. Kekul√©'s 1872 modification of his 1865 theory, illustrating rapid alternation of double bondsCritics pointed out a problem with Kekul√©'s original (1865) structure for benzene: Whenever benzene underwent substitution at the ortho position, two distinguishable isomers should have resulted, depending on whether a double bond or a single bond existed between the carbon atoms to which the substituents were attached; however, no such isomers were observed. In 1872, Kekul√© suggested that benzene had two complementary structures and that these forms rapidly interconverted, so that if there were a double bond between any pair of carbon atoms at one instant, that double bond would become a single bond at the next instant (and vice versa). To provide a mechanism for the conversion process, Kekul√© proposed that the valency of an atom is determined by the frequency with which it collided with its neighbors in a molecule. As the carbon atoms in the benzene ring collided with each other, each carbon atom would collide twice with one neighbor during a given interval and then twice with its other neighbor during the next interval. Thus, a double bond would exist with one neighbor during the first interval and with the other neighbor during the next interval. Therefore, between the carbon atoms of benzene there were no fixed (i.e., constant) and distinct single or double bonds; instead, the bonds between the carbon atoms were identical. See pages 86‚Äì89 of Auguste Kekul√© (1872) \\"Ueber einige Condensationsprodukte des Aldehyds\\" (On some condensation products of aldehydes), Liebig's Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie, 162(1): 77‚Äì124, 309‚Äì320. From p. 89: \\"Das einfachste Mittel aller St√∂√üe eines Kohlenstoffatoms ergiebt sich aus der Summe der St√∂√üe der beiden ersten Zeiteinheiten, die sich dann periodisch wiederholen. ‚Ä¶ man sieht daher, da√ü jedes Kohlenstoffatom mit den beiden anderen, ‚Ä¶ da√ü diese Verschiedenheit nur eine scheinbare, aber keine wirkliche ist.\\" (The simplest average of all the collisions of a carbon atom [in benzene] comes from the sum of the collisions during the first two units of time, which then periodically repeat. ‚Ä¶ thus one sees that each carbon atom collides equally often with the two others against which it bumps, [and] thus stands in exactly the same relation with its two neighbors. The usual structural formula for benzene expresses, of course, only the collisions that occur during one unit of time, thus during one phase, and so one is led to the view [that] doubly substituted derivatives [of benzene] must be different at positions 1,2 and 1,6 [of the benzene ring]. If the idea [that was] just presented ‚Äî or a similar one ‚Äî can be regarded as correct, then [it] follows therefrom that this difference [between the bonds at positions 1,2 and 1,6] is only an apparent [one], not a real [one].) In 1845, Charles Mansfield, working under August Wilhelm von Hofmann, isolated benzene from coal tar.Hofmann, A. W. (1845) \\"Ueber eine sichere Reaction auf Benzol\\" (On a reliable test for benzene), Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie, vol. 55, pp. 200‚Äì205; on pp. 204‚Äì205, Hofmann found benzene in coal tar oil. Four years later, Mansfield began the first industrial-scale production of benzene, based on the coal-tar method.Charles Mansfield filed for (November 11, 1847) and received (May 1848) a patent (no. 11,960) for the fractional distillation of coal tar. Gradually, the sense developed among chemists that a number of substances were chemically related to benzene, comprising a diverse chemical family. In 1855, Hofmann used the word \\"aromatic\\" to designate this family relationship, after a characteristic property of many of its members. [Note: The empirical formulas of organic compounds that appear in Hofmann's article (p. 3) are based upon an atomic mass of carbon of 6 (instead of 12) and an atomic mass of oxygen of 8 (instead of 16).] In 1997, benzene was detected in deep space. =Ring formula= Claus (1867),Claus, Adolph K.L.

See further: Thiele (1901) \\"Zur Kenntnis der unges√§ttigen Verbindungen,\\" Justus Liebig‚Äôs Annalen der Chemie, 319: 129‚Äì143.In his 1890 paper, Armstrong represented benzene nuclei within polycyclic benzenoids by placing inside the benzene nuclei a letter \\"C\\", an abbreviation of the word \\"centric\\". Centric affinities (i.e., bonds) acted within a designated cycle of carbon atoms. From p. 102: \\" ‚Ä¶ benzene, according to this view, may be represented by a double ring, in fact.\\" See: * The use of a circle to denote a benzene nucleus first appeared in: * A history of the determination of benzene's structure is recounted in: * and Kekul√© (1865). Dewar benzene and prismane are distinct that have Dewar's and Ladenburg's structures. Thiele and Kekul√©'s structures are used today. The empirical formula for benzene was long known, but its highly polyunsaturated structure, with just one hydrogen atom for each carbon atom, was challenging to determine. Archibald Scott Couper in 1858 and Johann Josef Loschmidt in 1861 suggested possible structures that contained multiple double bonds or multiple rings, but too little evidence was then available to help chemists decide on any particular structure. In 1865, the German chemist Friedrich August Kekul√© published a paper in French (for he was then teaching in Francophone Belgium) suggesting that the structure contained a ring of six carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds. The next year he published a much longer paper in German on the same subject. On p. 100, Kekul√© suggests that the carbon atoms of benzene could form a \\"cha√Æne ferm√©e\\" (a closed chain, a loop). Kekul√© used evidence that had accumulated in the intervening years‚Äînamely, that there always appeared to be only one isomer of any monoderivative of benzene, and that there always appeared to be exactly three isomers of every disubstituted derivative‚Äînow understood to correspond to the ortho, meta, and para patterns of arene substitution‚Äîto argue in support of his proposed structure.. Kekul√©'s symmetrical ring could explain these curious facts, as well as benzene's 1:1 carbon-hydrogen ratio. The new understanding of benzene, and hence of all aromatic compounds, proved to be so important for both pure and applied chemistry that in 1890 the German Chemical Society organized an elaborate appreciation in Kekul√©'s honor, celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of his first benzene paper. Here Kekul√© spoke of the creation of the theory. He said that he had discovered the ring shape of the benzene molecule after having a reverie or day-dream of a snake seizing its own tail (this is a common symbol in many ancient cultures known as the Ouroboros or Endless knot). This vision, he said, came to him after years of studying the nature of carbon-carbon bonds. This was 7 years after he had solved the problem of how carbon atoms could bond to up to four other atoms at the same time. Curiously, a similar, humorous depiction of benzene had appeared in 1886 in a pamphlet entitled Berichte der Durstigen Chemischen Gesellschaft (Journal of the Thirsty Chemical Society), a parody of the Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft, only the parody had monkeys seizing each other in a circle, rather than snakes as in Kekul√©'s anecdote.English translation Some historians have suggested that the parody was a lampoon of the snake anecdote, possibly already well known through oral transmission even if it had not yet appeared in print. Kekul√©'s 1890 speech in which this anecdote appeared has been translated into English. If the anecdote is the memory of a real event, circumstances mentioned in the story suggest that it must have happened early in 1862. The cyclic nature of benzene was finally confirmed by the crystallographer Kathleen Lonsdale in 1929. =Nomenclature= The German chemist Wilhelm K√∂rner suggested the prefixes ortho-, meta-, para- to distinguish di-substituted benzene derivatives in 1867; however, he did not use the prefixes to distinguish the relative positions of the substituents on a benzene ring.Wilhelm K√∂rner (1867) \\"Faits pour servir √† la d√©termination du lieu chimique dans la s√©rie aromatique\\" (Facts to be used in determining chemical location in the aromatic series), Bulletins de l'Acad√©mie royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts de Belgique, 2nd series, 24 : 166‚Äì185; see especially p. 169. From p. 169: \\"On distingue facilement ces trois s√©ries, dans lesquelles les d√©riv√©s bihydroxyliques ont leurs terms correspondants, par les pr√©fixes ortho-, para- et m√™ta-.\\" (One easily distinguishes these three series ‚Äì in which the dihydroxy derivatives have their corresponding terms ‚Äì by the prefixes ortho-, para- and meta-.)Hermann von Fehling, ed., Neues Handw√∂rterbuch der Chemie [New concise dictionary of chemistry] (Braunschweig, Germany: Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn, 1874), vol. 1, p. 1142. It was the German chemist Karl Gr√§be who, in 1869, first used the prefixes ortho-, meta-, para- to denote specific relative locations of the substituents on a di-substituted aromatic ring (viz, naphthalene).Graebe (1869) \\"Ueber die Constitution des Naphthalins\\" (On the structure of naphthalene), Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie, 149 : 20‚Äì28; see especially p. 26. In 1870, the German chemist Viktor Meyer first applied Gr√§be's nomenclature to benzene.Victor Meyer (1870) \\"Untersuchungen √ºber die Constitution der zweifach-substituirten Benzole\\" (Investigations into the structure of di-substituted benzenes), Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie, 156 : 265‚Äì301; see especially pp. 299‚Äì300. =Early applications= In the 19th and early 20th centuries, benzene was used as an after-shave lotion because of its pleasant smell. Prior to the 1920s, benzene was frequently used as an industrial solvent, especially for degreasing metal. As its toxicity became obvious, benzene was supplanted by other solvents, especially toluene (methylbenzene), which has similar physical properties but is not as carcinogenic. In 1903, Ludwig Roselius popularized the use of benzene to decaffeinate coffee. This discovery led to the production of Sanka. This process was later discontinued. Benzene was historically used as a significant component in many consumer products such as Liquid Wrench, several paint strippers, rubber cements, spot removers, and other products. Manufacture of some of these benzene-containing formulations ceased in about 1950, although Liquid Wrench continued to contain significant amounts of benzene until the late 1970s. =Occurrence= Trace amounts of benzene are found in petroleum and coal. It is a byproduct of the incomplete combustion of many materials. For commercial use, until World War II, most benzene was obtained as a by-product of coke production (or \\"coke-oven light oil\\") for the steel industry. However, in the 1950s, increased demand for benzene, especially from the growing polymers industry, necessitated the production of benzene from petroleum. Today, most benzene comes from the petrochemical industry, with only a small fraction being produced from coal. Structure The various representations of benzene. X-ray diffraction shows that all six carbon-carbon bonds in benzene are of the same length, at 140 picometres (pm). The C‚ÄìC bond lengths are greater than a double bond (135 pm) but shorter than a single bond (147 pm). This intermediate distance is consistent with electron delocalization: the electrons for C‚ÄìC bonding are distributed equally between each of the six carbon atoms. Benzene has 6 hydrogen atoms ‚Äì fewer than the corresponding parent alkane, hexane. The molecule is planar. The molecular orbital description involves the formation of three delocalized œÄ orbitals spanning all six carbon atoms, while the valence bond description involves a superposition of resonance structures. It is likely that this stability contributes to the peculiar molecular and chemical properties known as aromaticity. To accurately reflect the nature of the bonding, benzene is often depicted with a circle inside a hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms. Derivatives of benzene occur sufficiently often as a component of organic molecules that the Unicode Consortium has allocated a symbol in the Miscellaneous Technical block with the code U+232C (‚å¨) to represent it with three double bonds, and U+23E3 (‚è£) for a delocalized version. Benzene derivatives Many important chemical compounds are derived from benzene by replacing one or more of its hydrogen atoms with another functional group. Examples of simple benzene derivatives are phenol, toluene, and aniline, abbreviated PhOH, PhMe, and PhNH2, respectively. Linking benzene rings gives biphenyl, C6H5‚ÄìC6H5. Further loss of hydrogen gives \\"fused\\" aromatic hydrocarbons, such as naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, and pyrene. The limit of the fusion process is the hydrogen-free allotrope of carbon, graphite. In heterocycles, carbon atoms in the benzene ring are replaced with other elements. The most important variations contain nitrogen. Replacing one CH with N gives the compound pyridine, C5H5N. Although benzene and pyridine are structurally related, benzene cannot be converted into pyridine. Replacement of a second CH bond with N gives, depending on the location of the second N, pyridazine, pyrimidine, or pyrazine. Production Four chemical processes contribute to industrial benzene production: catalytic reforming, toluene hydrodealkylation, toluene disproportionation, and steam cracking. According to the ATSDR Toxicological Profile for benzene, between 1978 and 1981, catalytic reformates accounted for approximately 44‚Äì50% of the total U.S benzene production. =Catalytic reforming= In catalytic reforming, a mixture of hydrocarbons with boiling points between 60‚Äì200 ¬∞C is blended with hydrogen gas and then exposed to a bifunctional platinum chloride or rhenium chloride catalyst at 500‚Äì525 ¬∞C and pressures ranging from 8‚Äì50 atm. Under these conditions, aliphatic hydrocarbons form rings and lose hydrogen to become aromatic hydrocarbons. The aromatic products of the reaction are then separated from the reaction mixture (or reformate) by extraction with any one of a number of solvents, including diethylene glycol or sulfolane, and benzene is then separated from the other aromatics by distillation. The extraction step of aromatics from the reformate is designed to produce aromatics with lowest non-aromatic components. Recovery of the aromatics, commonly referred to as BTX (benzene, toluene and xylene isomers), involves such extraction and distillation steps. In similar fashion to this catalytic reforming, UOP and BP commercialized a method from LPG (mainly propane and butane) to aromatics. =Toluene hydrodealkylation= Toluene hydrodealkylation converts toluene to benzene. In this hydrogen-intensive process, toluene is mixed with hydrogen, then passed over a chromium, molybdenum, or platinum oxide catalyst at 500‚Äì650 ¬∞C and 20‚Äì60 atm pressure. Sometimes, higher temperatures are used instead of a catalyst (at the similar reaction condition). Under these conditions, toluene undergoes dealkylation to benzene and methane: :C6H5CH3 \\\\+ H2 ‚Üí C6H6 \\\\+ CH4 This irreversible reaction is accompanied by an equilibrium side reaction that produces biphenyl (aka diphenyl) at higher temperature: :2 + If the raw material stream contains much non-aromatic components (paraffins or naphthenes), those are likely decomposed to lower hydrocarbons such as methane, which increases the consumption of hydrogen. A typical reaction yield exceeds 95%. Sometimes, xylenes and heavier aromatics are used in place of toluene, with similar efficiency. This is often called \\"on-purpose\\" methodology to produce benzene, compared to conventional BTX (benzene-toluene-xylene) extraction processes. =Toluene disproportionation= Where a chemical complex has similar demands for both benzene and xylene, then toluene disproportionation (TDP) may be an attractive alternative to the toluene hydrodealkylation. In the broad sense, two toluene molecules are reacted and the methyl groups rearranged from one toluene molecule to the other, yielding one benzene molecule and one xylene molecule. Given that demand for para-xylene (p-xylene) substantially exceeds demand for other xylene isomers, a refinement of the TDP process called Selective TDP (STDP) may be used. In this process, the xylene stream exiting the TDP unit is approximately 90% paraxylene. In some current catalytic systems, even the benzene-to-xylenes ratio is decreased (more xylenes) when the demand of xylenes is higher. =Steam cracking= Steam cracking is the process for producing ethylene and other alkenes from aliphatic hydrocarbons. Depending on the feedstock used to produce the olefins, steam cracking can produce a benzene-rich liquid by-product called pyrolysis gasoline. Pyrolysis gasoline can be blended with other hydrocarbons as a gasoline additive, or routed through an extraction process to recover BTX aromatics (benzene, toluene and xylenes). = Other methods = Although of no commercial significance, many other routes to benzene exist. Phenol and halobenzenes can be reduced with metals. Benzoic acid and its salts undergo decarboxylation to benzene. Via the reaction the diazonium compound with hypophosphorus acid aniline gives benzene. Trimerization of acetylene gives benzene. Uses Benzene is used mainly as an intermediate to make other chemicals, above all ethylbenzene, cumene, cyclohexane, nitrobenzene, and alkylbenzene. More than half of the entire benzene production is processed into ethylbenzene, a precursor to styrene, which is used to make polymers and plastics like polystyrene and EPS. Some 20% of the benzene production is used to manufacture cumene, which is needed to produce phenol and acetone for resins and adhesives. Cyclohexane consumes around 10% of the world's benzene production; it is primarily used in the manufacture of nylon fibers, which are processed into textiles and engineering plastics. Smaller amounts of benzene are used to make some types of rubbers, lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, explosives, and pesticides. In 2013, the biggest consumer country of benzene was China, followed by the USA. Benzene production is currently expanding in the Middle East and in Africa, whereas production capacities in Western Europe and North America are stagnating. Toluene is now often used as a substitute for benzene, for instance as a fuel additive. The solvent-properties of the two are similar, but toluene is less toxic and has a wider liquid range. Toluene is also processed into benzene. File:Benzene_uses.pngcenterMajor commodity chemicals and polymers derived from benzene.

As a consequence, gasoline often contained several percent benzene before the 1950s, when tetraethyl lead replaced it as the most widely used antiknock additive. With the global phaseout of leaded gasoline, benzene has made a comeback as a gasoline additive in some nations. In the United States, concern over its negative health effects and the possibility of benzene's entering the groundwater have led to stringent regulation of gasoline's benzene content, with limits typically around 1%.Kolmetz, Gentry, Guidelines for BTX Revamps, AIChE 2007 Spring Conference European petrol specifications now contain the same 1% limit on benzene content. The United States Environmental Protection Agency introduced new regulations in 2011 that lowered the benzene content in gasoline to 0.62%. In many European languages, the word for petroleum or gasoline is an exact cognate of \\"benzene\\". Reactions The most common reactions of benzene involve substitution of a proton by other groups. Electrophilic aromatic substitution is a general method of derivatizing benzene. Benzene is sufficiently nucleophilic that it undergoes substitution by acylium ions and alkyl carbocations to give substituted derivatives. :Electrophilic aromatic substitution of benzene The most widely practiced example of this reaction is the ethylation of benzene. ::320 px Approximately 24,700,000 tons were produced in 1999. Highly instructive but of far less industrial significance is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene (and many other aromatic rings) using an alkyl halide in the presence of a strong Lewis acid catalyst. Similarly, the Friedel-Crafts acylation is a related example of electrophilic aromatic substitution. The reaction involves the acylation of benzene (or many other aromatic rings) with an acyl chloride using a strong Lewis acid catalyst such as aluminium chloride or Iron(III) chloride. Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene by acetyl chloride =Sulfonation, chlorination, nitration= Using electrophilic aromatic substitution, many functional groups are introduced onto the benzene framework. Sulfonation of benzene involves the use of oleum, a mixture of sulfuric acid with sulfur trioxide. Sulfonated benzene derivatives are useful detergents. In nitration, benzene reacts with nitronium ions (NO2+), which is a strong electrophile produced by combining sulfuric and nitric acids. Nitrobenzene is the precursor to aniline. Chlorination is achieved with chlorine to give chlorobenzene in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst such as aluminium tri-chloride. =Hydrogenation= Via hydrogenation, benzene and its derivatives convert to cyclohexane and derivatives. This reaction is achieved by the use of high pressures of hydrogen in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts, such as finely divided nickel. Whereas alkenes can be hydrogenated near room temperatures, benzene and related compounds are more reluctant substrates, requiring temperatures >100 ¬∞C. This reaction is practiced on a large scale industrially. In the absence of the catalyst, benzene is impervious to hydrogen. Hydrogenation cannot be stopped to give cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes as these are superior substrates. Birch reduction, a non catalytic process, however selectively hydrogenates benzene to the diene. =Metal complexes= Benzene is an excellent ligand in the organometallic chemistry of low-valent metals. Important examples include the sandwich and half-sandwich complexes, respectively, Cr(C6H6)2 and [RuCl2(C6H6)]2. Health effects thumb Benzene is classified as a carcinogen, which increases the risk of cancer and other illnesses, and is also a notorious cause of bone marrow failure. Substantial quantities of epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data link benzene to aplastic anemia, acute leukemia, bone marrow abnormalities and cardiovascular disease.Kasper, Dennis L.et al. (2004) Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th ed., McGraw-Hill Professional, p. 618, .Merck Manual, Home Edition, \\"Overview of Leukemia\\". The specific hematologic malignancies that benzene is associated with include: acute myeloid leukemia (AML), aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The American Petroleum Institute (API) stated in 1948 that \\"it is generally considered that the only absolutely safe concentration for benzene is zero\\".American Petroleum Institute, API Toxicological Review, Benzene, September 1948, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Department of Health and Human Services There is no safe exposure level; even tiny amounts can cause harm. The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) classifies benzene as a human carcinogen. Long-term exposure to excessive levels of benzene in the air causes leukemia, a potentially fatal cancer of the blood-forming organs. In particular, acute myeloid leukemia or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (AML & ANLL) is not disputed to be caused by benzene.WHO. International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, Overall Evaluations of Carcinogenicity: An Updating of IARC Monographs , Volumes 1 to 42, Supplement 7 IARC rated benzene as \\"known to be carcinogenic to humans\\" (Group 1). As benzene is ubiquitous in gasoline and hydrocarbon fuels that are in use everywhere, human exposure to benzene is a global health problem. Benzene targets the liver, kidney, lung, heart and brain and can cause DNA strand breaks, chromosomal damage, etc. Benzene causes cancer in animals including humans. Benzene has been shown to cause cancer in both sexes of multiple species of laboratory animals exposed via various routes. Exposure to benzene According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) (2007), benzene is both a man-made and naturally occurring chemical from processes that include: volcanic eruptions, wild fires, synthesis of chemicals such as phenol, production of synthetic fibers, and fabrication of rubbers, lubricants, pesticides, medications, and dyes. The major sources of benzene exposure are tobacco smoke, automobile service stations, exhaust from motor vehicles, and industrial emissions; however, ingestion and dermal absorption of benzene can also occur through contact with contaminated water. Benzene is hepatically metabolized and excreted in the urine. Measurement of air and water levels of benzene is accomplished through collection via activated charcoal tubes, which are then analyzed with a gas chromatograph. The measurement of benzene in humans can be accomplished via urine, blood, and breath tests; however, all of these have their limitations because benzene is rapidly metabolized in the human body.Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.

The maximum allowable amount of benzene in workroom air during an 8-hour workday, 40-hour workweek is 1 ppm. As benzene can cause cancer, NIOSH recommends that all workers wear special breathing equipment when they are likely to be exposed to benzene at levels exceeding the recommended (8-hour) exposure limit of 0.1 ppm.Public Health Statement for Benzene, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. (August 2007). Benzene: Patient information sheet. Atsdr.cdc.gov (2011-03-03). Retrieved on 2011-11-23. =Benzene exposure limits= The United States Environmental Protection Agency has set a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for benzene in drinking water at 0.005 mg/L (5 ppb), as promulgated via the U.S. National Primary Drinking Water Regulations.Drinking Water ContaminantsOrganic ChemicalsBenzene. Water.epa.gov. Retrieved on 2014-04-17. This regulation is based on preventing benzene leukemogenesis. The maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG), a nonenforceable health goal that would allow an adequate margin of safety for the prevention of adverse effects, is zero benzene concentration in drinking water. The EPA requires that spills or accidental releases into the environment of 10 pounds (4.5 kg) or more of benzene be reported. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set a permissible exposure limit of 1 part of benzene per million parts of air (1 ppm) in the workplace during an 8-hour workday, 40-hour workweek. The short term exposure limit for airborne benzene is 5 ppm for 15 minutes.Chemical Sampling Information Benzene. Osha.gov. Retrieved on 2011-11-23. These legal limits were based on studies demonstrating compelling evidence of health risk to workers exposed to benzene. The risk from exposure to 1 ppm for a working lifetime has been estimated as 5 excess leukemia deaths per 1,000 employees exposed. (This estimate assumes no threshold for benzene's carcinogenic effects.) OSHA has also established an action level of 0.5 ppm to encourage even lower exposures in the workplace.Benzene Toxicity: Standards and RegulationsATSDR ‚Äì Environmental Medicine & Environmental Health Education ‚Äì CSEM. Atsdr.cdc.gov (2000-06-30). Retrieved on 2010-10-09. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) revised the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) concentration for benzene to 500 ppm. The current NIOSH definition for an IDLH condition, as given in the NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic, is one that poses a threat of exposure to airborne contaminants when that exposure is likely to cause death or immediate or delayed permanent adverse health effects or prevent escape from such an environment [NIOSH 2004]. The purpose of establishing an IDLH value is (1) to ensure that the worker can escape from a given contaminated environment in the event of failure of the respiratory protection equipment and (2) is considered a maximum level above which only a highly reliable breathing apparatus providing maximum worker protection is permitted [NIOSH 2004NIOSH respirator selection logic (October 2004).

Publication No. 2005-100.].Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH): Introduction. Cdc.gov. Retrieved on 2011-11-23. In September 1995, NIOSH issued a new policy for developing recommended exposure limits (RELs) for substances, including carcinogens. As benzene can cause cancer, NIOSH recommends that all workers wear special breathing equipment when they are likely to be exposed to benzene at levels exceeding the REL (10-hour) of 0.1 ppm. The NIOSH short-term exposure limit (STEL ‚Äì 15 min) is 1 ppm. American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) adopted Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) for benzene at 0.5 ppm TWA and 2.5 ppm STEL. =Toxicology=Biomarkers of exposure Several tests can determine exposure to benzene. Benzene itself can be measured in breath, blood or urine, but such testing is usually limited to the first 24 hours post-exposure due to the relatively rapid removal of the chemical by exhalation or biotransformation. Most people in developed countries have measureable baseline levels of benzene and other aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons in their blood. In the body, benzene is enzymatically converted to a series of oxidation products including muconic acid, phenylmercapturic acid, phenol, catechol, hydroquinone and 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene. Most of these metabolites have some value as biomarkers of human exposure, since they accumulate in the urine in proportion to the extent and duration of exposure, and they may still be present for some days after exposure has ceased. The current ACGIH biological exposure limits for occupational exposure are 500 Œºg/g creatinine for muconic acid and 25 Œºg/g creatinine for phenylmercapturic acid in an end- of-shift urine specimen.ACGIH (2009). 2009 TLVs and BEIs. American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, Cincinnati, Ohio.Baselt, R. (2008) Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man, 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, pp. 144‚Äì148, . Biotransformations Even if it is not a common substrate for metabolism, benzene can be oxidized by both bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, dioxygenase enzyme can add an oxygen to the ring, and the unstable product is immediately reduced (by NADH) to a cyclic diol with two double bonds, breaking the aromaticity. Next, the diol is newly reduced by NADH to catechol. The catechol is then metabolized to acetyl CoA and succinyl CoA, used by organisms mainly in the Citric Acid Cycle for energy production. The pathway for the metabolism of benzene is complex and begins in the liver. Several enzymes are involved. These include cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), quinine oxidoreductase (NQ01 or DT-diaphorase or NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone 1)), GSH, and myeloperoxidase (MPO). CYP2E1 is involved at multiple steps: converting benzene to oxepin (benzene oxide), phenol to hydroquinone, and hydroquinone to both benzenetriol and catechol. Hydroquinone, benzenetriol and catechol are converted to polyphenols. In the bone marrow, MPO converts these polyphenols to benzoquinones. These intermediates and metabolites induce genotoxicity by multiple mechanisms including inhibition of topoisomerase II (which maintains chromosome structure), disruption of microtubules (which maintains cellular structure and organization), generation of oxygen free radicals (unstable species) that may lead to point mutations, increasing oxidative stress, inducing DNA strand breaks, and altering DNA methylation (which can affect gene expression). NQ01 and GSH shift metabolism away from toxicity. NQ01 metabolizes benzoquinone toward polyphenols (counteracting the effect of MPO). GSH is involved with the formation of phenylmercapturic acid. Genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes may induce loss of function or gain of function. For example, mutations in CYP2E1 increase activity and result in increased generation of toxic metabolites. NQ01 mutations result in loss of function and may result in decreased detoxification. Myeloperoxidase mutations result in loss of function and may result in decreased generation of toxic metabolites. GSH mutations or deletions result in loss of function and result in decreased detoxification. These genes may be targets for genetic screening for susceptibility to benzene toxicity. Molecular toxicology The paradigm of toxicological assessment of benzene is shifting towards the domain of molecular toxicology as it allows understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms in a better way. Glutathione seems to play an important role by protecting against benzene-induced DNA breaks and it is being identified as a new biomarker for exposure and effect. Benzene causes chromosomal aberrations in the peripheral blood leukocytes and bone marrow explaining the higher incidence of leukemia and multiple myeloma caused by chronic exposure. These aberrations can be monitored using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with DNA probes to assess the effects of benzene along with the hematological tests as markers of hematotoxicity. Benzene metabolism involves enzymes coded for by polymorphic genes. Studies have shown that genotype at these loci may influence susceptibility to the toxic effects of benzene exposure. Individuals carrying variant of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX) and deletion of the glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) showed a greater frequency of DNA single-stranded breaks. Biological oxidation and carcinogenic activity One way of understanding the carcinogenic effects of benzene is by examining the products of biological oxidation. Pure benzene, for example, oxidizes in the body to produce an epoxide, benzene oxide, which is not excreted readily and can interact with DNA to produce harmful mutations. =Routes of exposure=Inhalation Outdoor air may contain low levels of benzene from automobile service stations, wood smoke, tobacco smoke, the transfer of gasoline, exhaust from motor vehicles, and industrial emissions.ToxFAQs for Benzene, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Department of Health and Human Services About 50% of the entire nationwide (United States) exposure to benzene results from smoking tobacco or from exposure to tobacco smoke.ToxGuide for Benzene, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Department of Health and Human Services After smoking 32 cigarettes per day, the smoker would take in about 1.8 milligrams (mg) of benzene. This amount is about 10 times the average daily intake of benzene by nonsmokers.Public Health Statement. Benzene, Division of Toxicology and Environmental Medicine, August 2007 Inhaled benzene is primarily expelled unchanged through exhalation. In a human study 16.4 to 41.6% of retained benzene was eliminated through the lungs within five to seven hours after a two- to three-hour exposure to 47 to 110 ppm and only 0.07 to 0.2% of the remaining benzene was excreted unchanged in the urine. After exposure to 63 to 405 mg/m3 of benzene for 1 to 5 hours, 51 to 87% was excreted in the urine as phenol over a period of 23 to 50 hours. In another human study, 30% of absorbed dermally applied benzene, which is primarily metabolized in the liver, was excreted as phenol in the urine.Benzene, CASRN: 71-43-2. Hazardous Substances Data Bank, U.S. National Library of Medicine. National Institutes of Health. Exposure from soft drinks Under specific conditions and in the presence of other chemicals benzoic acid (a preservative) and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) may interact to produce benzene. In March 2006, the official Food Standards Agency in Britain conducted a survey of 150 brands of soft drinks. It found that four contained benzene levels above World Health Organization limits. The affected batches were removed from sale. Similar problems were reported by the FDA in the United States.\\"FDA: Too Much Benzene In Some Drinks\\", CBS News, May 19, 2006.

Contamination of water supply In 2005, the water supply to the city of Harbin in China with a population of almost nine million people, was cut off because of a major benzene exposure. Benzene leaked into the Songhua River, which supplies drinking water to the city, after an explosion at a China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) factory in the city of Jilin on 13 November 2005.

It is a group-14 hydride and the simplest alkane, and is the main constituent of natural gas. The relative abundance of methane on Earth makes it an economically attractive fuel, although capturing and storing it poses technical challenges due to its gaseous state under normal conditions for temperature and pressure. Naturally occurring methane is found both below ground and under the seafloor, and is formed by both geological and biological processes. The largest reservoir of methane is under the seafloor in the form of methane clathrates. When methane reaches the surface and the atmosphere, it is known as atmospheric methane. The Earth's atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 150% since 1750, and it accounts for 20% of the total radiative forcing from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases. Methane has also been detected on other planets, including Mars, which has implications for astrobiology research. Properties and bonding Methane is a tetrahedral molecule with four equivalent C‚ÄìH bonds. Its electronic structure is described by four bonding molecular orbitals (MOs) resulting from the overlap of the valence orbitals on C and H. The lowest energy MO is the result of the overlap of the 2s orbital on carbon with the in-phase combination of the 1s orbitals on the four hydrogen atoms. Above this energy level is a triply degenerate set of MOs that involve overlap of the 2p orbitals on carbon with various linear combinations of the 1s orbitals on hydrogen. The resulting \\"three-over-one\\" bonding scheme is consistent with photoelectron spectroscopic measurements. At room temperature and standard pressure, methane is a colorless, odorless gas. The familiar smell of natural gas as used in homes is achieved by the addition of an odorant, usually blends containing tert-butylthiol, as a safety measure. Methane has a boiling point of ‚àí164 ¬∞C (‚àí257.8 ¬∞F) at a pressure of one atmosphere.Methane Phase change data. NIST Chemistry Webbook. As a gas it is flammable over a range of concentrations (5.4‚Äì17%) in air at standard pressure. Solid methane exists in several modifications. Presently nine are known. Cooling methane at normal pressure results in the formation of methane I. This substance crystallizes in the cubic system (space group Fmm). The positions of the hydrogen atoms are not fixed in methane I, i.e. methane molecules may rotate freely. Therefore, it is a plastic crystal. Chemical reactions The primary chemical reactions of methane are combustion, steam reforming to syngas, and halogenation. In general, methane reactions are difficult to control. =Selective oxidation= Partial oxidation of methane to methanol is challenging because the reaction typically progresses all the way to carbon dioxide and water even with an insufficient supply of oxygen. The enzyme methane monooxygenase produces methanol from methane, but cannot be used for industrial-scale reactions. Some homogeneously catalyzed systems and heterogeneous systems have been developed, but all have significant drawbacks. These generally operate by generating protected products which are shielded from overoxidation. Examples include the Catalytica system, copper zeolites, and iron zeolites stabilizing the alpha-oxygen active site. One group of bacteria drive methane oxidation with nitrite as the oxidant in the absence of oxygen, giving rise to the so-called anaerobic oxidation of methane. =Acid- base reactions= Like other hydrocarbons, methane is a very weak acid. Its pKa in DMSO is estimated to be 56. It cannot be deprotonated in solution, but the conjugate base is known in forms such as methyllithium. A variety of positive ions derived from methane have been observed, mostly as unstable species in low-pressure gas mixtures. These include methenium or methyl cation , methane cation , and methanium or protonated methane . Some of these have been detected in outer space. Methanium can also be produced as diluted solutions from methane with superacids. Cations with higher charge, such as and , have been studied theoretically and conjectured to be stable. Despite the strength of its C‚ÄìH bonds, there is intense interest in catalysts that facilitate C‚ÄìH bond activation in methane (and other lower numbered alkanes). =Combustion= Methane bubbles can be burned on a wet hand without injury. Methane's heat of combustion is 55.5 MJ/kg.Energy Content of some Combustibles (in MJ/kg) . People.hofstra.edu. Retrieved on March 30, 2014. Combustion of methane is a multiple step reaction summarized as follows: :CH4 \\\\+ 2 O2 ‚Üí CO2 \\\\+ 2 H2O (, at standard conditions) Peters four-step chemistry is a systematically reduced four-step chemistry which explains the burning of methane. =Methane radical reactions= Given appropriate conditions, methane reacts with halogen radicals as follows: :X‚Ä¢ + CH4 ‚Üí HX + CH3‚Ä¢ :CH3‚Ä¢ + X2 ‚Üí CH3X + X‚Ä¢ where X is a halogen: fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), or iodine (I). This mechanism for this process is called free radical halogenation. It is initiated when UV light or some other radical initiator (like peroxides) produces a halogen atom. A two-step chain reaction ensues in which the halogen atom abstracts a hydrogen atom from a methane molecule, resulting in the formation of a hydrogen halide molecule and a methyl radical (CH3‚Ä¢). The methyl radical then reacts with a molecule of the halogen to form a molecule of the halomethane, with a new halogen atom as byproduct. Similar reactions can occur on the halogenated product, leading to replacement of additional hydrogen atoms by halogen atoms with dihalomethane, trihalomethane, and ultimately, tetrahalomethane structures, depending upon reaction conditions and the halogen-to-methane ratio. Uses Methane is used in industrial chemical processes and may be transported as a refrigerated liquid (liquefied natural gas, or LNG). While leaks from a refrigerated liquid container are initially heavier than air due to the increased density of the cold gas, the gas at ambient temperature is lighter than air. Gas pipelines distribute large amounts of natural gas, of which methane is the principal component. =Fuel= Methane is used as a fuel for ovens, homes, water heaters, kilns, automobiles, turbines, and other things. Activated carbon is used to store methane. Refined liquid methane is used as a rocket fuel, when combined with liquid oxygen, as in the BE-4 and Raptor engines. As the major constituent of natural gas, methane is important for electricity generation by burning it as a fuel in a gas turbine or steam generator. Compared to other hydrocarbon fuels, methane produces less carbon dioxide for each unit of heat released. At about 891 kJ/mol, methane's heat of combustion is lower than that of any other hydrocarbon. However, it produces more heat per mass (55.7 kJ/g) than any other organic molecule due to its relatively large content of hydrogen, which accounts for 55% of the heat of combustion but contributes only 25% of the molecular mass of methane. In many cities, methane is piped into homes for domestic heating and cooking. In this context it is usually known as natural gas, which is considered to have an energy content of 39 megajoules per cubic meter, or 1,000 BTU per standard cubic foot. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is predominantly methane (CH4) converted into liquid form for ease of storage or transport. As a rocket fuel, methane offers the advantage over kerosene of producing small exhaust molecules. This deposits less soot on the internal parts of rocket motors, reducing the difficulty of booster re-use. The lower molecular weight of the exhaust also increases the fraction of the heat energy which is in the form of kinetic energy available for propulsion, increasing the specific impulse of the rocket. Liquid methane also has a temperature range (91‚Äì112 K) nearly compatible with liquid oxygen (54‚Äì90 K). =Chemical feedstock= Natural gas, which is mostly composed of methane, is used to produce hydrogen gas on an industrial scale. Steam Methane Reforming (SMR), or simply known as Steam Reforming, is the most common method of producing commercial bulk hydrogen gas. More than 50 million metric tons are produced annually worldwide (2013), principally from SMR of natural gas.https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/hpep_report_2013.pdf Much of this hydrogen is used in petroleum refineries, in the production of chemicals and in food processing. Very large quantities of hydrogen are used in the industrial synthesis of ammonia. At high temperatures (700 - 1100 ¬∞C) and in the presence of a metal-based catalyst (nickel), steam reacts with methane to yield a mixture of CO and H2, known as \\"Water gas\\" or \\"Syn-gas\\": :CH4 \\\\+ H2O ‚áå CO + 3 H2 This reaction is strongly endothermic (consumes heat, ŒîHr= 206 kJ/mol). Additional hydrogen is obtained by the reaction of CO with water via the water-gas shift reaction. :CO + H2O ‚áå CO2 \\\\+ H2 This reaction is mildly exothermic (produces heat, ŒîHr= -41 kJ/mol). Methane is also subjected to free-radical chlorination in the production of chloromethanes, although methanol is a more typical precursor.Rossberg, M. et al. (2006) \\"Chlorinated Hydrocarbons\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Generation This diagram shows a method for producing methane sustainably. See: = Geological routes = The two main routes for geological methane generation are (i) organic (thermally generated, or thermogenic) and (ii) inorganic (abiotic). Thermogenic methane occurs due to the breakup of organic matter at elevated temperatures and pressures in deep sedimentary strata. Most methane in sedimentary basins is thermogenic; therefore, thermogenic methane is the most important source of natural gas. Thermogenic methane components are typically considered to be relic (from an earlier time). Generally, formation of thermogenic methane (at depth) can occur through organic matter breakup, or organic synthesis. Both ways can involve microorganisms (methanogenesis), but may also occur inorganically. The processes involved can also consume methane, with and without microorganisms. The more important source of methane at depth (crystalline bedrock) is abiotic. Abiotic means that methane is created from inorganic compounds, without biological activity, either through magmatic processes or via water- rock reactions that occur at low temperatures and pressures, like serpentinization. =Biological routes= Most of Earth's methane is biogenic and is produced by methanogenesis,Lessner, Daniel J(Dec 2009) Methanogenesis Biochemistry. In: eLS. John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester. http://www.els.net [doi: 10.1002/9780470015902.a0000573.pub2] a form of anaerobic respiration only known to be conducted by some members of the domain Archaea. Methanogens occupy landfills and other soils, ruminants (for example cows or cattle), the guts of termites, and the anoxic sediments below the seafloor and the bottom of lakes. Rice fields also generate large amounts of methane during plant growth.IPCC. Climate Change 2013: The physical Science Basis . United Nations Environment Programme, 2013: Ch. 6, p. 507 IPCC.ch This multistep process is used by these microorganisms for energy. The net reaction of methanogenesis is: :CO2 \\\\+ 4 H2‚Üí CH4 \\\\+ 2 H2O The final step in the process is catalyzed by the enzyme methyl coenzyme M reductase (MCR).Testing Australian sheep for exhaled methane production (2001), CSIRO This image represents a ruminant, more specifically a sheep producing methane within the four stages of hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. Ruminants Ruminants, such as cattle, belch methane, accounting for ~22% of the U.S. annual methane emissions to the atmosphere. One study reported that the livestock sector in general (primarily cattle, chickens, and pigs) produces 37% of all human-induced methane. A 2013 study estimated that livestock accounted for 44% of human-induced methane and ~15% of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. Many efforts are underway to reduce livestock methane production, such as medical treatments and dietary adjustments, and to trap the gas to use as energy.  Seafloor sediments  Most of the subseafloor is anoxic because oxygen is removed by aerobic microorganisms within the first few centimeters of the sediment. Below the oxygen replete seafloor, methanogens produce methane that is either used by other organisms or becomes trapped in gas hydrates. These other organisms which utilize methane for energy are known as methanotrophs (methane-eating), and are the main reason why little methane generated at depth reaches the sea surface. Consortia of Archaea and Bacteria have been found to oxidize methane via Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane (AOM); the organisms responsible for this are Anaerobic Methanotrophic Archaea (ANME) and Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria (SRB). =Industrial routes= There is little incentive to produce methane industrially. Methane is produced by hydrogenating carbon dioxide through the Sabatier process. Methane is also a side product of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide in the Fischer‚ÄìTropsch process, which is practiced on a large scale to produce longer-chain molecules than methane. Example of large-scale coal-to-methane gasification is the Great Plains Synfuels plant, started in 1984 in Beulah, North Dakota as a way to develop abundant local resources of low-grade lignite, a resource that is otherwise difficult to transport for its weight, ash content, low calorific value and propensity to spontaneous combustion during storage and transport. Power to methane is a technology that uses electrical power to produce hydrogen from water by electrolysis and uses the Sabatier reaction to combine hydrogen with carbon dioxide to produce methane. As of 2016, this is mostly under development and not in large-scale use. Theoretically, the process could be used as a buffer for excess and off- peak power generated by highly fluctuating wind generators and solar arrays. However, as currently very large amounts of natural gas are used in power plants (e.g. CCGT) to produce electric energy, the losses in efficiency are not acceptable. Laboratory synthesis Methane can be produced by protonation of methyl lithium and methylmagnesium iodide. In practice, a requirement for pure methane will be filled with a steel gas bottle from standard suppliers. Occurrence Methane was discovered and isolated by Alessandro Volta between 1776 and 1778 when studying marsh gas from Lake Maggiore. It is the major component of natural gas, about 87% by volume. The major source of methane is extraction from geological deposits known as natural gas fields, with coal seam gas extraction becoming a major source (see Coal bed methane extraction, a method for extracting methane from a coal deposit, while enhanced coal bed methane recovery is a method of recovering methane from non-mineable coal seams). It is associated with other hydrocarbon fuels, and sometimes accompanied by helium and nitrogen. Methane is produced at shallow levels (low pressure) by anaerobic decay of organic matter and reworked methane from deep under the Earth's surface. In general, the sediments that generate natural gas are buried deeper and at higher temperatures than those that contain oil. Methane is generally transported in bulk by pipeline in its natural gas form, or LNG carriers in its liquefied form; few countries transport it by truck. =Atmospheric methane= Methane concentration evolution from 1987 to September 2020 at Mauna Loa (Hawaii). In 2010, methane levels in the Arctic were measured at 1850 nmol/mol. This level is over twice as high as at any time in the last 400,000 years. Historic methane concentrations in the world's atmosphere have ranged between 300 and 400 nmol/mol during glacial periods commonly known as ice ages, and between 600 and 700 nmol/mol during the warm interglacial periods. The Earth's oceans are a potential important source of Arctic methane. Methane is an important greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 34 compared to CO2 (potential of 1) over a 100-year period, and 72 over a 20-year period.IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, Table 8.7, Chap. 8, p. 8‚Äì58 (PDF; 8,0 MB) The Earth's atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 150% since 1750, and it accounts for 20% of the total radiative forcing from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases (these gases don't include water vapor which is by far the largest component of the greenhouse effect). From 2015 to 2019 sharp rises in levels of atmospheric methane have been recorded. In February 2020, it was reported methane emissions from the fossil fuel industry may have been significantly underestimated.Chelsea Harvey Methane Emissions from Oil and Gas May Be Significantly Underestimated; Estimates of methane coming from natural sources have been too high, shifting the burden to human activities E&E; News via Scientific American February 21, 2020 Climate change can increase atmospheric methane levels by increasing methane production in natural ecosystems, forming a Climate change feedback.Carrington, Damian, First active leak of sea-bed methane discovered in Antarctica, The Guardian, July 21, 2020 =Clathrates= Methane clathrates (also known as methane hydrates) are solid cages of water molecules that trap single molecules of methane. Significant reservoirs of methane clathrates have been found in arctic permafrost and along continental margins beneath the ocean floor within the gas clathrate stability zone, located at high pressures (1 to 100 MPa; lower end requires lower temperature) and low temperatures (< 15 ¬∞C; upper end requires higher pressure). Methane clathrates can form from biogenic methane, thermogenic methane, or a mix of the two. These deposits are both a potential source of methane fuel as well as a potential contributor to global warming.Miller, G. Tyler (2007). Sustaining the Earth: An Integrated Approach. U.S.A.: Thomson Advantage Books, , p. 160. The global mass of carbon stored in gas clathrates is still uncertain and has been estimated as high as 12,500 Gt carbon and as low as 500 Gt carbon. The estimate has declined over time with a most recent estimate of ~1800 Gt carbon. A large part of this uncertainty is due to our knowledge gap in sources and sinks of methane and the distribution of methane clathrates at the global scale. For example, a relatively newly discovered source of methane was discovered in an ultraslow spreading ridge in the Arctic. Some climate models suggest that today's methane emission regime from the ocean floor is potentially similar to that during the period of the Paleocene‚ÄìEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) around 55.5 million years ago, although there are no data indicating that methane from clathrate dissociation currently reaches the atmosphere. Arctic methane release from permafrost and seafloor methane clathrates is a potential consequence and further cause of global warming; this is known as the clathrate gun hypothesis. Data from 2016 indicate that Arctic permafrost thaws faster than predicted. =Extraterrestrial methane=Interstellar medium Methane is abundant in many parts of the Solar system and potentially could be harvested on the surface of another solar-system body (in particular, using methane production from local materials found on Mars or Titan), providing fuel for a return journey. Mars Methane has been detected on all planets of the solar system and most of the larger moons. With the possible exception of Mars, it is believed to have come from abiotic processes. Methane (CH4) on Mars ‚Äì potential sources and sinks. The Curiosity rover has documented seasonal fluctuations of atmospheric methane levels on Mars. These fluctuations peaked at the end of the Martian summer at 0.6 parts per billion. Methane has been proposed as a possible rocket propellant on future Mars missions due in part to the possibility of synthesizing it on the planet by in situ resource utilization. An adaptation of the Sabatier methanation reaction may be used with a mixed catalyst bed and a reverse water-gas shift in a single reactor to produce methane from the raw materials available on Mars, utilizing water from the Martian subsoil and carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere. Methane could be produced by a non-biological process called serpentinization involving water, carbon dioxide, and the mineral olivine, which is known to be common on Mars. History Alessandro Volta In November 1776, methane was first scientifically identified by Italian physicist Alessandro Volta in the marshes of Lake Maggiore straddling Italy and Switzerland. Volta was inspired to search for the substance after reading a paper written by Benjamin Franklin about \\"flammable air\\".Volta, Alessandro (1777) Lettere del Signor Don Alessandro Volta ... Sull' Aria Inflammable Nativa Delle Paludi [Letters of Signor Don Alessandro Volta ... on the flammable native air of the marshes], Milan, Italy: Giuseppe Marelli. Volta collected the gas rising from the marsh, and by 1778 had isolated the pure gas. He also demonstrated that the gas could be ignited with an electric spark. The name \\"methane\\" was coined in 1866 by the German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann.See: *A. W. Hofmann (1866) \\"On the action of trichloride of phosphorus on the salts of the aromatic monoamines,\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, 15 : 55‚Äì 62; see footnote on pp. 57‚Äì58. *James Michael McBride (1999) \\"Development of systematic names for the simple alkanes\\". Available online at Chemistry Department, Yale University (New Haven, Connecticut). The name was derived from methanol. Etymology Etymologically, the word \\"methane\\" is coined from the chemical suffix \\"-ane\\", which denotes substances belonging to the alkane family; and the word \\"methyl\\", which is derived from the German \\"methyl\\" (A.D.1840) or directly from the French \\"m√©thyle\\" which is a back-formation from the French \\"m√©thyl√®ne\\" (corresponding to English \\"methylene\\"), the root of which is coined from the Greek \\"methy\\" (related to English \\"mead\\") and \\"hyle\\" (meaning \\"wood\\"). The radical is named after this because it was first detected in methanol, an alcohol first isolated by distillation of wood. The chemical suffix \\"-ane\\" is from the coordinating chemical suffix \\"-ine\\" which is from Latin feminine suffix \\"-ina\\" which is applied to represent abstracts. The coordination of \\"-ane\\", \\"-ene\\", \\"-one\\", etc. was proposed in 1866 by German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann (1818-1892). =Abbreviations= The abbreviation CH4-C can mean the mass of carbon contained in a mass of methane, and the mass of methane is always 1.33 times the mass of CH4-C. CH4-C can also mean the methane-carbon ratio, which is 1.33 by weight. Methane at scales of the atmosphere is commonly measured in teragrams (Tg CH4) or millions of metric tons (MMT CH4), which mean the same thing. Other standard units are also used, such as nanomole (nmol=one billionth of a mole), mole (mol), kilogram, and gram. Safety Methane is nontoxic, yet it is extremely flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air. Methane is also an asphyxiant if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below about 16% by displacement, as most people can tolerate a reduction from 21% to 16% without ill effects. The concentration of methane at which asphyxiation risk becomes significant is much higher than the 5‚Äì15% concentration in a flammable or explosive mixture. Methane off-gas can penetrate the interiors of buildings near landfills and expose occupants to significant levels of methane. Some buildings have specially engineered recovery systems below their basements to actively capture this gas and vent it away from the building. Methane gas explosions are responsible for many deadly mining disasters. A methane gas explosion was the cause of the Upper Big Branch coal mine disaster in West Virginia on April 5, 2010, killing 29.

The early RPI campus is seen in the foreground. Troy University was a short- lived university established at Troy, New York in 1858 under the auspices of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The school closed in 1861. The building that housed the university remained a prominent Troy landmark until 1969. On the site now is Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Folsom Library. There were initial plans for the founding of a college in Troy in 1853, and the plan for organization was adopted in 1854. The New York State Regents issued a provisional charter on April 13, 1855 to the educational board of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The original plan was for a four-year college course and an additional university course of \\"Lectures upon the higher branches of Science and literature, extending through two years\\". There also were unrealized plans for a school of Theology. A property was bought including most of Mount Ida in Troy, and a large building of Byzantine architecture was erected. The university opened for students on September 9, 1858, and the institution remained opened for about three years. On representations made to the Board of Regents by the President of the Board of Trustees, and by the Acting President of the faculty, the charter of Troy University was made absolute on March 18, 1861. Troy University was considered firmly enough established to allow for the 1859 creation of the Kappa Phi chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon chartered March 2, 1860.Chapter Roll of Delta Kappa Epsilon The administration of the University raised funds by selling scholarships, which were a right to attend in the future based on a current dollar amount. Apparently the inflationary period of the early 1860s destroyed the financial stability of the university.

It is the longest surviving Latin poem from antiquity. Its theme is the Second Punic War and the conflict between the two great generals Hannibal and Scipio Africanus. The poem was re-discovered in either 1416 or 1417 by the Italian humanist and scholar Poggio Bracciolini. A depiction of Hannibal crossing the Alps, a significant scene in the Punica. Composition The dates of the Punica's composition are not entirely clear. There is external evidence for composition dates from some of the epigrams of Martial. Martial 4.14, a poem dated to 88 AD, describes Silius' work on the Punica, mentioning Scipio and Hannibal as the subjects of the poem. 7.63, dated to 92 AD also describes his work on the poem. Two passages of internal evidence also help date the Punica. At 3.600ff. during Jupiter's prophecy about the future of Rome, describes significant events from the Flavian dynasty and the life of Domitian, such as the death of Vespasian, Titus' destruction of Jerusalem, Domitian's adoption of the title Germanicus (83 AD), and the burning of the Capitoline temple in 69 AD. Thus the passage puts a terminus post quem for Book 3 at 83 AD. At 14.685-88, the mention of a contemporary vir who has brought peace to the world and put a stop to illegal theft has been interpreted as referring to the accession of Nerva in 96 AD,E. Wistrand, Die Chronologie der Punica des Silius Italicus Goeteborg, 1956. although this reference to Nerva has been disputed.W. MacDermott and A. Orentzel \\"Silius and Domitian\\" in AJPh 1977 pp. 24-34 Thus, composition dates for the poem must be set at c. 83 to c. 96 AD, although since those dates do not include the first two or final three books, they must remain approximate. The poem is a work of Silius' old age, and thus his time spent at his Campanian villas collecting antiques and giving recitations, presumably of the Punica.Pliny 3.7 According to the epigrams of Martial cited above, the poem met with some success and was compared with the Aeneid. Poetic models and historical sources A 3rd century AD depiction of Virgil on a mosaic from Hadrumetum. Virgil was Silius' most important model, and he was personally devoted to Virgil. Silius, as a poet of historical epic, had to make use of both historical sources and poetic models. Livy is considered his single most important historical source; however, Silius differs his work from Livy's by often embellishing themes which are only briefly treated in Livy and altering the focus of his narrative.Steele, R. B. \\"The Method of Silius Italicus\\", Classical Philology Vol. 17, No. 4 (Oct. 1922), pp. 319-333 It is known that Silius also used other historians as sources.von Albrecht, M. \\"Roman Epic: an interpretive guide\\" p. 293. Silius should not be viewed as a simple transmitter of his historical sources, as \\"Livy in verse\\",von Albrecht, p. 293. but should be viewed as a poet who, while making use of historians, is not bound by the rules of historiography but rather of poetry. In choosing a historical subject, the Second Punic War, Silius had many poetic predecessors. From the time of Naevius onwards every great military struggle in which the Romans had been engaged had found its poet. Naevius' influence cannot be gauged because of the almost total loss of his poem on the First Punic War. Silius specifically names Virgil, Homer, and Ennius as his epic inspiration. Homer is mentioned at 13.778-797, where Silius has Scipio meet his shade in the underworld. Silius' sybil praises Homer as the preeminent, universal, and divine poet who made Troy, (i.e. Rome) famous in song, saying \\"his [Homer's] poetry embraced the earth, sea, stars, and shades and he rivaled the Muses in song and Phoebus in glory,\\" to which Scipio replies, \\"If Fate would allow this poet to sing of Roman deeds, for all the world to hear, how much deeper an impression the same deeds would make upon posterity if Homer sang of them.\\" Ennius is a character in Book 12 of the Punica (12.387-414), where he participates in a battle in Sardinia. Silius says that his account of Ennius' fight is his attempt to \\"hand down to long ages noble deeds, too little known, of a great man.\\" He describes Ennius' birth, his prowess in war, and has Apollo prophesy his future, saying \\"he [Ennius] shall be the first to sing of Roman wars in noble verse, exalting their commanders to the skies; he shall teach Helicon\\"Helicon\\" refers to Mount Helicon, in Greek mythology the traditional home of the Muses. to repeat the sound of Roman poetry...\\" Virgil is mentioned at 8.593-594, where Silius says of Virgil's hometown Mantua that it was \\"home of the Muses, raised to the sky by immortal verse, and a match for the lyre of Homer.\\" Indeed, Virgil is considered Silius' most pervasive influence. His contemporaries Pliny and Martial discuss his almost crazed devotion to the spirit of Virgil (whom Silius is known to have worshipped as a god and whose tomb he bought and repaired) and often compare his poetry to the works of Virgil.Martial 7.63 Silius employs constantly Virgilian images, similes, tropes, and elements (such as his nekyia or the historically-themed shield of Hannibal) in the Punica,M. von Albrecht, A History of Latin Literature vol. 2, p. 962 for a list of some Virgilian references. and hardly a page goes by without some significant allusion to the Aeneid. Finally, Lucan is a significant model for Silius, although Silius differs dramatically from Lucan's historical epic by his use of the divine machinery. Frederick Ahl posits that Silius construed his epic as occupying the historical and poetic midpoint between the Aeneid and the Bellum Civile, forming a trilogy of poems on Roman history.Ahl, F. \\"Silius Italicus\\" ANRW p. 2501. Silius is closest to Lucan in his treatment of historical description, especially geography and battlefields, his focus on the macabre and violence, and his stoic tone.von Albrecht, History, p. 984. Contents Book 1 The poem opens with phrase ordior arma \\"I set in order the arms\\" and tells how the poet's theme is the Second Punic War, setting up the conflict as the struggle between the Roman and Carthaginian nations for supremacy. The betrayal of Dido, familiar from the Aeneid and Juno's anger stir the goddess to prophesy the course of the war and choose Hannibal as her instrument of revenge. The childhood oath of Hannibal to his father Hamilcar at the Dido temple in Carthage is narrated, and his character is described as vicious, cunning, and daring. The priestess of the temple prophesies the war. Hasdrubal is slaughtered by Spanish Gauls in revenge for his crucifixion of their king. Hannibal succeeds him by the army's acclaim and attacks Saguntum the situation and Rutulian/Zacynthian history of which are described. The siege begins and Hannibal fights a duel with the Saguntine champion Murrus, who is slain. The Saguntine senate meets and requests that Rome send envoys to stop the siege. Book 2 In Book 2, Hannibal dismisses the Roman envoys from Saguntum and addresses his troops with a threat to Rome. The siege of the city continues and the warrior princess Asbyte is killed by Theron, who is killed by Hannibal and mutilated. At Carthage, Hanno gives a speech calling Hannibal insolent, while Gestar gives a response that suggests Hanno is a Roman sympathizer. While campaigning against Spanish tribes, Hannibal receives a shield as a gift from the Gallaeci that shows Carthaginian history up to the siege of Saguntum. The Saguntines begin to suffer, and a saddened Hercules sends Fides to strengthen and ennoble the Saguntines. Juno sends Tisiphone, who whips the people into a madness that causes them to burn themselves alive. The poet addresses the Saguntines and ensures their immortality. Book 3 Bostar is sent to consult Jupiter Ammon about the war. Hannibal visits the shrine of Hercules at Gades, where he admires the doors painted with the god's deeds and the unusual tides of the Atlantic Ocean. He tearfully sends his wife, the brave Imilce, back to Carthage, despite her wish to remain in the camp. Jupiter sends a dream to Hannibal in which he is led by Mercury into Italy with a destructive snake which symbolizes Hannibal. The poet offers a catalogue of Carthaginian troops. As Hannibal crosses the Pyrenees, their Herculean aetiology is explained. Hannibal crosses the Alps amid hardship while Venus asks Jupiter whether he plans on destroying Rome. Jupiter says his plan is to test Roman virtus and set the foundations of the Roman empire. He describes the future of Rome, which culminates in the reign of Domitian and a praise of the emperor's poetry. The response from Jupiter Ammon promises glory to Carthage. Book 4 Fama incites fear and preparation in the Romans who ready themselves for Hannibal and his vengeance-seeking Gallic troops. Scipio encourages his troops and leads them to the Ticinus river where a bird omen promises that the Carthaginians can rout the Romans for 8 years, but will be overcome eventually by Rome. The Gauls and their hero Crixus stand out in the Battle of Ticinus. Jupiter calls Mars to help the young Scipio after his father is killed, and he withdraws the troops to the river Trebia, where there is a large battle in which the Carthaginians prevail and the river attacks Scipio until it is burned up by Vulcan. Juno appears as the god of Lake Trasimene and tells Hannibal to march there. Hannibal refuses to allow his son to be sacrificed by lot to the gods and asks him ever to be an enemy of Rome. Book 5 The history and mythical aetiology of Lake Trasimene is presented. Hannibal lays a trap for the Romans in a ravine while an enraged Flamininus goes on a rant against augury and refuses to heed the terrible sacrificial omens. The poet shudders to describe the battle from which the gods turn their faces away in obedience to fate except for a gleeful Juno. Bellona stirs the Carthaginian lines, while Appius distinguishes himself before dying. Mago is wounded but healed by the snake charmer/physician Synhalus. The Carthaginian hero Sychaeus is slain. The Romans seek refuge in the trees where they are slaughtered and there is an earthquake. Ducarius slays Flamininus who is buried by a heap of Roman dead. Book 6 The book opens with a description of Bruttius' burial of the legionary eagle to save it from Hannibal. Serranus, a son of Marcus Atilius Regulus, escapes the battle and comes to the humble house of Marus at Perusia. There he is treated by Marus, who tells him the story of Regulus' battle with the Libyan snake at the river Bagradas (Medjerda) which leads the Naiads to demand suffering from Regulus in the future. Marus then tells Serranus about the Spartan Xanthippus in the First Punic War and the use of Regulus as an envoy for Carthage. Marcia, Serranus' mother, asks Regulus not to return, but he, respecting his oath, leaves her and is tortured to death by the Carthaginians. A bloodied Fama reports the battle at Rome, after which Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus Cunctator, whose family history is described, is elected consul. Hannibal sees at Liternum temple doors portraying scenes from the First Punic War; in a rage he orders the temple burnt. Book 7 Book 7 opens with an exploration of Fabius' tactics of delay. Hannibal learns from a prisoner the family history of the Fabii and then attempts to incite Fabius to battle as he ravages Campania and the Falernian countryside. The poet, as he says, cannot resist telling the story of Falernus' theoxenia of Bacchus and the gods gift of wine. Hannibal, by sparing Fabius' lands tries to make the dictator suspect but becomes trapped in a defile. By setting a herd of cattle on fire, a diversion is created so the Carthaginians can escape. Fabius called to Rome hands over command to the magister equitum Marcus Minucius Rufus. The Carthaginians land at Cumae, where they frighten the Nereids who go to Phorcys for prophecy. Phorkys tells the story of the Judgment of Paris and the reason for the war. Minucius, given equal powers with Fabius, attacks the Carthaginians and is barely saved by Fabius' force; the armies are reunited at the conclusion. Book 8 Juno sends the spirit of Anna, the sister of Dido and now the nymph of the river Numicius, to Hannibal who is upset about his forced retreat. Anna tells Juno of Dido's suicide, her flight to Cyrene after Iarbas' invasion, her escape to Italy and Aeneas from Pygmalion's fleet, and her transformation into a river from fear of Lavinia, then hastens to Hannibal and encourages him by prophesying the Battle of Cannae. Varro is elected consul and gives a haughty speech criticizing Fabius, his colleague, Paulus, reluctantly decides to go to battle. There is a catalogue of Italian soldiers and allies. The book ends with an account of bad omens and an anonymous soldier's grim prophecy. Book 9 Varro and Paulus argue about tactics, and a son, Satricus, accidentally kills his father, Sulmo, in a night skirmish, an omen of disaster for the Romans at the Battle of Cannae. After addressing their troops, Hannibal and Varro array their soldiers at Cannae. Scipio and Scaevola have their aristeiai, but Mars stirs up a storm that beats the Romans back as the other gods retire from battle. The Romans fight Hannibal's elephants, but Varro and Paulus, after discussing the crisis, are forced from the battlefield. Book 10 Paulus tries to rally the troops after Juno speaks to him in the guise of Metellus. Juno rouses Hannibal to kill Paulus to give him a glorious death; as he dies, Paulus prophesies the future of the war and sends Lentulus to support Fabius' strategy. Hannibal plans to march on Rome, but Juno sends Sleep and he dreams about Jupiter protecting Rome, so he rejects Mago's plan to march on the city. The Romans gather at Canusium and Metellus proposes to abandon Italy and escape Hannibal; Scipio takes an oath that he will allow no one to leave Italy. The horse of Cloelius attends his dead master and Cinna tells the story of Cloelia. Hannibal buries Paulus and his soldiers as an offering to the gods, while Rumor travels to Rome. Fabius creates a plan of action. Book 11 A catalogue of the Italians who join Hannibal, followed by a description of Capua. Pacuvius persuades the citizens to ask Rome if one of the consuls can be a Campanian, which is refused. Capua joins Hannibal, but Decius opposes the alliance, defying Hannibal's order that he be arrested. Hannibal speaks to Decius who accuses him of tyranny as he is arrested. The Carthaginians feast and Teuthras sings a theogonic poem. Perolla, Pacuvius' son tries to assassinate Hannibal but Pacuvius stops him. Venus sends a mob of Cupids to shoot the Carthaginians and make them lose their discipline, aided by Teuthras' song on Amphion and Orpheus. Mago reports at Carthage on Cannae, but is attacked by Hanno. Book 12 The Carthaginians, weakened by Venus, cannot take Greek cities in southern Italy. Campanian nobles tell Hannibal about famous landmarks. The Battle of Nola, in which Pedianus kills Cinyps recovering Paulus' armor, and Hannibal is defeated. The Romans revive their hopes with an oracle from Delphi that promises their victory. On Sicily, the epic poet Ennius fights and kills Hostus. Hannibal takes the lower city of Tarentum and returns to Capua and advances on Rome where Fulvius leads out the troops and Jupiter creates a storm and defends the city from him. Hannibal attacks again, but Jupiter sends Juno to stop him. After he leaves, the Romans run to view his deserted campsite. Book 13 Hannibal criticizes his troops for failing to take Rome, but Dasius responds with a story about the palladium and how Diomedes gave it to Aeneas when he was founding Livinium, so a dejected Hannibal sacks the temple of Feronia. Fulvius attacks Capua and wolves kill the deer of Capys, which portends the city's fall. The Capuans resist and the goddess Fides praises loyalty. Virrius burns himself alive and the Capuans admit the Romans; Pan saves the city from burning but Taurea kills himself in defiance of the Romans. Scipio learns that his father and uncle have died in battle which spurs him visit the Underworld. He goes to Cumae where the priestess raises Appius Claudius, who asks for burial (an account of funeral customs follows). The Sibyl's ghost prophesies Scipio's success and discusses the ten gates of the underworld, each associated with a type of death, the ghosts of the wicked and allegories, the tree of evil birds, and the palace of judgment. Scipio speaks to Pomponia, his mother, who tells him that his real father is Jupiter. His father tells him about virtue and warns him about Carthaginians. His uncle describes his own death. Paulus calls for vengeance and hears about his burial. He speaks to Hannibal's father who praises his son. In the throng, Scipio speaks to Alexander who advises him to virtue and swift action. Scipio then meets Homer and asks for a poet of his deeds to match Homer; he then views the Greek heroes and comes to a catalog of Roman women. He sees the souls of Sulla, Marius, and Pompey preparing to ascend and then learns from the Sibyl of Hannibal's fate. Book 14 This book begins with a new invocation and a long description of Sicily's history and the Syracusan monarchy. Marcellus begins his campaign and Silius adds a catalog of Sicilian allies and cities. Archimedes attacks the Romans with his machines and is praised as he burns the Romans' ships with his mirrors. There is an elaborate sea battle, but Silius describes an outbreak of plague that causes the city to fall. Marcellus looks over the riches of Syracuse, decides to spare the city, and is praised for his clementia. Book 15 The Senate debates whom to send to Spain. Scipio is eager to go and is visited by Virtue and Pleasure who contend for his allegiance. Persuaded by Virtue he asks for and receives command of the army. After receiving good omens, his fleet lands at Tarraco and in a dream his father's ghost encourages him to take New Carthage, which he does. He sacrifices to the gods and distributes the spoils to his soldiers. Silius relates the war against Philip of Macedon and how Fabius captures Tarentum. Then the Romans receive news that the consuls Marcellus and Crispinus were killed in battle against Hannibal. However, Scipio manages to rout Hasdrubal in Spain. Hasdrubal then crosses the Alps to join his brother in Italy. The personification of Italy warns the consul Claudius Nero in a dream of Hasdrubal's invasion. He joins the other consul Livius and they defeat Hasdrubal at the battle of the Metaurus. Claudius Nero returns and displays to Hannibal his brother's dead on a spike. Book 16 While Hannibal travels around southern Italy, the Carthaginians are driven out of Spain by Scipio and flee to Carthage. Scipio takes Hanno captive and the army of Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, is destroyed. Scipio travels to Africa and Masinissa, a Numidian prince, joins the Roman side. Scipio makes a treaty with Syphax, a Numidian king, but it is accompanied by evil omens. Scipio returns to Spain and holds funeral games in honor of his father and uncle. Scipio returns to Rome and is elected consul. Despite Fabius' opposition, he receives permission to cross to Africa and attack Carthage. Book 17 The image of Cybele is brought from Phrygia to Rome and received in Ostia. Meanwhile, Scipio crosses to Africa and takes Syphax prisoner for breaking his oath to support the Romans. Hasdrubal retreats to Carthage and Hannibal is recalled from Italy. Hannibal's sleep is disturbed by nightmares before receiving the summons to return to Carthage. His departure is delayed by a storm but he lands in Africa and encourages his soldiers despite their retreat from Italy. In the heavens, Juno and Jupiter discuss the fates of Carthage and Hannibal. Juno agrees that she cannot change fate but asks Jupiter to spare Hannibal's life and to let Carthage stay standing. Jupiter agrees but warns that soon another Scipio will come who will destroy Carthage. The Carthaginian and Roman armies then join battle at Zama. The battle rages with Hannibal and Scipio both killing many soldiers. As Scipio searches for Hannibal, Juno fashions a phantom Scipio which she tricks Hannibal into chasing so that he might not face Scipio in battle and die. Hannibal chases the phantom and his horse falls down and dies. Juno, disguised as a shepherd, says she will guide him back to the battle but deceives him again. The Carthaginian army, deprived of their leader, falls apart and Hannibal returns just in time to see his army routed. He flees ignominiously to the mountains with some of his soldiers. Scipio returns to Rome victorious and celebrates a triumph through the city with a long train of captives including Syphax and Hanno along with images of the places he conquered. As Scipio, in purple and gold, rides through Rome in a chariot, Silius compares him to Hercules and declares that it is no lie that he is the son of Jupiter. Editions The Punica was rediscovered by Poggio Bracciolini c.14161417. The poem was discovered in a manuscript, possibly at Constance, by Poggio Bracciolini, in 1416 or 1417; from this now lost manuscript all existing manuscripts, which belong entirely to the 15th century, are derived. A valuable manuscript of the 8th or 9th century, found at Cologne by L. Carrion in the latter part of the 16th century, disappeared soon after its discovery. Two editiones principes appeared at Rome in 1471; the principal editions since have been those of Heinsius (1600), Drakenborch (1717), Ernesti (Leipzig, 1791) and L. Bauer (1890). The Punica is included in the second edition of the Corpus poetarum Latinorum. A useful variorum edition is that of Lema√Ætre (Paris, 1823). Delz's 1987 edition of the Punica is the current standard text. In 1934 the Punica was edited, translated, and published in Loeb Classical Editions. Commentaries Peter Marso (1442‚Äì1512) published a commentary on the Punica in 1483. More recent commentaries include Neil Bernstein's commentary on book 2, Joy Littlewood's commentaries on books 7 and 10, and Michiel van der Keur's commentary on book 13. Monographs Studies of the Punica have flourished with many new monographs published about the poem, for example by Antony Augoustakis,Augoustakis, Antony. 2010.

The Nabataean Kingdom controlled much of the trade routes of the region, amassing large wealth and drawing the envy of its neighbors. It stretched south along the Red Sea coast into the Hejaz, up as far north as Damascus, which it controlled for a short period (85‚Äì71 BC). Nabataea remained independent from the 4th century BC until it was annexed in AD 106 by the Roman Empire, which renamed it Arabia Petraea. History=Nabataeans= The Nabataeans were one among several nomadic Bedouin tribes that roamed the Arabian Desert and moved with their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water. They became familiar with their area as seasons passed, and they struggled to survive during bad years when seasonal rainfall diminished. Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in Aramaic culture, theories about them having Aramean roots are rejected by modern scholars. Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern Arabian tribe. The precise origin of the specific tribe of Arab nomads remains uncertain. One hypothesis locates their original homeland in today's Yemen, in the southwest of the Arabian peninsula, but their deities, language and script share nothing with those of southern Arabia. Another hypothesis argues that they came from the eastern coast of the peninsula. The suggestion that they came from the Hejaz area is considered to be more convincing, as they share many deities with the ancient people there; nbtw, the root consonant of the tribe's name, is found in the early Semitic languages of Hejaz. Similarities between late Nabataean Arabic dialect and the ones found in Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian period, as well as a group with the name of \\"Nabatu\\" being listed by the Assyrians as one of several rebellious Arab tribes in the region, suggests a connection between the two. The Nabataeans might have originated from there and migrated west between the 6th and 4th centuries BC into northwestern Arabia and much of what is now modern-day Jordan. Nabataeans have been falsely associated with other groups of people. A people called the \\"Nabaiti\\", who were defeated by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal, were associated by some with the Nabataeans because of the temptation to link their similar names. Another misconception is their identification with the Nebaioth of the Hebrew Bible, the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son. Unlike the rest of the Arabian tribes, the Nabataeans later emerged as vital players in the region during their times of prosperity. However, their influence then faded, and the Nabataeans were forgotten. =Emergence= Trading routes of the ancient 241x241px The literate Nabataeans left no lengthy historical texts. However, thousands of inscriptions have been found in their settlements, including graffiti and on minted coins. The Nabataeans appear in historical records from the fourth century BC, although there seems to be evidence of their existence before that time. Aramaic ostraca finds indicate that the Achaemenid province Idumaea must have been established before 363 B.C. after the failed revolt of Hakor of Egypt and Evagoras I of Salamis against the Persians. The Qedarites joined the failed revolt, and consequently lost significant territory and their privileged position in the frankincense trade, and were presumably replaced by the Nabataeans. It has been argued that the Persians lost interest in the former territory of the Edomite Kingdom after 400 BC, allowing the Nabataeans to gain prominence in that area. All of these changes would have allowed Nabataeans to control the frankincense trade from Dedan to Gaza. The first historical reference to the Nabataeans is by Greek historian Diodorus Siculus who lived around 30 BC. Diodorus refers accounts made 300 years earlier by Hieronymus of Cardia, one of Alexander the Great's generals, who had a first- hand encounter with the Nabataeans. Diodorus relates how the Nabataeans survived in a waterless desert and managed to defeat their enemies by hiding in the desert until the latter surrendered for lack of water. The Nabataeans dug cisterns that were covered and marked by signs known only to themselves. Diodorus wrote about how they were \\"exceptionally fond of freedom\\" and includes an account about unsuccessful raids that were initiated by Greek general Antigonus I in 312 BC. Nabataean tomb, Qasr al-Farid, located at Mada'in Saleh, Hejaz, Saudi Arabia After Alexander the Great's death in 323 BC, his empire split among his generals. During the conflict between Alexander's generals, Antigonus I conquered the Levant, and this brought him to the borders of Edom, just north of Petra. According to Diodorus Siculus, Antigonus sought to add \\"the land of the Arabs who are called Nabataeans\\" to his existing territories of Syria and Phoenicia. The Nabataeans were distinguished from the other Arab tribes by wealth. The Nabataeans generated revenues from the trade caravans that transported frankincense, myrrh and other spices from Eudaemon in today's Yemen, across the Arabian peninsula, passing through Petra and ending up in the Port of Gaza for shipment to European markets. Antigonus ordered one of his officers, Athenaeus, to raid the Nabataeans with 4000 infantry and 600 cavalry, and loot herds and processions. Athenaeus learned that, every year, the Nabataeans gathered for a festival, during which women, children, and elders were left at \\"a certain rock\\" (later interpreted by some as the future city of \\"Petra\\", \\"rock\\" in Greek.)Diodorus Siculus, Book XIX, 95-100, Loeb Classical Library edition, 1954, accessed 27 December 2019 The Antigonids attacked \\"the rock\\" in 312 BC while the Nabataeans were away trading; the inhabitants were taken by surprise and tonnes of spices and silver were looted. The Antigonids departed before nightfall and made camp to rest 200 stadion away, where they thought they would be safe from Nabataean counter-attack. The camp was attacked by 8000 pursuing Nabataean soldiers and - as Diodorus describes it - \\"all the 4000 foot-soldiers were slain, but of the 600 horsemen about fifty escaped, and of these the larger part were wounded\\"; Athenaeus himself was killed. The Antigonids had deployed no scouts, a failure that Diodorus ascribes to Athenaeus's failure to anticipate the rapidity of the Nabataean response. After the Nabataeans returned to their rock, they wrote a letter to Antigonus accusing Athenaeus and declaring that they had destroyed the Antigonid army in self-defence. Antigonus replied by blaming Athenaeus for acting unilaterally, intending to lull the Nabataeans into a false sense of security. But the Nabataeans, though pleased with Antigonus response, remained suspicious and established outposts on the edge of the mountains in preparation for future Antigonid attacks. Marble bust of Demetrius I Poliorcetes. Roman copy from 1st century AD of a Greek original from 3rd century BC. The Antigonids' second attack was with an army of 4000 infantry and 4000 cavalry led by Antigonus's son, Demetrius \\"the Besieger\\". The Nabataean scouts spotted the marching enemy and used smoke signals to warn of the approaching Antigonid army. The Nabataeans dispersed their herds and possessions to guarded locations in harsh terrain - such as deserts and mountain tops - which would be difficult for the Antigonids to attack, and garrisoned \\"the rock\\" to defend what remained. The Antigonids attacked \\"the rock\\" through its \\"single artificial approach\\", but the Nabataeans managed to repulse the invading force. A Nabataean called out to Demetrius pointing out that Antigonid aggression made no sense, for the land was semi-barren and the Nabataeans had no desire to be their slaves. Realizing his limited supplies and the determination of the Nabataean fighters, Demetrius eventually was forced to accept peace, and withdraw with hostages and gifts. Demetrius drew Antigonus's displeasure for the peace, but this was ameliorated by Demetrius's reports of bitumen deposits in the Dead Sea, a valuable commodity that was essential for the embalming process. Antigonus sent an expedition, this time under Hieronymus of Cardia, to extract bitumen from the Dead Sea. A force of 6000 Arabs sailing on reed rafts approached Hieronymus's troops and killed them with arrows. These Arabs were almost certainly Nabataeans. Antigonus thus lost all hope of generating revenue in that manner. The event is described as the first conflict caused by a Middle Eastern petroleum product. The series of wars among the Greek generals ended in a dispute over the lands of modern-day Jordan between the Ptolemies based in Egypt and the Seleucids based in Syria. The conflict enabled the Nabataeans to extend their kingdom beyond Edom. Diodorus mentions that the Nabataeans had attacked merchant ships belonging to the Ptolemies in Egypt at unspecified date, but were soon targeted by a larger force and \\"punished as they deserved\\". While it is unknown why the wealthy Nabataeans turned to piracy, one possible reason is that they felt that their trade interests were threatened by the understanding of the nature of monsoon in the Red Sea from the third century BC. =Creation of the Nabataean Kingdom= Al- Khazneh carved into rock by the Nabataeans in their capital, Petra. The Nabataean Arabs did not emerge as a political power suddenly; their rise instead went through two phases. The first phase was in the 4th century BC (ruled then by an elders' council), which was marked by the growth of Nabataean control over trade routes and various tribes and towns. Their presence in Transjordan by the end of the fourth century BC is guaranteed by Antigonus's operations in the region, and despite recent suggestions that there is no evidence of Nabataean occupation of the Hauran in the early period, the Zenon papyri firmly attest the penetration of the Hauran by the Nabataeans in the mid-third century BC beyond all doubt, and according to Bowersock, it \\"establish[es] these Arabs in one of the principal areas of subsequent splendor\\". Simultaneously, the Nabataeans had probably moved across the 'Araba to the west into the desert tracts of the Negev. In their early history, before establishing urban centers, the Nabataeans demonstrated on several occasions their impressive and well organized military prowess by successfully defending their territory against larger powers. The second phase saw the creation of the Nabataean political state in the mid-3rd century BC. Kingship is regarded as a characteristic of a state and urban society. The Nabataean institution of kingship came about as a result of multiple factors, such as the indispensabilities of trade organization and war; the subsequent outcomes of the Greek expeditions on the Nabataeans played a role in the political centralization of the Nabatu tribe. The earliest evidence of Nabataean kingship comes from a Nabataean inscription in the Hauran region, probably Bosra, which mentions a Nabataean king whose name was lost, dated by Stracky to the early third century BC. The dating is significant, since the available evidence does not attest the existence of Nabataean monarchy until the second century BC. This nameless Nabataean king perhaps could be linked with a reference from the Zenon archive (the second historical mention of the Nabataeans) to deliveries of grain to \\"Rabbel's men\\", Rabbel being a characteristically royal Nabataean name, it is thus possible to link Rabbel of the Zenon archive with the nameless king of Bosra's inscription, though it is highly speculative. A recent papyrological discovery, the Milan Papyrus, provides further evidence. The relevant part of the Lithika section of the papyrus describes an Arabian cavalry of a certain Nabataean king, providing an early 3rd century BC reference to a Nabataean monarch. The word Nabataean stands alone beside a missing word that start with the letter M; one of the suggested words for filling the gap is the traditional name of Nabataean kings, Malichus. Furthermore, the anonymous Nabataean coins dated by Barkay to the second half of the 3rd century BC, found mainly in Nabataean territory, support such an early date of the Nabataean Kingdom. This is in line with Strabo's account (whose description of Arabia derives ultimately from reports by 3rd century BC Ptolemaic officials) that the Nabataean kingship was old and traditional. In conclusion, Rachel Barkay states that \\"the Nabataean economy and political regime were in existence by the third century BC\\". The Kingship of the Nabataeans, was in the view of Strabo, an effective one, where the Nabataean kingdom was \\"very well governed\\" and the king was \\"a man of the people\\". For more than four centuries the Nabataean kingdom dominated, politically and commercially, a large territory and was arguably the first Arab kingdom in the area. The testimony of the 4th and 3rd century external accounts and local materialistic evidence demonstrate that the Nabataeans played a relatively substantial political and economic role in the sphere of the early Hellenistic world. While the Nabataeans didn't attain observable characteristics of a Hellenistic state (i.e. monumental architecture) in their early period, similar to contemporary Seleucid Syria, the Milan papyrus speaks of their wealth and prestige in this period. In that respect, the Nabataeans must be considered a unique entity. Coin showing Aretas IV in military dress Statue of soldier in Petra Aretas I, mentioned in II Macc as \\"the tyrant of the Arabs\\" (169-168 BC), is regarded as the first explicitly named king of the Nabataeans. His first appearance in history is in the II Macc, where the high- priest Jason, driven by his rival Menelaus, sought the protection of Aretas. Upon his arrival at the land of the Nabataeans, Aretas imprisoned Jason. It is not clear why or when that happened; his arrest by Aretas was either after he escaped Jerusalem, where Aretas, fearing the retaliation of Antiochus IV Epiphanes for \\"openly demonstrating pro-Ptolemaic stand\\" (in Hammond's view however, Aretas hoped to use Jason as a political bargaining counter with the Seleucids), arrested Jason. Or his imprisonment might have happened at a later date (167 BC), as a result of the established friendship between the Nabataeans and Judas Maccabaeus, aimed to hand Jason to the Jews. \\"Either suggestion is feasible and so the riddle remains unresolved\\", according to Kasher. A Nabataean inscription in the Negev, mentions a Nabataean king called Aretas, the date given by Starcky is not later than 150 BC. However, the dating is difficult. It has been claimed that the inscription dates to the 3rd century BC, based on the pre-Nabataean writing style, or somewhere in the 2nd century BC. Generally, the inscription is attributed to Aretas I of II Macc, or perhaps as suggested by others, to Aretas II. Around the same time, the Arab Nabataeans and the neighboring Jewish Maccabees had maintained a friendly relationship, the former had sympathized with the Maccabees, who were being mistreated by the Seleucids. The Romano-Jewish historian Josephus report that Judas Maccabeus and his brother Jonathan marched three days into the wilderness before encountering the Nabataeans in the Hauran, where they were settled in for at least a century. The Nabataeans treated them peacefully and told them of what happened to the Jews residing in the land of Galaad. This peaceful meeting between the Nabataeans and two brothers in the first book of Maccabees seems to contradict a parallel account from the second book where a pastoral Arab tribe launched a surprise attack on the two brothers. Despite open contradiction between the two accounts, scholars tend to identify the plundering Arab tribe of the second book with the Nabataeans in the first book. They were evidently not Nabataeans, for good relations between the Maccabees and their \\"friends\\", the Nabataeans, continued to exist. The friendly relations between them is further emphasized by Jonathan decision to send his brother John to \\"lodge his baggage\\" with the Nabataeans until the battle with the Seleucids is over. Again, the Maccabean caravan suffered an attack by a murderer Arab tribe in the vicinity of Madaba. This tribe was clearly not Nabataean, for they were identified as the sons of Amrai. In Bowersock view, the interpretation of the evidence in the books of Maccabees \\"illustrates the danger of assuming that any reference to Arabs in areas known to have been settled by the Nabataeans must automatically refer to them\\". But the picture is different, many Arab tribes in the region continued to be nomadic and moved in and out of the emerging Nabataean kingdom, and the Nabataeans, as well as invading armies and eventually the Romans also, had to cope with these people. The Nabataeans began to mint coins during the second century BC, revealing the extensive economic and political independence they enjoyed. Petra was included in a list of major cities in the Mediterranean area to be visited by a notable from Priene, a sign of the significance of Nabataea in the ancient world. Petra was included with Alexandria, which was considered to be a supreme city in the civilized world. =Nabataeans and Hasmoneans= Remains of Byzantine church at 279x279px The Nabataeans were allies of the Maccabees during their struggles against the Seleucid monarchs. They then became rivals of their successors, the Judaean Hasmonean dynasty, and a chief element in the disorders which invited Pompey's intervention in Judea. The Port of Gaza was the last stop for spices that were carried by trade caravans before shipment to European markets, giving the Nabataeans considerable influence over the Gazans. The Hasmonean King Alexander Jannaeus, besieged the city of Gaza around 100 BC, on the grounds that the Gazans had favoured the Ptolemies over the Judaeans in their recent battles. Gaza was occupied and its inhabitants put to the sword by Jannaeus. The Hasmoneans, under Jannaeus, launched a campaign that captured several territories in Transjordan north of Nabataea, along the road to Damascus, including northern Moab and Gilead. The territorial acquisitions threatened Nabataean trade interests, both to Gaza and to the Seleucids in Damascus. The Nabataean King, Obodas I fought to restore the areas. Obodas managed to defeat Jannaeus in the Battle of Gadara around 93 BC, when he ambushed him and his forces in a steep valley where Jannaeus \\"was lucky to escape alive\\". After the Nabataean victory over the Judaeans, the former were now at odds with the Seleucids, who were not impressed with the increasing influence of the Nabataeans to the south of their territories. The Nabataeans were again victorious over the Greeks, and this time over the Seleucids. During the Battle of Cana, the Seleucid king Antiochus XII waged war against the Nabataeans; the king himself was slain during combat. His demoralized army fled and perished in the desert from starvation. After Obodas's victories over the Judaeans and the Greeks, he became the first Nabataean king to be worshipped as a god by his people. Aretas III on a Roman coin, depicted in a pose of submission Avdat was a temple built in the Negev desert by the Nabataeans to commemorate Obodas. He was buried there and inscriptions have been found referring to \\"Obodas the god\\". During the reign of Aretas III (87 to 62 BC) the kingdom seems to have reached its territorial zenith; it was defeated by a Roman army under the command of Marcus Aemilius Scaurus. Scaurus's army even besieged Petra; eventually a compromise was negotiated. Paying a tribute, Aretas III received formal recognition by the Roman Republic. Taylor, Jane; Petra; p.25-31; Aurum Press Ltd; London; 2005; The Nabataean kingdom saw itself slowly surrounded by the expanding Roman Empire, which conquered Egypt and annexed Hasmonean Judea. While the Nabataean kingdom managed to preserve its formal independence, it became a client kingdom under the influence of Rome. =Roman annexation= A map of the Roman Empire, at its greatest extent, showing the territory of Trajan's Nabataean conquests in red In 106 AD, during the reign of Roman emperor Trajan, the last king of the Nabataean kingdom Rabbel II Soter died. That might have prompted the official annexation of Nabatea to the Roman Empire, but the formal reasons and the exact manner of annexation are unknown. Some epigraphic evidence suggests a military campaign, commanded by Cornelius Palma, the governor of Syria. Roman forces seem to have come from Syria and also from Egypt. It is clear that by 107 AD Roman legions were stationed in the area around Petra and Bosra, as is shown by a papyrus found in Egypt. The kingdom was annexed by the empire to become the province of Arabia Petraea. Trade seems to have largely continued thanks to the Nabataeans' undiminished talent for trading. Under Hadrian, the limes Arabicus ignored most of the Nabat√¶an territory and ran northeast from Aila (modern Aqaba) at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba. A century later, during the reign of Alexander Severus, the local issue of coinage came to an end. There was no more building of sumptuous tombs, apparently because of a sudden change in political ways, such as an invasion by the neo-Persian power under the Sassanid Empire. The city of Palmyra, for a time the capital of the breakaway Palmyrene Empire, grew in importance and attracted the Arabian trade away from Petra. Teller, Matthew; Jordan; p.265; Rough Guides; Sept 2009; Geography It was situated between the Arabian and Sinai Peninsulas. Its northern neighbour was the kingdom of Judea, and its south western neighbour was Ptolemaic Egypt. Its capital was the city of Raqmu in Jordan, and it included the towns of Bosra, Mada'in Saleh (Hegra), and Nitzana. Raqmu, now called Petra, was a wealthy trading town, located at a convergence of several important trade routes. One of them was the Incense Route which was based around the production of both myrrh and frankincense in southern Arabia, and ran through Mada'in Saleh to Petra. From there, aromatics were distributed throughout the Mediterranean region.

The Poona Diocee consists of the civil districts of Pune, Satara, Solapur, Sangli & Kolhapur city. In about 1790 the Archbishop of Goa at the request of Dom Manuel Noronha, a Portuguese officer working in the Peshwa's army, sent Fr. Vincent Joaquim Menezes to minister to the Catholics working in the army of Peshwas. Fr.Menezes resided and said Mass in the house of Dom Noronha. In 1794, with the contribution of the Catholics in the army, a small chapel was built at Nana Peth on a plot offered by the Peshwa. The first Mass was celebrated in this chapel on Christmasday. These were the beginning of the Church of the Immaculate Conception, commonly known as the City Church. Around 1800 the Vicar Apostolic of Bombay started sending his priests to minister to the Catholics in the Scindia's army but he stopped this about 1804. In 1835 Fr.Britto, a Goan priest working under the Vicar Apostolic acted as Military Chaplain in a chapel built at Right Flank Lines, Wanwadi. In 1850, St. Patrick's Church, the present cathedral, was built. Poona was erected into a Vicariate Apostolic by dismemberment from Bombay on March 8, 1854, and entrusted to the society of Jesus. The Vicar Apostolic of Bombay remained Administrator till the Hierarchy was established in 1886. Rt.Rev.Bernard Bieder-Linden SJ was appointed its first Bishop. On October 20, 1953, the Catholics of Ratnagiri District and those of the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Pune, who formerly belonged to the Archdiocese of Goa, were placed under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Poona. On November 30, 1953 the districts of Dharwar and Bijapur, formerly in the Poona Diocese were attached to the newly constituted Diocese of Belgaum. On June 9, 1987, the Diocese of Nashik was created, comprising four districts - Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon and Ahmednagar - of the Poona Diocese. Jesuit Thomas Bhalerao became its first bishop. St.Patrick's Cathedral was rededicated on October 22, 1987. The roof of the old Cathedral collapsed shortly before midnight on July 15, 1984. The outer walls and facade have been retained, but there is now a vault roof of concrete. The Eparchy of Kalyan, which is contiguous with the Archdiocese of Bombay and the Dioceses of Poona and Nashik, was created on May 19, 1988. On August 24, 1988, Paul Chittilapilly was ordained Eparch of Kalyan, and the new diocese was formally inaugurated. All Catholics of the Syro-Malabar rite in the diocese came under his jurisdiction. The First Diocesan Synod was held at Ishvani Kendra, Pune, from 11 to 14 February 2003. 144 delegates from all the 7 districts attended.

Born in Wickmore, County Wexford, Jacob was introduced to hurling in his youth. His granduncle, Jim Mythen, was an All-Ireland medal winner with Wexford in 1910. Jacob was just sixteen years-old when he established himself on the Oulart-the Ballagh junior team. A championship medal winner in the junior and intermediate grades, Jacob lost five senior championship finals. Jacob made his debut on the inter-county scene when he first linked up with the Wexford minor team. After little success in this grade, he later won an All-Ireland medal with the under-21 team. Jacob joined the senior team during the 1967-68 league. He went on to play a key role for Wexford in defence during a successful era, and won one All-Ireland medal, four Leinster medals and one National Hurling League medal. Jacob was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team, Jacob won three Railway Cup medals. Throughout his inter-county career he made 31 championship appearances. Jacob retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1984 championship. Jacob's siblings- Christy, Robbie and Bridie - also played with distinction at all levels with Wexford. His children - Helena, Ursula, Michael and Rory - have also lined out with Wexford. Jacob won three All-Star awards, and was chosen as one of the 125 greatest hurlers of all time in a 2009 poll. In retirement from playing Jacob became involved in team management and coaching. He was a selector with the Wexford senior team as well as with all levels with Oulart-the Ballagh. Playing career=Club= Jacob began his club career in goals for the Oulart-the Ballagh junior team in 1962. He won a junior championship medal in 1967 before claiming an intermediate championship medal in 1968. =Minor and under-21= After one season with the Wexford minor team, Jacob first enjoyed success as the goalkeeper on the inaugural Wexford under-21 team. He won his first Leinster medal in 1964 as Laois were defeated by 4-7 to 2-2. On 4 October 1964 Wexford faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final. A tally of 2-2 for Babs Keating helped Tipperary to an easy 8-9 to 3-1 victory. Wexford retained the provincial under-21 title in 1965 with Jacob winning a second Leinster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final was a repeat of the previous year with Tipperary providing the opposition once again. A 3-7 to 1-4 victory gave Jacob an All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship medal. Wexford retained their provincial crown in 1966, with Jacob collecting a third Leinster medal following a 7‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì8 demolition of Laois. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw Cork providing the opposition. After a high-scoring hour of hurling Wexford scored 5‚Äì6 to Cork's 3‚Äì12 resulting in a draw. The replay was also a close affair with the sides finishing level again at 4‚Äì9 apiece. A third game produced the eventual winner as Wexford were defeated by 9‚Äì9 to 5‚Äì9. =Senior= Jacob joined his brother Christy on the Wexford senior team in 1968. He was an unused substitute throughout the season as Wexford claimed the Leinster and All-Ireland titles following respective defeats of Kilkenny and Tipperary. Jacob made his senior championship debut in a 5-10 to 3-11 Leinster semi-final defeat by Offaly on 29 June 1969. Wexford regrouped in 1970, however, Jacob remained on the bench for their 4‚Äì16 to 3‚Äì14 defeat of old rivals Kilkenny in the Leinster final. Wexford subsequently faced Cork in the All-Ireland decider on 6 September 1970 and Jacob was back on the starting fifteen. A record 64-point scoreline and eleven goals were produced in a sometimes ill-tempered and disappointing contest. Tony Doran top scored for Wexford with two goals, however, the day belonged to Eddie O'Brien who scored a hat-trick of goals for Cork from his hand. A remarkable 6‚Äì21 to 5‚Äì10 score line gave Cork the victory. In 1972 Jacob became Wexford's first All-Star recipient when his performances earned him the award. Jacob won a National Hurling League medal in 1973 following a 4‚Äì13 to 3‚Äì7 defeat of Limerick. After a five-year period of Kilkenny dominance, Wexford broke through in 1976. A 2‚Äì20 to 1‚Äì6 trouncing gave Jacob a third Leinster medal. It was his first won on the field of play. Cork provided the opposition in the subsequent All- Ireland final on 5 September 1976. Wexford got off to a great start and were 2‚Äì2 to no score ahead after just six minutes. Wexford had a two-point lead with ten minutes to go, however, three points from Jimmy Barry-Murphy, two from Pat Moylan and a kicked effort from Ray Cummins gave Cork a 2‚Äì21 to 4‚Äì11 victory. In spite of this defeat Jacob was later presented with a second All- Star award. Jacob collected his fourth Leinster medal in 1977 following a 3‚Äì17 to 3‚Äì14 defeat of Kilkenny. The All-Ireland final on 4 September 1977 was a repeat of the previous year, with Cork providing the opposition once again. Se√°nie O'Leary score the decisive goal for Cork as the game entered the last quarter, while Martin Coleman brought off a match-winning save from Christy Keogh to foil the Wexford comeback. A 1‚Äì17 to 3‚Äì8 defeat was Jacob's lot as he endured a second successive year as an All-Ireland runner-up. He later collected a third All-Star. Wexford went into decline following this defeat as Kilkenny and Offaly emerged as the dominant teams in Leinster. Jacob played his last game for Wexford in a 1‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì11 Leinster decider defeat by Offaly on 8 July 1984. He retired from inter-county hurling later that year when he sustained a serious eye injury in a practice match with his club. =Inter- provincial= Jacob also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He first played for his province in 1973 as Leinster defeated Munster to take the Railway Cup. Jacob added further Railway Cup medals to his collection in 1975 and 1977.

Address  Bishop's House, Barampur, Vasai Road West. Palghar Dist. - 401 202, Maharashtra. History The history of Vasai is as old as Christianity itself. Tradition has it that St. Bartholomeo, the apostle, came to Kalyan which forms part of Thane district in which the Diocese of Vasai is situated. In the 6th century, Kalyan had a Bishop elected and sent from Persia. Jordenus worked as a Dominican priest for a brief period in a church at Sopara in 1321 in this diocese when he had come just as a Father before he was appointed as the first Bishop of Quilon. In 1534, the Portuguese moved to Vasai from Cochin and Goa. In 1536, they put up a church in Vasai Fort dedicated to Our Lady of Life. There was also a Parish church under the title of St. Joseph. This Church was known as the 'Se' or 'Seat of the Bishop.' Whenever the Bishop of Goa visited Vasai that was the church from where he officiated. With the arrival of the Portuguese Fathers, the Franciscans, Dominicans, Jesuits, Augustinians, they started sending their Fathers to Vasai. (The Brothers of St. John of God were also among them). They erected 3 big churches in North Vasai and about 5 churches in South Vasai. There were churches built by them in Palghar and Dahanu Talukas. Today, they do not exist anymore. The Catholics of the former 8 churches are being served today by the 33 ecclesiastical units which form the major part of this diocese. The Church in this diocese had its ups and downs during the 18th-20th centuries, i.e. during the Maratha and the British rule, but the priests that came from Goa kept up the faith when the European Fathers were driven away. The local priests coming from the East Indian Community were among the first ones to help the Goan priests in preserving the faith of the people of this area which they had received from the Portuguese in the 16th Century. The new Diocese of Vasai was created on May 22, 1998 by Late Pope John Paul II. The good tidings of the creation of the new diocese were joyfully announced by Cardinal Ivan Dias, on Sunday, June 28, 1998, the eve of the feast of the Apostles, Sts. Peter and Paul, at the Shrine dedicated to Our Lady of Remedy. The installation ceremony of Father Thomas Dabre as the First Bishop of the new Diocese took place at the new Cathedral of Our Lady of Grace, Papdy, on Aug. 15, 1998. On April 4, 2009 Bishop Dabre was transferred to the diocese of Poona. Archbishop Machado of Nashik diocese was transferred to the diocese of Vasai on Nov. 10, 2009 and was installed on December 19, 2009.

It is similar to, and often confused with, the llama. However, alpacas are often noticeably smaller than llamas. The two animals are closely related and can successfully cross-breed. Both species are believed to have been domesticated from their wild relatives, the vicu√±a and guanaco. There are two breeds of alpaca: the Suri alpaca and the Huacaya alpaca. Alpacas are kept in herds that graze on the level heights of the Andes of Southern Peru, Western Bolivia, Ecuador, and Northern Chile at an altitude of above sea level. Alpacas are considerably smaller than llamas, and unlike llamas, they were not bred to be working animals but were bred specifically for their fiber. Alpaca fiber is used for making knitted and woven items, similar to sheep's wool. These items include blankets, sweaters, hats, gloves, scarves, a wide variety of textiles and ponchos in South America, and sweaters, socks, coats and bedding in other parts of the world. The fiber comes in more than 52 natural colors as classified in Peru, 12 as classified in Australia, and 16 as classified in the United States. Alpacas communicate through body language. The most common is spitting when they are in distress, fearful, or mean to show dominance. Male alpacas are more aggressive than females, and tend to establish dominance of their herd group. In some cases, alpha males will immobilize the head and neck of a weaker or challenging male in order to show their strength and dominance. In the textile industry, \\"alpaca\\" primarily refers to the hair of Peruvian alpacas, but more broadly it refers to a style of fabric originally made from alpaca hair, such as mohair, Icelandic sheep wool, or even high-quality wool from other breeds of sheep. In trade, distinctions are made between alpacas and the several styles of mohair and luster. An adult alpaca generally is between in height at the shoulders (withers). They usually weigh between . Background Guanacos (wild parent species of llamas) near Torres del Paine, Chile The relationship between alpacas and vicu√±as was disputed for many years. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the four South American lamoid species were assigned scientific names. At that time, the alpaca was assumed to be descended from the llama, ignoring similarities in size, fleece and dentition between the alpaca and the vicu√±a. Classification was complicated by the fact that all four species of South American camelid can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. The advent of DNA technology made a more accurate classification possible. In 2001, the alpaca genus classification changed from Lama pacos to Vicugna pacos, following the presentation of a paper on work by Miranda Kadwell etal. on alpaca DNA to the Royal Society showing the alpaca is descended from the vicu√±a, not the guanaco. =Origin and domestication= Alpacas were domesticated thousands of years ago. The Moche people of Northern Peru often used alpaca images in their art. There are no known wild alpacas, and its closest living relative, the vicu√±a (also native to South America), is the wild ancestor of the alpaca. The family Camelidae first appeared in Americas 40‚Äì45 million years ago, during the Eocene period, from the common ancestor, Protylopus. The descendants divided into Camelini and Lamini tribes, taking different migratory patterns to Asia and South America, respectively. Although the camelids became extinct in North America around 3 million years ago, it flourished in the South with the species we see today. It was not until 2‚Äì5 million years ago, during the Pliocene, that the genus Hemiauchenia of the tribe Lamini split into Palaeolama and Lama; the latter would then split again into Lama and Vicugna upon migrating down to South America. Remains of vicu√±a and guanaco have been found throughout Peru for around 12,000 years. Their domesticated counterparts, the llama and alpacas, have been found mummified in the Moquegua valley, in the south of Peru, dating back 900 to 1000 years. Mummies found in this region show two breeds of alpacas. More precise analysis of bone and teeth of these mummies has demonstrated that alpacas were domesticated from the Vicugna vicugna. Other research, considering the behavioral and morphological characteristics of alpacas and their wild counterparts, seems to indicate that alpacas could find their origins in Lama guanicoe as well as Vicugna vicugna, or even a hybrid of both. Genetic analysis shows a different picture of the origins of the alpaca. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA shows that most alpacas have guanaco mtDNA, and many also have vicu√±a mtDNA. But microsatellite data shows that alpaca DNA is much more similar to vicu√±a DNA than to guanaco DNA. This suggests that alpacas are descendants of the Vicugna vicugna, not of the Lama guanicoe. The discrepancy with mtDNA seems to be a result of the fact that mtDNA is only transmitted by the mother, and recent husbandry practices have caused hybridization between llamas (which primarily carry guanaco DNA) and alpacas. To the extent that many of today's domestic alpacas are the result of male alpacas bred to female llamas, this would explain the mtDNA consistent with guanacos. This situation has led to attempts to reclassify the alpaca as Vicugna pacos.  Breeds  The alpaca comes in two breeds, Suri and Huacaya, based on their fibers rather than scientific or European classifications. Alpaca skeleton, with alpaca and guanaco skull above. (Museum of Osteology) Huacaya alpacas are the most commonly found, constituting about 90% of the population. The Huacaya alpaca is thought to have originated in post-colonial Peru. This is due to their thicker fleece which makes them more suited to survive in the higher altitudes of the Andes after being pushed into the highlands of Peru after the arrival of the Spanish.Merrell, J., & Merrell, S. (2017). Huacaya alpacas. Retrieved from http://www.gatewayalpacas.com/alpacas/the-breed/huacaya.htm Suri alpacas represent a smaller portion of the total alpaca population, around 10%. They are thought to have been more prevalent in pre-Columbian Peru since they could be kept at a lower altitude where a thicker fleece was not needed for harsh weather conditions. Behavior Alpaca near a farm Closeup of an alpaca's face Alpacas are social herd animals that live in family groups, consisting of a territorial alpha male, females, and their young ones. Alpacas warn the herd about intruders by making sharp, noisy inhalations that sound like a high- pitched bray. The herd may attack smaller predators with their front feet and can spit and kick. Their aggression towards members of the canid family (coyotes, foxes, dogs etc.) is exploited when alpacas are used as guard llamas for guarding sheep. Alpacas can sometimes be aggressive, but they can also be very gentle, intelligent, and extremely observant. For the most part, alpacas are very quiet, but male alpacas are more energetic when they get involved in fighting with other alpacas. When they prey, they are cautious but also nervous when they feel any type of threat. They can feel threatened when a person or another alpaca comes up from behind them.Alpaca Behaviour. (n.d.). Retrieved 16 November 2017, from http://www.alpacasociety.co.za/?q=node%2F8 Alpacas set their own boundaries of \\"personal space\\" within their families and groups. They make a hierarchy in some sense, and each alpaca is aware of the dominant animals in each group. Body language is the key to their communication. It helps to maintain their order. One example of their body communication includes a pose named broadside, where their ears are pulled back and they stand sideways. This pose is used when male alpacas are defending their territory. When they are young, they tend to follow larger objects and to sit near or under them. An example of this is a baby alpaca with its mother. This can also apply when an alpaca passes by an older alpaca. =Training= Alpacas are often very trainable and will usually respond to reward, most commonly in the form of food. They are able to be petted without getting agitated although this is usually only when the animal is not being patted around the head or neck. Alpacas are usually quite easy to herd; even in large groups. Although when being herded, it is recommended that the handler approaches the animals slowly and quietly, not doing this can result in danger for both the animals and the handler. Alpaca and llamas have started showing up in U.S. nursing homes and hospitals as trained, certified therapy animals. The Mayo Clinic says animal-assisted therapy can reduce pain, depression, anxiety, and fatigue. This type of animal therapy is growing in popularity, and there are several organizations throughout the United States that participate. =Spitting= Not all alpacas spit, but all are capable of doing so. \\"Spit\\" is somewhat euphemistic; occasionally the projectile contains only air and a little saliva, although alpacas commonly bring up acidic stomach contents (generally a green, grassy mix) and project it onto their chosen targets. Spitting is mostly reserved for other alpacas, but an alpaca will also occasionally spit at a human. Spitting can result in what is called \\"sour mouth\\". Sour mouth is characterized by a loose-hanging lower lip and a gaping mouth. Alpacas can spit for several reasons. A female alpaca spits when she is not interested in a male alpaca, typically when she thinks that she is already impregnated. Both sexes of alpaca keep others away from their food, or anything they have their eyes on. Most give a slight warning before spitting by blowing air out and raising their heads, giving their ears a \\"pinned\\" appearance. Alpacas can spit up to ten feet if they need to. For example, if another animal does not back off, the alpaca will throw up its stomach contents, resulting in a lot of spit. Some signs of stress which can lead to their spitting habits include: humming, a wrinkle under their eye, drooling, rapid breathing, and stomping their feet. When alpacas show any sign of interest or alertness, they tend to sniff their surroundings, watch closely, or stand quietly in place and stare. When it comes to reproduction, they spit because it is a response triggered by the progesterone levels being increased, which is associated with ovulation. =Hygiene= Alpacas use a communal dung pile, where they do not graze. This behaviour tends to limit the spread of internal parasites. Generally, males have much tidier, and fewer dung piles than females, which tend to stand in a line and all go at once. One female approaches the dung pile and begins to urinate and/or defecate, and the rest of the herd often follows. Alpaca waste is collected and used as garden fertilizer or even natural fertilizer. Because of their preference for using a dung pile, some alpacas have been successfully house-trained. Alpacas develop dental hygiene problems which affect their eating and behavior. Warning signs include protracted chewing while eating, or food spilling out of their mouths. Poor body condition and sunken cheeks are also telltales of dental problems. =Sounds= Suri alpacas Alpacas make a variety of sounds: * Humming: When alpacas are born, the mother and baby hum constantly. They also hum as a sign of distress, especially when they are separated from their herd. Alpacas may also hum when curious, happy, worried or cautious. * Snorting: Alpacas snort when another alpaca is invading its space. * Grumbling: Alpacas grumble to warn each other. For example, when one is invading another's personal space, it sounds like gurgling. * Clucking: Similar to a hen's cluck, alpacas cluck when a mother is concerned for her cria. Male alpacas cluck to signal friendly behavior. * Screaming: Their screams are extremely deafening and loud. They will scream when they are not handled correctly or when they are being attacked by a potential enemy. * Screeching: A bird-like cry, presumably intended to terrify the opponent. This sound is typically used by male alpacas when they are in a fight over dominance. When a female screeches, it is more of a growl when she is angry. =Reproduction= Females are induced ovulators; the act of mating and the presence of semen causes them to ovulate. Females usually conceive after just one breeding, but occasionally do have trouble conceiving. Artificial insemination is technically difficult, expensive and not common, but it can be accomplished. Embryo transfer is more widespread. A male is usually ready to mate for the first time between two and three years of age. It is not advisable to allow a young female to be bred until she is mature and has reached two-thirds of her mature weight. Over- breeding a young female before conception is possibly a common cause of uterine infections. As the age of maturation varies greatly between individuals, it is usually recommended that novice breeders wait until females are 18 months of age or older before initiating breeding. Alpacas can breed at any time but it is more difficult to breed in the winter. Most breed during autumn or late spring. The most popular way to have alpacas mate is pen mating. Pen mating is when they move both the female and the desired male into a pen. Another way is paddock mating where one male alpaca is let loose in the paddock with several female alpacas. The gestation period is, on an average, 11.5 months, and usually results in a single offspring, or cria. Twins are rare, occurring about once per 1000 deliveries. Cria are generally between 15 and 19 pounds, and are standing 30 to 90 minutes after birth. After a female gives birth, she is generally receptive to breeding again after about two weeks. Crias may be weaned through human intervention at about six months old and 60 pounds, but many breeders prefer to allow the female to decide when to wean her offspring; they can be weaned earlier or later depending on their size and emotional maturity. The average lifespan of an alpaca is between 15‚Äì20 years, and the longest-lived alpaca on record is 27 years.  Habitat and lifestyle  Alpacas near a mountain in Ecuador Alpacas can be found all over South America. They typically live in temperate conditions in the mountains with high altitudes. They are easy to care for since they are not limited to a specific type of environment. Animals such as flamingos, condors, spectacled bears, mountain lions, coyotes, llamas, and sheep live near alpacas when they are in their natural habitat.  Population  Alpacas are native to Peru, but can be found throughout the globe. It currently has the largest population, with over half the world's animals. The population declined drastically after the Spanish Conquistadors invaded the Andes mountains in 1532, after which 98% of the animals were destroyed. The Spanish also brought with them diseases that were fatal to alpacas. European conquest forced the animals to move higher into the mountains, which remained there permanently. Although alpacas had almost been wiped out completely, they were rediscovered sometime during the 19th century by Europeans. After finding uses for them, the animals became important to societies during the industrial revolution.Maple View Farm Alpacas. (n.d.). Retrieved 14 November 2017, from http://www.mapleviewfarmalpacas.com/learn-about-alpacas/alpaca-history/ Diet (video) An alpaca chewing Alpacas chew their food which ends up being mixed with their cud and saliva and then they swallow it. Alpacas usually eat 1.5% of its body weight for normal growth. They mainly need pasture grass, hay, or silage but some may also need supplemental energy and protein foods and they will also normally try to chew on almost anything (e.g. empty bottle). Most alpaca ranchers rotate their feeding grounds so the grass can regrow and fecal parasites may die before reusing the area. Pasture grass is a great source of protein. When seasons change, the grass loses or gains more protein. For example, in the spring, the pasture grass has about 20% protein while in the summer, it only has 6%. They need more energy supplements in the winter to produce body heat and warmth. They get their fiber from hay or from long stems which provides them with vitamin E. Green grass contains vitamin A and E. Alpacas can eat natural unfertilized grass; however, ranchers can also supplement grass with low-protein grass hay. To provide selenium and other necessary vitamins, ranchers will feed their domestic alpacas a daily dose of grain to provide additional nutrients that are not fully obtained from their primary diet. Alpacas may obtain the necessary vitamins in their native grazing ranges. =Digestion= Alpacas, like other camelids, have a three- chambered stomach; combined with chewing cud, this three-chambered system allows maximum extraction of nutrients from low-quality forages. Alpacas are not ruminants, pseudo-ruminants, or modified ruminants, as there are many differences between the anatomy and physiology of a camelid and a ruminant stomach. Alpacas will chew their food in a figure eight motion, swallow the food, and then pass it into one of the stomach's chambers. The first and second chambers (called C1 and C2) are anaerobic fermentation chambers where the fermentation process begins. The alpaca will further absorb nutrients and water in the first part of the third chamber. The end of the third chamber (called C3) is where the stomach secretes acids to digest food and is the likely place where an alpaca will have ulcers if stressed. =Poisonous plants= Many plants are poisonous to the alpaca, including the bracken fern, Madagascar ragwort, oleander, and some azaleas. In common with similar livestock, others include: acorns, African rue, agave, amaryllis, autumn crocus, bear grass, broom snakeweed, buckwheat, ragweed, buttercups, calla lily, orange tree foliage, carnations, castor beans, and many others. Fiber Spinning alpaca wool in Switzerland, 2018 Alpaca fleece is a lustrous and silky natural fiber. While similar to sheep's wool, it is warmer, not prickly, and bears no lanolin, which makes it hypoallergenic. Without lanolin, it does not repel water. It is also soft and luxurious. In physical structure, alpaca fiber is somewhat akin to hair, being very glossy. The preparing, carding, spinning, weaving and finishing process of alpaca is very similar to the process used for wool. Alpaca fiber is also flame-resistant, and meets the US Consumer Product Safety Commission's standards. Alpacas are typically sheared once per year in the spring. Each shearing produces approximately of fiber per alpaca. An adult alpaca might produce of first- quality fiber as well as of second- and third-quality fiber. The quality of alpaca fiber is determined by how crimpy it is. Typically, the greater the number of small folds in the fiber, the greater the quality. Prices Alpacas were the subject of a speculative bubble between their introduction to North America in 1984 and the early 21st century. The price for American alpacas ranged from US$50 for a castrated male (gelding) to US$500,000 for the highest in the world, depending on breeding history, sex, and color. In 2006, researchers warned that the higher prices sought for alpaca breeding stock were largely speculative and not supported by market fundamentals, given the low inherent returns per head from the main end product, alpaca fiber, and prices into the $100s per head rather than $10,000s would be required for a commercially viable fiber production herd. Marketed as \\"the investment you can hug\\" in television commercials by the Alpaca Owners and Breeders Association, the market for alpacas was almost entirely dependent on breeding and selling animals to new buyers, a classic sign of speculative bubbles in livestock. The bubble burst in 2007, with the price of alpaca breeding stock dropping by thousands of dollars each year thereafter. Many farmers found themselves unable to sell animals for any price, or even give them away. It is possible to raise up to 25 alpacas per hectare (10 alpacas per acre), as they have a designated area for waste products and keep their eating area away from their waste area. However, this ratio differs from country to country and is highly dependent on the quality of pasture available (in many desert locations it is generally only possible to run one to three animals per acre due to lack of suitable vegetation). Fiber quality is the primary variant in the price achieved for alpaca wool; in Australia, it is common to classify the fiber by the thickness of the individual hairs and by the amount of vegetable matter contained in the supplied shearings. Livestock A Bolivian man and his alpaca Alpacas need to eat 1‚Äì2% of body weight per day, so about two bales of grass hay per month per animal. When formulating a proper diet for alpacas, water and hay analysis should be performed to determine the proper vitamin and mineral supplementation program. Two options are to provide free choice salt/mineral powder or feed a specially formulated ration. Indigenous to the highest regions of the Andes, this harsh environment has created an extremely hardy animal, so only minimal housing and predator fencing are needed. The alpaca's three-chambered stomachs allow for extremely efficient digestion. There are no viable seeds in the manure, because alpacas prefer to only eat tender plant leaves, and will not consume thick plant stems; therefore, alpaca manure does not need composting to enrich pastures or ornamental landscaping. Nail and teeth trimming are needed every six to twelve months, along with annual shearing. Similar to ruminants, such as cattle and sheep, alpacas have only lower teeth at the front of their mouths; therefore, they do not pull the grass up by the roots. Rotating pastures is still important, though, as alpacas have a tendency to regraze an area repeatedly. Alpacas are fiber- producing animals; they do not need to be slaughtered to reap their product, and their fiber is a renewable resource that grows yearly.  Cultural presence  Alpacas are closely tied to cultural practices for Andeans people. Prior to colonization, the image of the alpaca was used in rituals and in their religious practices. Since the people in the region depended heavily on these animals for their sustenance, the alpaca was seen as a gift from Pachamama. Alpacas were used for their meat, fibers for clothing, and art, and their images in the form of conopas. Conopas take their appearance from the Suri alpacas, with long locks flanking their sides and bangs covering the eyes, and a depression on the back. This depression is used in ritual practices, usually filled with coca leaves and fat from alpacas and lamas, to bring fertility and luck. While their use was prevalent before colonization, the attempts to convert the Andean people to Catholicism led to the acquisition of more than 3,400 conopas in Lima alone. The origin of alpaca is depicted in legend; the legend states they came to be in the world after a goddess fell in love with a man. The goddess‚Äô father only allowed her to be with her lover if he cared for her herd of alpacas. On top of caring for the herd, he was to always carry a small animal for his entire life. As the goddess came into our world, the alpacas followed her. Everything was fine until the man set the small animal down, and the goddess fled back to her home. On her way back home, the man attempted to stop her and her herd from fleeing. While he was not able to stop her from returning, he was able to stop a few alpacas from returning. These alpacas who did not make it back are said to be seen today in the swampy lands in the Andes waiting for the end of the world, so they may return to their goddess. Nuzzle and Scratch were two fictional alpacas who appeared on British children's television.

He went on to play a key role for Wexford at midfield during a successful era and won one All-Ireland medal as a non- playing substitute, four Leinster medals and one National Hurling League medal. Buggy was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team, Buggy won two Railway Cup medals. Throughout his inter-county career, he made 26 championship appearances. Buggy retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1982 championship. In retirement from playing, Buggy became involved in team management and coaching as a selector with the Leinster inter-provincial team. Playing career=Club= Buggy first played for Faythe Harriers as a juvenile in 1960. He claimed a championship medal in this grade in 1964 before later claiming a minor championship medal in 1966 followed by three successive under-21 championship medals. In 1981 Buggy lined out at left corner-forward in his third senior championship decider. Buffers Alley provided the opposition, however, a sensational late goal from a '65' by Buggy ended up in the net. The narrow 2-10 to 2-9 victory gave him a Wexford Senior Hurling Championship medal. =Minor and under-21= Buggy joined the Wexford minor team in 1965, however, their championship campaign ended without success. Eligible for the grade again in 1966, Buggy won a Leinster medal that year following a huge 7-6 to 1-7 defeat of Laois. On 4 September 1966, Wexford faced Cork in the All-Ireland decider. Wexford came from behind in the last five minute to level the game at 6-7 apiece. The replay on 16 October 1966 also saw Wexford stage a late rally with two goals. A 4-1 to 1-8 victory secured an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal for Buggy. By 1969 Buggy was in his final year with the Wexford under-21 team. A 3-16 to 4-3 defeat of reigning provincial champions Kilkenny gave him a Leinster medal in this grade. On 14 September 1969, Wexford faced Cork in the All-Ireland decider. Buggy scored 0-3 from play, however, Cork was superior in securing their third successive championship with a 5-13 to 4-7 victory. =Senior= Buggy made his senior championship debut in a 3-15 to 3-11 Leinster semi-final defeat of Dublin on 16 June 1968. He was an unused substitute throughout the rest of the campaign as Wexford claimed the Leinster and All-Ireland titles following respective defeats of Kilkenny and Tipperary. After surrendering their championship titles in 1969, Wexford regrouped the following year. A 4‚Äì16 to 3‚Äì14 defeat of old rivals Kilkenny in the very first 80-minute championship game gave Buggy a second Leinster medal, his first on the field of play. Wexford subsequently faced Cork in the All-Ireland decider on 6 September 1970, however, an injury ruled Buggy out of the game. A remarkable 6‚Äì21 to 5‚Äì10 score gave Cork the victory. Buggy won a National Hurling League medal in 1973 following a 4‚Äì13 to 3‚Äì7 defeat of Limerick. After a five-year period of Kilkenny dominance, Wexford broke through in 1976. A 2‚Äì20 to 1‚Äì6 trouncing gave Buggy a third Leinster medal. Cork provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 5 September 1976. Wexford got off to a great start and were 2‚Äì2 to no score ahead after just six minutes. Wexford had a two-point lead with ten minutes to go, however, three points from Jimmy Barry-Murphy, two from Pat Moylan and a kicked effort from Ray Cummins gave Cork a 2‚Äì21 to 4‚Äì11 victory. Buggy collected his fourth Leinster medal in 1977 following a 3‚Äì17 to 3‚Äì14 defeat of Kilkenny. The All-Ireland final on 4 September 1977 was a repeat of the previous year, with Cork providing the opposition once again. Se√°nie O'Leary score the decisive goal for Cork as the game entered the last quarter, while Martin Coleman brought off a match- winning save from Christy Keogh to foil the Wexford comeback. A 1‚Äì17 to 3‚Äì8 defeat was Buggy's lot as he endured a second successive year as an All- Ireland runner-up. Wexford went into decline following this defeat as Kilkenny and Offaly emerged as the dominant teams in Leinster. In spite of this Buggy won an All-Star award in 1979. =Inter-provincial= Buggy also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial series of games and enjoyed much success. In 1977 he was at midfield as Leinster faced Munster in the decider. A 2-17 to 1-13 victory gave him a Railway Cup medal. In 1979, Buggy won a second Railway Cup medal as Leinster defeated Connacht by 1-13 to 1-9.

Most often, the larger ring is a domain integrally closed in its field of fractions, and then the conductor measures the failure of the smaller ring to be integrally closed. The conductor is of great importance in the study of non-maximal orders in the ring of integers of an algebraic number field. One interpretation of the conductor is that it measures the failure of unique factorization into prime ideals.  Definition  Let A and B be commutative rings, and assume . The conductor of A in B is the ideal :\\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A) = \\\\operatorname{Ann}_A(B/A). Here is viewed as a quotient of A-modules, and denotes the annihilator. More concretely, the conductor is the set :\\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A) = \\\\\\\\{ a \\\\in A \\\\colon aB \\\\subseteq A \\\\\\\\}. Because the conductor is defined as an annihilator, it is an ideal of A. If B is an integral domain, then the conductor may be rewritten as :\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ a \\\\in A \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} : B \\\\subseteq \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{1}{a}A \\\\\\\\}, where \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{1}{a}A is considered as a subset of the fraction field of B. That is, if a is non-zero and in the conductor, then every element of B may be written as a fraction whose numerator is in A and whose denominator is a. Therefore the non-zero elements of the conductor are those that suffice as common denominators when writing elements of B as quotients of elements of A. Suppose R is a ring containing B. For example, R might equal B, or B might be a domain and R its field of fractions. Then, because , the conductor is also equal to :\\\\\\\\{ r \\\\in R : rB \\\\subseteq A \\\\\\\\}.  Elementary properties  The conductor is the whole ring A if and only if it contains and, therefore, if and only if . Otherwise, the conductor is a proper ideal of A. If the index is finite, then , so m \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A). In this case, the conductor is non- zero. This applies in particular when B is the ring of integers in an algebraic number field and A is an order (a subring for which is finite). The conductor is also an ideal of B, because, for any and any a \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A), . In fact, an ideal J of B is contained in A if and only if J is contained in the conductor. Indeed, for such a J, , so by definition J is contained in \\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A). Conversely, the conductor is an ideal of A, so any ideal contained in it is contained in A. This fact implies that \\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A) is the largest ideal of A which is also an ideal of B. (It can happen that there are ideals of A contained in the conductor which are not ideals of B.) Suppose that S is a multiplicative subset of A. Then :S^{-1}\\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A) \\\\subseteq \\\\mathfrak{f}(S^{-1}B/S^{-1}A), with equality in the case that B is a finitely generated A-module.  Conductors of Dedekind domains  Some of the most important applications of the conductor arise when B is a Dedekind domain and is finite. For example, B can be the ring of integers of a number field and A a non-maximal order. Or, B can be the affine coordinate ring of a smooth projective curve over a finite field and A the affine coordinate ring of a singular model. The ring A does not have unique factorization into prime ideals, and the failure of unique factorization is measured by the conductor \\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A). Ideals coprime to the conductor share many of pleasant properties of ideals in Dedekind domains. Furthermore, for these ideals there is a tight correspondence between ideals of B and ideals of A: * The ideals of A that are relatively prime to \\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A) have unique factorization into products of invertible prime ideals that are coprime to the conductor. In particular, all such ideals are invertible. * If I is an ideal of B that is relatively prime to \\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A), then is an ideal of A that is relatively prime to \\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A) and the natural ring homomorphism A / (I \\\\cap A) \\\\to B / I is an isomorphism. In particular, I is prime if and only if is prime. * If J is an ideal of A that is relatively prime to \\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A), then is an ideal of B that is relatively prime to \\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A) and the natural ring homomorphism A / J \\\\to B / JB is an isomorphism. In particular, J is prime if and only if JB is prime. * The functions I \\\\mapsto I \\\\cap A and J \\\\mapsto JB define a bijection between ideals of A relatively prime to \\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A) and ideals of B relatively prime to \\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A). This bijection preserves the property of being prime. It is also multiplicative, that is, (I \\\\cap A)(I' \\\\cap A) = II' \\\\cap A and (JB)(J'B) = JJ'B. All of these properties fail in general for ideals not coprime to the conductor. To see some of the difficulties that may arise, assume that J is a non-zero ideal of both A and B (in particular, it is contained in, hence not coprime to, the conductor). Then J cannot be an invertible fractional ideal of A unless . Because B is a Dedekind domain, J is invertible in B, and therefore :\\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in K \\\\colon xJ \\\\subseteq J \\\\\\\\} = B, since we may multiply both sides of the equation by J‚àí1. If J is also invertible in A, then the same reasoning applies. But the left- hand side of the above equation makes no reference to A or B, only to their shared fraction field, and therefore . Therefore being an ideal of both A and B implies non-invertibility in A.  Conductors of quadratic number fields  Let K be a quadratic extension of Q, and let be its ring of integers. By extending to a Z-basis, we see that every order O in K has the form for some positive integer c. The conductor of this order equals the ideal cOK. Indeed, it is clear that cOK is an ideal of OK contained in O, so it is contained in the conductor. On the other hand, the ideals of O containing cOK are the same as ideals of the quotient ring . The latter ring is isomorphic to by the second isomorphism theorem, so all such ideals of O are the sum of cOK with an ideal of Z. Under this isomorphism, the conductor annihilates , so it must be . In this case, the index is also equal to c, so for orders of quadratic number fields, the index may be identified with the conductor. This identification fails for higher degree number fields.

(1981). Tara, a tigress. Quartet Books, London and New York, . In the 1990s, some tigers from the protected area were observed to have the typical appearance of Siberian tigers, namely a large head, pale fur, white complexion, and wide stripes, and were suspected to be Bengal-Siberian tiger hybrids. Billy Arjan Singh sent hair samples of tigers from the national park to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad where the samples were analysed using mitochondrial sequence analysis. Results revealed that the tigers in question had a Bengal tiger mitochondrial haplotype indicating that their mother was a Bengal tiger. Skin, hair and blood samples from 71 tigers collected in various Indian zoos, in the National Museum in Kolkata and including two samples from Dudhwa National Park were prepared for microsatellite analysis that revealed that two tigers had alleles in two loci contributed by Bengal and Siberian tiger subspecies. However, samples of two hybrid specimens constituted too small a sample base to conclusively assume that Tara was the source of the Siberian tiger genes.Menon, S. (1997). Tainted Royalty .

Guns turned over to Italy as reparations after World War I were taken into Italian service as the Cannone da 152/37. Austrian and Czech guns were taken into Wehrmacht service after the Anschluss and the occupation of Czechoslovakia as the 15.2 cm K 15/16(t). Italian guns captured after the surrender of Italy in 1943 were known by the Wehrmacht as the 15.2 cm K 410(i). They weren't used much by the Germans, probably because of their unique ammunition, and generally served on coast-defense duties during World War II. Design The M. 15 was a thoroughly conventional design for its day with a box trail, iron wheels and a curved gunshield. It was notable as being the first Austro-Hungarian gun to be designed for motor transport, towed behind the M 17 'Goliath' artillery tractor, hence the Autokanone designation. For transport the barrel was generally detached from the recoil system and moved on its own trailer. The original M. 15 weapons had a maximum elevation of only 30¬∞, but an elevation of 45¬∞ was demanded early in the gun's production run, mainly to engage high-altitude targets in the mountains. 27 M. 15 guns were completed before production switched to the improved M. 15/16 with greater elevation in the first half of 1917. A total of 44 barrels and 43 carriages were completed by the end of the war.Ortner, p. 518-519 It seems likely that surviving M. 15 guns were rebuilt after the war to M. 15/16 standards. During the Twenties, guns in Italian service were relined and given new wheels by Vickers-Terni. In June 1940 Italy had 29 Cannone da 152/37 in service. By the time of the Italian capitulation this number had declined to 17.

Overview The census is a complete count of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. The Census looks at land use and ownership, operator characteristics, production practices, income and expenditures and many other areas. This picture, when compared to earlier censuses, helps to measure trends and new developments in the agricultural sector of our nation‚Äôs economy. Title 7 of the United States Code requires all those who receive a census report form to respond ‚Äì even if they did not operate a farm or ranch during the census year. The same law protects the confidentiality of all census respondents. NASS uses the information only for statistical purposes and publishes data only in tabulated totals. The report cannot be used for purposes of taxation, investigation or regulation. The privacy of individual census records is also protected from disclosure through the Freedom of Information Act. For census purposes, a farm is defined as a place from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold, or normally would have been sold, during the census year. This farm definition has changed nine times throughout history and the current definition has been in effect since 1974. History The first Census of Agriculture was taken in 1840 as part of the sixth decennial population census. The census remained a part of the decennial census through 1950, with separate mid-decade Censuses of Agriculture taken in 1925, 1935 and 1945. As time passed, census years were adjusted until the reference year coincided with the economic censuses covering other sectors of the nation‚Äôs economy. Currently, the Census of Agriculture is conducted for years ending in 2 and 7. The 1997 Census of Agriculture has historical significance because it was the first conducted by NASS after the 1997 Appropriations Act shifted responsibility of the Census of Agriculture from the U.S. Census Bureau, which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, to USDA. Uses of census data Census data is used by all those who serve farmers and rural communities ‚Äì federal, state and local governments, agribusinesses, trade associations and many others. For instance: *Companies and cooperatives use the information to determine the locations of facilities that will serve agricultural producers. *Community planners use the information to target needed services to rural residents. *USDA uses the information to ensure that local service centers are staffed at appropriate levels. *Legislators use the information when shaping farm policies and programs. *Farmers and ranchers use Census data to help make informed decisions about the future of their own operations.

Hosted by Sturdy Roots as \\"The Church, Abortion, and Sister Margaret Ellen Traxler\\" Traxler entered the novitiate of the School Sisters of Notre Dame in 1942, after completing high school, and the following year was given the habit of the School Sisters and the religious name of Sister Mary Peter, the name she used for some 20 years. She earned a Bachelor's degree in English from the College of St. Catherine in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and later received a Master's degree from Notre Dame University in Indiana. For the next 17 years she taught in high schools and colleges of her religious congregation in Minnesota and North Dakota. =Social Activism= At that point, Traxler, who had returned to using her baptismal name, began devoting herself to advocacy on behalf of interracial justice and the rights of women in society and in the Catholic Church, She took part in the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965, singing \\"We Shall Overcome\\". Just prior to Selma, she joined the staff of the National Catholic Conference for Interracial Justice, based in Chicago, serving successively as Assistant Director and Director of its Department of Educational Services (1965‚Äì1971) and as Executive Director (1971‚Äì1973). During this period, she and 12 other nuns marched in the front row of Martin Luther King Jr.'s Selma to Montgomery marches, and she also worked with King to organize \\"traveling workshops\\" of Sister-scholars to assist schools preparing for integration, and established a program to place Religious Sisters in African-American colleges to allow the regular faculty to pursue advanced degrees. In 1977, Traxler became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Other notable activities included attending the peace negotiations in Paris, France, for ending the Vietnam War, organizing the NCCIJ's Citizen's Task Force of Inquiry regarding Civil Liberties in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and co-founding the National Coalition of American Nuns and the National Interreligious Task Force on Soviet Jewry, for which she received an award from the Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Meir. = Women's rights = In 1984 Traxler was one of 26 Religious Sisters who signed their names to an advertisement in The New York Times entitled \\"A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion\\". The ad stated that there was more than one Catholic position on abortion, and called for religious pluralism and discussion within the Church. The ad showed the results of a poll of American Catholics: 11% were against abortion in any form. The ad said that this demonstrated a great majority of Catholics were sympathetic to at least some instances of abortion. Traxler upheld the church's teaching opposing abortion, but believed each woman had a right to make the choice for herself. Although 96 other religious leaders, both priests and laymen, also signed the ad, it was the members of religious congregations who drew the Vatican's wrath and who had to retract their statement or risk expulsion from their congregations. The four-year ordeal that ensued saw two Sisters leave religious life, and heralded the start of Traxler's heart troubles. Traxler defended the poll findings by appearing on television with a tube of toothpaste, saying that the toothpaste cannot be put back in the tube; an analogy to the Church's inability to hide the fact that the majority of American Catholics disagreed with its doctrinal position. \\"The tension that comes with Rome on your back is enormous,\\" said Sister Betty Barrett, who added that Traxler suffered greatly when Rome forbade her friend of 30 years, Sister Jeannine Gramick (also a School Sister of Notre Dame at the time), to continue her pastoral ministry with gays and lesbians. Gramick called Traxler \\"a giant of a woman, a prophetess to us all, unafraid to speak truth to power\\". Traxler was also the founder of the Institute for Women Today, a Christian‚ÄìJewish‚ÄìProtestant coalition to reach out to troubled women. Under the aegis of the IWT, she organized skilled workers and lawyers to travel to women's prisons in Illinois to provide training and advice. And she visited these prisons regularly, bringing the women sewing machines to make clothes for their children. She opened Sister House on Chicago's west side to aid women coming out of prison. She established Maria Shelter for abused women and children and Casa Notre Dame for older homeless women. And she funded these projects by speaking regularly, and without embarrassment, at churches and synagogues. =Death= Traxler suffered a debilitating stroke in 2000 that ended her public work, and retired to the infirmary at the Provincial Motherhouse of the School Sisters of Notre Dame in Mankato, Minnesota. She died two years later and was buried in the Sisters' cemetery there.

It applied for official recognition as a National Olympic Committee by the International Olympic Committee, but as of 2013 it remains unrecognized. History Logo of Macau Olympic Committee (1987-2008) Although sports in the Portugal-controlled region already had a long history, Macau first began to participate in international tournaments under a separate name following approval to do so by the Olympic Committee of Portugal in 1974. As the region's society became more affluent and more residents were able to attend sporting events, Macau's government established the Macau Sport Development Board (, ) on May 18, 1987 as a central coordinating office to promote sports in the city. Later that year on December 22, the Macau Olympic Committee (, ) was established as the National Olympic Committee for Macau using the flag of the Municipality of Macau. It applied for membership in the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) in December 1989 during the Council's General Assembly in Bali, Indonesia and was accepted. The first athlete from Macau to win a medal under the auspices of Macau's NOC in an international tournament was Li Man Yam () when he won the bronze medal in T'ai chi ch'uan during the 2nd Asian Martial Arts Tournament in Hong Kong in 1989. Wong Tung Ieong () won the first medal in a large-scale tournament by taking bronze in martial arts during the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing. In October 1994, Macau's government established the Awards Committee for Premier Sporting Competitions (, ) which grants prizes and awards for distinguished achievement in competitive sports for athletes and coaches from Macau. Also, from 1991 to 1999 the Macau Olympic Committee and the region's government built 20 different sport venues and facilities, including the multi-purpose Macau Stadium, which are administered by a related local sports organization. Macau Olympic Committee hosted the East Asian Games in 2005 Although the sovereignty of Macau was transferred from Portugal to the People's Republic of China in 1999, the new government has continued to allow Macau to participate in international organisations and sporting events under the name \\"Macau, China\\" using the regional flag of the Macau Special Administrative Region. In addition, the Macau Olympic Committee has participated in the National Games of China since 2011. Macau was elected as the host city of 2005 East Asian Games during the 11th General Assembly of East Asian Games Association in Guam in March 1996. The Games are the largest international sporting event ever hosted by Macau and the SAR achieved the best results of the all the countries that participated. Additionally, during the 22nd General Assembly of Olympic Council of Asia in Kuwait on January 24, 2003, Macau was approved as the host city of 2007 Asian Indoor Games. After the establishment of Association of the Portuguese Speaking Olympic Committees (ACOLOP) on June 8, 2005, Macau was chosen as the host city of the 2006 Lusofonia Games. Macau was also chosen as the first vice-president (2005-2009) and President of the Executive Committee (2009-2013) of ACOLOP. Manuel Silv√©rio (), the first vice-president of the Macau Olympic Committee, was elected as the vice president of the Olympic Council of Asia in 2005. As several athletes in the region had expressed interest in forming an organization to administer non-international sporting events in the regions, the Macau Olympic Committee revised its constitution and renamed itself to Sports and Olympic Committee of Macau, China on September 10, 2008. After the change, CODM remains the only internal and external sports federation for Macau. CODM hosted the 31st General Assembly of Olympic Council of Asia during November 2012 which elected Hanoi, Vietnam as the host city for the 2018 Asian Games. Status Flag of Macau, China (center) is raised in a Victory Ceremony during Hong Kong East Asian Games. As was done previously by the Macau Olympic Committee, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China has sent several letters to the International Olympic Committee to support recognition of Macau as a member of the IOC. This request has been complicated by the fact that the IOC revised its Charter in 1996 to only admit new NOCs that represent independent states recognised by the international community. (fellow SAR Hong Kong having been grandfathered in.) Despite the setbacks, Manuel Silv√©rio told a reporter for the Macau Daily in 2008 that \\"the application from the Macau Olympic Committee for membership in the International Olympic Committee under the name 'Macau, China' is in 'considering and hearing' and the Chinese Government and Chinese Olympic Committee are assisting with the application.\\" As of 2016, the Sports and Olympic Committee of Macau remains unrecognized as a NOC by the International Olympic Committee. However, as Macau is an autonomous territory, it has been allowed to join some international organisations and games such as the Asian Games as a separate entity, but it has not been allowed to do so in games for sovereign states such as the Olympic Games.

They are being assimilated by the Caucasian Avars. History Etnonym \\"hinukh\\" comes from the word hino/hinu - \\"the road\\" (suffix -kh/-kho form essive case - \\"at the road\\", \\"on the road\\"). Bezhta people call them \\"–≥—å–∏–Ω—É—Ö—ä–∞—Å–∞\\" (hinukhasa), Georgians - \\"·Éö·Éî·Éô·Éî·Éë·Éò\\" (lekebi), \\"·Éì·Éò·Éì·Éù·Éî·Éö·Éî·Éë·Éò\\" (didoelebi), Tsez people - \\"–≥—å–∏–Ω—É–∑–∏\\" (hinuzi). In the official documents and the censuses the Hinukh didn't appear as an independent ethnic group. After the forcible deportation of the Vainakh people and disbandment of the Chechen‚ÄìIngush ASSR, they were (together with some other Avar‚ÄìAndi‚ÄìDido peoples) resettled in Vedensky District which was given to Dagestan ASSR. After the rehabilitation of the Vainakh peoples in 1958 they settled back in their native lands. In 1960s the population of the Hinukh people was estimated to be 200. 2002 Russian Census showed their number as 531. They were considered as a subgroup of Avar people in this census. 2010 Russian Census registered 433 Hinukh, nearly all living in Dagestan. Religion The Hinukh people are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslims. They converted to Islam possibly in the late 18th century, through the mountain guides from the Free Community of Gidatl and Khunzakh and the Bezhta people who were already Muslims. Language Hinukh language is a Northeast Caucasian language of the Tsezic subgroup. Beside their native Hinukh language, many also speak Avar, Tsez, Russian and often also other languages of the region. The first information about Archi language was in a letter from Peter von Uslar to Franz Anton Schiefner dated 1865, where he writes about a special language in Inukho aul (i.e. Hinukh). The first written material about Hinukh language was a list of 16 words with their counterparts in Tsez language, given by the Belorussian ethnographer and folklorist Aleksandr Serzhputovkiy in his work about the Tsez people in 1916. Linguist Nicholas Marr classified Hinukh language as an independent language, but erroneously described it as a language \\"between Avar and Dido languages\\". It was classified as a dialect of the Tsez language by the linguists D.S. Imnaishvili and E.S. Lomtadze. The Hinukh people and Hinukh language were not in the list of the ethnic groups and languages of Dagestan for a long time. They appeared only in the second edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia.

But I don't know if this is correct. The gods know that.\\" :: Metalist Magazine :: Interviews :: Eluveitie is a Swiss folk metal band from Winterthur, Z√ºrich, founded in 2002 by Chrigel Glanzmann. The project's first EP, V√™n, was released in 2003. V√™n was a studio project of Glanzmann's, but its success led to the recruitment of a full band. The band then released a full-length album, Spirit, in June 2006. In November 2007, Eluveitie was signed by Nuclear Blast. The group rose to fame following the release of their first major-label album, Slania, in February 2008. The album peaked at number 35 in the Swiss charts and number 72 in the German charts. Eluveitie describe themselves as \\"the new wave of folk metal\\". The band's style incorporates characteristics of melodic death metal combined with the melodies of traditional Celtic music. They use traditional European instruments, including the hurdy-gurdy and bagpipes, amidst guitars and both clean and harsh vocals. Their lyrics include references to Celtic mythology, particularly of Celtic Gaul. The lyrics are often in a reconstructed form of the extinct ancient language Gaulish. The name of the band comes from graffiti on a vessel from Mantua ( 300 BC).Reproduction in Raffaele Carlo De Marinis, Gli Etruschi a nord del Po, Mantova, 1986. The inscription in Etruscan letters reads eluveitie, which has been interpreted as the Etruscan form of the Celtic *(h)elvetios (‚Äúthe Helvetian‚Äù), presumably referring to a man of Helvetian descent living in Mantua. History Eluveitie at Cernunnos Fest = Formation and Fear Dark Records contract (2002‚Äì2007) = After failing numerous attempts to form an actual band, Christian \\"Chrigel\\" Glanzmann created Eluveitie in the winter of 2002 as a studio project featuring various musicians on each track. The musicians had no obligations to the group but to record their parts in the studio. The name of the band comes from graffiti found in Mantua around 300 BC. In Etruscan letters, the inscription read \\"eluveitie\\", interpreted in the Etruscan language as \\"elvetios\\" (\\"The Swiss\\"). The inscription was probably a reference to the Helvetii people who lived in Mantua. October the following year saw the publication of the MCD V√™n (Helvetian Gaulish for \\"wild joy\\"Interview with Chrigel Glanzmann taste-of- black.ch Retrieved 24 February 2010). After Chrigel decided to make Eluveitie a real band instead of a studio project, he assembled nine other musicians, making it a full ten-piece band. Shortly afterwards, the group performed its first shows, one including the Swiss metal festival Elements of Rock, and Eluveitie signed a contract with the Dutch record label Fear Dark, which released a re-recorded V√™n in 2004. Other live performances were played, such as on some events of \\"Fear Dark Festivals\\", and even as support for the established international pagan‚Äìfolk metal acts such as Korpiklaani and Cruachan. (Chrigel sent the first MCD to Keith from Cruachan at this time for his opinion.) At this point, the band became full-time, and 6 of the 10 members left for various reasons, leaving Chrigel Glanzmann, Sevan Kirder, Meri Tadiƒá and Dide Marfurt to carry on with new members. They recruited six others, including Sevan Kirder's brother Rafi to play bass. A limited edition tribute album to the German‚ÄìIcelandic band Falkenbach was published in 2006 to celebrate their 15th anniversary. The album included Eluveitie's cover song \\"Vanadis\\". In the second quarter of 2006, the album entitled Spirit was published on Fear Dark. Although the official release date was 1 June 2006, it was made available on their first official 'tour' (a series of 'Fear Dark Festivals' in May 2006, playing alongside label mates Morphia (HOL)& Royal Anguish (USA), as well as Taketh (SWE)). In 2006, After the release of the Spirit album, there was another change in the band's line-up. Sarah Wauquiez was replaced by Anna Murphy to play hurdy-gurdy and Linda Suter was removed, trimming the band down to eight members. = Nuclear Blast contract and Slania (2007‚Äì2012) = In November 2007, Eluveitie signed a contract with label Nuclear Blast. The new studio album Slania (a girl's name that Chrigel saw on a 2500-year-old tombstoneThe stone in question appears to be the Davesco gravestone, see ) was released on 15 February 2008. On 4 June 2008, brothers Rafi and Sevan Kirder (bassist and bagpipe player, respectively) announced on their MySpace pages that they would leave Eluveitie following their concert at the Metal Camp Open Air in Slovenia on 8 July 2008. Eluveitie's next project, Evocation, was announced in 2008. The first part of the album, Evocation I: The Arcane Dominion, was released in April 2009. The band released an official special edition of this new album as Slania/Evocation I ‚Äì The Arcane Metal Hammer Edition on the May Edition from the Metal Hammer, the magazine was released on 15 April 2009 with eight songs from Evocation I: The Arcane Dominion and five from Slania.metal-hammer.de: Exklusive Eluveitie-CD im n√§chsten Metal Hammer Eluveitie announced via their websiteEluveitie.ch Eluveitie Forum:: View topic ‚Äì RECORDING NEW ALBUM! on 17 September 2009 that they were working on a new album titled Everything Remains (As It Never Was).

In August 2010 they were awarded the Metal Hammer \\"Up and Coming 2010\\" title at the Wacken Open Air. = Helvetios and Origins (2012‚Äì2015) = Eluveitie released Helvetios, another metal album, in 2012, which received very favorable reviews. In an interview with Metal Blast magazine, Chrigel Glanzmann revealed that he had already started writing new material for Evocation II, the follow up to their 2009 acoustic album, as well as some new metal songs. During their tour in South America, Anna, the hurdy-gurdy player and clean vocalist, was reported sick on 26 January 2013, and had to take a flight to Switzerland on short notice. Despite this, however, the band continued their tour without her. On 29 August 2013, it was revealed that Eluveitie had been working on a new album, and that their Helvetios World Tour will be the last of their time playing live (apart from their Eluveitie & Friends Festival) before fully working on the new album. On the 11th of December, it was revealed that Nicole Ansperger will be the successor of longtime member Meri Tadiƒá on the violin. In March 2014, Eluveitie won the Swiss Music Awards' Best Live Act National award. In April the same year, the band announced a headlining European tour, with support acts Arkona and Sk√°lm√∂ld.

They eventually started the band Cellar Darling. In July 2016 the departure of Shir-Ran Yinon was announced, claiming that her contract had expired, and Nicole Ansperger returning to the band. In September 2016, Eluveitie announced on Facebook that they started working on the second part of Evocation I: The Arcane Dominion. The album, entitled Evocation II: Pantheon, was released on 18 August 2017. = Rebirth single and Ategnatos (2017‚Äìpresent) = In January 2017, the band unveiled their new line-up, with Fabienne Erni (celtic harp, vocals). On 14 October 2017, the band announced via social media that they were working on a new album, and were to due to start recording after their Maximum Evocation tour. The band also revealed that they had recorded a single in advance of the tour, at Tommy Vetterli's New Sound Studio, entitled Rebirth.

On the band's official Instagram account, it was announced the new album is called Ategnatos. It was released on 5 April 2019.  Characteristics  Eluveitie infuses traditional Celtic folk melodies with Gothenburg-styled melodic death metal. Eluveitie uses traditional folk instruments in their music, such as fiddles, tin whistles and flutes, bagpipes and hurdy-gurdies. The traditional folk tunes in their songs have been drawn from various sources, including traditional Irish reels. While many of their lyrics are in English, some are in the ancient extinct Gaulish language. In some instances, the two languages are intertwined throughout a song. All of the lyrics on their 2009 release Evocation I: The Arcane Dominion are in Gaulish (except the first song \\"Sacrapos ‚Äì At First Glance\\"). Their lyrics are based on texts written in Gaulish such as prayers, invocations of the gods and other spirits.Transit Magazine, n¬∞47, √©t√© 2009, Eluveitie, interview of Christian Glanzmann by Dave, p. 28 Members ;Current members *Chrigel Glanzmann ‚Äì harsh vocals, mandola, whistles, pipes, gaita, acoustic guitar, bodhr√°n, harp (2002‚Äìpresent); sitar (2018‚Äìpresent) *Kay Brem ‚Äì bass (2008‚Äìpresent) *Rafael Salzmann ‚Äì lead guitar (2012‚Äìpresent) *Nicole Ansperger ‚Äì violin, backing vocals (2013‚Äì2015, 2016‚Äìpresent) *Matteo Sisti ‚Äì bagpipes, tin whistles (2014‚Äìpresent) *Jonas Wolf ‚Äì rhythm guitar (2016‚Äìpresent) *Alain Ackermann ‚Äì drums (2016‚Äìpresent) *Michalina Malisz ‚Äì hurdy-gurdy (2016‚Äìpresent) *Fabienne Erni ‚Äì clean vocals, Celtic harp (2017‚Äìpresent) ;Former members *Merlin Sutter ‚Äì drums (2004‚Äì2016) *Ivo Henzi ‚Äì rhythm guitar (2004‚Äì2016) *Anna Murphy ‚Äì hurdy-gurdy, clean vocals, occasional harsh vocals, flutes (2006‚Äì2016) *Shir-Ran Yinon - violin, backing vocals (2015‚Äì2016) *Patrick \\"P√§de\\" Kistler ‚Äì bagpipes, whistles, backing vocals (2008‚Äì2014) *Meri Tadiƒá ‚Äì violin, backing vocals (2003‚Äì2013) *Sim√©on Koch ‚Äì lead guitar, backing vocals (2004‚Äì2012) *Sevan Kirder ‚Äì bagpipes, flutes, whistles, backing vocals (2003‚Äì2008) *Rafi Kirder ‚Äì bass, backing vocals (2004‚Äì2008) *Linda Suter ‚Äì violin, backing vocals (2004‚Äì2006) *Sarah Wauquiez ‚Äì hurdy-gurdy, crumhorn, accordion, backing vocals (2005‚Äì2006, guest 2009) *Dani F√ºrer ‚Äì lead guitar (2003‚Äì2004) *Severin Binder ‚Äì bagpipes, backing vocals, flutes, whistles (2004‚Äì2005) *Philipp Reinmann ‚Äì Irish bouzouki (2003‚Äì2004) *Dide Marfurt ‚Äì hurdy-gurdy, bagpipes (2003‚Äì2005) *Gian Albertin ‚Äì bass, backing vocals, sound effects (2003‚Äì2004) *Dario Hofstetter ‚Äì drums (2003‚Äì2004) *Yves Tribelhorn ‚Äì rhythm guitar (2003‚Äì2004) *M√§ttu Ackermann ‚Äì violin (2003‚Äì2004) ;Former guest musicians *Fredy Schnyder ‚Äì hammered dulcimer (2009, 2011) *Mina the Fiddler ‚Äì 5-string viola (2009) *Oliver s.

As one of the members of the Jerusalem extreme metal scene, Arallu has \\"thrived off the seeming contradiction of its location within a 'holy' city.\\"Kahn Harris 2007, p. 115 History Arallu was created as the solo project of Moti \\"Butchered\\" Daniel, a bass guitarist who has performed live with Melechesh. The debut album The War on the Wailing Wall arrived in 2001 and featured \\"a drum machine programmed to ludicrous speed\\". In 2002, Arallu released their \\"iconoclastic\\" second album Satanic War in Jerusalem. Nir Nakav from the band Salem was responsible for the drums and the traditional Goblet drum while Daniel performed on all other instruments and vocals. The album featured a cover version of Slayer's \\"Evil Has No Boundaries\\". Daniel expanded the band's line- up after the release of this album and a DVD Visual Chaos Invasion was released in the following year. In September 2003, Daniel's brother was kidnapped and held to ransom by guerrillas from the Colombian organisation Ej√©rcito de Liberaci√≥n Nacional. Daniel was successful in negotiating for his brother's release. The year 2005 saw the release of Arallu's third album The Demon From The Ancient World with guest performers from various Israeli acts including Zeev Tananboim of Salem. Daniel returned the favor with a guest performance on Salem's chart-topping Strings Attached album. In September 2007, Arallu opened for Mayhem's concert in Tel Aviv. . Their fourth album Desert Battles - Descending to the Sands was released in 2009./> The footage from the performance was filmed and is scheduled for release in 2010 as the band's second DVD \\"The Ultimate War\\". In January 2008, Arallu was interviewed for the metal movie GLOBAL METAL by Sam Dunn. On August 28, 2009, the band was the opening act for Behemoth on their show at the Barby club in Tel Aviv, along with Arafel. In September 2011, the band went on their first European tour, playing five dates between September 9-13, 2011, in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. In October 2012, the band went on their second European tour, playing 5 dates between October 19-28 in Austria, Switzerland and Hungary Between October 22-25, the band recorded a new single, \\"Desert Genii Storm\\", in Sourmash Studio in Switzerland; it was produced by Dave Snow in May 2013 the band open for ENSLAVED at riding Tel Aviv, October 2013 the band went their third European tour playing 8 Dates between October 18- November 3 in Austria, Hungary, Switzerland and Germany. Style Arallu performs black metal with oriental influences and touches of thrash metal. Critic Roberto Marinelli describes their style as \\"reminiscent of early Venom, Sodom, and Voivod: thrashy, monochromatic, underproduced and full of ideas that far outstrip their abilities\\". Daniel has remarked in an interview that Arallu's style has to be oriental, thrashy and barbaric \\"all at once\\".

Nsrl.ttu.edu. Retrieved on 2011-09-16.

Museum.utep.edu. Retrieved on 2011-09-16. In Texas, it is commonly known as the rooter skunk for its habit of rooting and overturning rocks and debris in search of food. Description Hog-nosed skunk The distinguishing feature of the American hog-nosed skunk is it has a single, broad white stripe from the top of the head to the base of the tail, with the tail itself being completely white. It is the only skunk that lacks a white dot or medial bar between the eyes and has primarily black body fur. The snout of C. leuconotus is relatively long, with a naked nose pad, and resembles the nose of a small hog. The nose pad (20 mm wide by 25 mm long) is about three times wider than that of Mephitis mephitis. The ears are small and rounded, and the eyes are relatively small. The fur is short and coarse. A hog-nosed skunk skeleton on exhibit at the Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma The American hog-nosed skunk has stocky legs and plantigrade feet (the entire sole of the foot touches the ground). Its hind feet are broad and large with soles that are naked for about one-half their length. Its upper body is powerfully built, and the fore claws are very long.

Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History The striped skunk can broadly overlap in size with this species, but in comparison the striped, has a shorter head-and-body length and a longer tail than the hog-nosed skunk.Dohring, A. 2002. Conepatus leuconotus leuconotus. eastern hog-nosed skunk. Animal Diversity Web Males of this species average about 10% larger than females. The American hog-nosed skunk is adapted for digging, and resembles badgers rather than other species of skunks in this respect. The rectangular-shaped scapula, strong forearms, and shape of the humeri of C. leuconotus resemble those of badgers. The nostrils are located ventrally and open downward. Their sense of smell is acute, and the nose is used in locating and capturing buried prey. This skunk species also is a capable climber, although not as agile as the spotted skunks of the genus Spilogale. Reproduction C. leuconotus breeds from late February through early March; most adult females are pregnant by the end of March. Typically, gestation lasts about 60 days. Birth occurs in April and May. Half-grown young have been observed in late July and mid-August, and by late August young begin to disperse. The litter size is one to five young, although two to four are most common. Range and habitat This species occurs in canyons, stream sides, and rocky terrain. It has been collected in a variety of habitats in Mexico, including open desert-scrub and mesquite-grasslands, tropical areas, mountains, coastal plains, cornfields surrounded by brushland or adjacent to grassy plains and thickets of bull-horn acacia, thorn woodland, and riparian forests, characterized by live-oaks, pecans, sycamores, and Texas persimmons and an understory of briars, grasses, and weeds. It also has been found in pine‚Äìoak forest and in scrub and cacti. In Kleberg County, Texas, C. leuconotus occurs in mesquite-brushland, pastures, and native grassland, used exclusively for cattle ranching. Thorny brush and cactus are the predominant vegetation in the region of southern Texas where this species occurs. It is omnivorous, feeding primarily on insects and vegetation, though it will take small mammals and reptiles when available. While sometimes considered a pest by crop farmers due to their rooting habits, this is largely misplaced, as it generally prefers insects to agricultural plants. Like all skunk species, it possesses powerful anal glands used to deter would-be attackers. =Subspecies= Three subspecies are currently recognized, although one may be extinct: * C. l. leuconotus (eastern hog-nosed skunk) ‚Äì Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua * C. l. figginsi (Furnace Canyon hog-nosed skunk) ‚Äì Colorado * C. l. telmalestes (Big Thicket hog-nosed skunk)‚Ä† ‚Äì Oklahoma and southeastern Texas Conservation Although not threatened through most of its range, one subspecies, the Big Thicket hog- nosed skunk (C. l. telmalestes) of Oklahoma and southeastern Texas, is now considered extinct by the IUCN. Globally, this species is of low concern for conservation efforts, but at the local level, it is considered threatened in some states. In Colorado, for instance, it was ranked as \\"critically imperiled because of extreme rarity (five or fewer records of occurrence in the state or less than 1,000 individuals)\\" . In New Mexico and Oklahoma, it was ranked as \\"Imperiled because of rarity (six to 20 occurrences or less than 3,000 individuals)\\", also . The situation is far different in Texas and Arizona, though; the populations are high enough for the species to be legally harvested throughout the year and is designated as a \\"fur bearer\\" by the United States Forest Service.Meaney, Carron A., Anne K.

Production The film was produced by BBC Wales to tie in with the exhibition Hadrian: Empire and Conflict at the British Museum. Reception=Reviews= Sam Wollaston writing in The Guardian describes the film as, a breathless, whistle-stop tour of the Roman Empire, and complimented Snow for having, contagious bounding enthusiasm, a real passion for his subject, as well as the authority and gravitas to make you sit up and listen, but he is however critical of the cameraman‚Äôs dizzying, habit of circling presenters, and the presenter‚Äôs, prancing around in the desert, wearing a silk-scarf in the style of, The English Patient or Indiana Jones. Andrew Billen writing in The Times described the film as a, really rather good account, but described Snow as, a bit too public school for my liking, a bit keen on showing us his biceps, and, a bit too Bear Grylls with his flowing desert scarf, concluding that he was unsure, whether to be pleased or sad that Hadrian died a long and lonely death. =Ratings= Broadcast 2008-07-19: 2.2 million viewers (11% audience share). =Awards= *2009 Bafta Cymru for Best Presenter: Dan Snow (won). Synopsis Snow begins his journey at Monte Testaccio a vivid indication of the importance of Hadrian‚Äôs family olive oil business in Baetica. The Emperor Trajan was appointed guardian to the orphaned Hadrian who achieved his reputation leading the Emperor‚Äôs wars of Imperial expansion. Snow visits Trajan's Markets where Hadrian asserted his authority to rule following the death of his guardian. Reversing the expansionist policies of his predecessor Hadrian defined the Empire‚Äôs northern borders with a wall along the Danube- Rhine frontier and Hadrian's Wall, visited by Snow, in Northern England. Snow also visits the wall that defined the southern borders and the nearby city of Sbeitla in Tunisia which shows the prosperity this brought to the region. Snow sees Hadrian‚Äôs commitments to the cities of the Empire in the monumental constructions of Cyrene in Libya and Sagalassos in Greece built to enforce Roman cultural domination. Hadrian found solace is his close companionship with Antinous and his spiritual heartland of Athens, where he was initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries and built the Temple of Olympian Zeus visited by Snow, in Greece. Snow visits the remote Mons Claudianus in Egypt where Hadrian quarried the great granite columns for his most impressive monument the Pantheon. Hadrian decrees the construction of Aelia Capitolina on the ruins of Jerusalem exiling the resident Jews. Snow follows Hadrian‚Äôs tour of Egypt to the Great Pyramid at Giza and the Valley of the Kings where following the drowning of his beloved Antinous in the Nile the Emperor founded the city of Antino√∂polis and deified the young boy. Hadrian‚Äôs repressive policies in Judea resulted in the Bar Kokhba revolt which the Emperor had Julius Severus quash by besieging the guerrillas‚Äô mountain base, visited by Snow, in Israel. Snow visits the massive Villa Adriana at Tivoli where the isolated and paranoid Hadrian spent his final years on personal building projects. Hadrian constructed his own monumental mausoleum Castel Sant' Angelo, visited by Snow, where he was finally interred after rebuilding the Empire and ensuring its stability.

It is in charge of the railways in Henan Province. Before the reform of national railway bureaus in March 2005, it also controlled railways in Hubei, south Shaanxi and south Shanxi. The current director of the bureau is Zhang Junbang. History The precedent of Zhengzhou Railway Bureau was Zheng County Railway Station, founded in 1904. It was a station on the railway from Lugouqiao to Hankou. During Chinese Civil War following the end of Sino- Japanese War, Zhengzhou was occupied by the People's Liberation Army on October 22, 1948. Zhengzhou Associated Administration Commission, in charge of Longhai and Pinghan Railways in central China, was subsequently formed. In February 1949, it was renamed Central China Longhai and Pinghan Railways Associated Administration Bureau. In March of the same year, Zhengzhou Railway Management Bureau of Ministry of Railway of Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission was founded. In September 1958, Zhengzhou Railway Bureau of Ministry of Railway was founded. In the following reorganization of railway bureaus, Ministry of Railway merged Wuhan Railway Bureau and Xi'an Railway Bureau into, and separated them from Zhengzhou Bureau several times. In the reform in 2005, Wuhan and Xi'an Bureaus were again separated from Zhengzhou Bureau. Because the railway sections controlled by Zhengzhou Railway Bureau are the intersection of several major railway arteries in mainland China, Zhengzhou emerged into a railway transportation hub in China, and boasts influential status in China's railway history. During Cultural Revolution, Zhengzhou Bureau was once administrated by PLA army to ensure the normal operations. The railway administration was reorganized as a company in November 2017.

Population  The population of the municipality is 5240 inhabitants until 2006. The population density is 202.94 inhabitants per square kilometer.  History  It tells the story that in 1807 the canton Loma Lisa or Santiago belonged to the party of Chalatenango. In 1816 it emerged as the village by the name of La Laguna. From 12 June 1824 to 22 May 1835, belonged to the department of San Salvador and then to the February 14, 1855 the department of Cuscatl√°n, being annexed after this date by the Chalatenango department since its inception. On August 14, 1845 the town was burned by Honduran forces. In view of this disaster and the unhealthiness of the place, authorities and neighbors arranged to leave the primitive seat and moved to Old Village site. On July 15, 1919 was annexed to the District of Dulce Nombre de Maria, but only in administrative matters, as in the judiciary remained attached to the Court of First Instance of Tejutla and June 29, 1932 the district of Chalatenango.

With the signing of the peace accords the people reborn to be a tourist place and show its beauty. One of the most valuable men who gave this town is Don Luciano Calles who was mayor in 1972, and then served as deputy in the Legislative Assembly in 1976.

Religion  83% of the population of El Salvador is identified as Catholic, the other 17% are identified with other religions (CIA World Factbook), but in recent years the popularity of Catholicism has gone down (USBDHRL).

Craft Production  The municipality is characterized by the production of rigging, flowers and toys and whistles, tops coyotes (nose) and kites. It is noteworthy that these crafts are no longer seen in the town, however, still there are people who can develop them but having no value and demand, not compiled. There are also people who make coconut candy, sugar, dried fruit and guava. Also in the months of January to March are popular grinding mills or where sugar cane is processed and obtained at the various stages of cooking tasty products like cacha√ßa, clear, table honey, marshmallows, smoothies and sweet brown sugar, lacking cooked in honey pumpkins.

It has served as the city's public gathering place of choice since its completion in the late 1970s. The name of the square recalls the important historical role it played in Taiwan's transition from one-party rule to modern democracy in the 1990s.  Overview  Taipei Lantern Festival at Liberty Square Liberty Square serves as a major site for public gatherings in Taipei and is home to three major landmarks as well as civic parks. At the east end of Liberty Square stands the National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. The square is flanked by the National Concert Hall on the north and the National Theater on the south. A park surrounds the plaza and a wall surrounds the site. The square sits within sight of the Presidential Office Building. Liberty Square regularly serves as the site of mass gatherings in Taiwan. It is the scene for red-carpet ceremonies when Taiwan's president greets foreign dignitaries. Crowds gather at the square throughout the year for outdoor festivals and concerts. The Taipei Lantern Festival regularly takes place on the square. On many days students, athletes and soldiers may be seen at the square, working on drills and dance routines. The National Theater and Concert Hall host over 800 events every year and provide iconic backdrops for events on the square. The ponds and parks surrounding the memorial and cultural centers feature well-maintained lawns, trees, and pathways. The ponds are filled with colourful koi traditionally found in gardens in East Asia. The parks regularly play host to quieter forms of public activity, such as Go games and taekwondo, T'ai chi ch'uan and other martial arts practices. Holiday marching band and drum and bugle corps concerts, honor guard drill shows and traditional Chinese dances are also held within the grounds.  History  The square had its beginnings in the 1970s at a time when Taiwan remained under martial one-party rule by the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalists). Architect Yang Cho-cheng conceived the plaza as part of a grand design for a memorial to Chiang Kai-shek, the President of the Republic of China who relocated to Taiwan after the overthrow of the Kuomintang regime in China during the Chinese Civil War. The square first opened to the public as Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Square after Chiang's death in 1975. Architecture at the site incorporates many traditional elements and recalls earlier Kuomintang monuments erected in China. Yang's design symbolically assigned civic virtues to each area of the square. The main gate, the Gate of Integrity (), was placed at the west end on Zhongshan South Road, with the Gate of Loyalty () standing at the north side on Xinyi Road and the Gate of Piety () at the south side on Aiguo East Road. A Boulevard of Homage, bordered by manicured bushes, connects the square to the memorial hall. The square became Taipei's site of choice for mass gatherings as soon as it opened. The nature of many gatherings gave the site new historical meanings. The square became the hub of events in the 1980s and early 1990s that ushered Taiwan into its era of modern democracy. Of the many pro-democracy demonstrations that took place at the square, the most influential was the Wild Lily student movement of 1990. The movement provided the impetus for the far-reaching political reforms of President Lee Teng-hui. These culminated in the first popular elections of national leaders in 1996. The plaza's importance in the development of Taiwan's democracy led to its rededication as Liberty Square by President Chen Shui-bian in 2007.Ko Shu-ling, National Democracy Hall reopens, Taipei Times, 2 January 2008. Though the announcement of the new name was initially greeted with hostility by officials in the Pan-Blue camp, the name was eventually affirmed by officials across the political spectrum.Flora Wang, Chiang Kai- shek plaque to return to memorial hall, Taipei Times, 22 January 2009. The inscriptions over the archways, including the main gate that declares the plaza as \\"Liberty Square\\", recall the calligraphic style of Wang Xizhi in the East Jin Dynasty (see Chinese calligraphy). The style is noted for its sense of vitality, movement and freedom.

It stars Vishnuvardhan and Suhasini Maniratnam in the lead roles. The film speaks of the toll of warfare on a soldier's family. A portion of the core plot of the movie is partially based on Ernest Hemingway's novel A Farewell to Arms.https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/south- masala/Bypassing-copycats-Sandalwood-style/articleshow/21434657.cms  Background  The movie is set in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s. The protagonist is a Coorg soldier who fights in World War II and in India's wars against China.  Plot  Achappa (Vishnuvardhan) is a soldier from Madikeri who is injured while the Second World War is raging. In the hospital he meets an Army nurse (Suhasini) who is also from Coorg. After the war, both get married in Madikeri. Achappa goes back to the Army and his wife lives with her in-laws. She has Achappa's son but she becomes barren after giving birth. The son is named Viraj but Achappa hasn't seen him as he hasn't had a break from the Army. India becomes independent and partitioned. Achappa is stationed on India's border in Rajasthan. Meanwhile, Viraj is a couple of years old and Achappa longs to see him. So his wife and son travel to meet him. But then tension breaks between India and Pakistan along the border. Viraj becomes a casualty even before his father gets to see him. Achappa and Suhasini are aggrieved; she becomes an Army nurse again. Despite Suhasini's insistence, Achappa refuses to remarry for the sake of having another child. They remain faithful to each other and live like this as years pass by. Achappa becomes an Army Major, and he trains young army men in the Army Institute of Dehradun. One day Achappa's aged parents from Mercara come to live with him. They have been kept in the dark about Viraj's death and so they long to see their grandchild. When they come to know the truth, Achappa's unwell mother can't bear the shock and she dies. Meanwhile, the Indo-China War breaks out and Achappa is sent to the border with his troop. Achappa and his troop are captured by the Chinese and tortured. But Achappa remains loyal and doesn't reveal what his Chinese interrogators want. In his troop is a young, promising soldier (Ramkumar) whom Achappa treats as his son. They manage to escape into the Indian border but are mortally wounded. Achappa dies there while his prot√©g√© dies in the army hospital. Achappa's corpse has a war hero's funeral honored by the country, but Suhasini loses her sanity. Theme The title, meaning a string of pearls, stands for what Achappa promises his wife; every year he buys a pearl and gives it to her with the hope that one day she can make a necklace of it. She does get her pearl necklace complete only to have it broken at Achappa's funeral. The movie depicts how war affects a soldier's life and his family. The film opens with a scene where Hitler is shown giving a speech. The backdrop is the Second World War in which Achappa the soldier is abroad fighting. When his young son becomes a casualty in another war (in 1947, against invading Pakistan) the mother buries him in the sand dunes while vultures hover overhead. While the soldier and his wife pass by the same spot the mother runs to uncover the corpse but Achappa stops her, hence the father never gets to see his son. The film ends with the funeral of the soldier at the time of the India-China War and his wife becoming insane. Skeletons riding horseback through the darkness are shown at the start and the end of the movie. This is a metaphor for the ravages of war. The movie is not just a family saga but it depicts a larger dimension, it shows the devastating effects of war. Imperialists start the war for their own greed but ultimately it is the people who suffer. Director Rajendra Singh Babu has conveyed a strong message - stop the war.

In September 2011, LeBaron joined the law firm of Squire Patton Boggs as senior advisor. He is active in the practice areas of public policy and international business, with an emphasis on the Middle East, especially the Persian Gulf. LeBaron is the founder and CEO of GulfScape Arabia, LLC, a private consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. He is also the vice chairman of Daruna for Real Estate Brokerage & Development, a Qatar-based company focused on building migrant worker housing that meets all international standards. In October 2015, Daruna signed a $219.4 million deal to build a residential complex for 12,000 workers housed on a 150,000 square meter plot. LeBaron is also an adviser for Omnipoynt LLC, a private consulting firm with a focus on 4IR technology.  Diplomatic biography  LeBaron was sworn in as United States Ambassador to Qatar by Chief Justice Paul J. De Muniz of the Oregon Supreme Court on July 18, 2008, in a ceremony at the Simon Benson House of Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. PSU Interim President Michael J. Reardon presided over the ceremony. The event is believed to be the first time a career U.S. diplomat has been sworn in as ambassador in a public ceremony that was held in the United States outside Washington, D.C.  The State of Qatar  While in Qatar as ambassador, LeBaron introduced the doctrine and practice of \\"interagency synchronization in the field,\\" a strategic framework for embassy operations. In a report released by the Department of State's Office of the Inspector General after its routine inspection of the Embassy in April 2010, the OIG called it \\"an idea worth considering by other chiefs of mission.\\"https://oig.state.gov/system/files/154969.pdf The report described the approach in detail: \\"The Ambassador and DCM place a high priority on teamwork among the agencies and sections of the mission. Their emphasis is not just on coordination, but on working together to achieve clearly laid out goals. The primary vehicle for this priority is the Ambassador's synchronization process, which is an innovative approach to strategic planning and execution that draws on his recent experience working with the U.S. military.\\" The report went on to say that \\"the Ambassador's experience, both in the region and as a political advisor to U.S. Special Operations Command, contributes to the embassy's close and productive coordination with the military.\\" \\"The process begins with an examination of agency-specific strategic planning documents relevant to Qatar,\\" the report continued. \\"Additional guidance is obtained from Presidential policy statements, such as the June 2009 Cairo speech and the U.S. National Security Strategy.\\" \\"The Ambassador holds a semiannual interagency offsite meeting to analyze trends in Qatar and their implications for U.S. policy objectives. This meeting provides the basis for the creation of interagency synchronization groups with clearly defined goals and timelines for achieving them. The groups cover issues such as security and counterterrorism, the National Export Initiative, critical infrastructure protection, and Muslim community outreach. The groups adjust their objectives or conclude operations when their goals are achieved. All groups are chaired by the DCM and meet every two weeks or, in some cases, less frequently,\\" the report said. The report did acknowledge that some organizations within the embassy team felt the frequency of meetings distracted them from operational coordination (the report cited the frequency of meetings: \\"The Ambassador chairs a weekly country team meeting [and] he meets bi-weekly with agency heads and section chiefs.\\"), \\"but given the Ambassador's strong commitment, [the agencies and section chiefs] want to do all they can to support the process.\\" \\"This process sounds complicated at first, but it provides clarity and focus to interagency goals and is heavily results-oriented. It promotes teamwork and helps agencies and sections see how their own agendas can be reinforced through cooperation with their counterparts in the embassy. It also helps the embassy enlist the growing number of high-level visitors to advance the embassy's objectives in meetings with Qatari officials,\\" the report noted. The report concluded: \\"The process is compatible with the Mission Strategic and Resource Plan process and is an idea worth considering by other chiefs of mission for possible adaptation to their own circumstances.\\" Although the OIG report characterized LeBaron as \\"a distant figure to some of the staff,\\" it praised the efforts of his team. For example, it said \\"[the Ambassador] presides over embassy-wide gatherings, such as hail and farewell ceremonies,\\" but it recommended \\"[his] briefing sessions could be used as more formal means to solicit LE (Locally Employed) ideas. The front office and political/economic officers could also hold an off-site discussion with LE staff... [and] in addition to information sharing, an off- site would enhance report and cooperation... The OIG team made an informal recommendation to address this issue.\\" In a July 2011 interview with the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, LeBaron said, \\"for the three years that I've been Ambassador in Qatar, therefore, I have focused on establishing Embassy synchronization groups to achieve the strategic goals and objectives of the U.S. government at the planning and programmatic levels.\\" He continued, commenting on his leadership approach: \\"Ambassadors are responsible for managing and, where appropriate, deepening the relationship between two states ‚Äî across the entire range of issues, whether those issues are commercial, military, educational, political, or cultural.\\" \\"One of the biggest challenges I have faced as an Ambassador is synchronizing in the host country the programs and activities of the Executive Branch of the United States. What I've seen over the years as a professional diplomat is a tendency towards uncoordinated planning and programmatic action in the Executive Branch. That lack of synchronized planning and operations at the tactical level can confuse and mislead host countries about the nature and intent of U.S. policies in the region.\\" He said, referring to doing business in the Gulf, \\"Frequent, clear communication about your goals and your intent is key; a concise message often repeated in a variety of ways and venues. Carefully chosen themes and points, repeated so that people eventually internalize what you say. You need to have a clear sense of where you want to go and you need to communicate that direction clearly to others, identifying the shared interests that exist as you do.\\" As LeBaron was preparing to leave Qatar in July, 2011, and join the private sector, he was also asked during his Wharton interview for his recommendations to the business sector. LeBaron noted that there is a high barrier to entry to Gulf markets, particularly for small and medium-sized companies, in quite a few countries in the region. \\"Knowing the business conditions; understanding how business is done; identifying a local partner; determining how to structure one's presence in the country ‚Äî all are important and often difficult commercial steps. They are not simple and straightforward. The region can be a difficult, complex commercial operating environment, particularly for small and medium size enterprises (SME's).\\" \\"I certainly know our Commercial Office at the U.S. Embassy in Qatar does not advise small companies to begin their overseas activities with the Middle East region. There are communication problems as well,\\" he continued. \\"Once you make that decision on presence, a whole host of decisions necessarily follows: how is your business presence to be structured, for example. Will it be a branch office or a representative office? With whom, if anyone, will you partner? Does it make sense to be in a duty free zone? There are several issues that must be addressed, and these often vary by country. The one approach I would strongly advise against is coming in angling for a quick sale and moving on. That is usually the wrong way to approach the Gulf. Establishing relationships, making a commitment to doing business in the country, and staying involved in the region are extremely important. The companies that I see coming to the region usually understand this; they have a quite realistic and knowledgeable approach to the region. I find U.S. business representatives to be an impressive group.  Controversies  During his time as ambassador in Qatar, LeBaron was involved in a diplomatic incident with Turkish Ambassador Fuat Tanlay that occurred on the outskirts of a meeting between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan (an \\"altercation\\" described as a \\"yelling match\\" and a \\"violent fight\\"). In July 2015, Doha News reported that Daruna for Real Estate Brokerage and Development, where Lebaron holds a vice chairmanship, was under fire for purchasing technology to track workers. A Human Rights Watch representative criticized the purchase, saying \\"Passport confiscation, recruitment fees, sponsorship-based employment, the prohibition of trade unions, and absence of grievance mechanisms combine to a toxic effect in Qatar. The last thing we need is yet another control mechanism.\\" An Amnesty International representative said, while \\"the new technology may have some positive uses... the Qatari authorities, Daruna and the developers must ensure its application respects the rights of migrant workers, particularly the rights to privacy and freedom of movement, and does not enable businesses to tighten existing conditions of forced labor.\\"  The Islamic Republic of Mauritania  While Ambassador to Mauritania, LeBaron organized the first bilateral consultations in the then 45-year history of US-Mauritanian diplomatic relations. He also mounted extensive disaster relief for a locust invasion and helped start a long-delayed political dialogue between the Mauritanian government and opposition parties, journalists, and human rights groups. He also launched the first US-Mauritanian Business Council and helped secure the largest US aircraft sale to Mauritania ever. When a huge locust invasion struck the Trans-Sahara region in 2004, LeBaron campaigned early on for a prompt international response to meet the consequent food crisis. The U.S. Agriculture Department subsequently agreed to supply 17,000 metric tons of wheat and rice, the first Title I commodities to Mauritania in over 17 years, as well as $10 million more in Title II relief. That more than tripled the U.S. government's food aid to Mauritania.  Personal  LeBaron received a BS in sociology from Portland State University and an MA and PhD in Near Eastern Studies from Princeton University. LeBaron served in the United States Air Force during the Vietnam War. From 2006-2008, he served as the Political Advisor to the Commander, U.S. Special Operations Command, MacDill AFB, Tampa, Florida. From 2001-2003, he served as a faculty member at The George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs.U.S. Department of State: Biography of Joseph E LeBaron He is married to Elinor R.

He served in many of the early battles of the French Revolutionary Wars, and was killed in action in 1793. His name is among those inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe. Early life Dampierre was born in Paris into a military family and was commissioned as a junior officer in the Gardes Fran√ßaises 17 May 1772. He was promoted to 1st Ensign 19 January 1777 and Sous-Lieutenant 15 June 1780, but then quit the Guards because he was dissatisfied with Marshal de Biron, and transferred to the Regiment of Chartres, 6 October 1784. He then became Major of the 2nd Chasseurs of Normandy 1 May 1788. During the 1780s he travelled to England and then to Berlin, where he studied Prussian military tactics. He became an admirer of Frederick II of Prussia, imitating him even down to the smallest detail, such as to appearing at court with a long tailed coat, which earned him a mockery from Louis XVI. At the outbreak of the revolution, he was sympathetic to the new revolutionary ideas and resumed his military career, promoted Lieutenant- Colonel of the 5th Dragoons 25 July 1791, he became aide-de-camp to Rochambeau and then in April 1792 was made Colonel of the 5th dragoons under Biron. At the Battle of Qui√©vrain (30 April 1792) he was trampled by a horse whilst attempting to rally his routed troops, then, serving under Dumouriez, was promoted Marechal-de-Camp of the Army of the Ardennes. French Revolutionary Wars At the Battle of Valmy, Dampierre commanded a division of the army of Beurnonville, then commanded the right wing at the Battle of Jemappes, where his troops presented him with a coronet for his bravery. Marching at the head of the Flanders regiment and a battalion of Paris volunteers, he attacked six enemy battalions threatening Beurnonville and aiding Beurnonville's successful advance. Promoted General-de-Division on 8 March 1793, he commanded the right wing under Valence during the invasion of Holland and Flanders Campaign, and served under the Duke of Chartres at the Battle of Neerwinden on 18 March. Following Dumouriez's flight, Dampierre was elected commander of the Army of the North and the Arm√©e des Ardennes 4 April 1793, and withdrew these forces towards the Camp of Famars to re-organise. Under pressure from Paris and in an attempt to relieve besieged Cond√©, he attacked the Allies on 19 April but was repulsed after a stiff fight at St. Amand. At the Battle of Raismes on 8 May he again led his men to attack, but was repulsed once more and towards the end of the action hit in the thigh by a cannonball. He died of his wounds the next day at Valenciennes. He was buried in the main redoubt of the left at the Camp of Famars, but was reinterned at the Panth√©on by the Convention on 11 May. His body was later removed. His name is inscribed on the north side of the Arc du Triomphe.Six I p.284 References ;Sources *. *. *.

Starring long-time Alaska resident Geo Beach, the program explored the dangerous and extraordinary efforts put forth by Alaskans to perform jobs and provide services in such a remote, large, rugged, and hostile place. The program premiered on May 8, 2008 and aired one 13-episode season. The series was produced by Moore Huntley Productions, whose previous programs include several other programs about Alaska. The Principal Cinematographer was Daniel J. Lyons of Vermont Films. Format Each episode featured several related occupations in which Geo Beach joins the workers for a hands-on approach to the unique dangers of performing their job in Alaska, in a manner somewhat similar to the Discovery Channel program Dirty Jobs. The program switched back and forth between these jobs throughout each episode. Beach frequently commented on just how difficult or different life in Alaska can be, not only in the jobs themselves but also in the effort it takes just to get to where he or the fruits of his labor need to go. DVD releases The one season of the program, featuring all 13 episodes, became available on DVD on September 30, 2008.

Description The submarine is constructed of riveted iron, long, wide and deep, with a hand-cranked propeller. History No period documentation for the submarine is known to exist, and its original name and many details about it remain unknown. The submarine was rediscovered in 1878 during dredging of Bayou St. John where it joins Lake Pontchartrain in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the submarine was presumably scuttled to prevent it falling into Union hands after the capture of New Orleans (see also: New Orleans in the American Civil War). It was put on display beside the Bayou at Spanish Fort Amusement Park as a curiosity, incorrectly identified as the Confederate submarine Pioneer. The traditional identification as the Pioneer was not questioned seriously until historical research in the late 20th century showed the Pioneer to be of a different design than the one retrieved from Bayou St. John. The Bayou submarine and the Pioneer may have undergone trials at about the same time, and confusion of the two may date back to contemporary accounts; it is not clear which one was constructed first. In 1908 the submarine was moved to the grounds of Camp Nicholls Confederate Home on Moss Street, beside Bayou St. John. About this time, the interior of the submarine was filled with concrete in an attempt at preservation that later generations of conservators found questionable. In 1942 the submarine was acquired by the Louisiana State Museum and moved to Jackson Square. After being in various displays around the Square it was placed in the shelter of the arcade on the ground floor of the Presbytere in 1957, where it would remain until 1999. In 1999 the submarine was transported to Baton Rouge, where the old concrete was removed as part of major restoration work. Afterwards, the submarine was placed on display at the Capitol Park Museum - Baton Rouge.

Sh≈ç Shin's long reign has been described as \\"the Great Days of Ch≈´zan\\", a period of great peace and relative prosperity. He was the son of Sh≈ç En, the founder of the dynasty, by Yosoidon, Sh≈ç En's second wife, often referred to as the queen mother. He succeeded his uncle, Sh≈ç Sen'i, who was forced to abdicate in his favor. Reign Much of the foundational organization of the kingdom's administration and economy is traced back to developments which occurred during Sh≈ç Shin's reign. As government became more institutionalized and organized, the aji (ÊåâÂè∏, local lords) gradually lost power and independence, becoming more closely tied to the central government at Shuri. In order to strengthen central control over the kingdom, and to prevent insurrection on the part of the aji, Sh≈ç Shin gathered weapons from all the aji to be put to use for the defense of the kingdom, and ordered aji to make their residences in Shuri; lords separated from their lands and from their people were far less able to act independently or to organize rebellion, and, over time, their emotional connections to Shuri grew, those with their territory weakening. The residences at Shuri of the aji were divided into three districts ‚Äì one each for those coming from the northern, central, and southern areas of Okinawa Island which had formerly been the independent kingdoms of Hokuzan, Ch≈´zan, and Nanzan respectively. These regions were now renamed Kunigami, Nakagami, and Shimajiri, respectively, place names which remain in use today. Through intermarriage, residence in Shuri, and other factors, the aji came to be more integrated as a class, more closely associated with life and customs and politics at Shuri, and less attached to their ancestral territorial identities. The aji left deputies, called aji okite (ÊåâÂè∏Êéü), to administer their lands on their behalf, and some years later a system of jito dai (Âú∞È†≠‰ª£), agents sent by the central government to oversee the outlying territories, was established. Some aji of the northern regions were allowed to remain there, not moving to Shuri, as they were too powerful for the king to force their obedience in this matter; the king's third son was made Warden of the North, however, and granted authority to maintain peace and order in the region.Kerr. pp105-8. The Shuri dialect of the Okinawan language used by administrators and bureaucrats became standardized at this time, and a golden age of poetry and literature blossomed. The first volumes of the Omoro S≈çshi, a collection of poems, songs, and chants reflecting centuries-old oral tradition as well as contemporary events, were completed in 1532.Kerr. p111. Along with later volumes, the Omoro S≈çshi would become one of the chief primary sources for modern-day historians studying the kingdom's history. The process of moving the aji to Shuri also brought about major changes to the city, including the construction of a great many grand gates, pavilions, lakes, bridges, monuments, and gardens. There came to be a great demand for masons, carpenters, and others, as well as for a wide variety of goods and materials, imported by each aji from his own territories. Okinawa Island quickly became more economically integrated, with goods and labor traveling to and from Shuri and the neighboring port city of Naha.Kerr. p108. Economic integration allowed territories to become more specialized, and the production of luxury goods expanded significantly. Various kinds of hairpins and other ornaments became standard elements of the fashions of courtiers and bureaucrats, new techniques in producing and weaving silk were imported, and the use of gold, silver, lacquer, and silk became more common among townspeople.Kerr. p108. Urbanization led to increased prosperity for merchants, traders, courtiers, townsmen and others, though historian George H. Kerr points out that farmers and fishermen, who made up the vast majority of the Okinawan population, remained quite poor.Kerr. p105. Many monuments, temples, and other structures were also erected during the prosperous reign of Sh≈ç Shin. A new palace building was constructed, in Chinese style, and court rituals and ceremonies were dramatically altered and expanded, in emulation of Chinese modes. A pair of tall stone \\"Dragon Pillars\\" were placed at the entrance to the palace, patterned not after Chinese, Korean or Japanese models, but after those of Thailand and Cambodia, reflecting, as Kerr points out, the reach and extent of Okinawan trade and the cosmopolitan nature of the capital at this time.Kerr. p109. The Buddhist temple Enkaku-ji was built in 1492, S≈çgen-ji was expanded in 1496, and in 1501, Tamaudun, the royal mausoleum complex, was completed. Sh≈ç Shin successfully petitioned the Korean royal court, several times, to send volumes of Buddhist texts;Kerr. p112. the first metal movable type printing presses in the world had been invented in Korea in the 13th century. In the thirtieth year of his reign, a stele was erected in the grounds of Shuri Castle, listing Eleven Distinctions of the Age enumerated by court officials. A reproduction of this stele, destroyed in the 1945 Battle of Okinawa along with the castle, stands in the castle grounds today. The reign of Sh≈ç Shin also saw the expansion of the kingdom's control over several of the outlying Ryukyu Islands. Okinawan ships began in the late 15th century to frequent Miyakojima and the Yaeyama Islands; following a series of disputes among the local lords in the Yaeyama Islands which broke out in 1486, Sh≈ç Shin in 1500 sent military forces to quell the disputes and establish control over the islands. Kumejima was brought under firm control of Shuri, and liaison offices were established in Miyako and Yaeyama, in 1500 and 1524 respectively.Kerr. p115. Sh≈ç Shin also effected significant changes to the organization of the native noro (Â∑´Â•≥, village priestesses) cult and its relationship to the government. He owed his uncle's abdication, and his own succession to his sister, the noro of the royal family, a special position known as the kikoe-≈çgimi. He established a new residence for the kikoe-≈çgimi (ËÅûÂæóÂ§ßÂêõ) just outside the gates to the castle, and erected high walls in 1519 around the Sonohyan Utaki, the sacred space and accompanying sacred hearth which she tended. A system by which the king and kikoe-≈çgimi appointed local noro across the kingdom was established, tying this element of the native Ryukyuan religion into formal systems of authority under the government.Kerr. p111. After a fifty-year reign, Sh≈ç Shin died in 1526, and was succeeded by his son Sh≈ç Sei. It is said that after such a long reign, officials encountered difficulties in determining the proper way to conduct the royal funeral, succession rituals, and other important related ceremonies.Kerr. p115.

Her career was without major incident, and she returned home safely after the war with two battle stars to her credit. Launched in Washington Satinleaf was laid down as YN-62 on 5 July 1943 by Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company, Everett, Washington; reclassified AN-43 on 20 January 1944; launched on 15 February 1944; and commissioned on 8 April 1944, Lt. Arthur B. Church in command. World War II service = Pacific Ocean operations= Satinleaf arrived at San Pedro, California, on 9 May 1944 for shakedown, and sailed from there on 13 June 1944 to join the Service Force, U.S. 7th Fleet, at Funafuti, traveling via Pearl Harbor. On 27 July, she departed Funafuti towing an Army barge which she delivered to Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 6 August. She was employed there as a harbor defense and general utility vessel until 1 October, departing the harbor only to deliver a barge to Manus between 18 and 25 September. =Supporting invasion of the Philippines= On 1 October, the ship sailed for Brisbane, Australia, where she loaded sonar buoy equipment for use in the forthcoming assault at Leyte Gulf. Picking up personnel for the buoy unit at Milne Bay on 15 October, she arrived at Leyte on 29 October, shortly after the landings. The ship began laying the sonar buoys on 5 November 1944, and guarded them until 17 January 1945, providing protection to ships anchored off Leyte. On 20 January, she became Harbor Entry Control Vessel and performed that duty until 12 March. Then, for the next month, she was employed in general utility work in San Pedro and Guiuan Roadstead and assisted part-time with the Guiuan Roadtead net defenses. =Supporting Tarakan landings= On 15 April 1945, Satinleaf was assigned to the Amphibious Forces, 7th Fleet, and sailed a week later with navigation buoys for the Tarakan landings. Arriving off Tarakan, Borneo, on 27 April, she laid navigation buoys to guide the assault ships along the cleared channel. This mission was completed on 30 April, and the ship sailed on 8 May for Morotai where she staged for the Brunei landings. Arriving off Brunei, Borneo, on 7 June, she once again laid navigation buoys in the channel; and, after completion of this duty on 9 June, she remained in the area providing general utility services until departing for Leyte Gulf on 25 June. She helped install net defenses in Guiuan Roadstead until sailing to Manus on 12 July for overhaul. =End-of-war operations= Returning to Guiuan Roadstead on 30 August, after the Japanese surrender, Satinleaf helped remove net defenses in the Leyte Gulf area until sailing for the United States on 27 November 1945 via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor. She arrived at San Pedro, California, on 4 January 1946 and moved to Tiburon, California, on 13 February to begin inactivation. Post-war decommissioning She was decommissioned on 4 April 1946 and struck from the Navy list on 8 May 1946. The ship was transferred to the U.S. Maritime Commission as of 7 May 1947 and delivered to her purchaser, E. E. Johnson, on 29 April 1947. Vessel was later sold to Foundation Maritime, Limited of Halifax, Nova Scotia and converted to a Salvage/Rescue tug \\"Foundation Josephine II\\" In 1960 Foundation sold her to become the research vessel \\"North Star IV\\" foundered during a hydro-graphic expedition in 1961.

Its source is Borer's Creek. A very picturesque waterfall featured on many Hamilton waterfall postcards over the years. Named after the Borer family who ran a sawmill for over a century. This mill was the lifeblood of the village of Rock Chapel. Also known as Rock Chapel Falls. The area is a hiker's haven and also an ice- climbing destination in the winter when the weather is cold enough to freeze the Falls. Nearby attractions include the Bruce Trail, Cootes Paradise, Borer's Falls, Borer's Falls Conservation Area, the Spencer Gorge / Webster's Falls Conservation Area, Rock Chapel Sanctuary and Royal Botanical Gardens, who own the lands around the falls. There are also many other waterfalls in the area. Lower Borer's Falls is a complex curtain/ cascade waterfall, 3 metres in height and 5 metres wide and a 10-minute walking distance south of Borer's Falls. Difficult to access. Good pair of hiking boots recommended to access by foot. Directions Borer's Falls can be accessed from the Dundas section of the Bruce Trail and also from the Borer's Falls Conservation Area. By car take the QEW west to Highway 403, which you will follow to Highway 6 in Flamborough and go north. Go left on Highway 5 (Dundas Street), and left on Rock Chapel Road. Hazards The Bruce Trail passes by the edge of Borer's Falls and presents a hazard to people with young children, as there is a poorly marked high vertical drop inches from what appears to be the trail; unless one reads a small sign directing you to walk on the road.

Born in (Switzerland in 1910; Asuncion and he died in Asuncion on February 7, 2002) First Steps  Lil√≠ del M√≥nico 1948 began taking painting lessons in oil painting at Lausanne (Switzerland) with Professor David Burner and in Asuncion with Jaime Bestard . At the beginning of the decade of 1950 she held her first solo exhibition in the Paraguayan American Cultural Center (CCPA) in 1952 and participated in the Women's Hall of Fine Arts at the Union Club, both institutions of the Paraguayan capital.  Trajectory  The year 1954 was crucial to work out the later Paraguayan visual arts. Lil√≠ del M√≥nico performed with the New Art Group the first Art Exhibition of Modern Art in Asuncion in the windows of stores and shops on the street Palma, the main avenue of the capital down town. That same year, the group formed by Josefina Pl√°, Jose Parodi Laterza and Olga Blinder presented an exposition in Buenos Aires in the Argentine Society of Plastic Artists. This artist had since the beginning of her career intense participation in the cultural life of Paraguay. In 1960 she took part in several group exhibitions in Asuncion. In 1967 she made her second individual sample in the Kennedy Gallery. In 1968 he won the Gold Medal at the exhibition organized by the Society of Horticulture & Garden of Asuncion. Also, in the years 1972, 1974, 1980 she organized solo exhibitions in the Paraguayan American Cultural Center. In 1975 she participated in the sample group \\"Women in Paraguayan plastic.\\" In 1976 she exhibited in the Colonial Bookshop Gallery in Punta del Este, Uruguay. In 1980 she showed her oil paintings in an exhibit at the same individual Uruguayan seaside resort. In 1988 Lil√≠ del M√≥nico exhibited in the Factory Gallery and made a show of paintings at the Gallery of Art-sans of Asuncion. She also could show her work in her homeland. So she took some pictures in which she focused on the female body to her country.  \\"Consistency internal\\"  In the catalog for the presentation ‚ÄúArt-Sans‚Äù her colleague from the movement \\"Arte Nuevo‚Äù and friend Olga Blinder wrote:\\" Lil√¨ was looking for her way and her findings were not accidental. The force is always constant inside her and, although her production is not constant and is governed by a line or technical issue, the strength of her paintings rely on their authenticity, which makes her paint the way she speaks and acts in her daily life.

The event was broadcast from taped footage on the night of Wednesday, August 28, the third day of the convention. Demonstrators took up the chant as police were beating and pulling many of them into police vans, \\"each with a superfluous whack of a nightstick,\\" after the demonstrators, being barricaded in the park by the police, began to come into Michigan Avenue in front of the hotel. The prescient and apparently spontaneous chant quickly became famous. The following year, it served as the title of a television movie about student activism. Chicago Transit Authority On track 10 of their 1969 hit debut record album the rock band Chicago, then known as Chicago Transit Authority, used what may be a copy of the real audio clip of the crowd chanting, \\"The whole world is watching.\\" The track called, \\"Prologue, August 29, 1968\\" is 57 seconds long. The chant continues into the next song, track eleven, \\"Someday (August 29, 1968)\\" but fades away after a few seconds, only to return again in the middle of the song. In their 2008 release, Chicago reprised the chant in the third track, \\"All the Years\\". At about two and a half minutes into the track, the chant is played after a montage of other notable historical clips and concurrently with a harmonica solo. Current usage Today, the phrase is regularly used in mainstream left movements such as the 2003 demonstrations against the Iraq War. It is the title of a 1980 book about mass media and the New Left by former student activist Todd Gitlin. Rightist commentators have also used the phrase to argue for such causes as U.S. condemnation of Islamic violence. The phrase is a poster tagline for the 2007 film Battle in Seattle and it is repeatedly chanted in the film. President Barack Obama used the phrase during demonstrations in Tehran over the outcome of Iranian elections in June, 2009.Obama to Iran: 'The whole world is watching', CNN.com, June 20, 2009. Retrieved March 31 2010. During the 2011 Wisconsin protests, protesters in Madison, WI chanted the phrase often in reference to the large national media presence and worldwide positive response.From Cairo to Madison, some pizza, Politico.com, February 20, 2011. Retrieved December 1, 2011. Protesters also chanted the phrase while being arrested and removed from the Capitol the morning of the first vote on the law they were protesting. Occupy Wall Street protesters chanted the phrase on October 1, 2011, when NYPD barricaded and arrested citizens who were blocking the roadway on the Brooklyn Bridge in one of the largest mass-arrests of otherwise nonviolent demonstrators in US history. \\"The Whole World Is Watching\\" was on a banner purposely blocking the view of ropes being tied to the statue of Silent Sam in 2018, minutes before the statue was pulled down. Origin The origin of the phrase is unclear. The phrase was used in the late 1950s regarding international coverage of U.S. Civil Rights events, such as the Little Rock integration crisis.An editorial cartoon from the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on September 11, 1957 is reprinted in Dudziak, Mary L., Cold War Civil Rights: Race and Image of American Democracy, Princeton University Press, 2000, p. 122. The 1963 Bob Dylan song \\"When the Ship Comes In\\" contains the lyric \\"And the ship's wise men / Will remind you once again / That the whole wide world is watchin'.\\" Peter, Paul and Mary, who performed for the demonstrators during the convention, covered Dylan's song on their 1965 album A Song Will Rise. Don Rose, who was press secretary for the Chicago office of the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, the primary organizer of the Chicago actions, has said in several interviews that he coined the phrase prior to a press conference on Monday, August 26, at which Mobe organizer Rennie Davis spoke. Davis asked Rose what they could say about the violence of the Chicago police the night before in Lincoln Park and Rose said, \\"tell them the whole world is watching and they'll never get away with it again.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * 1968 United States presidential election American political catchphrases Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War 1968 Democratic National Convention ","title":"The whole world is watching"},{"id":"18584056","text":"Mugam (also, Mugamlu) is a town in the Armavir Province of Armenia.

SOHO20 was one of the first galleries in Manhattan to showcase the work of an all-woman membership and most of the members joined the organization as emerging artists. These artists were provided with exhibition opportunities that they could not find elsewhere. 1973‚Äî1981 SOHO20 was founded by two artists, Joan Glueckman and Mary Ann Gillies, who modeled SOHO20 after A.I.R. Gallery (est. 1972), the first all-women cooperative art gallery in New York City. While attending a meeting of Women Artists in Revolution (WAR) in late 1972, Glueckman and Gillies met Agnes Denes, who told them about A.I.R. Gallery and encouraged them to establish another all-women cooperative exhibition venue, citing \\"much need for women's galleries.\\" Marilyn Raymond, a businesswoman and friend of Glueckman's, handled the business matters while Glueckman and Gillies looked for artists to join the gallery. A cooperative structure was chosen for financial reasons. The name of the gallery was derived from its location at 99 Spring Street in the Manhattan neighborhood of Soho (formatted entirely in uppercase as SOHO) and an anticipated 20 artist-members. According to the original press release, \\"In keeping with the feminist ideal of women defining themselves, the criterion for membership is professional excellence without restriction of style, medium, or theme.\\" From the outset, the artist- members reflected a diversity of styles, subjects, and mediums. In addition to Glueckman and Gillies, the original members were Elena Borstein, Barbara Coleman, Maureen Connor, Eunice Golden, Marge Helenchild, Cynthia Mailman, Marion Ranyak, Rachel Rolon de Clet, Halina Rusak, Lucy Sallick, Morgan Sanders, Rosalind Shaffer, Sylvia Sleigh, Eileen Spikol, May Stevens, Suzanne Weisberg, and Sharon Wybrants. In order to give every member an opportunity to exhibit, the gallery initially held two concurrent solo shows at a time. The premiere exhibitions in October 1973 featured works by Sylvia Sleigh, who exhibited The Turkish Bath (1973) and several other paintings, and Maureen Connor, who showed a group of giant \\"breathing flowers\\" that alternately inflated and deflated. After the 1973‚Äì74 exhibition season, Sleigh, Helenchild, Stevens, and Weisberg left the gallery. Shirley Gorelick, Kate Resek, and Susan Hoeltzel became members in 1974; Vernita Nemec, C.R. Peck, Diane Churchill, and Noreen Bumby joined SOHO20 in 1975, following the departures of several other artists. In 1975, SOHO20 began to hold annual group exhibitions in addition to solo shows by member-artists. Showing Off opened the 1975‚Äì76 exhibition season. The art critic John Perreault responded positively to Showing Off, saying that most group shows \\"are the bane of reviewers\\" but this was \\"a fine show far above the level of most such things.\\" In the 1975‚Äì76 season, the artists of SOHO20 also arranged their first exchange exhibition with Hera (est. 1974), an all-women cooperative gallery in Wakefield, Rhode Island. The galleries exchanged group shows in an effort to expose viewers to the breadth of women's work. Invitational exhibitions, which tended to reflect a diversity similar to that of the gallery's member-artists, were likewise introduced in 1975 as a \\"community service\\" that gave viewers \\"a broad new look at new talent.\\" 1982‚Äî1996 In 1982, SOHO20 moved to a new space at 469 Broome Street, another location in Soho. The gallery obtained legal, non-profit 501(c)3 status in 1989, which made it possible for SOHO20 to receive funding from the New York State Council on the Arts for two multi-year exhibition series, Ageless Perceptions and Emerging Women Artists. Drawing attention to the work of mature women, each Ageless Perceptions exhibition highlighted several artists, including Lil Picard, Esther Gentle, Dorothy Dehner, Sari Dienes, and Jane Teller. Also added to the schedule were guest- curated exhibitions, such as New Visions (1986-87), a show of works by four artists who had no gallery affiliation, including Lorna Simpson. During the 1980s, favorable reviews of artist-members were featured in The New York Times and mainstream art periodicals. A group of sublime drawings by Eve Ingalls, inspired by summers spent in the Idaho wilderness, were recognized for their combination of calligraphic, east Asian art forms and an empirical sensibility. Martha Edelheit's miniature sculpted \\"fliers,\\" frozen in daring acrobatic poses, were praised for their \\"feeling of power tempered by sensuous grace.\\" In her paintings of fields in upstate New York and Nova Scotia, Marion Ranyak's artistic touch was described as being \\"delicate as a bird\\" while the light in her works was \\"always at that point of gray heat that sets everything in a landscape in motion.\\" Nancy Azara, Harriet Mishkin, and Linda Cunningham were also reviewed positively. At the time, SOHO20 also placed greater emphasis on exhibitions that exposed relevant social and political issues. In 1985, Private Gone Public attempted to reveal how artists \\"formulate a private view of life, environment, the world, into a comprehensible visual symbology.\\" The exhibition included works by May Stevens, Howardena Pindell, Sue Coe, Erika Rothenberg, Nancy Spero, and Bonnie Lucas‚Äî\\"six 'gut issue' artists,\\" as described by Grace Glueck in The New York Times. In 1989, South African Mail: Messages from Inside consisted of more than 400 works by 200 artists from South Africa, conceived as a form of resistance against apartheid. The exhibition was curated by Janet Goldner with funding from the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid. An exhibition in 1990, curated by Faith Ringgold, was made as a tribute to the civil rights workers killed in Mississippi in 1964, and featured works by six African-American women artists, including Beverly Buchanan, Joyce J. Scott, and Clarissa Sligh. SOHO20 was also among the many arts organizations that responded to concerns over censorship and attempts to defund the National Endowment for the Arts in 1989, which followed the widely publicized controversies around exhibitions of works by Andres Serrano and Robert Mapplethorpe. Blacklisted/Whitewashed/Red Handed (1990) addressed issues of censorship, funding restrictions, and 1st Amendment rights through the works of SOHO20 artists and artist-interns from Washington Irving High School. Also in 1990, SOHO20 partnered with the Organization of Pan Asian American Women to present an art auction of works by Asian artists to benefit the New York Asian Women's Center (now known as Womankind), which serves the survivors of human trafficking, sexual and domestic violence, and later-in-life abuse. In 1994, SOHO20 hosted an invitational exhibition called Effect or Infect: Art and Ecology, which addressed the state of world ecology. 1996‚Äî2015 In 1996, SOHO20 moved to a third location at 545 Broadway, and then relocated for the fourth time to 511 West 25th Street in Chelsea in 2001. SOHO20 also began to invite literary artists for readings, and hosted events led by the organization Artists Talk on Art between 2003 and 2010. In 2007, the gallery organized an all-media juried exhibition, Adam's Rib, Eve's Air in Her Hair, which explored the many manifestations of Eve, including Lilith, to whom the second part of the exhibition title refers. SOHO20 hosted its first all-woman video show in 2008, followed by various film screenings. In late 2009, the gallery relocated to its fifth location on West 27th Street. An exhibition of talks and dialogues called INTERNATIONAL FOCUS-Women in Crisis (2010) dealt with human rights issues such as sex trafficking, child soldiers, and genital mutilation; it later continued under the name CONVERSATIONS, with experts speaking on a variety of topics including \\"Voices of Muslim Women.\\" The series continued with \\"What‚Äôs Old is New Again: The Legacy of the Feminist Art Movement of the 70s\\" (2010) and \\"Louise Nevelson: Empress of Environmental Sculpture\\" (2013). Another project, \\"Savoir-Faire,\\" began in 2009 as a platform for women performance artists to realize projects that had not been seen previously. Implemented around the same time were the Artist Studio Residency Program and \\"SIGHT unSEEN,\\" an ongoing series of gallery tours through the Chelsea arts district, led by guest curators, writers, and artists. 2015‚Äîpresent After 42 years in Manhattan, SOHO20 relocated to the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick in August 2015; its informal, site-specific name‚ÄîSOHO20 Chelsea‚Äîreverted to SOHO20 Gallery.

For example, when one measures a point that is 1 meter away at 45 degrees, an angular error of 1 degree corresponds to a positional error of over 1.745 cm, equivalent to a distance- measurement error of 1.745%. In machine design, some components are particularly sensitive to angular errors. For example, slight deviations from parallelism of the spindle axis of a lathe to the tool motion along the bed of the machine can lead to relatively large (undesired) taper along the part (i.e a non-cylindrical part). Vernier calipers are not free from abbe error, while screw gauges are free from abbe error. Abbe error is the product of the abbe offset and the sine of angular error in the system.

It is also referred to as \\"Granville's Castle\\", after Richard I de Grenville (or Granville or Glanville; died post 1142), Lord of Neath, who has also been credited with its construction. The town of Neath takes its Welsh name, \\"Castell-nedd\\", from the castle. History The first castle in Neath was located west of the river near the Roman fort of Nidum, and was a timber fortification in a motte and bailey structure. When Richard de Grenville founded Neath Abbey close by, he abandoned this original castle, and it may have been used by the monks as a source of building material.Neath Castle from The Cistercian Way A second castle on the opposite bank of the river, in what is now the centre of the town, is first documented in 1183; shortly afterwards, William de Cogan, son of Miles de Cogan, was appointed constable. This second castle was built by Gilbert de Clare, 5th Earl of Gloucester. During the 13th century, being a Norman stronghold, it was subject to attack by the Welsh, notably by Llywelyn the Great, who captured it in 1231 with help from a local Welsh lord, Morgan Gam. Following this, it was substantially rebuilt by Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester, Gilbert's son. It was taken again, and this time destroyed, by Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford, in 1321, during the rebellion against King Edward II of England. Its owner, Hugh Despenser the Younger (who had gained the lordship through his marriage to the heiress Eleanor de Clare), rebuilt it, possibly with the addition of a gatehouse. In 1376, one Roger Kyngot was the constable, and the castle was rebuilt in stone in 1377; that is probably when the great gatehouse was built, which is the main surviving feature. The castle was in use until the 17th century, and has been a recreational area for the town since the 18th century.. . Cadw SAM: GM039: Neath Castle The post of \\"Constable of Neath Castle\\", a medieval legacy, was held by Sir Humphrey Mackworth from 1703. The title was eventually absorbed into that of Mayor of Neath. What remains of the castle is designated a Grade II* listed building.

Habitat Occurs in various habitats, including open woodland, forests, mountains, fields, in farming areas with nearby streams, ponds, and other water sources. It can also be found in human habitations Feeding Hunts for rodents and other vertebrates in open areas, especially in sugar cane fields and, sometimes near human habitations. Reproduction Both oviparous and ovoviviparous. Depending on environmental condition, females will either deposit their eggs, or retain them to incubate internally and give birth later to live young. Venom The venom of Ovophis okinavensis, like that of most vipers, is mainly hemotoxin with cytotoxicity factors. People are bitten when they step on this sluggish snake at night, or when tending crops by day. Although venom from this snake is not life-threatening usually, people still should seek medical attention promptly if they are bitten. Because of its relatively weak venom, antivenom is not produced. ReferencesFurther reading * Boulenger, G.A. 1892. Descriptions of new Reptiles and Batrachians from the Loo Choo Islands.

They are the largest ethnic group of Guinea-Bissau, representing more than one-quarter of the population. Despite their numbers, they have remained outside the colonial and postcolonial state because of their social organisation. The Balanta can be divided into four subgroups: Balanta Nhacra, Balanta Ganja, Balanta Mane, and Balanta Kentohe, the largest of which are the Balanta Kentohe. Archaeologists believe that the people who became the Balanta migrated to present-day Guinea-Bissau in small groups between the 10th and 14th centuries CE. Oral tradition amongst the Balanta has it that they migrated westward from the area that is now Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia to escape drought and wars. During the 19th century, they spread throughout the area that is now Guinea-Bissau and southern Senegal in order to resist the expansion of the Kaabu kingdom. Today, the Balanta are found in the modern-day countries of Senegal and Gambia but mostly reside in the southern and central regions of Guinea-Bissau. Culture All important decisions amongst the Balanta are taken by a Council of Elders. To become a member of the Council of Elders, the person has to be initiated during the Fanado ceremony. In general, egalitarianism prevails amongst the Balanta. Consequently, the Portuguese colonialists found it difficult to govern them. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Portugal mounted pacification campaigns against the resistant Balanta and subjected them to appointed Fulbe chiefs. Because of the Portuguese repression, the Balanta enlisted as soldiers in great numbers and were principal supporters of the PAIGC in the nationalist struggle for liberation during the 1960s and 1970s. Many Balanta resented their exclusion from the government; their prominence in the military spurred a series of Balanta-led coup attempts in the 1980s. =Religion= The Balanta practice indigenous, spiritual customs and rites. In the Balanta society, God is believed to be far away, and communication with the Almighty is established through their spiritual practices and traditions. Although Catholicism has been partially accepted, Islam is strong and practiced along with their unique spirit worship. =Music= The Balanta play a gourd lute instrument called a kusunde. On the kusunde instrument, the short string is at the bottom rather than at the top, the top string was of middle length and the middle string is the longest although it was capoed by the middle length string and its open sounding length is therefore the same as that string. The tones produced by the instrument are in all: top string open F#, top string stopped G#, middle string open C#, middle string stopped D#, bottom drone string A#/B. The Balanta kusunde is similar to the Jola akonting. The Balanta also play the balafon, which is composed of 24 layers instead of 12 or 14 found in the Mandingue community. =Marriage= In People Like Me 2002: Face to Face!, the Sunugal Ballet presented the Balanta wedding dance from the village of Mini-Ndame. In this village, when the prince comes of age to marry, the kingdom has a big party, to which every family brings their daughters. The young women compete with their beauty and their virtuosic dancing for the hand of the prince. The prince then chooses his bride, and a celebration ensues. To prove his courage to his future wife, a Balanta man must steal a cow. The masks that are used in this dance include a large spirit mask laden with cowry shells, an old woman mask, a young girl mask, and a young man mask. As symbols of family and spiritual connection, the masks play an important role when the community comes together to celebrate with music and dance. =Farming= The Balanta are fishermen, herders, and cultivators. They grow millet, rice, peanuts, cashews, and fruit for a cash crop. Their specialty is the culture of cashew which they derive from the apple wine cashew called Cadjou. The export to India of cashew nuts also provides an important economic force in the Balanta villages. Raising cattle is also a traditional activity predominant as the sacrifice of the cattle is import in all stages of life (initiation, marriage, death, etc.) The back of Guinea- Bissau's 50-peso note (No. 1) shows two farmers wielding an agricultural tool that is called a kebinde in the Balanta language (also called an arade in Guinean Creole). These tools are used by the Balanta, Jola and Papel peoples to prepare the soil for planting crops ‚Äì usually rice. Use of the kebinde is an art that has been perfected over many years by the Balanta people who deservedly hold a reputation as expert farmers. Along with intricate irrigation systems that mix salt and fresh water, they manage to maintain the nutrients in the soil and achieve excellent yields. After the harvest, the Balanta people have a celebration called the Kussund√©, where non-initiated men compete in dances. =Rites of passage= The Balanta have initiation rites at various states of the individual's life. Each phase of life, from childhood to adulthood, is regulated by an initiation that marks the entrance into a new social category. From early childhood up to age 15, the child belongs to the category of Nwatch. Around age 18 to 20 the individual enters the Fuur and then enters the Nghaye around age 25. Around age 30, according to the rites of Kgness a man will be authorized to take a woman. After the young Balanta man has become a landowner and taken on family responsibilities, he can then be chosen by his maternal uncle to participate in the Fanado initiation. Once chosen for the Fanado, a Balanta man cannot refuse the family's wishes. The Fanado initiation ceremony takes place once every four years. The Fanado is a two-month process in the ‚Äúsacred woods‚Äù which is the ultimate phase of initiation rites and social hierarchy. Initiation during the Fanado ritual opens the doors of maturity and wisdom in the Balanta community. Depicted on the back of the 50-peso note (No. 1) is a man in the costume worn by young Balanta men during the ‚ÄúFanado‚Äù or male circumcision ceremony. Part of the costume is a tortoise shell that is hollowed out and worn on the back. The first day of the Fanado ceremony is a general festival for the entire village during which people eat, drink and dance. The initiates are presented to the village by their maternal uncles and greeted by the village. After the presentation and greeting, the initiates are brought in the middle of a tropical forest to a place completely secret called the ‚Äúsacred woods.‚Äù In the ‚Äúsacred woods‚Äù the initiates are circumcised by the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù, a sort of magical figure-pedagogical. After the first few days of circumcision, the initiates must build a kind of hut that will serve as their home-base for the next two months. During these two months, the initiates only have contact with their uncles and the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù. The initiates undergo test of endurance and learn to be men. What is imparted to the initiates during the Fanado not only concerns their entire culture, but also how to behave with others, how to manage the family, and how to live as adults and men therefore wise. The tests and trials are hard to the point where some people face physical suffering, mutilation, and/or do not survive. Once completed, the initiate is a mature man, capable of taking care of other people in the tribe. After two months in the ‚Äúsacred woods,‚Äù the initiate (if survived) is ready to return to his family as a new man. Nothing remains of the place where the rite was held, everything is burnt and jealously guarded in secret by those who took part. Mothers learn of the fate of their children only on arrival to the village of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù men. The most valiant initiates that do survive emerge from the ‚Äúsacred woods‚Äù to songs of their bravery by family and friends. The initiate then wears a bright red hat to show that he has become Lante Ndang (brave and wise), and the following day he will be allowed to serve on the council of elders who manages village life. The ex-president of Guinea-Bissau Kumba Yalla is a member of the Balanta people and was often seen wearing a red hat as a sign that he had completed the Fanado initiation.

It serves urban Indianapolis and the greater Indianapolis metropolitan area as a school for children from pre-kindergarten to eighth grade. It is the only Episcopal elementary day school in the state. History St. Richard's School was founded in 1960 by the Rev. G. Ernest Lynch, rector of Trinity Episcopal Church. He envisioned a unique elementary school linked with the church that would stress academic excellence and traditional values, but also diversity of its student body. According to the school's website , \\"St. Richard‚Äôs School was the first private school in Indianapolis to open its doors to all races, creeds, and nationalities.\\" The school's namesake comes from St. Richard of Wych, Bishop of Chichester from the 13th Century. The official school song's lyrics come from St. Richard's famous prayer, \\"Day by Day\\". Its mission is \\"We foster knowledge and values for a lifetime through the implementation of our Five Pillars for Success: Faith, Classical Curriculum, Leadership, Civic Responsibility, and Global Readiness.\\" The school was modeled after a British day school and originally employed only European teachers. From the beginning, students were required to wear uniforms - plaid jumpers for girls and ties and trousers for boys. Both sexes wore green blazers emblazoned with the school's crest. Today As of 2017, St. Richard's has a student body of well over 300 students. The schools is divided into three sections: Early Childhood, the Lower School, and the Middle School. St. Richard's continues to enroll students of diverse heritage and religion. Only 20% of students are Episcopalian and 27% are of racial or cultural minorities. Of all Indianapolis private schools, St. Richard's has arguably the best academic program in the city and is known for its avant- garde curriculum. Students take French from Kindergarten until 5th grade. In 6th grade, students may decide to continue French or learn Spanish. You also learn Latin from 6th to 8th grade. Along with core subjects such as math, science, history/social studies, English, and foreign language, students also attend multiple art, music, and physical education classes a week. Grades 1 through 8 wear the traditional uniforms. In carrying out Rev. Lynch's wish for a school connected to the church, the Lower School has a chapel service daily and the Middle School once a week on Wednesday's. St. Richard's mascot is the dragon. There are many sports with no-cut policies. There is usually an A-team (more experienced players) and a B-team(Developmental players) in grades 6-8. The school has sports teams for tennis, girls' volleyball, girls and boys basketball, track and field, and soccer in which the Dragons won the IISL from 2006-2009. Intramural sports are offered for the Lower School(Those Sports include Basketball and Soccer). In 2010, St. Richard's School celebrated its 50th anniversary, and the school decided to change its name to St. Richard's Episcopal School. First Day of School and Special Events School starts on every August 15th. Before the first day of school there is an Ice Cream Social. On September 15, there is f√™te (party in French) where students enjoy their Friday's after school. Also the 5th graders go to France for the back- to-back program for 2-weeks at the end of the year.

Biography Julio Alsogaray was born in Esperanza, Santa Fe to Julia Elena Bosch and √Ålvaro Enrique Alsogaray, in 1918. Alsogaray's great-grandfather had a role as Admiral Guillermo Brown's adjutant in the 1845 Battle of Vuelta de Obligado, which established Argentine control over the lower Paran√° River, and both his father and grandfather had been colonels in the Argentine Army.GeneaNet: Coronel √Ålvaro Jos√© Alsogaray Echag√ºe La Naci√≥n Alsogaray graduated from the National War College in 1937, and married the former Zulema Legorburo. Politics Participating in General Benjamin Men√©ndez's failed, September 1951 coup attempt against President Juan Per√≥n, Alsogaray was promoted to the rank of General following Per√≥n's 1955 overthrow. He later served as Campo de Mayo training base Commandant, and Commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division. Alsogaray was named Under Secretary of the Army in 1962-63, and in 1964, Chief of Gendarmerie, in which capacity he captured the members of an incipient guerrilla group led by journalist Jorge Ricardo Masetti.Cr√≠tica de la Argentina: De llantos y cuentas suizas He was direct involved in the Laguna del Desierto incident. Appointed Commander of the 1st Army Corps in January 1966, Alsogaray planned a coup d'√©tat against the democratically elected President Arturo Illia; Illia was a moderate figure who had incurred opposition from conservative groups by refusing to annul Peronist victories in the 1965 mid-term elections (their exiled populist leader, Juan Per√≥n, himself welcomed the prospect of a coup, and of a possible political deal).Potash, Robert. The Army and Politics in Argentina. Stanford University Press, 1996. Alsogaray supported the recently removed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a, as Illia's successor; the two generals were allies and had been leading members of the moderate (\\"Blue\\") faction of the Argentine military during their dispute with the hard-line (\\"Red\\") faction that marred events in 1962 and 1963. Alsogaray managed military contacts with leading civilians amenable to a coup, and enjoyed the support of Ongan√≠a's replacement, General Pascual Pistarini, as well as the friendship of the Chief of Army Intelligence, General Mario Fonseca. Leading discussions on the structure of the future government, he put forth a blueprint prepared by his influential older brother, √Ålvaro Alsogaray, supporting the dissolution of democratic institutions, the enhancement of the judiciary as the guarantor of rights, and a more free market-oriented economic policy. A key proposal was the creation of the post of Prime Minister, who would be given wide purview over policy, and to which the Alsogaray brothers intended that √Ålvaro be appointed by Ongan√≠a. The coup itself, which took place on the morning of June 28, 1966, was led militarily by Pistarini, who encountered little resistance. General Alsogaray, however, personally approached President Illia at his Casa Rosada office to deliver the order to resign, informing Illia that: > As a representative of the Armed Forces, I have come to request that you > leave this office. > (Illia): You do not represent the Armed Forces, rather an insurrection. You > and those with you are highwaymen who, like bandits, appear in the early > morning hours. > I invite you to leave. Do not force me to use violence. > Of what violence do you speak? The violence is the one you've just > unleashed. The nation shall always recriminate you for this usurpation. > Pigna, Felipe. El Historiador. Biograf√≠as: Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a Following the coup, Ongan√≠a, who had obtained Pistarini's pledge to leave himself and any other active-duty General out of the new government, nixed √Ålvaro Alsogaray's proposal for creating a (powerful) Prime Minister's post, denying him even the post of Minister of Economy of Argentina he had twice previously held. He did, however, name Julio Alsogaray, to whose planning he largely owed the coup's success, to succeed Pistarini as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs in December. Differences had developed by May 1968, however, between Alsogaray and the President, who resisted his input, and whose efforts to control the CGT labor union (by way of fostering a corporativist model) were anathema to Alsogaray's neoliberal ideology. Disputes also arose with the Internal Affairs Minister, Dr. Guillermo Borda (who opposed any return to democratic rule), and with Alsogaray's successor as head of the important Campo de Mayo base, Major General C√°ndido L√≥pez (who favored an early call for elections). Fearing a coup, Ongan√≠a decided it was best to \\"refresh\\" the three forces' leadership every two years, and informed Alsogaray of his retirement on August 20; rather than wait until the scheduled, October 4 transition, he stepped down as Joint Chiefs Commander on August 26. His replacement, the 3rd Army Corps Commander, General Alejandro Lanusse, himself removed Ongan√≠a in 1970. Amid a wave of political violence (Ongan√≠a removal was triggered by the execution of a former President, General Pedro Aramburu), a group belonging to the far-left ERP unsuccessfully attempted to kidnap Alsogaray on August 18, 1971.Por la memoria His own son, Juan Carlos, joined the Montoneros guerrilla organization, and took part in attacks on the Army in the hills of Tucum√°n Province as a commander during the mid-1970s.Lewis, Paul. Guerrillas and generals: the Dirty War in Argentina. University of North Carolina Press, 2002.

Goldman‚Äôs 1997 article, \\"Redistributional Consequences of Community Rating\\" discusses a study done in California where health insurance premiums were based on community ratings. The Patient Protection and Accountable Care Act (PPACA) has been passed through Congress and implementation has commenced in the U.S. healthcare system. Community rating systems will be the basis for health care premiums in the future exchange system.H.R. 3590 ‚Äì 111th Congress: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. (2009) ¬ß2701 These ratings, pool people in to demographic groups and charge all members a constant rate. The goal of this system is to prevent medical underwriting and decrease the inequities that occur for clients with higher risks of increased medical utilization present in a risk adjusted system. Goldman et al. conducted a study in California that trialed such clusters of insured clients by pooling at the state level, regional level, and metropolitan level. Results from California‚Äôs experiment with such a system conclude that the larger the areas pooled, the greater the transfer of costs. Another challenge to community based rating systems is that lower income neighborhoods with lower healthcare utilization subsidize the healthcare cost of higher income communities that tend to have higher healthcare expenditures.Dubay, L.C., Lebrun, L.A., (2012) Health, behavior, and health care disparities: disentangling the effects of income and race in the United States. Int j Health Serv. 42(4):607‚Äì25. The health exchange system will not be the only place where community rating systems are utilized. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (CMS) plans to initiate a modified rating system starting in January 2014,Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan. (Nov 20, 2012). CMS issues rule: modified community rating. this may lead other insurance companies following suit. Due to the results of the California experiment and the widespread use of community based rating systems being initiated, it is imperative that some kind of subsidies be used for low income families. Otherwise, these families may be more likely to avoid insurance due to higher premium costs.Grau, J., Giesa, K., (2009, December).

This result would be counter intuitive to the goals of implementing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the U.S. healthcare system. Use of drugs for chronic illness when co-payments are doubled Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed that chronic illness affected 133 million people in the United States and accounted for seven out of ten deaths.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources In relationship to these numbers, the American Society of Health System Pharmacists say Americans spent $307.5 billion on pharmaceuticals in 2010.American Society of Health- System Pharmacists. (2012). Retrieved from http://www.ajhp.org/DocLibrary/Advocacy Research by Goldman, Joyce, Escarce, Pace, Soloman, Laouri, Landsman, and Teutsch (2001) studied the purchasing behavior of drugs used to treat eight chronic illnesses: diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, asthma, depression, allergies, arthritis, and stomach ulcers. This retrospective study presents a strong correlation between co-payment levels and medication use for these chronic illnesses. The study illustrated the change in consumption behaviors based on plan generosity and structure such as coinsurance rates and mandatory generic substitution. The study by Goldman et al. (2001) predicts there would be a significant decrease in medication utilization in all of the chronic disease categories examined when co-payments were doubled. However, of note, the researchers discovered that patients respond discriminatorily to changes in co-payment and are less likely to reduce consumption of disease specific medications and will reduce pharmacy spending in other medications. Goldman, et al. (2001) exposed the largest decrease in drug spending when co-payments were doubled were in medications to treat arthritis and allergies. The study revealed that patients with diabetes decreased their purchase of diabetes drugs the most compared to the other chronic illnesses examined when their co-payments doubled. The research by Goldman et al. (2001) reveals two points that could inform public policy related to pharmaceutical expenditures. One, consumption of over-the- counter drugs to treat allergies and arthritis are highly influenced by out of pocket spending. Two, diabetes patients may choose lifestyle behavior changes when faced with higher drug costs.Folland, S, Goodman, A., and Stano, M. (2010). The economics of health and health care. (6th ed). Boston, MA. Prentice Hall Before changing payment structures, more research will be needed to examine adverse health consequences in the chronically ill if pharmaceutical interventions are limited by increasing out of pocket expenses.Soumerai, S. and Ross-Degnan.

New England Journal of Medicine. 340. 722‚Äì728 For instance, emergency department utilization could rise in response to these changes. The results of the study by Goldman et al. (2001) could inform public policy on ways to decrease excess drug usage when the benefits are less than the cost of the drug.

History * July 4, 1979: Established as Diocese of Rourkela from the Diocese of Sambalpur *The Diocese of Rourkela was created by the Papal Bull \\"cum Cordi\\" dated July 4, 1979 by taking the entire civil district of Sundargarh from the diocese of Sambalpur in Orissa. At the time of erection of Rourkela, the diocese of Sambalpur, erected in 1951, comprised the four Orissa districts of Sundargarh, Sambalpur, Bolangir and Dhenkanal. The new diocese of Rourkela is bounded on the north by Archdiocese of Ranchi and on the South by the diocese of Sambalpur to the west and the north-west lies the diocese of Raigarh, while the diocese of Jamshedpur and Balasore lie to the east and South-East. Jesuit Missionaries began evangelization of this part of the Chotanagpur Mission, Fr Constant Livens (1856‚Äì1893) being the most prominent among them. After the Second World War, the Jesuits faced two major problems - personnel and finance. They, therefore, requested the Divine Word Missionaries (SVD) who had been working in the neighbouring states of Central India since 1932, to take up the Gangpur Mission in Northern Orissa. The SVDs set their feet in this mission land in 1948. The Late Bishop Herman Westermann, SVD, who had several years of experience in Central India, was ordained the first Bishop of Sambalpur in 1951. During his tenure as well as that of Bishop Raphael Cheenath, SVD (1974‚Äì1979), mission work in this ecclesiastical territory progressed in leaps and bounds. Rt. Rev. Alphonse Billung, S.V.D. was appointed the first Bishop of Rourkela on November 3, 1979. Today the Diocese of Rourkela owes a lot to the relentless zeal and indefatigable labour of these eminent personalities, and their co - Missionaries - Priests, Brothers, Sisters, Lay people, generous benefactors and all well-wishers.

They speak the Bezhta language, but many of them also speak Avar, Russian or other Tsezic languages of their region. They numbered 1,448 in 1926. According to the Russian census in 2002, there were 6184 self-identified \\"Bezhtins\\", though the real number is probably higher.  History  The terriotry of the Bezhtas was nominally part of the Avar Khanate. In 1806, the Bezhtas were incorporated into the Russian empire. Tight colonial control of the region was enforced during the 1860's and 1870's. During Soviet rule, the Bezhtas witnessed collectivization, urbanization, education mainly taught in the Russian language, and a erosion of Islam and traditional Bezhta culture.

For example, the vector data model represents geography as collections of points, lines, and polygons; the raster data model represent geography as cell matrices that store numeric values; and the TIN data model represents geography as sets of contiguous, nonoverlapping triangles.Wade, T. and Sommer, S. eds. A to Z GIS In ArcGIS, a data model describes the thematic layers used in the applications (for example, hamburger stands, roads, and counties); their spatial representation (for example, point, line, or polygon); their attributes; their integrity rules and relationships (for example, counties must nest within states); their cartographic portrayal; and their metadata requirements. Representing three- dimensional map information There are two approaches for representing three- dimensional map information, and for managing it in the data model. Approaches for representing three-dimensional map information, and for managing it in the data model.David R. Soller1 and Thomas M. Berg (2003). The National Geologic Map Database Project: Overview and Progress U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 03‚Äì471. =Vector-based stack-unit= Vector-based stack-unit maps depict the vertical succession of geologic units to a specified depth (here, the base of the block diagram). This mapping approach characterizes the vertical variations of physical properties in each 3-D map unit. In this example, an alluvial deposit (unit ‚Äúa‚Äù) overlies glacial till (unit ‚Äút‚Äù), and the stack-unit labeled ‚Äúa/t‚Äù indicates that relationship, whereas the unit ‚Äút‚Äù indicates that glacial till extends down to the specified depth. In a manner similar to that shown in figure 11, the stack-unit's occurrence (the map unit's outcrop), geometry (the map unit's boundaries), and descriptors (the physical properties of the geologic units included in the stack-unit) are managed as they are for a typical 2-D geologic map. =Raster-based stacked surfaces= Raster-based stacked surfaces depict the surface of each buried geologic unit, and can accommodate data on lateral variations of physical properties. In this example from Soller and others (1999),D.R. Soller et al. (1999). \\"inclusion of digital map products in the National Geologic Map Database\\". In Soller, D.R., ed., Digital Mapping Techniques ‚Äò99‚ÄîWorkshop Proceedings:.

The middle grid is the uppermost surface of an economically important aquifer, the Mahomet Sand, which fills a pre- and inter-glacial valley carved into the bedrock surface. Each geologic unit in raster format can be managed in the data model, in a manner not dissimilar from that shown for the stack-unit map. The Mahomet Sand is continuous in this area, and represents one occurrence of this unit in the data model. Each raster, or pixel, on the Mahomet Sand surface has a set of map coordinates that are recorded in a GIS (in the data model bin that is labeled ‚ÄúPixel coordinates‚Äù, which is the raster corollary of the ‚ÄúGeometry‚Äù bin for vector map data). Each pixel can have a unique set of descriptive information, such as surface elevation, unit thickness, lithology, transmissivity, etc.).

The squadron was set up to provide the RSAF with much needed help in the heavylift/support role of troop- lift and equipment transportation. Occasionally, the squadron's Chinooks are used to augment 125 Sqn & 126 Sqn in Search & Rescue (SAR) operations. One such incident happened on 18 December 2008 at 1612hrs (Singapore Standard Time), when a multi-role survey vessel of the Royal Navy‚Äî , made a call for assistance to the RSAF's Air operation centre (AOC) requesting for emergency evacuation of an unconscious crew. As HMS Echo was then outside the normal operational range of 125 Sqn's SAR Super Pumas, LTC Vincent Chin of AOC decided to launch one of 127 Sqn's Chinook helicopter to undertake the task of long-range medical evacuation (Medevac).

The Whistler Weasel Workers is a non-profit society dedicated to the advancement of alpine ski racing in British Columbia and Canada. The Weasel Worker's major activity is the preparation and maintenance of ski race courses and the support and organization of ski racing competitions. The Weasel Workers have participated in the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, in all World Cup, Canadian Championship and NorAm alpine ski races that have been held in Whistler BC. The Weasel Workers have also participated in international ski races at other locations, including the FIS Alpine World Championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain (1996), and in Bormio, Italy (2005), in World Cup alpine ski races in Lake Louise, AB (2000‚Äìpresent), and in Beaver Creek, CO (2006), as well as in the Winter Olympic Games in Calgary, AB (1988) and in Salt Lake, UT (2002). The Whistler Weasel Workers participated in the 2008 Whistler World Cup and they played a role in the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games. Alpine ski racing in Canada is largely dependent on volunteer workers who prepare a course for racing and then maintain the course during the event. This activity includes creating and maintaining a hard, smooth snow surface and installing and maintaining safety netting necessary to safeguard both the ski racers and spectators. Volunteers also organize and officiate most alpine ski races. Among officiating and other tasks requiring large numbers of volunteers are those of Gate Judging (confirms that competitors properly complete the course) and Course Security (restricts access to the race course). In the 1970s, while watching a line of course workers walking, arm-in-arm, \\"boot-packing\\" the snow on a steep pitch on Whistler Mountain's Dave Murray track, an early race organizer was heard to say, \\"They're Weasel Workers\\", naming the group after the slope on which they were working. The name stuck and from that time, Whistler's volunteer ski race workers have been known as the \\"Weasel Workers\\". A course crew setting B-NetsIn 1984, the organization formally registered itself as a society, under the name \\"Coast Alpine Event Club\\". This name is rarely used and the group is commonly known simply as \\"the Weasels\\". The Weasels are very loosely organized with membership requirements being simply four or five day's participation as a course worker at a Weasel-supported Whistler ski race. Most members are intermediate to advanced skiers, but the organization includes many non-skiers as well. Whereas the core membership is resident in the Lower Mainland region of BC (Vancouver and surroundings), and in Whistler, Squamish and Pemberton, BC, Weasel Workers reside throughout Canada, as well as in the USA, Australia, New Zealand, and many countries in Europe. The Whistler Weasel Worker organization is sustained by strong camaraderie and a shared love of and dedication to alpine ski racing. The Weasels are enthusiastic supporters of the Canadian Alpine Ski Team. Many Weasels are or have been parents of ski racers competing at various levels, from local club and regional ski races to international World Cup races.

In the First World War, it formed part of the British Salonika Force on the Macedonian front. In the Second World War, it formed part of the British Second Army during Operation Overlord and the subsequent North-West Europe Campaign of 1944-45. First World War XII Corps was formed in France on 8 September 1915 under the command of Lt-Gen Sir Henry Fuller Maitland Wilson.Official History: France and Belgium 1915, Vol. II, p. 87. In November 1915, XII Corps was sent from France with 22nd, 26th and 28th Divisions under command to reinforce Allied forces on the Macedonian front. Wilson and his corps headquarters (HQ) arrived at the port of Salonika on 12 November, but the commander of the British Salonika Force (BSF) took XII Corp‚Äôs staff to establish his own HQ.Official History: Macedonia, Vol. I, p. 58. On 14 December 1915, the War Office sanctioned the establishment of two corps within the BSF and Wilson reformed XII Corps.Wakefield & Moody, p.45; Official History: Macedonia, Vol. I, p. 95. After a period holding the defensive position known as ‚Äòthe Birdcage‚Äô around Salonika, XII Corps moved up-country in July 1916, taking over former French positions, but only part was involved in the fighting during the summer and autumn.Wakefield & Moody, pp. 48‚Äì58; Official History: Macedonia, Vol. I, pp. 155, 188. XII Corps was selected to attack the Bulgarian positions west of Lake Doiran in April 1917.Official History, Macedonia, Vol I, p. 295. The area to be attacked was ‚Äòa defender‚Äôs dream, being a tangled mass of hills cut by numerous ravines‚Äô.Wakefield & Moody p. 65. Wilson planned a three-stage operation to capture the three lines of defences, preceded by a short intense bombardment. The BSF‚Äôs commander, Sir George Milne decided that his manpower was too limited, and reduced this to a smaller assault on the first defence line only, preceded by a three-day bombardment to neutralise enemy batteries and destroy trenches and barbed wire. This, of course, lost the element of surprise and the Bulgarians were well aware of what was coming. Only three brigades were engaged, but the casualties were high and little ground was gained. In a second attack two weeks later, the assault troops managed to cross no man‚Äôs land, but it was difficult to get information back to HQs, and some companies simply disappeared.Wakefield & Moody, pp. 65‚Äì98;Official History: Macedonia, Vol I, pp. 306‚Äì319. This 1st Battle of Doiran (second battle by Bulgarian reckoning) had been a failure and, with many troops being withdrawn to other theatres, XII Corps did not get another opportunity to launch a major attack until 18 September 1918. On that day, with two brigades of 22nd Division and the Greek Seres Division, XII Corps failed to take ‚ÄòPip Ridge‚Äô and the ‚ÄòGrande Couronne‚Äô. The following day, the attack was renewed with a brigade from 27th Division supported by the remnants of 22nd Division, the Seres Division, and the French 2nd Regiment of Zouaves. Once more the attack failed with heavy casualties.Wakefield & Moody pp. 196‚Äì219; Official History: Macedonia, Vol II, pp. 163‚Äì178. However, the 2nd Battle of Doiran had served its purpose by drawing Bulgarian attention away from Gen Franchet d‚ÄôEsperey‚Äôs main Franco- Serbian thrust, which broke through the Bulgarian lines further west. On 21 September, the BSF was ordered to pursue the retreating Bulgarians, with XII Corps in the lead. Bulgaria signed an armistice with the Allies on 29 September, but XII Corps continued to advance across Bulgaria towards the Turkish frontier, until the Ottoman Turks also signed the Armistice of Mudros on 31 October.Wakefield & Moody pp. 220‚Äì227. XII Corps occupied parts of European Turkey and Wilson was appointed GOC Allied Forces Gallipoli and Bosporus. On 11 February 1919, XII Corps ceased to exist, Wilson becoming Commander, Allied Forces Turkey in Europe, British Salonika Army, and British Army of the Black Sea.Army List.Official History: Macedonia, Vol II, pp. 268‚Äì70. =First World War order of battle= Order of Battle (March 1917)Wakefield & Moody, Appendix. *22nd Division *26th Division *60th (2/2nd London) Division Corps Troops: *1/1st Lothians and Border Horse Second World War=Home defence= XII Corps, which was formed in 1940, came under Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces in the early part of the Second World War.

In July, it took over command of the troops holding the Odon Valley area in July 1944 (previously under command of Lieutenant-General Richard N. O'Connor's VIII Corps). XII Corps then took part in a diversionary action in the area prior to Operation Goodwood (18‚Äì20 July 1944), and was then involved in the fighting southwards out of this area in August. XII Corps was the last assignment of the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division prior to the division's disbandment, due to a severe shortage of manpower, in late August. XII Corps supported the left flank of XXX Corps during Operation Market Garden in September 1944; but, like VIII Corps on the right flank, struggled to match the pace of XXX Corps' rapid advance. This left XXX Corps' flanks exposed to German counter-attacks on its lines of communication. XII Corps later went on to fight in the rest of the campaign, during operations Pheasant, Blackcock and later in the invasion of Germany.

In 2003, the synagogue had a membership of 140 families, and in 2012 that number had risen to 220 families. The congregation is notable for the unusual concentration of distinguished scholars among its members. History Shaarei Tefillah was founded in December 1983 by dissident members of Newton's other major Orthodox synagogue, Congregation Beth-El Atereth Israel. Members describe the split as \\"generational\\"; Shaarei Tefillah members were younger, but more traditional and knowledgeable than those at Beth El. Members share the duty of leading services throughout the year. The synagogue initially met in the living rooms of the homes of its members, and in a church gymnasium. In 1985, the congregation proposed locating the synagogue in a private house at 841 Commonwealth Avenue. They bought the property in 1984 for $165,000 and sought a zoning variance that would allow them to open a synagogue there in spite of there not being adequate parking. The synagogue sold the property a year later after failing to work out an arrangement. The synagogue has been located since 1987 at 35 Morseland Avenue, one block north of Commonwealth Avenue and around the corner from Beth El. It purchased the house that year from a rabbi who had been operating a small synagogue in its basement since 1970. The interior walls of the house were removed and a five-foot high wall constructed down the middle to create separate spaces for men and women. The ark is on the men's side, but both it and the bimah are easily seen from the women's side. As of 2009, the synagogue had 300 seats, and was seeking to expand to 405 seats.

Kenilworth was located in Arthur Township until 1999. A post office has operated continuously in Kenilworth since 1848. History Kenilworth is named for a pioneer storekeeper who immigrated from Kenilworth, England. Many of the first settlers in Arthur Township were very poor, and moved here because the land was inexpensive. Among them were a number of Irish Catholics, and some German Catholics. Members of the Jesuit Order established the township's first Catholic church at Kenilworth in 1852. The log church served whole township until 1857, when a Catholic church was established in the village of Arthur. The Kenilworth church closed in 1870 after being condemned as structurally unsound. In 1903, a Catholic church called Sacred Heart re-established in Kenilworth. A Methodist church and cemetery were established in Kenilworth prior to 1854. Called Ebenezer Church, it was built from logs, and was replaced in 1885 by a red brick church. The congregation merged with the United Church in 1925. Kenilworth United Church closed in 2001 and was demolished. The cemetery also closed; the last inscription being from 2006. A cairn was erected at the cemetery displaying a memorial plaque and the church's cornerstone. By 1869, Kenilworth had a general store, tailor, doctor, saloon, wagon maker, hotel and post office. The population was 50. The Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway established a line through Kenilworth in 1872. Despite having a population at that time of just 75 people, Arthur Township made it conditional that in order to receive funding, the railway had to erect a station at Kenilworth. The railway has since been abandoned and the tracks removed. By 1910, Kenilworth had a bank and telegraph office, and a population of 100. That same year, a steam boiler at a grist mill in Kenilworth exploded causing extensive damage. The administrative offices of the Township of Wellington North are today located in Kenilworth.

First published in 1921, it is in the public domain in the United States.Buttel, p. 179. One point of entry into this poem is Stevens's attitude towards the weather. Is it all he cared about or does it converge with reflections on the passage of time and attendant issues such as ennui and ageing? (The difference between Helen Vendler and Harold Bloom on this matter is noted in the main Harmonium essay, the section \\"The musical imagist\\".) This poem emphatically ties 'the time of year' to the relentless flow of time. Buttel interprets the poem as evoking urban emptiness under the influence of Jules Laforgue. Stevens, he argues, brought the monotony, emptiness and meaninglessness of city life into his poetry.Buttel, p. 175-6 However, Bates reads the poem as issuing a favorable prognosis, \\"for his cure is implicit in the terms of his complaint: if 'summer' is here, can 'winter' be far behind?\\"Bates, p. 109 Although Buttel thinks that Stevens would often ask essentially Laforgue's question, \\"Faudra-t-il vivre monotone?\\", Stevens's despair is modified by exuberance.Buttel, p. 175 Bates though doesn't register the despair for he understands \\"Laforguian boredom\\" as temperamentally uncongenial to Stevens, mattering to him chiefly as something to overcome.Bates, p. 109 With reference to \\"The Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad,\\" Buttel and Bates are debating whether a change of season would allow the poet to be less diffident; this is Bates's view. Or is it rather that a season would have to break out of the cycle of seasons in order to overcome this malady of the quotidian? Would summer have to come to rest in some perfected state or winter penetrate to \\"the final slate\\"? Harold Bloom interprets the poem as belonging to a triad in Harmonium, the other elements being \\"The Snow Man\\" and \\"Tea at the Palaz of Hoon.\\" To master the triad is to reach \\"the center of Stevens's poetic and human anxieties and of his resources for meeting those anxieties\\".Bloom, p. 86 \\"The Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad\\" represents a moment in Harmoniums progress in which the poet proclaims diffidence about his future creativity.

This is the girli that whenever it rains shei cries. Resumptive pronouns have been described as \\"ways of salvaging a sentence that a speaker has started without realizing that it is impossible or at least difficult to finish it grammatically\\". An English speaker might use a resumptive pronoun in order to prevent violations of syntactic constraints. In many languages resumptive pronouns are necessary for a sentence to be grammatical and are required to help interpretation and performance in particular syntactic conditions. Defining the resumptive pronoun Resumptive pronouns are pronouns that become more common the deeper the relative clause is embedded within the sentence because of greater processing constraints. When a relative clause is deeply embedded, the sentence is longer and it is more difficult to understand what is being modified by the relative clause. This added level, or additional distance, makes processing the sentence more difficult. These pronouns may not be actually grammatical in some languages like English, but are inserted into some sentences for clarity when there is a great deal of embedding or distance. = Relationship of resumptive pronouns and traces = Crucial to understanding resumptive pronouns is grasping the concept of their counterpart: the trace. Since resumptive pronouns and traces may not be differentiated in the English lexicon, the definition of one requires information about the other. When movement occurs in English sentences an invisible place-marker is left, called a trace. An example of movement that would result in a trace would be when an auxiliary verb is moved from a main clause to the beginning of a sentence to form a question phrase. A trace is an empty category that maintains a position in a sentence even though, in some languages, there is no surface level evidence of that linguistic element. Traces represent the pronoun that would have been present in the embedded clause, or before the wh-movement, that is removed from the surface representation of the sentence. As a result, in accordance with binding theory, the empty position of a trace must still be co-indexed with the preceding noun that it refers to in D-structure since they refer to the same entity. 2\\\\. a) The man [whoi John saw ti.] b) *The man [whoi John saw himi.] t = trace i = co-indexed = Two competing accounts of resumptive pronouns = There are two main views regarding the existence of resumptive pronouns. Some linguists believe that resumptive pronouns occur as a result of syntactic processing, while others believe they are the result of grammatical structure and are actually the pronunciation of a trace. In terms of grammatical processing, speakers use resumptive pronouns to clarify syntactically complicated sentences by using a resumptive pronoun as a hook back to the antecedent. This point of view sees resumptive pronouns as a kind of helper that is inserted into the sentence in order to make understanding the sentence easier for speakers. The second view looks at the underlying syntactic structure of the sentence, and views the resumptive pronouns as audible instances of an invisible underlying form. From the structural perspective, resumptive pronouns have been called a \\"cross between a trace morpheme and a regular pronoun\\". A conceivable way of approaching resumptive pronouns is to say that they are of the same syntactic category as gaps or traces, and that they get the same semantic translation. The only difference would be that certain gaps get 'spelled out' as pronouns for clarity. Resumptive pronouns are syntactically and semantically pronouns, and they differ in both these respects from gaps. Example sentences The following examples are based on sentences provided in the work by 3\\\\. a) That is [the boyi that ti cries loudly.] b) *That is [the boyi that hei cries loudly.] Sentence (a) shows a trace, where the pronoun has been removed from the embedded clause. In sentence (b), the word him represents the pronoun that would be referred to as a resumptive pronoun if it remained in the sentence. However, as was stated previously, traces and resumptive pronouns appear in complementary distribution, so for the sentence to be grammatical with a trace in (a), it must be ungrammatical when the resumptive pronoun fills that same position in (b). Sentences (c) and (d) operate similarly, and are demonstrated in the X-bar theory trees below. leftcenter Theories of resumptive pronoun distribution Through a brief overview of resumptive pronouns in Swedish, conclude that in some languages resumptive pronoun usage is not a case of anaphoric binding. In fact, they indicate that the relationship between a wh- word and a resumptive pronoun is actually akin to the relationship between a wh-word and a trace (an empty category that maintains a position in a sentence) that exists in English. Furthermore, they state that even though resumptive pronouns typically occur in syntactic islands, this is not because of switch in the category of binding. The issues with resumptive pronoun extractability clearly follow from syntactic principles. Furthermore, this factor is naturally described within the Minimalist program, where the possibility of one structure can affect the possibility of another. In pre- Minimalist frameworks where derivations are independent of each other, this type of relation between two structures was unaccounted for; that is, there was no syntactic account of the ungrammaticality of cases like (5b). The independence of (5a) and (5b) implied that (5b) should be as good as (6b), regardless of whether resumptive pronouns are marginal in English. However, in the Minimalist framework, derivations that originate from the same numeration (i.e. set of lexical items) compete with one another so that the least costly derivation blocks the other(s). Therefore, if each resumptive‚Äìtrace pair in the patterns exemplified in (5) and (6) is analyzed as originating from the same numeration, the complementarity has an account. To develop this account we must claim that resumptive pronouns and traces are not differentiated in the English lexicon. If they were, the two versions would derive from different numerations and so would not compete. Distribution of resumptive pronouns Resumptive pronouns in English behave differently from those in some other languages. In many contexts resumptive pronouns are judged to be ungrammatical by native speakers and they cannot be in the same binding domain or clause as the pronoun to which they refer. They do not usually occur in main clauses, but generally in relative clauses in some languages. In fact, in English, \\"relative clauses with resumptive pronouns are officially ungrammatical [...] However, they are in fact not uncommon in speech\\". However, their grammaticality is influenced by linear distance from the subject, embedded depth, and extractability. # Distance ‚Äì Processing constraints between the distance of the antecedent and the pronoun. # Extractability ‚Äì The acceptability of a trace. # Island Constraints ‚Äì The movement capability of WH-words. In a relative clause, resumptive pronouns are generally not seen as grammatical, however their level of grammaticality improves as they get farther from the head. Thus, (4b) seems preferable to (4a). Some improvement in whether a native speaker judges resumptive pronouns as grammatical may also result when the resumptive pronoun is embedded, as in (4c). The following examples are based on sentences provided in the work by 4 a) *This is the cameli that hei likes Oscar. b) This is the cameli that maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe hei likes Oscar. c) This is the cameli that I think hei likes Oscar. Since distance is generally irrelevant to syntactic principles, it is difficult to build a grammatical account of English resumptive pronouns in such terms. The factor that seems to affect the distribution of resumptives in English most is extractability (i.e., whether a trace is acceptable). Resumptive pronouns are therefore generally in complementary distribution with traces. In (5), where the trace is possible, the resumptive pronoun is not; in (6), where the trace is not possible because of island constraints, the resumptive pronoun is. 5\\\\. a) That's the girli that I like ti . b) *That's the girli that I like heri. 6\\\\. a) *This is the girli that I don't know what ti said. b) This is the girli that I don't know what shei said. leftcenter Distribution in other languages The use of resumptive pronouns and the resumptive pronoun strategy is \\"marginal\\" in the English language, but \\"common in colloquial English where binding theory prohibits wh-movement\\". The phenomenon is found more readily in other languages; in some of them it is the normal way of forming relative clauses. See Relative clause ‚Üí Pronoun retention type. In some languages, resumptive pronouns and traces seem to alternate relatively freely, as the Romani examples in (7) illustrate. 7\\\\. a) Ake i haj so mangav. here the girl that I-like 'Here's the girl that I like.' '' b) Ake i haj so mangav la. here the girl that I-like her 'Here's the girl that I like [her]'.'' Yiddish is another example of a language that uses resumptive pronouns readily, as can be seen in the example below. 8\\\\. a) ...a yid vos er iz geven a groyser lamdn un a gvir... ...a Jew that he is been a big scholar and a rich-man... '...a guy who [he] was a big scholar and a rich man...' Some languages, such as Italian, features grammatical resumption in some situations other than relative clauses. In the example below, the resumptive clitic pronoun lo (which refers back to the topicalized object) is required for the sentence to be grammatical. 9\\\\. a) Mario lo ho visto domenica 'Mario him I saw on Sunday' See also *Syntax *Linguistics *Pronouns *Relative clause ReferencesSources  Pronouns ","title":"Resumptive pronoun"},{"id":"18584726","text":"The Mississippi Gambler is a 1929 American romantic drama film directed by Reginald Barker, and starring Joseph Schildkraut and Joan Bennett.

The signatories of the treaty were then Australian prime minister John Howard and his East Timorese counterpart at that time Mari Alkatiri. The Timor Gap The treaty entered into force on April 2, 2003 following an exchange of diplomatic notes and was backdated to May 20, 2002. The treaty was to run for 30 years from the day it came into force or when a seabed boundary could be established, whichever came earlier. However, the subsequent signing of the Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea (CMATS) in 2007, the period of validity for the Timor Sea Treaty was extended to 2057, when the validity of CMATS also ends.Robert J. King, ‚ÄúThe Timor Gap, 1972-2017‚Äù, March 2017. Submission No.27 to the inquiry by the Australian Parliament Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into Certain Maritime Arrangements - Timor-Leste. p.48. The Timor Sea Treaty provides for the sharing of the proceeds of petroleum found in an agreed area of seabed, called the Joint Petroleum Development Area and does not determine the sovereignty and maritime boundary between the two countries. The treaty expressly states that the right of either country to claim the overlapping portion of the seabed is maintained. The Timor Sea Treaty ceased being in force when the Treaty between Australia and the Democratic Republic of Timor- Leste Establishing Their Maritime Boundaries in the Timor Sea entered into force on 30 August 2019. https://www.info.dfat.gov.au/info/treaties/treaties.nsf/AllDocIDs/A8A223D015C50F8CCA256BC70008A0E2 Effects of the treaty The treaty replaces the Timor Gap Treaty which was signed between Australia and Indonesia on December 11, 1989 which was no longer valid once the territory of East Timor ceased to become a province of Indonesia. It virtually puts East Timor in the place of Indonesia in the Timor Gap Treaty but with a few differences. The significant difference between the Timor Gap Treaty and Timor Sea Treaty is that the latter only creates one Joint Petroleum Development Area, with East Timor getting 90% and Australia 10% of the revenue derived from the area. The former created three zones, with the revenue of the middle Zone of Cooperation being divided equally between the two countries.

One of the main story is of Savi, a woman who leaves her husband and maintains an extra-marital relationship with another married man, with both their spouses being aware of the situation.

She served in both World Wars, and was sunk in 1942. Construction and commissioning Vortigern was ordered from J. Samuel White, of Cowes, Isle of Wight during the First World War under the 1916‚Äì17 Programme Build (9th Order), and was laid down on 17 January 1917. She was launched on 5 October 1917 and commissioned on 21 January 1918. She has been the only ship of the Royal Navy so far to be named HMS Vortigern, after Vortigern, an early British ruler. Wartime and interwar service Vortigern served throughout the remaining months of the war, and was redeployed to the Baltic Sea in 1919, later serving with the 1st Destroyer Flotilla. She was eventually placed in reserve, but was reactivated in 1939 in order to take part in the August Fleet Review of the ships of the reserve by HM King George VI. Second World War With the outbreak of war Vortigern was deployed with the 17th Destroyer Flotilla, based at Plymouth and tasked with escorting convoys and carrying out anti-submarine patrols in the South Western Approaches and the English Channel. She was engaged in these duties for the rest of 1939. In January 1940 Vortigern was nominated to join the 13th Destroyer Flotilla based at Gibraltar. On 13 January, she and escorted the outbound convoy OG 14F to Gibraltar. On their arrival on 15 January, both destroyers were detached to join the flotilla. Vortigern spent the period between February and June escorting convoys between Britain and Gibraltar. On 3 July she was present at the attack on the French fleet at Mers-el-K√©bir (Operation Catapult). On 6 July she formed part of the escort with the ships of the 13th and 8th Destroyer Flotillas for the battlecruiser , the battleship , the aircraft carrier and the cruisers and for the air attacks on the . Vortigern then joined the destroyers , , , , , , , Velox and on 8 July as they screened the capital ships preparing for air attacks from HMS Ark Royal on Italian targets on Cagliari. The operation was abandoned after the force came under heavy air attack, and Vortigern took passage to Britain on 12 July. She deployed in August on convoy defence duties in Home waters, covering convoys sailing in the North Western Approaches to and from the Clyde. She was taken in hand in September for a refit, and to be converted into a Short Range Escort. The work lasted until November, and after completing trials Vortigern joined the 12th Destroyer Flotilla based at Rosyth, and deployed to escort convoys in the North Sea. On 9 December whilst escorting one convoy, Vortigern came under attack by a German seaplane off Aldeburgh. The destroyer continued her patrols and convoy escort duties all throughout 1941 and into 1942. Sinking Vortigern was sunk off Cromer on 15 March 1942, whilst defending a coastal convoy against attack by E-boats. She was torpedoed by the E-boat S104, and sank with the loss of 110 lives. Only 14 survivors were rescued. Eleven bodies were recovered from the sea by the Cromer lifeboat H F Bailey III. The wrecksite is designated as a Protected Place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. There are twelve war graves in Lowestoft cemetery from HMS Vortigern. Correction and additions-- The ship was seen sinking by a Harwich-based 16th Flotilla destroyer, but her captain (S Lonbard-Hobson) felt obliged to keep up with the convoy, and therefore broke off and only returned once it was daylight and the E-boats had gone. An inquiry was held at HMS Badger, Parkeston Quay, where a few surviving ratings were inconclusively questioned.

Formed mainly by priests active in villas miserias (shantytowns) and workers' neighborhoods, the Movement of Priests for the Third World was an important canal for social action between 1967 and 1976, close to Leftwing Peronism and, at times, Marxism. It was also close to the CGT de los Argentinos, which was strongly active in the 1969 Cordobazo demonstrations against Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a's military dictatorship.  Creation  The CELAM declaration of Medell√≠n (August 1968) tied poverty in the Third World to exploitation by multinational firms of industrialized countries, supporting liberation theology. The Medell√≠n declaration was issued at a time when the Argentine Catholic Church was already in turmoil. Three priests from Buenos Aires, H√©ctor Bot√°n, Miguel Ramondetti and Rodolfo Ricciardelli had published, a month earlier, the Manifiesto de los 18 Obispos (Manifest of the 18 Bishops), which proposed, among other suggestions, the creation of the MSTM. The first encounter took place in May 1968, with the tacit authorization of the bishops Guillermo Bolatti, Enrique Angelelli, Alberto Devoto, Jer√≥nimo Podest√°, Jaime de Nevares, Adolfo Tortolo and Vicente Faustino Zazpe, although none of them would associate themselves with the Movement of Priests for the Third World. Along with laics, the MSTM dedicated itself to social welfare projects, as well as supporting workers' claims, at a time when the military dictatorship of Ongan√≠a had suspended the right to strike as well as other political rights. The MSTM's relationship with trade unions lead many of its members to gravitate towards Peronism, and even Socialism. In December 1969, more than 20 priests, members of the MSTM, marched on the Casa Rosada to present to Ongan√≠a a petition pleading him to abandon the eradication plan of villas miserias.Oscar Anzorena, Tiempo de violencia y utop√≠a (1966-1976), Editorial Contrapunto, 1987, p.49 The same year, the Movement issued a declaration supporting Socialist revolutionary movements, which led to the Catholic hierarchy, through Juan Carlos Aramburu, coadjutor Archbishop of Buenos Aires, to proscribe priests from making political or social declarations.Oscar Anzorena, 1987, p.53 One of the MSTM statements advocated socialization of the means of production (i.e. abolition of private ownership of the means of production), leading to its condemnation by the Catholic hierarchy.  Internal conflicts and dissolving  Various political conflicts inside the MTSM, with some advocating a more centralist version of Peronism, others a more horizontal organisation, and yet others supporting Guevarism rather than Peronism, led to a rupture in the movement in its 1973 encounter. Although the priests did not cease individual actions, the MSTM ceased to function as a united front. Along with the increase in repression during the Dirty War, the movement lost any capacity for action and finally dissolved itself a few years after Juan Per√≥n's death. Although a few of its members left the clergy, in general to marry, the majority remained priests. A 1988 study estimated that 67% of its members had kept their clerical status.Ortolani, Luis, La Iglesia de los oprimidos: Sacerdotes para el Tercer Mundo , in Pol√≠tica, cultura y sociedad en los '70, n¬∞6 2002  References  Catholic Church in Argentina Christian socialist organizations Catholicism and far-left politics History of Argentina (1955‚Äì1973) Liberation theology ","title":"Movement of Priests for the Third World"},{"id":"18584809","text":"Kirkor Kirkorov (; born March 4, 1968, in Varna as Krikor Kirkorian) is a retired boxer from Bulgaria, who competed for his native country at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.

Distributed by United Artists, Trade Winds was released on December 28, 1938. Plot Socialite Kay Kerrigan (Joan Bennett) is accused of fatally shooting millionaire cad Thomas Bruhme II (Sidney Blackmer). Kay blames the callous Bruhme for her sister's suicide but when he is confronted, he dismissively throws Kay a gun, but she angrily shoots him in the stomach. Police detectives Ben \\"Homer\\" Blodgett (Ralph Bellamy) and George Faulkner (Robert Elliott) find the body, with a gunshot in the back of Bruhme's head that is the fatal shot. After finding her handbag at the murder scene, the police are on Kay's trail. First she fakes a car accident, driving into the ocean, then makes arrangements to go to Hawaii. When she pawns a unique piece of jewelry, Police Commissioner Blackton (Thomas Mitchell) knows that Kay is alive and puts former detective Sam Wye (Fredric March) on the case. Kay with a brown wig, and travelling on a British passport as \\"Mary Holden\\" has taken a ship to the South Seas.

Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. .'' Description Mounted specimen at the National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo, Japan. Growing to an average total length of , with a maximum of , this is the largest member of its genus. It is slenderly built and gracefully proportioned with a large head. The crown of the head is covered with small scales. P. flavorviridis has a light olive or brown ground color, overlaid with elongated dark green or brownish blotches. The blotches have yellow edges, sometimes contain yellow spots, and frequently fuse to produce wavy stripes. The belly is whitish with dark coloring along the edges. Distribution and habitat Protobothrops flavoviridis is restricted to the Japanese Ryukyu Islands, including Okinawa and the Amami Islands. The type locality is \\"Amakarima Island (one of the Loo-Choo group)\\" (= Keramashima, Ryukyu Islands). It is common on the larger volcanic islands, but not present on the smaller coral islands. The species is often reported from the transition zone between palm forest and cultivated fields. It may also be found on rock walls and in old tombs and caves. Ecology The species is terrestrial and mostly nocturnal. It often enters homes and other structures in search of rats and mice. Bold and irritable, it can strike quickly and has a long reach. Unlike most pitvipers, P. flavoviridis is oviparous and lays eggs, rather than bearing live young. Mating takes place in early spring and up to 18 eggs are laid in mid-summer. The hatchlings, which emerge after an incubation period of 5‚Äì6 weeks, are in length and look the same as the adults. To reduce the population of P. flavoviridis on the island of Okinawa, the small Asian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus), was introduced in 1910. Although the effects of this introduction have not been studied, in other such cases the negative effects on species of native birds, mammals, and herpetofauna have been a source of concern for wildlife managers. Venom The incidence of snakebite in the Amami Islands is 2 per 1,000 people, which is considered very high. The venom of this species is of high toxicity, containing cytotoxin and haemorrhagin components, yet the fatality rate is less than 1%.. According to this report, 8901 snakebites from this snake are reported during 1964-2011 in Okinawa prefecture(Amami excluded). Among those, fatalities are 53. So, fatality rate is around 0.6%. A bite from a habu snake can cause nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and possibly death. There have been cases where victims report the loss of motor function in hands and legs following treatment. \\"An experimental study of emergency care for habu bites : estimation of amount of venom removed by suction\\". Ryukyu Medical Association. 5 (3): 196‚Äì200. 1982. If a bite victim receives medical care promptly, bites are not life- threatening. However, 6-8% do suffer permanent disability. values of 3.1, 4.3, 3.7, 2.7, 3.7, 3.8 mg/kg IV, 5.1 mg/kg IP and 6.0, 3.5-5.0, 4.5 mg/kg SC have been reported for the venom. Exploitation A bottle of \\"habushu\\". P. flavoviridis has been subject to overhunting for use in traditional liquor- making. On the island of Okinawa, this species is heavily collected, primarily for use in habushu („Éè„ÉñÈÖí). In this case, the sake is a liquor called awamori (Ê≥°Áõõ), alleged to have medicinal properties. As is typical with snake wine, the snakes may be inserted into the container while still alive, causing them to drown, or the snake may be stunned first and gutted while still alive. The production includes the body in the fermentation process and it is sold in bottles that may or may not retain the body of a snake (or other animals such as lizards or scorpions).

His paternal grandfather, whose ancestors were from Martinique, was a founder of the Century Association; his maternal grandfather was E. Peshine Smith, who with Commodore Perry completed commercial negotiations with Japan. Balestier studied for one year at Cornell University, and studied law for one summer (1883) at the University of Virginia. He worked for a short time at the Rochester Post Express, and later ran his own newspaper in Rochester.Rudyard Kipling, by Andrew Lycett, Phoenix, 2000, pages 296-317 At age 17 he began to send stories to the Atlantic Monthly, then edited by William Dean Howells. His first published work was a story entitled A Patent Philter, which was published serially in the daily New York Tribune in 1884. His first novel, A Fair Device, was published in the same year, as was his campaign biography for presidential candidate James G. Blaine. In 1886, he published A Victorious Defeat. He co-authored with Rudyard Kipling The Naulahka, published in 1892 after his death. Around 1884, the John W. Lovell Company in New York City made him editor of their magazine, Tid Bits, which he renamed Time and made a success. In the autumn of 1888, he moved to England to purchase literary copyrights for the Lovells. In this profession, he became acquainted with all the leading British authors, and particularly with Henry James, who wrote in 1890 that \\"I have lately seen much of the admirably acute and intelligent young Balestrier.\\"Cited in Benfey, page 53. In 1890, he formed a partnership with William Heinemann to establish the firm Heinemann & Balestier, which published the Review of Reviews in London, and the English Library series in continental Europe. At about that time, Edmund Gosse described him as a \\"mixture of suave Colonial French and the strained nervous New England blood.... a carefully dressed young-old man or elderly youth, clean-shaven, with smooth dark hair, thin nose, large sensitive ears, and whimsically mobile mouth.\\"Cited in Benfey, page 52. Balestier died in 1891 in Dresden, a victim of typhoid fever. Henry James traveled to Dresden for the funeral, and described it as follows: \\"The English chaplain read the service with sufficient yet not offensive sonority, and the arrangements were of an admirable, decorously grave German kind.\\"The American Essays of Henry James, edited by Leon Edel, Vintage, 1956.

It was distributed by United Artists. The screenplay was written by Kenneth Earl, Curtis Kenyon and Eddie Moran, based on the play of the same name by Salisbury Field and Margaret Mayo. Plot Even as they walk down the aisle to be joined in holy matrimony, Julie and Mike Abbott argue about her extensive involvement in the USO. For starters, her obligations are in the way of their honeymoon trip. After a short while of marriage, Mike is tired of Julie's constant working, not being able to spend much time with him at all. Also, the tabloids has a lot of theories about who is to pursue and catch her. On top of this, Julie is involved in arranging an engagement party for her ex-boyfriend, Larky, who is now going to marry her friend Lydia. The party prevents Mike and Julie to have the quiet dinner at home he had planned. The party is a catastrophe for Mike, who is appalled by all the snobs attending, and jealous of all the men pursuing his wife during the evening. Among others, Nicolai Cherupin, a Russian opera tenor who lives next door, is very keen on socializing with Julie. His wife tells Mike he should watch out, and Mike eventually throws the man out of their apartment. Julie is upset and tells Mike she disapproves of his mistrust in her. In the heat of the moment Mike suggests they replace their double bed with twin beds. A while later the couple make up, but the sound of opera singing reach them from outside. Mike demands they move to another building to get rid of the persistent singer. He isn't aware that the singer's wife, Sonya also has decided they should move to a new place, jealous of her husband's shameless behavior. Lydia also wants to move, since she is worried Larky will fall back in love with Julie. It turns put all three couples move to the same new building, and Julie has arranged for twin beds, apparently listening to Mike's angry remark during the party. The singer is convinced that Julie has followed him to the new building because she is infatuated with him. He starts to sing to her, and subsequently Mike decides to leave Julie, believing that she has led the singer on. Julie rejects the singer's attempt to meet her. He goes to a bar and gets plastered, and when he returns to the building, he is mistakenly let into Mike and Julie's apartment by the door man. The singer falls asleep in Mike's bed, where he is found the next morning by the very disturbed Julie. Mike boards a train to Canada, but is persuaded by a fellow traveler to return and win Julie back. Upon his arrival back to the apartment, Julie is trying to get rid of the singer. When Julie sees Mike coming, she makes the singer hide in a trunk to avoid him being even more jealous. The singer's clothes are mistaken for Mike's and the maid takes them to the cleaners. The singer tries to borrow and dress in Mike's clothes, but is constantly interrupted by visitors, forcing him to hide again. The maid eventually removes all clothes from the room and the singer is forced to escape by climbing out the window and down the fire escape. The singer is caught climbing by Lydia, who believes he is a burglar trying to get in, and he has to flee back up into the apartment bedroom. Larky comes around, finds the singer and starts chasing him. The singer manages to trick Larky, steal his clothes and lock him into a room. Still in his underwear, the singer meets Sonya when she arrives to the apartment with a private investigator who she has hired to follow her husband. Larky is released from his prison and the singer is found hidden, in his underwear, in the trunk. Mike and Julie decides to move again, and after they make up they choose to return to their old apartment.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/94145/Twin-Beds/ Main cast * George Brent as Mike Abbott * Joan Bennett as Julie Abbott * Mischa Auer as Nicolai Cherupin * Una Merkel as Lydia * Glenda Farrell as Sonya Cherupin * Ernest Truex as Larky * Margaret Hamilton as Norah Production The play had been filmed previously in 1920 and 1929.

It was built primarily to carry goods between Blackburn and Garston Dock on the River Mersey, and also to serve collieries in the Wigan area. Most of the line has now closed, except for the St Helens- to-Wigan section that forms part of the main line between Liverpool and the North. History The Lancashire Union Railway (LUR) was authorised by Parliamentary Act of 25 July 1864 to build a line from the Blackbrook branch of the St Helens Railway to Adlington on the Bolton-to-Preston line of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) near Chorley. This connected with existing lines between and St Helens. A further act of 13 July 1868 authorised an extension from to , and vested the section between (on the North Union Railway (NUR) north of Wigan) and (on the LYR near Blackburn) jointly with the LYR.Awdry, p.86 The whole line between St Helens and Blackburn opened to passengers on 1 December 1869.Butt Most passenger services were local between Blackburn and Wigan. LNWR trains travelled to the station later known as via Chorley and Boar's Head, but LYR trains used an alternative route between Chorley and the station later to become via .Suggitt (2003), p.131 The LUR also built a line, the \\"Whelley Loop\\", that bypassed Wigan to the east. It opened in 1869, mainly for freight.Suggitt (2004), pp.62-64 Stations at and Amberswood were open for only three months between 1 January and 1 March 1872. Additional connections were made to the NUR's West Coast Main Line north and south of Wigan in 1882 and 1886 respectively, and to other lines radiating from Wigan, thus allowing many trains to bypass Wigan.Suggitt (2004), p.64 The LUR company was vested jointly between the LNWR and LYR from 16 July 1883, until the two parent companies merged on 1 January 1922. The Blackburn-to- Chorley line closed to passengers on 4 January 1960 and to goods in 1966, although a short section between Cherry Tree and continued until 1968. The Chorley-to-Wigan line also closed to passengers in 1960, and to goods on 25 May 1971.Suggitt (2003), pp.132-6 The Whelley Loop survived until 1976.Suggitt (2004), p.65 The Wigan-to-St Helens section is still in use as part of the Liverpool to Wigan Line. Route The line began at Blackburn and followed the East Lancashire Line to Cherry Tree where the line branched to Feniscowles; there remnants of the bridge that carried the railway over the A6062 Livesey road can clearly be seen. From there the line is more or less undeveloped except that gravel and rails are missing; the line carries on where the M65 motorway is now, towards . The line between Withnell and Brinscall now forms Railway Park. Leaving Brinscall the line ran parallel to Lodge Bank Road and has been built on. At Brinscall Hall there is an old bridge carrying the railway over a footpath which is still intact. The line of the railway is still evident as it passes Wheelton Plantation towards Heapey. Before Heapey the line passes the former ROF Heapey site where there were sidings serving the plant. Heapey Station is now a private residence. The line had another siding which intersected two of the Heapey reservoirs before serving the Heapey Bleachworks; half of the bridge carrying the line over Higher House Lane to the works is still in situ. The line continued under a bridge under Tithe Barn Lane toward the Blackburn‚ÄìChorley road (again under an existing bridge) towards the arched viaduct at Botany Bay which carried the line over the Leeds and Liverpool Canal towards Chorley. The viaduct was demolished in 1968 to make way for the M61 motorway. The line continued past the North Gate estate and past the rear of St. Joseph's Church where it crossed Highfield Road and ran parallel to the Manchester to Preston Line on an embankment (now a footpath). The line headed towards where Friday Street car park now stands where it merged with the main line and entered Chorley station. The LUR uses the main line to Adlington where the line branched off and under the A6 along the Leeds-Liverpool Canal and on to White Bear Station. On leaving the station the line continued parallel to the canal bypassing the town of Blackrod to the east. The line followed the canal to the station at Red Rock. It continued south and split as it neared Pendlebury Lane. The first route ‚Äì the Whelley Loop which bypassed Wigan ‚Äì was built to serve collieries and iron works before the loop split at De Trafford junction joining the Manchester to Southport Line just before Hindley railway station to the East and to Amberswood to the West, before re-joining the LUR at Bryn or heading further south to Warrington via the NUR. The second route headed over a viaduct, the 13 bridges which carried the railway over the River Douglas. The bridges are known locally as the dominoes due to the position and shape of the pillars and are the only parts left standing. After the viaduct the line continued to Boar's Head before connecting with the Blackpool to Liverpool Line. The line then continued through Wigan North Western before heading towards Bryn and before eventually joining the St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway and continuing to that line's southern terminus at .

Biography Anthony Cerami received his undergraduate degree from Rutgers University and received a Ph.D. in 1967 from Rockefeller University, New York, completed postdoctoral fellowships at Harvard Medical School and at the Jackson Laboratory and served for 20 years as Professor and Head of the Laboratory of Medical Biochemistry, and Dean of Graduate and Postgraduate Studies at Rockefeller. In late 1986 Cerami was a founder of Alteon, Inc. which licensed patents filed by Rockefeller on work Cerami had done there; Cerami took a seat on the board of the company, was on the scientific advisory board, and received research funding from Alteon first at Rockefeller and then at Picower, and later through his consulting company and the \\"Kenneth S. Warren Laboratories, Inc.\\" In the spring of 1999 Alteon and Cerami terminated the consulting agreement and research agreement with Warren Labs, and Cerami resigned from the board. Cerami was one of 15 Rockefeller faculty who vocally opposed the appointment of David Baltimore as president of Rockefeller in 1989. Due in part to that disagreement, in 1991 Cerami left Rockefeller to found (with Jeffry Picower) the Picower Institute for Medical Research on the grounds of North Shore University Hospital. As of March 1998, Cerami was President of Cerami Consulting and was President and Trustee of the \\"Kenneth S. Warren Laboratories, Inc. The Picower Institute was closed down by Picower in 2001, and early the next year it was acquired by The Institute for Medical Research at North Shore-LIJ. As of 2001, Cerami was the director and lead researcher of the Kenneth S. Warren Institute, and in 2001, Warren Pharmaceuticals was formed to commercialize inventions made at the institute; Cerami was chairman of the board. Research Cerami has led research programs into genetic, metabolic and infectious diseases, with the goal of translating scientific discovery into drugs and diagnostic tests. He received funding from the Rockefeller Foundation to study neglected tropical diseases and traveled to Africa, where he became interested in the wasting, one of the symptoms of African sleeping sickness. He developed and validated a measurement of glycated hemoglobin to monitor control of blood sugar in people with diabetes, and a paper he published in 1985 using polyclonal antibodies against tumour necrosis factor-alpha was important in the field of immunology for demonstrating that TNF-alpha causes disease and blocking it could be a treatment. Work that he did while he was at Rockefeller on advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and protein cross-linking and their roles in metabolic diseases and aging was patented by Rockfeller and licensed to Alteon Inc. in 1987 and in 1992 the company licensed further work that Cerami did on the use of pimagedine to reduce AGEs. At the Warren institutes, he led work on erythropoietin derivatives that were called \\"tissue protective cytokines\\"; this work was licensed to Warren Pharmaceuticals and through them to Lundbeck in 2001; the development program was terminated in 2007. He is the recipient the Luft Award in Diabetes and the Frederick Banting Medal for Scientific Achievement, awarded by the American Diabetes Association in recognition of his lifelong work on diabetes.

He was born in Spain(as well as London?) and has also lived in Cyprus and Dubai, where he oversees a number of property developments. He has served as the vice-president in charge of player recruitment for Newcastle United and the co-owner of Charlton Athletic. He is a father and regularly holds fundraisers for children's charity, Variety Club.  Newcastle United  Jimenez acted as a football agent before being appointed as vice president (player recruitment) at Newcastle United, owing to his extensive football contacts. During his time at the club, he played a key role in completing deals for Jon√°s Guti√©rrez, Fabricio Coloccini, Ignacio Gonz√°lez and Xisco. Signing Guti√©rrez is often labeled his biggest achievement, but his other recruits were less successful. Coloccini cost ¬£9,000,000 and was part of the team that got relegated in 2008, and Xisco cost nearly ¬£6,000,000 but only made nine appearances for the club in five years. Jimenez left the club after manager Kevin Keegan resigned, and the club was put up for sale. In 2010, he took over Charlton Athletic with fellow businessman Michael Slater. He is still on the board. Since leaving Newcastle, Keegan has accused Jimenez of preventing midfielder Luka Modric's transfer to Newcastle. Jimenez denies the accusation, claiming that owner Mike Ashley stopped the deal. Keegan stated that Jimenez feared the player's ability to cope with the physical nature of the Premier League and did not want to take the risk. Jimenez hit back by claiming that Keegan also prevented a number of deals, such as the opportunity to and he went to go somewhere too sign Karim Benzema and Samir Nasri.

Raised in London, she began illustrating books in the early 1930s and began painting exhibition pieces after becoming the recipient of a small legacy in 1934, working in watercolours and oil paint. Early life Grace Golden (Associate of the Royal College of Art) was born to a working-class family in east London. After her education at the City of London School for Girls, she won a scholarship to the Chelsea College of Art, where she studied from 1920 to 1923. She progressed from there to the Royal College of Art, where she first studied and later taught from 1926 to 1927. She also studied at the Regent Street Polytechnic for a time. Career \\"A West-End London Street Scene\\" (ca 1945); clearly depicting Regent Street, Golden imagines future post-war prosperity Her career in book illustration began in the early 1930s. She received a small legacy in 1934 which enabled her to work on exhibition pieces. Working in both watercolours and oil paint, she exhibited at the Royal Academy, as well as the Fine Art Society and Leicester Galleries. Golden received a commission from The Pilgrim Trust to make illustrations of historic buildings and landmarks during World War II, as well as her work appearing in touring exhibitions. Golden received a sketching permit from the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, which allowed her to draw and paint in public during the war. WAAC also purchased her painting An Emergency Food Office which showed people queuing for ration books. Later, she worked for the Ministry of Information ‚Äì painstakingly producing illustrations which were used to aid the reading of educational books. Posters promoting safe working practice were produced from her illustrations, many of which were used to stress the hazards of a mixed sex workforce within wartime manufacturing environments, with slogans such as ‚ÄòKeep your mind on the job ‚Äì and save your knuckles‚Äô. Golden had always been interested in the working life of the Thames. She had witnessed the lives of the industrious people who were employed near and on the river from the age of five, when her parents had moved to a five-storey house at the City End of Southwark Bridge. This fascination led to her producing her book Old Bankside which contained some fifty-one illustrations of the wharfs and alleys alongside the Thames between Blackfriars Bridge and London Bridge. Years later, Sam Wanamaker invited Golden to become the honorary archivist to his Globe Theatre project, which was based in the same part of London. Her work also frequently appeared in the Swift annual (1957‚Äì1961). Final years Grace Golden died on 3 June 1993, aged 89 at the Royal Free Hospital. She had, during her last years, become something of a recluse, having closed herself off from the world around her and living a life of frugality and simplicity. Her work, which was popular with many writers, including Enid Blyton, will be remembered for its attention to detail, which now makes her work of distinctive historical value. Some of her work is exhibited at the Tate Gallery and The National Archives. At Golders Green Crematorium, London, there is a commemorative plaque to her.

The game is currently published by Valofe. The game's primary setting is a fantasy-themed alternate history Earth composed of a diverse blend of historical, cultural, allegorical, and mythological elements. The game world is primarily modeled after real-world geography with accessible locations on six of the seven continents as well as the mythical floating continent of Atlantis from which the game's name is derived. Gameplay mercenaries accompanied by two groups of mobs attacking an enemy mob group. Atlantica Online is a turn-based tactical MMORPG in which the player primarily assumes the role of a descendant of the Atlantean people. The primary goal of the game is to search for your ancestral home to save the world from the effects of Oriharukon, a substance created by the ancient Atlanteans. The player's journey spans the globe and transcends time in search of clues that will lead to the lost civilization. The player battles men, monsters, and machines that have been corrupted by the Oriharukon's Influence.http://www.ign.com/games/atlantica-online/pc-14261327 The game design puts a strong emphasis on membership in guilds, which are permitted to own and customize towns like a business, profiting from the transactions that take place within their town. Up to ten guilds can unite under a single banner to form a Nation and go to war with other nations. Guilds and nations offer a variety of benefits to their members including passive boosts, guild-oriented dungeons, and ‚ÄòGuild Crafting‚Äô where every member of a guild works together to complete a single craft. Players can also own their own houses. In addition to the main quest line, the game features a variety of supplementary side quests rich with history and lore, a complex skill system, an in-depth crafting system, and a player housing system. As players journey through the world of Atlantica Online, their characters and mercenaries grow and develop, gaining access to new, more powerful skills and equipment along the way. As the level cap has advanced, the developers have implemented a set of milestones in the leveling structure with associated level-specific quest lines that enable players access to powerful class- specific skills known as ‚Äútalents‚Äù upon completion. Players can recruit up to eight mercenaries to join them in their travels, and each can increase in experience level. There are relatively few equipment options available to players apart from a few class-specific armor sets and limited-time ‚Äòlegendary items‚Äô. Players can combine armor effects through an \\"enchantment\\" process. The game's battle system is turn-based. When a player character and an enemy character come into contact with each other on the game map, both parties are transported into an instance where the battle takes place. During battle other players' groups and other monster groups may join in to a maximum of three groups on each side. In battle, the characters of each party are positioned on a 3x3 grid. Using attacks and abilities, the goal is to beat the opponent. The rewards include experience points and loot like the game's virtual currency, various materials, pieces of equipment etc. Player versus player combat operates through this system. There are two leagues players can join, as well as daily, weekly, and monthly fights and championships. The Tactical battle system (TBS) is a separate, additional combat system that differs in many respects from the original system. Players and their adversaries are placed in a landscape where moving around characters freely is possible. New decision impacts like the possibility to take cover, different height levels and the movement speed of specific characters are added while certain mechanics of the original combat system are removed. Players complete story-based and objective-driven missions in the tactical battle system. A dungeon in Atlantica Online is an instance region that can be opened with a special key and allows up to three players to clean the dungeon of enemies for a final reward in addition to the normal loot. Raid dungeons were added in 2012. =Setting= The world of Atlantica Online features real world locations mixed with mythological and fantasy elements. Countries like Germany and China are represented, with cities like Munich, Moscow, and Sapporo as visitable hubs that offer services like banks, hospitals, the marketplace where players can trade goods with each other and other facilities. Though the locations on the map feature climates similar to their real world counterparts, the architecture is often a generic recreation of well known structure types, such as the cities in Eastern Europe and Japan. The locations are based on real world locations, but are often geographically out of place and altered for effect. Most of the civilizations represented are anachronistic: Rome is set in the Holy Roman Empire, while Great Britain is independent, the Ottoman Empire reigns in Turkey, Southeast Asia resembles ancient Indian kingdoms before Western colonization and Islamic influence, and North America is caught up in the Industrial Revolution. Development The North American English version, available worldwide, was first distributed by the USA subsidiary company NDOORS Interactive, Inc..Closed Beta Press Release A closed beta version was made available to FilePlanet subscribers on July 15, 2008. The first phase of the open beta ended on July 28, 2008; the start of the second phase began on August 7, 2008. On October 30, 2008 at 11a.m. PDT, Atlantica Online ended its beta period and began its official run at 6p.m. PDT on October 30, 2008. NDOORS also launches Atlantica Online Germany, for European players, on the October 21. The closed Beta started on September 1 and ended after a month. The Chinese company The9 has obtained exclusive rights for distributing and operating Atlantica Online in China. Russian localized version open beta test started May 12, 2010 supported by Innova Systems company. Atlantica's publisher and developer, Valofe, regularly releases new content updates. Non-Korean servers generally receive the updates after the Korean servers. Updates include, for instance, new dungeons, quests, NPCs, skills, mercenaries, outfits, equipment, mounts, and community features. Updates also balance the game's elements. Implemented on August 17, 2010, the Troy Story Arc is a series of 'missions' following the format of the Tactical Battle System (TBS) that was introduced in the same patch. In each mission one or more players take part in a fantasy version of the Trojan War. The rewards include generous amounts of experience points and valuable chests containing loot. In April 2013, the first part of the major content update 'Rise of Atlantis' was released. May 2013 saw the second part and the third part is scheduled for June 2013. Previously with The Trojan War and the Romance of the Three Kingdom's reaching a great feedback from the players it was time to add in a new area, the Mythical region of Atlantis, which was divided by two, West and Eastern Atlantis. This update was the most extensive to that date, introducing a new continent to explore (mythical Atlantis), new mercenary classes, new equipment, content and several changes to other features of the game. Implemented on April 8, 2014, (Europe) the Mayan Hero Arc is the start of the new \\"Heroes\\" class line following the format of the Tactical Battle System (TBS) that was introduced previously in some raids and other more classic Content. In each mission one or more players take part in a fantasy version of the ancient mythology. The rewards can be very rewarding if the highest level of content is done. Future content to come will revolution the game, such as Whip using Mercenary's, a Corps Feature and other things that are planned/set to hit the Korean Servers in 2014 and early 2015. On December 18, 2008, the North American continent was added, which features New York City as a new explorable city and the United States and Mexico as explorable countries. These contain a few dungeons, but greatly expand the map in Atlantica. Developers have also mentioned the possibility of adding the continents of the Southern Hemisphere, excluding Antarctica. Reception Reception of Atlantica Online has been largely positive. The game received a number of awards upon release in 2008. Atlantica Online was selected as an official game for the Korean Game and Game World Championship (GNGWC) in 2008 and 2009 and won the prestigious Golden Plume Award for Best Foreign Online Game at the 2008 China Digital Entertainment Expo and Conference (ChinaJoy). The game is acclaimed for its innovative turn-based battle system and its integration with community features. Danny Gourley of Ten Ton Hammer praised its gameplay, stating \\"it requires gamers to think a little instead of just mashing buttons\\".

The mixed assortment of remains deposited in this one location provide a unique opportunity to scientists to study the paleoecology of the area in the late Jurassic period. In June 2008 following three weeks of excavation, paleontologists from the Burpee Museum of Natural History and Western Illinois University announced major recent discoveries made at the site, including a probable Stegosaurus, four sauropods, and at least two carnivorous dinosaurs. The researchers expressed confidence that future excavations at the site will come to rival those produced from Dinosaur National Monument and the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, two major sources of giant Jurassic reptile remains. The site is located on federal land overseen by the United States Bureau of Land Management and is part of the Morrison Formation, which is a significant source for the largest known dinosaur remains. Paleogeographic evidence indicates that the Hanksville-Burpee Quarry area was situated at the bend of a large river during time of sediment deposition. Researchers point to the large number of animal remains collected at the single location, and suggest the river bend acted as a trap for carcasses of large animals that died upriver and were carried downstream by high waters.

It was written by the series' creator and executive producer Tina Fey, and was directed by Michael Engler. It first aired on February 8, 2007 in the United States. Guest stars in this episode include Katrina Bowden, Rachel Dratch, Rachel Hamilton, John Lutz, Maulik Pancholy, Keith Powell, Lonny Ross, Isabella Rossellini, Sherri Shepherd, Jason Sudeikis and Mark Zimmerman. Joy Behar appeared as herself in the episode. This episode focuses on the events of Valentine's Day for the cast and crew of TGS with Tracy Jordan, a fictional sketch comedy series. Liz Lemon (played by Tina Fey) receives a mysterious gift; Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) comments that he hates Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski); Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) forgets Valentine's Day, which also happens to be his wife, Paula's (Paula Pell) birthday; Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) divorce from Bianca (Isabella Rossellini) is made official; the writers believe that Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden) has romantic feelings for Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer); and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tries to spend a night with his wife, Angie Jordan (Sherri Shephard). Plot Jack's wife, Bianca, asks to finalize their divorce to which Jack agree, demanding various things in their settlement all to which she agrees, and the divorce is set for the next day. It is Valentine's Day, although the TGS cast and crew still have to work all night. Frank reveals that he hates Jenna when he always chooses to \\"kill\\" Jenna in a game of \\"Marry, Boff, Kill\\". Frank believes that Jenna is \\"phony\\", and Jenna tries many times to redeem herself with Frank, with reasons such as her participation in Vagina Day: \\"a charity event founded by a group of celebrities who have for whatever reason never been asked to participate in The Vagina Monologues.\\" Eventually, in her final confrontation with Frank, she farts, but Frank is happy, telling her that that is the first real thing she has done, and the two reconcile. Another game of \\"Marry, Boff, Kill\\" leads some of the writers into believing that Cerie (who has been having problems with her fianc√©, Aris, as he wants a Greek Orthodox wedding, but she disagrees with the church's position on Cyprus) has feelings for Kenneth when she chooses to \\"boff\\" him. The writers send the pair off to get candy for the night. Kenneth and Cerie take a walk around Rockefeller Center, and Cerie reveals that she is not attracted to Kenneth but tells him that he can tell the others that the two made out. However, Kenneth fails to convince the writers that he has done so when he shows them a pair of male underpants, which he claims belong to Cerie. Jack asks Tracy to have a drink with him to celebrate his impending divorce, but Tracy has to leave early to celebrate Valentine's Day with his wife through \\"role-play\\". As Jack gets more and more drunk, he reveals that he still has various fantasies about his wife from grabbing one of her breasts to her getting various terminal diseases with him by her bedside. Eventually, he picks up a prostitute (Rachel Dratch), and the two interrupt Tracy and Angie's Valentine's Day at the Soho Grand Hotel. Angie, upset that their Valentine's Day is ruined, demands that Tracy get rid of Jack and the prostitute, so he calls Liz for help. Liz gets Jack and the drunk prostitute out of the hotel, and Liz tells Jack that his relationship with his wife is sick and presents him with a scenario of \\"Marry, Boff, Kill\\", all with his wife, causing Jack to say that he wants to do all of the three but promises Liz that he will get over his wife, and the two leave the prostitute in the street. The next day, Jack and Bianca sign the divorce papers, and Bianca begs Jack not to sell the Arby's that he had gotten in their settlement. He promises not to do so, but will let the place shut down and become desolate. The two argue, and the sexual tension between the two escalate, until Bianca tears herself away from Jack and leaves. Pete has forgotten that it is Valentine's Day, which also happens to be his wife's birthday. He spends the night running around the city to try to find Valentine's Day and birthday presents for his wife, only to lose the balloons that he had bought for his wife. Liz has received a gift of chocolate-covered cherries and flowers from a supposed secret admirer. The \\"admirer\\" turns out to be \\"a law stylist\\", (Jason Sudeikis) and the gifts turn out to be for his girlfriend, Liz Lemler, who works in the accounting department at TGS. However, he tells Liz to keep the flowers but asks for a picture of her with the flowers and her ID to prove to his girlfriend that he did indeed get her something for Valentine's Day. Reception \\"Up All Night\\" brought in an average of 5.2 million viewers. The episode also achieved a 2.5/6 in the key 18- to 49-year-old demographic. The 2.5 refers to 2.5% of all 18- to 49-year- olds in the U.S., and the 6 refers to 6% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast in the U.S.. Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote that \\"it would be nearly impossible to measure up to last week's utterly manic introduction of Prince Gerhardt [Paul Ruebens], so forgive 30 Rock if this week's outing was 'merely' very amusing at times.\\" He added that compared to Jack's storyline, he \\"actually wore more grins watching the microscopic B-story with the writers, playing Marry, Boff, Kill.\\" Robert Canning of IGN thought that \\"the Valentine's Day episode of 30 Rock gave us a big surprise: a low-key half hour from a show known for being over the top,\\" adding that this was \\"a pleasant surprise\\". He said that this episode \\"proved that [30 Rock] could make with the funny no matter what the tone\\". Canning rated this episode 8.5 out of 10.

The project is run by political science professors and forecasting experts, one of which is J. Scott Armstrong. All procedures, data, and results are fully disclosed and freely available online. The project started in March 2004 to demonstrate the benefits of combining forecasts. In averaging forecasts within and across different forecasting methods, the combined PollyVote forecast provided highly accurate predictions of the two-party popular vote shares for the last three U.S. presidential elections.  History  The PollyVote was created in March 2004 by marketing and forecasting expert J. Scott Armstrong and political science professors Alfred Cuz√°n and Randall Jones. The goal at that time was to apply the combination principle in forecasting to predict President Bush's share of the two-party popular vote (omitting minor candidates) in the 2004 presidential election. Until Election Day in November of the same year, the researchers collected data from 268 polls, 10 quantitative models, and 246 daily market prices from the Iowa Electronic Markets vote-share market. In each of the last three months prior to the election, they also administered a survey with a panel of 17 experts on US politics, asking them for their predictions. The forecasts were first combined within each component method by averaging recent polls, the IEM prediction market forecasts from the previous week, and averaging the predictions of the quantitative models. Then, the researchers averaged the forecasts across the four component methods. The resulting forecast was named the PollyVote. From March to November, the forecasts were initially updated weekly, and then, twice a week. The forecasts were published at the Political Forecasting Special Interest Group at forprin.com. In 2007, Andreas Graefe joined the PollyVote team and helped to launch the PollyVote.com website prior to the 2008 U.S. presidential election. For predicting the 2008 election, the general structure of the PollyVote remained unchanged; the PollyVote combined forecasts within and across the same four component methods as in 2004. However, some changes were made at the level of the component methods. Instead of averaging recent polls themselves, the PollyVote team used the RCP poll average by RealClearPolitics as the polls component. In addition, the advantage of the leading candidate was discounted (or damped) using the approach suggested by Jim Campbell. The first PollyVote forecast for the 2008 election was published in August 2007, 14 months prior to Election Day, and was updated daily. For forecasting the 2012 election, a fifth component called \\"index models\\" was added to the PollyVote. This component captured information from quantitative models that use a different method and rely on different information than the traditional political economy models. In particular, the index models capture information about the campaign, such as the candidates' perceived issue-handling competence, their leadership skills, their biographies or the influence of other factors such as whether the incumbent government faced some scandal. The first forecast for the 2012 election was published on January 1, 2011, almost two years prior to Election Day. As in 2008, the forecasts were updated daily, or whenever new information became available. In 2013, the PollyVote was launched in Germany to predict the German federal election of the same year. For the presidential election in 2016, PollyVote augmented their reporting with computational writing for the campaign coverage campaign coverage, publishing articles for all of their (intermediate) predictions on their Blog.  Method  The PollyVote demonstrates the benefits of combining forecasts by averaging predictions within and across several component methods. In its application for the U.S. presidential election, the PollyVote is currently based on five component methods: polls, prediction markets, expert judgment, political economy models, and index models. The PollyVote predicts the share of the popular two-party vote achieved by the candidate of the incumbent party.  Accuracy of the PollyVote  The PollyVote published forecasts prior to each of the three U.S. presidential elections, the 2006 U.S. House of Representatives election, and the 2013 German federal election. In addition, one analysis tested how the PollyVote would have performed for the three elections from 1992 to 2000. As expected, the application of the forecasting principles has led to accurate forecasts. Surprisingly, however, across the three U.S. Presidential elections, the forecast error was always lower than the error of each component methods. Comparisons have also been made with other methods. For example, forecasts of the 2012 election were also substantially more accurate than the closely watched forecasts from Nate Silver's model at FiveThirtyEight.com. = 2004 U.S. presidential election= The 2004 PollyVote was launched in March 2004 and forecast a victory for President Bush over the 8 months that it was making forecasts. The final forecast published on the morning of the election predicted that President would receive 51.5% of the popular two-party vote, an error of 0.3 percentage points. = 2008 U.S. presidential election= The 2008 PollyVote was launched in August 2007 and forecast a victory for Barack Obama over the 14 months that it was making daily forecasts. On Election Eve, it predicted that Obama would receive 53.0% of the popular two-party vote, an error of 0.7 percentage points. = 2012 U.S. presidential election= The 2012 PollyVote was launched in January 2011 and forecast a victory for President Obama over the 22 months that it was making daily forecasts. On Election Eve, it predicted that Obama would receive 51.0% of the popular two-party vote, an error of 0.9 percentage points. = 2016 U.S. presidential election= The 2016 PollyVote predicted that Hillary Clinton would win both popular vote and electoral vote. \\"Clinton will win the popular vote by 5.0 percentage points in the two-party vote (52.5% vs. 47.5%). ... Clinton‚Äôs chance to win the popular vote is above 99%. In terms of the Electoral College, Polly predicts Clinton to receive 323 electoral votes compared to 215 for Trump.\\" = 2006 US House of Representatives election = PollyVote predicted the outcome of the 2006 U.S. House of Representatives Elections, forecasting that the Republicans would lose 23 seats, and thus, their majority in the House. The Republicans lost 30 seats and the House majority in those elections. Perception The results of the PollyVote project are regularly published in the academic community. Prior to the past elections, forecasts were published in Foresight and the New Scientist. Analyses of the accuracy of the PollyVote were published in the International Journal of Forecasting and PS: Political Science & Politics. In addition, scholars have referenced the PollyVote as a benchmark when assessing the validity of U.S. presidential election forecasts. To date, the PollyVote predictions have been rarely cited in the popular press. In their IJF paper, the PollyVote team discusses several reasons why this might be the case: (1) people have difficulties to understand the benefits of combining, (2) people wrongly believe that they can identify the best forecast, and (3) people think that the method of calculating averages is too simple. Another possible reason is that the PollyVote predictions are very stable and rarely change, whereas election observers and journalists are interested in excitement and newsworthiness.

London: The Tantivy Press (1976): 68. No. 38 is introduced as \\"another C major Festive Symphony.\\" by Joseph Haydn. The symphony was composed some time between 1765 and 1769. Because of the virtuosic oboe parts in the final two movements, it has been suggested that the work's composition may have coincided with the employ of the oboist Vittorino Colombazzo in the fall of 1768.Brown, A. Peter, The Symphonic Repertoire (Volume 2). Indiana University Press (), pp. 109-112 (2002). The symphony is popularly called the Echo Symphony, a nickname that, like all other named Haydn symphonies, did not originate with the composer. Nickname (Echo) It is typically referred to as the \\"Echo\\" Symphony because of the use of mimicry motif (or echo) in the cadential phrasing of the second movement. The echo effect is created by scoring the leading line for unmuted first violins and the response from muted second violins.Hodgson (1976): 68:\\"Haydn has by now assimilated his own inventions in syncopation and echo effect. The answering between first and second violins is the more fascinating since only the seconds are muted and the tonal contrast is obvious even to the most untutored ear.\\" This innovation in scoring expands upon an earlier common baroque practice of cadential phrase-repetition. Movements The work is scored for two oboes, bassoon, two horns, trumpets, timpani and strings with continuo.H. C. Robbins Landon, The Symphonies of Joseph Haydn. London: Universal Edition & Rockliff (1955): 673. \\"2 ob., 2 cor. in C (prob. alto), 2 clarini (trpt.), timp., str. [fag., cemb.]. In many sources, trpt. and timp. omitted.\\" There are four movements: #Allegro di molto, #Andante molto in F major, #Menuet e Trio (Trio in F major), #Allegro di molto, The \\"Echo\\" slow movement is scored for strings only. The trio of the minuet contains a virtuosic solo oboe part that spans the entire range of the instrument and contains leaps of almost two octaves. The finale is another showpiece for the solo oboe which includes virtuosic display, notes held fermata and a spot for a cadenza. It is not in typical concerto form, but is a mixture between concerto and sonata forms. It has been suggested that the first two movements were composed before Haydn knew of the engagement with the soloist Colombazzo as they have a completely different character than the two oboe-centric movements that round up the work.

It was published in French as La Danseuse de Shamakha in 1918 and translated into English in 1923 by Rose Wilder. After moving to Europe, Ohanian danced traditional dances for audiences, gave lectures on poetry, and was an active member in intellectual and political circles. She eventually moved to Mexico. She is the author of some 15 publications including autobiographical volumes and books on culture and politics.Ohanian, Armen. La Danseuse de Shamakha. Foreword by Anatole France.

The story is about a man who goes on a murder spree after being exposed to marijuana for the first time. Plot King Turner is in a deep funk after his wife, Eleanor, left him. He's fallen in with a pair of reprobates, Bill Evans and Wash Gordon, who are more interested in him as the butt of their jokes than as a friend. One night they drag King and a girl named Vinnie to a \\"ranch\\"‚Äîa sort of speakeasy where people smoke \\"grass\\". After getting high, King hallucinates that Vinnie is his ex-wife and begins chasing her around the room. Bill hands him a knife as a lark and tells him to \\"pin her down.\\" King does exactly that and then flees the room. He finds a sleeping bouncer and steals the man's gun. Before he can leave the ranch, a couple police officers arrive, but King manages to sneak past them. King evades pursuit and hides out in the phone booth of a candy store. While there, a police officer enters and walks towards the store's proprietor to buy a numbers ticket, but King, paranoid from the marijuana, thinks the officer is there to arrest him, and responds by gunning the man down. King flees the store and heads to the hotel where his ex-wife is living. Eleanor agrees to talk with King in her room. After hearing his story, she tries to calm him down but with little effect. She convinces him to let her order some sandwiches and coffee from room service. On the phone, she tells the clerk that she wants her order fixed \\"just like the other night,\\" referring to the fact that she'd had sleeping powder added to her coffee to help with insomnia. But before the order can arrive, King grows paranoid that Eleanor has betrayed him to the police. When he thinks room service is taking too long, King shoots Eleanor and flees the room. With nowhere else to go, he heads back to his apartment, where the police are waiting for him. King escapes onto the ledge of the building. Detective Spillane, the officer in charge of catching him, follows him out, but before he can save him, King jumps to his death. The book ends with a final twist‚Äîback in her apartment Vinnie is alive and well, telling a friend about the gag she, Bill and Wash had pulled on King. Bill had only handed King a butter knife, and when King stabbed her, Vinnie took a ketchup-soaked piece of bread and squeezed it to simulate blood. Vinnie is completely unaware of subsequent events and thinks the whole situation hilarious, though her friend has doubts. The story ends with Detective Spillane arriving and Vinnie's friend thinking, \\"He's either a bill collector or a plainclothesman ... or maybe a little of both.\\" Portrayal of Police Officers Detective Spillane appears throughout the story as a competent officer who is simply one step behind King, and genuinely wants to help him. However the rest of the police force does not fare so well. When the two officers arrive at the ranch, the proprietor lets them in without making any effort to hide the illicit behavior inside, indicating that the officers are on the take. Likewise, the officer King shoots was attempting to purchase an illegal numbers ticket from the owner of the candy store. Depiction of Marijuana Woolrich's depiction of marijuana is in keeping with popular views of the time which saw the drug as causing \\"insanity, criminality, and death,\\" according to Federal Bureau of Narcotics Commissioner Harry J. AnslingerHarry J. Anslinger, Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, quoted by Professor Charles Whitebread in \\"The History of the Non-Medical Use of Drugs in the United States\\". In his efforts to circumscribe marijuana use, Anslinger disseminated stories based on the trope of \\"marijuana-crime-insanity\\", such as allegedly evidenced by the Victor Licata case in which the 21-year-old murdered his family with an axe. (Licata was schizophrenic with homicidal tendencies; there is no evidence that marijuana was a factor in the killings.) Inhaling marijuana smoke initially makes King lethargic and he loses all sense of time‚Äîsomething that continues throughout the story as he thinks several days have gone by despite it being the same night; his murder of Eleanor is prompted by his insistence that a half-hour has passed since she ordered room service, when in fact it was only five minutes. King and his friends also experience munchies which causes Bill to raid the ranch's kitchen for food; King later notes that \\"the hempseeds create a false, insatiable appetite.\\" King's lethargy soon turns to hallucinations and paranoia, which causes him to embark upon his murder spree. Though King and his friends are all middle class, they travel to Hell's Kitchen, an area that had been a center for bootleggers during Prohibition. The \\"ranch\\" operates similarly to a speakeasy‚Äîthe proprietor bribes local police officers, visitors leave their cars several blocks away so as not to draw attention to the ranch, and a bouncer guards the door, inspecting each person through a peephole before letting them enter. Peculiarly, Woolrich has the ranch operate as a buffet, with each visitor paying a cover charge in exchange for an unlimited amount of marijuana. The term \\"ranch\\" is Woolrich's own invention, derived from the slang term for marijuana, \\"grass.\\" Characters also refer to it as \\"reefer,\\" though they always describe the joints as cigarettes. Publication history Marijuana first appeared in the May 3, 1941 edition of Detective Fiction Weekly. Dell later published it as volume 11 of their 10 Cent Book line.Cornell Woolrich bibliography Like the other books of this series, original editions are now collectors' items that can sell for more than $100.Marihuana by Cornell Woolrich References 1941 American novels Novels by Cornell Woolrich Works published under a pseudonym 1941 in cannabis ","title":"Marihuana (novel)"},{"id":"18585853","text":"Sin at-tamyiz (the \\"age of discernment\\") refers to the age at which a child is able to care for him or herself, no longer requiring adult assistance to eat, dress, or clean themselves.

The presidency armies were named after the presidencies: the Bengal Army, the Madras Army and the Bombay Army. Initially, only Europeans served as commissioned or non-commissioned officers. In time, Indian Army units were garrisoned from Peshawar in the north, to Sind in the west, and to Rangoon in the east. The army was engaged in the wars to extend British control in India (the Mysore, Maratha and Sikh wars) and beyond (the Burma, Afghan, First and Second Opium Wars, and the Expedition to Abyssinia). The presidency armies, like the presidencies themselves, belonged to the Company until the Indian Rebellion of 1857, when the Crown took over the Company and its three armies. In 1895 the three presidency armies were merged into a united Indian Army. Origin The origin of the British Indian Army and subsequently the army of independent India lies in the origins of the Presidency Armies which preceded them. The first purely Indian troops employed by the British were watchmen employed in each of the Presidencies of the British East India Company to protect their trading stations. These were all placed in 1748 under one Commander-in-Chief, Major-General Stringer Lawrence who is regarded as the \\"Father of the Indian Army\\". From the mid-eighteenth century, the East India Company began to maintain armies at each of its three main stations, or Presidencies of British India, at Calcutta (Bengal), Madras and Bombay. The Bengal Army, Madras Army, and Bombay Army were quite distinct, each with its own Regiments and cadre of European officers. All three armies contained European regiments in which both the officers and men were Europeans, as well as a larger number of 'Native' regiments, in which the officers were Europeans and the other ranks were Indians. They included Artillery, Cavalry and Infantry regiments, so historical sources refer to the Bengal/Madras/Bombay Artillery/Cavalry/Infantry (the latter often termed \\"Native Infantry\\" or \\"N.I.\\"). From the mid-eighteenth century onwards, the Crown began to dispatch regiments of the regular British Army to India, to reinforce the Company's armies. These troops are often referred to as \\"H.M.'s Regiments\\" or \\"Royal regiments\\". By 1824, the size of the combined armies of Bengal, Madras, and Bombay was about 200,000 and had at least 170 sepoy and 16 European regiments. In 1844 the combined average strength of the three armies was 235,446 native and 14,584 European. Regimental organisation In 1757, Robert Clive came up with the idea of sepoy battalions for the Bengal Presidency. These would be Indian soldiers, armed, dressed, and trained the same as the \\"red coats\\" (British soldiers), and commanded by a nucleus of British officers. The Madras Presidency followed suit with six battalions in 1759, followed by the Bombay Presidency in 1767. Recruitment in all cases was done locally, with battalions each drawn from single castes, and from specific communities, villages, and families. Regular cavalry regiments were raised in 1784, of which only three survived the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Irregular cavalry were raised by the \\"silladar system\\" employed by rulers of Indian states.In the \\"silladar\\" system, the soldier provided his own horse, weapons, and military attire as prescribed, for which he received in exchange from the state a lump sum grant and maintenance grants from time to time. Irregular cavalry regiments had very few British officers. In addition, native artillery and pioneers (referred to later as Sappers and Miners) were also raised. Between 1796 and 1804, a regimental system on two battalion basis was introduced. The battalions were only theoretically linked together and shared no esprit de corps. The number of British officers went up to 22 per battalion, which diminished the importance of native officers. Control by Regimental commanders was excessive and exasperating to the battalions, and the system was reverted in 1824. Thereafter, units were formed into single battalion regiments, which were numbered per their seniority of raising. After 1857 Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the consequent takeover of power by the British government from the East India Company, its European regiments were amalgamated in 1860 with the British Army, but its 'Native' regiments were not. The three separate Presidency Armies therefore continued to exist, and their European officers continued to be listed as members of the Bengal, Madras or Bombay Army rather than the British Army. However, the Presidency Armies began to be described collectively as the Indian Army. Another change resulting from the Indian Rebellion of 1857 was that henceforward artillery was confined to the British Army. In 1895, the separate Presidency Armies were at last abolished and a fully unified Indian Army came into being. As before, its British officers were not members of the British Army, though as young subalterns they did serve for a year with a British Army regiment as part of their training before taking up permanent commissions with their Indian Army regiment.

One of the most powerful women of the Italian Renaissance, she was born in Rome around 1483 to Lucrezia Normanni and Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, later Pope Julius II. Felice was well educated, became accepted into close courtly circles of aristocratic families, and formed friendships with scholars and poets through her education and genuine interest in humanism. Through the influence of her father, including an arranged marriage to Gian Giordano Orsini, she wielded extraordinary wealth and influence both within and beyond the Roman Curia. In particular, she negotiated a peace between Julius II and the Queen of France, and held the position of Orsini Signora for over a decade following the death of her husband in 1517. Felice further increased her power through a castle that she bought with money received from her father, the Castle at Palo, and through her involvement in the grain trade. Felice gave birth to two sons, Francesco and Girolamo, choosing the second as the heir to the Orsini fortune (and thus ensuring a rivalry with her stepson, Napoleone), as well as two daughters, Julia and Clarice; another child died during infancy. Felice's children married into prominent families: the Colonna, Sforza, Borghese, Gonzaga, and Appiani. Her Orsini offspring became the dukes of Bracciano and their lines maintained this role until 1699, when the family line became extinct. Felice's legacy lasts to this day, as Prof. Caroline Murphy has identified her in two pieces of art: Raphael's The Mass at Bolsena, and Sebastiano del Piombo's portrait of an unknown woman. Felice had an influence on other renaissance icons as well, evident from her correspondences with figures such as Catherine de' Medici. Early life Palazzo della Rovere in Savona, where Felice spent her young adult years The exact date of Felice della Rovere's birth is not known. She is believed to have been born in Rome, most likely in the year 1483. Felice's mother, Lucrezia Normanni, was born in Trastevere in Rome. Felice's maternal lineage can be traced back to the 11th century, which, at the time of Felice's birth, would have made the Normanni one of Rome's oldest families. Felice's father, Giuliano della Rovere, was born in the coastal village of Albissola in Liguria. In his youth, Giuliano was a member of the Franciscan order before being made Archbishop of Avignon by his uncle, Pope Sixtus IV. It is likely that Giuliano and Lucrezia had a brief relationship after meeting in Trastevere, where Giuliano was known to visit. Felice grew up alongside two siblings, a half-brother named Gian Domenico and a half-sister, Francesca, both of whom were born after her mother's marriage to Bernardino de Cupis. Felice's step-father was employed by Cardinal Girolamo Basso della Rovere as a maestro di casa, and oversaw the cardinal's servants. Bernardino was well-rewarded by the della Rovere family and his earnings comfortably supported Felice and her family. Felice spent her early years in the de Cupis Palace in the Piazza Navona in Rome. After her father attempted to have the Borgia pope, Alexander VI, deposed in 1494, Felice was taken away from Rome and brought to the Palazzo della Rovere in Savona where she would be safe from Borgia retaliation. Education Growing up in the Palazzo de Cupis in the Piazza Navona, a lively societal centre of Rome, meant that Felice was likely surrounded by important businessmen, merchants, lawyers, and apostolic secretaries that often visited her home. As she grew older, Felice was genuinely interested in humanist scholarship and formed friendships with scholars and poets that visited the Vatican. Giovanni Filoteo Achillini, an Italian philosopher and poet, described Felice in his poem Viridario, calling her honourable and worthy of praise. She also became close with Scipione Carteromacho, a humanist scholar whose ties to a well- known publisher allowed Felice to acquire many books in both Latin and Italian. Felice was an enthusiastic reader, evidenced by her large book collection. Through her relationships with both Italian and visiting scholars, she came to own a collection of manuscript books by ancient authors as well as many unnamed books, although they had little monetary value. It is speculated that she used her interests in education and humanism to gain acceptance into the close courtly circles of the wealthy and powerful Medici and Gonzaga families. First marriage Felice's father arranged a marriage for her when she was 14 or 15 years old. The identity of her first husband is unknown, but he was probably from Savona or Genoa and likely had strong political ties to his community that would have benefited Giuliano. Not much information is available about this brief marriage, except that the man died in early 1504 due to unknown circumstances, and the experience probably caused Felice to be hesitant to remarry. Following the death of her first husband, Felice rejected many prospective husbands and refused to marry Roberto Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno, a man favoured by her father.Shaw 1993, p. 182. Upon her husband's death, Felice likely received the dowry that was given on her marriage and this share of money would only be available to her while she remained unmarried. It is likely that Felice did not want to give up the financial independence this dowry provided her, and this was possibly a contributing factor as to why she was reluctant to remarry. Second marriage The Orsini palace of Monte Giordano in Rome After becoming pope in 1503, Pope Julius II aimed to find Felice a second husband. This was a difficult task because Felice was not a popular choice for marriage: she was the illegitimate daughter of a pope and did not appear to be beloved by him, and she was 20, rendering her an unappealing match due to her older age. A match was eventually made with Gian Giordano, son of Gentile Virginio Orsini, Lord of Bracciano, and the leader of two of Rome's most powerful aristocratic families. This was an excellent match for Felice as it allowed her to stay in Rome. This match was also very beneficial for Pope Julius II, who wanted to end the bloody feud between the Orsini and Colonna families. He accomplished this by gaining influence in both families by marrying his niece, Lucrezia, into the Colonna family, and Felice into the Orsini family. Gian Giordano was 20 years Felice's senior, and worked as a condotierre. He had previously been married to king Ferdinand I of Naples' illegitimate daughter, Maria D'Aragona of Naples, who had born him three children: Napoleone, Carlotta, and Francesca, before dying in 1504. Felice's dowry was 15,000 ducats, which was worth less than the dowry given to Lucrezia, who had received 10,000 ducats, but also a palace at the church of Dodici Apostoli, and the town of Frascati. Scholars believe that Pope Julius II's unfriendly treatment of Felice was due to his desire to differentiate himself from his predecessor and rival, Pope Alexander VI, who had practiced extreme nepotism, particularly by parading his daughter around Rome. Felice's father further humiliated her by forbidding any major festivities for her wedding and by not attending. The wedding took place on the 24th and 25 May 1506, and was held at the Cancelleria (modern: Palazzo Sforza Cesarini), a palace then in disrepair. Cancelleria (modern: Palazzo Sforza Cesarini) the location of Felice's marriage to Gian Giordano in 1506 Some scholars have hypothesised the marriage as an unhappy one, claiming that Gian Giordano mocked Felice for being the bastard daughter of a pope, but evidence suggests that Gian Giordano came to like Felice's \\"managerial qualities and diplomatic skills\\", and encouraged Felice to pursue her ambitions. In the first two years of marriage Felice's main objective was to give birth to a son, who would guarantee her security within the Orsini family, exclude her stepson, Napoleone Orsini, from receiving the Orsini lordship, and make her the regent of the family should Gian Giordano die while her son was a minor. Without a son, Felice risked losing the power and wealth gained from her marriage. =Reconciliation with her father= When Pope Julius II refused to attend the wedding he arranged for his daughter and Gian Giordano, it is believed that Felice interpreted this as a lack of respect on the part of her father and was resentful towards him. These feelings created a rift between Felice and her father that lasted for a few months. In an effort to reconcile, Julius II invited Felice and her new husband to the Vatican in late June 1506 and held a lavish banquet in their honour. Following this reconciliation, Julius II frequently made Felice the guest of honour at various parties in Rome, where oftentimes she was the only woman present. Felice's presence at various events in Rome throughout this period helped elevate her to a position of power within the Vatican court. In addition, the Pope gifted Felice with extravagant jewelry and significant sums of money, including an item that would become one of her most prized possessions: a diamond cross originally given to her father from the Republic of Venice. =Economic activities=Castle at Palo During her marriage Felice was given her own personal assets, which allowed her to become a wealthy woman in her own right. Her main source of income was the estate and castle at Palo, a pre-existing property in modern-day Ladispoli. Acquired in 1509, this castle provided both income and a method through which to increase both her influence and her family's power. She did this primarily through establishing the estate as a papal residence. The castle was granted this status by her father when he was pope, and continued on after his pontificate ended. This prior use of the estate as a papal residence led to subsequent papal figures such as Pope Leo X being hosted at the castle. The grounds around Palo were suitable for hunting, which helped to attract these prominent guests, and eventually led to the property also being recognized as an official papal hunting lodge. Felice was able to set up the residence as a hunting lodge by brokering a deal with Leo X. He agreed to pay for the necessary repairs and upgrades the castle would need to turn it into a luxury property, and in exchange, Felice allowed Leo X to stay at Palo for free. By employing the castle as a financial asset and opening it up to high-ranking guests, Felice was able to promote both the image of the della Rovere family as a whole, as well as her own image. Grain trade Besides property-owning, Felice also used the grain trade as a source of income. This involvement in business gave Felice experience that would help to support her both during her marriage and after her husband's death. The fields on her Palo property were well-suited for grain growing, and could produce a significant amount of wheat, as attested to by the entries written by Felice's servants in the account books for the estate. However, during the 1533-1534 grain crisis in Rome, Felice's revenue suffered. The reasons for the crisis were mainly a bout of poor weather conditions and an underdeveloped transportation system. As a result, Rome had to import grain from other areas of Italy, and this often led to the price of grain being doubled. As Felice's property was located close to Rome itself, she mainly sold her grain directly to people in and around the city and was therefore affected by the bad harvest. As well, grain suppliers located in Northern Italy were able to abuse the system during this time because the supply of grain in Rome itself was so poor, allowing them to charge steep prices. This left local suppliers such as Felice in a dire situation. During this crisis, Felice had to resort to bargaining to get a better price for her grain. Felice's individuality is revealed through actions such as these, as haggling was not something upper-class women were supposed to do. Ultimately, despite these struggles, Felice was able to use the grain trade to increase her wealth. Role in peace negotiations between the Papal States and France In 1510, in the midst of the Italian Wars, Pope Julius II wanted to eliminate France's presence in Northern Italy. In order to accomplish this, the Pope dissolved the League of Cambrai, originally established in 1508 as an anti- Venetian alliance between France and the Papal States.Bedini 1997, p. 5. In place of the League of Cambrai, the Pope established the Holy League, forming an alliance between the Papal States and Venice.Bedini 1997, p. 6. The exclusion of France from the Holy League caused tension to escalate between Julius II and Louis XII.Shaw 1993, p. 289. After the Papal States lost Bologna to France, Julius II agreed to negotiate with Louis XII. Negotiations were held between Bishop Andrew Forman and others, including Felice's husband, Gian Giordano Orsini. Julius II sent Felice to accompany Gian Giordano to France in July 1511 where she was involved in negotiations with Queen Anne of Brittany for two years. Children=Births and early years= Felice and Gian Giordano had 5 children, 4 of whom survived into adulthood. Like most noble women of the 16th century, Felice employed wetnurses and was therefore able to have children in rapid succession. Felice gave birth to 2 daughters: Julia in 1507, and Clarice in 1514. She also had 3 sons: Giulio in 1508, who died a few months later, Francesco in 1512, and Girolamo in 1513. Felice was a very involved mother: she named her children, a task typically given to the godparents at baptism, hired their wetnurses, and managed their financial affairs. She was also primarily responsible for the upbringing of her surviving sons, Francesco and Girolamo, who were ages 4 and 5 when their father died in 1517. =Relationship with stepson Napoleone= Some of the Orsini family viewed Felice as an evil stepmother because her sons displaced Napoleone's claims to inheritance, but this was actually Gian Giordano's choice. It appears that Felice sympathized with Napoleone, as she tried to improve his situation by having her father appoint Napoleone abbot through an endowment of the Abbey of Farfa, an estate over 200 square kilometers in size, and had Napoleone granted an additional income of 1,000 ducats a month under Pope Leo X. Felice's only role in the isolation and alleged mistreatment of Napoleone was that she believed Napoleone to be an aggressive boy and feared that he would hurt her sons in an attempt to regain the inheritance. To protect herself and her sons, Felice kept Napoleone at a distance and ensured that he did not receive a cardinal's hat under Pope Leo X. =Marriages= As the Orsini Signora, Felice had a role in orchestrating the marriages of her stepchildren and her children. In October 1519, Felice secured her stepdaughter Carlotta's marriage to Giantommaso Pico, lord of Mirandola. Because Felice was not Carlotta's mother, she required the approval of Napoleone, and other Orsini males. Felice then married her daughter Giulia to Pier Antonio di Sanseverino, the ruler of Bisignano. They agreed upon a dowry of 40,000 ducats and a cardinal's hat to a member of Pier Antonio's family in exchange for 24,000 ducats: 8,000 for Pope Leo X and 16,000 for Felice. This marriage benefitted Felice by providing her with funds and a strong ally in the South, but it also came with consequences: the union angered members of the Orsini family because it involved a Southern family, the dowry was twice the size of Carlotta's, and it angered Napoleone who felt that the cardinal's hat given away was rightfully his. Napoleone forfeited his claim to the Abbey of Farfa to Francesco when he married Claudia Colonna. After the Sack of Rome, Felice married Clarice to Don Luigi Carafa, the Prince of Stigliano, whose family was on good terms with the Spanish, providing Felice an Imperial ally. Francesco never married, but had many illegitimate children. Felice arranged for Girolamo to marry Francesca Sforza, daughter of Count Bosio of Santa Fiora, but this union did not occur until October 1537, a year after Felice's death. Widowhood Gian Giordano became ill in September 1517 and made a living will bestowing the authority to act as Orsini regent to Felice after his death while their sons were still minors. Giovanno Roberta della Colle, one of Gian Giordano's chiefs of staff, was present when the living will was made, and records that Gian Giordano said: \\"I shall leave my wife, that is Madonna Felice, named as Lady and Guardian of the children and of the estate because she has been such a woman and such a wife, and so rightly she merits such an honour.\\" This announcement was very publicly made to ensure that the Orsini family would have no grounds to oppose Felice becoming the Lady and Guardian of the estate because she was a woman, not an Orsini by blood, or not of Roman nobility. Gian Giordano died on October 11 at his castle in Vicovaro and left all of his worldly possessions to his sons Francesco, Girolamo, and Napoleone. His appointment of Felice made her one of the most powerful figures in Rome, a position scholars note she was well prepared for due to her humanist education. Pope Leo X ratified this position by writing a bull stating that Felice would be the guardian and caretaker of Gian Giordano Orsini's children as long as she remained a widow. There were some rumours surrounding Gian Giordano's death, as Marino Sanuto recorded that Gian Giordano had died without receiving confession or communion because doctors did not think he was ill, indicating that Felice may have been responsible for his death, rendering her fortuitous appointment as the head of the Bracciano Orsini clan unlawful. Some members of the Orsini household rallied behind the 17-year-old Napoleone as the rightful leader, but this did not gain power as Leo X had proclaimed his support for Felice, and there was no additional proof of any suspicious activity surrounding Gian Giordano's death. The Sack of Rome In 1527, Felice was not staying in the Orsini Palace at Monte Giordano when the Sack of Rome began, and this likely saved her life, as it was one of the first palaces to be attacked. She and her children were with her mother, Lucrezia, and half-siblings Gian Domenico and Francesca at the De Cupis palace when the Sack began. They decided that it would be safest to divide by gender and flee Rome. The women dressed in plain clothes, hid their jewels underneath their dresses and went to Isabella d'Este's rented castle, Dodici Apostoli, which provided refuge to 1200 noblewomen and 1000 noblemen and was one of the only palaces not attacked because Isabella's son was a chief lieutenant leading the attack.Chamberlin 1979, p. 166. The palace was soon put under ransom.Chamberlin 1979, pp. 166‚Äì167. Felice paid for herself and a few others, including 2000 ducats for her nephew Cristofano. Felice and her family then fled Rome for Ostia where they took a boat to Civitavecchia and were united with the rest of Felice's family. The family split up again because Felice wanted to be far from Rome to protect her children from Napoleone, who was stationed at Felice's Bracciano estate with some followers. Felice feared that Napoleone might use the chaos of the sack as an opportunity to kill his half- siblings and reclaim what he believed to be his rightful inheritance of the Orsini lordship. Felice and her children went to stay with her cousins in the Duchy of Urbino, where she received a palace in the hillside town of Fossombrone. In Fossombrone, Felice helped noblemen and women in Rome, sending money and coordinating supplies. The Sack of Rome ended in 1528, but Felice did not immediately return to Rome because Napoleone had set up a force fighting against the Imperial attackers in Bracciano. Soon after, the Imperial forces dispelled Napoleone, and Felice felt safe returning. Once in Rome, Felice had the Orsini estate of Monte Giordano rebuilt for the sake of her sons and the family's reputation. Her property near Trinit√† dei Monti had also been ransacked and destroyed, so she had it rebuilt. The Sack of Rome had significantly changed Felice's life, and for the first time in her life she was poor. Presence in art Raphael's The Mass at Bolensa, 1511, in which Felice is believed to be represented Though no official portraiture of Felice has been identified, Caroline Murphy has suggested two works might be depictions of Felice. These are Raphael's The Mass at Bolsena and Sebastiano del Piombo's portrait of an unknown woman. The Mass at Bolsena was commissioned by Julius II in 1512, and depicts the miracle of Bolsena. As Julius II was Raphael's patron, he would have influenced who exactly appeared in the painting.Jones and Penny 1983, p.49. Both clergy and male members of the della Rovere family appear in the painting, as well as a few female figures. The figure Murphy identifies as Felice is dressed in black, kneeling, and gazing up at Julius II. She argues that this is possibly Felice because she is depicted differently from all the other female figures, who appear to be stylized. Sebastiano del Piombo was another painter who completed many works in this period, including portraiture.Hirst 1981, p. 119. The fact that he was personally known to Felice, and the similarities in dress between this piece and The Mass at Bolsena, led Murphy to suggest that Sebastiano del Piombo's portrait of an unknown woman is also a depiction of Felice. Felice's presence cannot be fully confirmed as she was never properly identified in these art pieces. However, as Julius II was a patron of the arts it is likely he included his daughter in some of the paintings he commissioned. Legacy Though Felice is less well-known than her female contemporaries such as Lucrezia Borgia and Isabella d'Este, she was a respected figure in her own time. She was acquainted with other 16th century figures such as Catherine de' Medici and Pope Leo X, and it is clear that despite the lack of documentation on her life, she was corresponding with various important people. Catherine de' Medici, queen of France, had stayed with Felice for a short period of time as a young child, and later wrote a letter thanking Felice for the care she had received. Though this letter was written long before Catherine became an important figure, Felice's good reputation can be discerned from the letter Catherine wrote to her. Another figure Felice corresponded with was Pope Leo X, who succeeded Felice's father as pope.Cummings 2012, p.viii. Her reputation among high-ranking figures is reflected through her business dealings with Leo X and her hosting of him and his guests at her residence. Her reputation is also apparent in Francesco Sansovini's History of the House of Orsini, which states that Felice's granddaughter shared both her grandmother's name and good manners.

It was established in 1662 and governed by the East India Company until the Government of India Act 1858 transferred all presidencies to the direct authority of the British Crown. On 1 April 1895 the army was incorporated into the newly created Indian Army, and became known as the Bombay Command until 1908. History=18th century= Sepoys of the 3rd Battalion of native infantry at Bombay, 1773 In the early stages of HEIC rule Bombay was rated as an unhealthy and unprofitable region. Accordingly, only a small garrison was maintained while emphasis was placed on creating a local navy (the \\"Bombay Marine\\") to control piracy. In 1742 the Bombay Army consisted of eight companies of European and Eurasian garrison troops, numbering 1,593 of all ranks. These had evolved from independent companies dating back as far as 1668 when the Company took over control of the city of Bombay.Raugh, p. 55 The Mahars served in both Bombay Army and Marine battalions. Prior to the Indian Rebellion of 1857 they were heavily recruited and constituted between a fifth and a quarter of the entire Bombay Army. By 1783 the Bombay Army had grown to 15,000 men, a force that was still significantly smaller than the other two Presidency armies. Recruitment from the 1750s on had however been expanded to include a majority of indigenous sepoys, initially employed as irregulars for particular campaigns. The first two regular sepoy battalions were raised in 1768, a third in 1760 and a fourth ten years later. The non-Indian (mostly British but also including Swiss and German mercenaries) element was organized in a single Bombay European Regiment. In 1796 the Bombay Native Infantry was reorganized into four regiments, each of two battalions. The Bombay Foot Artillery, which traced its history back nearly 50 years prior to this date, was brought up to six companies in strength in 1797.Carman, WY. (1969). \\"Indian Army Uniforms - Artillery, Engineers and Infantry\\". London: Morgan-Grampton. p. 34 The Bombay Army was heavily involved in the First Maratha War and the defeat of Tipu Sultan of Mysore in 1799. =19th century= Native Officers of the Bombay Army in dress uniform, 1818 Prior to the cessation of Company rule in 1861, the Bombay Army played a substantial role in campaigns against the Bani Bu Ali in 1821, in North-Western India, notably the 1st Afghan War of 1838‚Äì1842, the Sind War of 1843, the 2nd Sikh War of 1848-49 and the Persian War of 1856-57. The Bombay Army had acquired responsibility for garrisoning Aden, and The 1st Bombay European Regiment, The Bombay Marine Battalion and the 24th Bombay Native Infantry all saw service there in 1839. As of 1 January 1842 the Bombay Army's disposition was as follows: *The Bombay Garrison *The Poona Division - Headquartered in Poona *The Northern Division - Headquartered in Ahmedabad *The Mhow Brigade *The Scinde Field Force *Forces in Lower Scinde *Forces Garrisoning the Asirgarh Fort *Forces in and around Karrack Island (Kharg Island), in the Persian Gulf *Forces in Aden. The Bombay native infantry establishment continued to expand until it reached 26 regiments in 1845. Three Bombay Light Cavalry regiments were raised after 1817, plus a few troops of irregular horse. One brigade of Bombay Horse Artillery comprising both British and Indian personnel had been established by 1845, plus three battalions of foot artillery. The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was almost entirely confined to the Bengal Army. Of the thirty-two Bombay infantry regiments in existence at the time only two mutinied. After some initial uncertainty as to the loyalty of the remainder, it was deemed possible to send most of the British troops in the Presidency to Bengal, while the Bombay sepoy and sowar (cavalry) units held the southern districts of the North-West Frontier. Some Bombay units saw active service during the repression of the rebellion in Central India. The Bombay Presidency's Army was also supplemented by regular British Army Regiments and in 1842 one cavalry and four infantry regiments were deployed on the \\"Bombay Establishment\\". =Post mutiny= Following the transfer of HEIC rule to that of the British government in 1861 the Bombay Army underwent a series of changes. These included the disbandment of three regiments of Bombay Native Infantry and the recruitment of replacement units from the Beluchi population. Originally created as irregular units, the three \\"Belooch\\" regiments in their red trousers were to remain a conspicuous part of the Bombay Army for the remainder of its separate existence.Carman, WY. (1969). \\"Indian Army Uniforms - Artillery, Engineers and Infantry\\". London: Morgan- Grampton. pp. 182-3 By 1864 the Bombay Army had been reorganised as follows: *The Northern Division *The Poona Division *The Mhow Division *The Scinde Division With brigades at Bombay, Belgaum, Neemuch, Poona, Ahmednuggur, Nusseerabad and Deesa; as well as a garrison in Aden. During the remainder of the 19th century Bombay Army units participated in the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia, the Second Afghan War of 1878‚Äì80, and the Third Anglo-Burmese War of 1885‚Äì87. In 1895 the three separate Presidency Armies were abolished and the Army of India was divided into four commands, each commanded by a lieutenant-general. These comprised Madras (including Burma), Punjab (including the North West Frontier), Bengal and Bombay (including Aden). =End of the separate Bombay Army= In 1895 the three separate Presidency Armies began a process of unification which was not to be concluded until the Kitchener reforms of eight years later. As an initial step the Army of India was divided into four commands, each commanded by a lieutenant-general. These comprised Bombay (including Aden), Madras (including Burma), Punjab (including the North West Frontier) and Bengal. In 1903 the separately numbered regiments of the Bombay, Madras and Bengal Armies were unified in a single organisational sequence and the presidency affiliations disappeared.

The presidency armies, like the presidencies themselves, belonged to the East India Company until the Government of India Act 1858 (passed in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857) transferred all three presidencies to the direct authority of the British Crown. In 1895 all three presidency armies were merged into the British Indian Army. Establishment and early history Left to right, the Madras Horse Artillery, the Madras Light Cavalry, the Madras Rifle Corps, the Madras Pioneers, the Madras Native Infantry, and the Madras Foot Artillery, c. 1830 A painting showing a sowar (cavalry equivalent of sepoy), 6th Madras Light Cavalry circa 1845. The Madras Army of the Honourable East India Company came into being through the need to protect the Company's commercial interests. These were mostly untrained guards, with only some bearing arms. The French attack and capture of Madras in 1746 forced the British hand. In 1757, the British decided to raise well-trained military units to conduct operations, conquer territory, and force allegiance from local rulers.Schmidt, p. 26 The loosely organised military units were later combined into battalions with Indian officers commanding local troops. One of the first major actions fought by these troops was in the battle of Wandiwash in 1760. The troops were highly praised for their steadiness under fire. Earlier a good part of the force was sent to Bengal under young Clive, who made history and a personal fortune after the Battle of Plassey. The 1st Madras Pioneers, c. 1890 The Queen's Own Madras Sappers and Miners, 1896 The Madras Army officers were in the early years very conscious of the soldiers' local customs, caste rituals, dress, and social hierarchy. Some leading landowners joined the Madras Army, one of whom is recorded as Mootoo (Muthu) Nayak from the nobility in Madura. As the army expanded and new officers came in, mostly from Company sources, the leadership style and care of the men changed for the worse. The most famous incident in the Madras Army was the Vellore mutiny. Looting was an organised activity among the East India Company officers. Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington, was in the Seringapatnam battle. In keeping with the times, he laid down the share of every officer and sepoy from the loot that was organised after Tipu was killed. The defeat of Hyder Ali and the death of Tipu with the most widespread looting of Seringapatnam rankled with Indians at all levels. After Tipu Sultan was killed, his two sons were held in British custody in Vellore Fort. On the night of 10 July 1806 the sepoys of three Madrasi regiments garrisoning Vellore Fort mutinied, killing 129 British officers and soldiers. The rising, caused by a mixture of military and political grievances, was suppressed within hours by a force which included loyal Madras cavalry.Philip Mason, pages 240‚Äì241, A Matter of Honour ‚Äì an Account of the Indian Army, In the 1830s the Madras Army was concerned with internal security and support for the civil administration. This was a multi- ethnic army in which the British officers were encouraged to learn and speak Asian languages. In 1832‚Äì33 superior discipline and training enabled the Madras Army put down a rebellion in the Visakhapatnam district. Under the British Raj=Post-1857 history= The Army of the Madras Presidency remained almost unaffected by the Indian Rebellion of 1857. By contrast with the larger Bengal Army where all but twelve (out of eighty-four) infantry and cavalry regiments either mutinied or were disbanded, all fifty-two regiments of Madras Native Infantry remained unaffected and passed into the new Indian Army when direct British Crown rule replaced that of the Honourable East India Company.Mason, p. 349 Four regiments of Madras Light Cavalry and the Madras Artillery batteries did however disappear in the post-1858 reorganisation of all three of the Presidency Armies. The Madras Fusiliers (a regiment of European infantry recruited by the East India Company for service in India) was transferred to the regular British Army. =End of the separate Madras Army= In 1895 the three separate Presidency Armies began a process of unification which was not to be concluded until the Kitchener reforms of eight years later. As an initial step the Army of India was divided into four commands, each commanded by a lieutenant-general. These comprised Madras (including Burma), Punjab (including the North West Frontier), Bengal and Bombay (including Aden). In 1903 the separately numbered regiments of the Madras, Bombay and Bengal Armies were unified in a single organisational sequence and the presidency affiliations disappeared. =Disbanding of Madras infantry regiments= While the Madras Army remained in existence as a separate entity until 1895, twelve of the Madras Native Infantry regiments were disbanded between 1862 and 1864. A further eight went in 1882, three between 1902 and 1904, two in 1907 and four in 1922. The remainder were disbanded between 1923 and 1933, leaving the highly regarded Madras Sappers and Miners as the only Madrasi unit in the Indian Army until a new Madras Regiment was raised in 1942, during World War II. Both of these regiments continue to exist in the modern Indian Army.Keegan, p. 310 The gradual phasing out of Madrasi recruitment for the Indian Army in the late 19th century, in favour of Sikhs, Rajputs, Dogras and Punjabi Mussalmans, was justified by General Sir Frederick Roberts on the grounds that long periods of peace and inactivity in Southern India had rendered the Madras infantry soldier inferior to the Martial Races of the North. The military historians John Keegan and Philip Mason have however pointed out that under the \\"watertight\\" Presidency Army system, Madras regiments had little opportunity of active service on the North-West Frontier. As a result, the more ambitious and capable British officers of the Indian Army opted for service with Punjabi and other northern units and the overall efficiency of the Madras Army suffered accordingly.Mason, pp. 345‚Äì350 Composition=Madras Native Infantry= * 1st Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 2nd Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 3rd Regiment of Madras Native Infantry Palamcottah Light Infantry * 4th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 5th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 6th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 7th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 8th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 9th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 10th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 11th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 12th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 13th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 14th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 16th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 17th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 18th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 19th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 20th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 21st Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 22nd Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 23rd Regiment of Madras Native Infantry Wallajahbad Light infantry * 24th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 25th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 26th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 27th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 28th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 29th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 30th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 31st Regiment of Madras Native Infantry Trichinopoly Light Infantry * 32nd Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 33rd Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 34th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry Chicacole Light Infantry * 35th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 36th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 37th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 38th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 39th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 40th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 41st Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 42nd Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 43rd Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 44th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 45th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 46th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 47th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 48th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 49th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * 50th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry * Madras Rifle Corps = Madras European Infantry = * 1st Madras (European) Fusiliers * 2nd Madras (European) Light Infantry * 3rd Madras (European) Infantry = Madras Light Cavalry = * 1st Madras Light Cavalry * 2nd Madras Light Cavalry * 3rd Madras Light Cavalry * 4th Madras Light Cavalry * 5th Madras Light Cavalry * 6th Madras Light Cavalry * 7th Madras Light Cavalry * 8th Madras Light Cavalry = Artillery = * Madras Foot Artillery (effectively divided into the 'Natives' and 'Europeans', but not segregated into battalions.)

One of its uses is in text mining for search engines. It was introduced by Avrim Blum and Tom Mitchell in 1998. Algorithm design Co-training is a semi-supervised learning technique that requires two views of the data. It assumes that each example is described using two different feature sets that provide different, complementary information about the instance. Ideally, the two views are conditionally independent (i.e., the two feature sets of each instance are conditionally independent given the class) and each view is sufficient (i.e., the class of an instance can be accurately predicted from each view alone). Co-training first learns a separate classifier for each view using any labeled examples. The most confident predictions of each classifier on the unlabeled data are then used to iteratively construct additional labeled training data.Blum, A., Mitchell, T. Combining labeled and unlabeled data with co- training. COLT: Proceedings of the Workshop on Computational Learning Theory, Morgan Kaufmann, 1998, p. 92-100. The original co-training paper described experiments using co-training to classify web pages into \\"academic course home page\\" or not; the classifier correctly categorized 95% of 788 web pages with only 12 labeled web pages as examples. The paper has been cited over 1000 times, and received the 10 years Best Paper Award at the 25th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2008), a renowned computer science conference. Krogel and Scheffer showed in 2004 that co-training is only beneficial if the data sets used in classification are independent. Co- training can only work if one of the classifiers correctly labels a piece of data that the other classifier previously misclassified. If both classifiers agree on all the unlabeled data, i.e. they are not independent, labeling the data does not create new information. When they applied co-training to problems in functional genomics, co-training worsened the results as the dependence of the classifiers was greater than 60%. Uses Co-training has been used to classify web pages using the text on the page as one view and the anchor text of hyperlinks on other pages that point to the page as the other view. Simply put, the text in a hyperlink on one page can give information about the page it links to. Co-training can work on \\"unlabeled\\" text that has not already been classified or tagged, which is typical for the text appearing on web pages and in emails. According to Tom Mitchell, \\"The features that describe a page are the words on the page and the links that point to that page. The co-training models utilize both classifiers to determine the likelihood that a page will contain data relevant to the search criteria.\\" Text on websites can judge the relevance of link classifiers, hence the term \\"co-training\\". Mitchell claims that other search algorithms are 86% accurate, whereas co-training is 96% accurate. Co-training was used on FlipDog.com, a job search site, and by the U.S. Department of Labor, for a directory of continuing and distance education. It has been used in many other applications, including statistical parsing and visual detection.

It was first described by Albinus in 1758. The muscles lies in the fourth extensor compartment of the wrist, and is relatively rare. It has a prevalence of 4% in the general population according to a meta-analysis. This muscle is commonly misdiagnosed as a ganglion cysta, synovial nodule or cyst.  Structure  The extensor digitorum brevis manus usually originates from the dorsal aspect (backside) of the wrist, either from the joint capsule, the distal end (the most distant end) of the radius, the metacarpal, or from the radiocarpal ligament in the area of the fourth extensor compartment. Many variations of the muscle have been described in the literature. It could have up to four tendons with a single tendon inserting to the index or the middle finger being the two most common variations. At the insertion the tendon of the extensor digitorum brevis manus often joins the extensor indicis proprius, although it also occurs when the extensor indicis proprius is absent. It was also reported to coexist with the extensor medii proprius, another anatomical variation in the extensor compartment of the hand. The muscle is supplied the posterior interosseous nerve and posterior branch of the anterior interosseous artery. = Variation = The extensor digitorum brevis manus was found to be present in 4% of the population, and there was no correlation between gender, side or ancestry. it inserted to the index finger and the middle finger in 77% and 23% of the cases, respectively. It occurred bilaterally in 26% the total cases. = Development = At some point during the embryonic development, the precursor extensor mass differentiates into three layers: radial, superficial, and deep. The extensor digitorum brevis manus may have been originated from the deep layer, a typical location where most of the variations take place. Some authors believe that this muscle may represent a failure of proximal migration of ulnocarpal elements of the extensor muscle mass in humans.  Functions  It extends the index or the middle finger. It is believed to be a substitute for the extension of the index finger when the extensor indicis proprius is absent.  Clinical significance  Only a few clinical cases have been reported among more than 300 clinical and cadaveric dissections. This implies that the presence of this muscle is usually asymptomatic, although the extensor digitorum brevis manus might cause a painful swelling which can potentially be misdiagnosed as other pathology such as synovial cyst and lipoma.

CommScope is a 1997 spin-off of General Instrument and has over 20,000 employees worldwide, with customers in over 130 countries. CommScope manufactures the SYSTIMAX and Uniprise brands of enterprise infrastructure of copper Unshielded Twisted Pair cabling, connector panels, jacks and fiber optic cabling, connector panels, racking, and metals. CommScope also manufactures environmentally secure cabinets for FTTN and DSL applications.  History  In 1975, CommScope was a product line of Superior Continental Cable. 29-year-old Frank Drendel headed a team charged with selling the failing product line. Drendel and Jearld Leonhardt founded CommScope in August 1976 after raising $5.1 million to purchase the CommScope product line. Two years later, CommScope and Valtech merged under the Valtech name. In 1979 Valtech donated fiber optics line and equipment to link the U.S. House of Representatives to the C-SPAN studios, enabling live broadcasting of U.S. Congressional proceedings for the first time. In the 1980s, Valtech sold to M/A-COM, Inc. and CommScope became part of the Cable Home Group for M/A-COM. In 1983 CommScope formed the Network Cable division for the local area network, data communications, television-receive only, and specialized wire markets. In 1986 M/A-COM, Inc. sold the Cable Home Group to General Instrument Corporation. CommScope became a division of General Instrument. In 1990 CommScope opened a new manufacturing facility in Claremont, North Carolina, to answer the increased demand for unshielded twisted pair (copper telephone wiring), television receive-only cables (used for consumer satellite reception) and personal computer cables. In 1997 General Instrument split into three independent, publicly traded companies, one of which was CommScope. In July 1997 Drendel rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange to announce CommScope going public. In 2000 CommScope opened its new global headquarters in Hickory, North Carolina. In 2004 CommScope acquired Avaya's Connectivity Solutions business and inherited the SYSTIMAX brand, a company perhaps best known for its enterprise cabling systems. Avaya's Carrier Solutions, which offered products designed for switching and transmission applications in telephone central offices and secure environmental enclosures, also became part of CommScope. This acquisition doubled CommScope's size. In 2007 CommScope acquired the global wireless infrastructure provider Andrew Corporation. Through its new Andrew brand, CommScope became a global leader in radio frequency subsystem solutions for wireless networks and again doubled CommScope's size. On October 25, 2010, The Carlyle Group, a global alternative asset manager, announced it would pay $31.50 a share, or about $2.98 billion, to take CommScope private. In 2011 the acquisition by Carlyle Group was completed. This made CommScope privately owned by the Carlyle Group and removed it from the New York Stock Exchange. The acquisition also changed CommScope's executive structure. Eddie Edwards was appointed president and chief executive officer, succeeding Drendel, who had been CommScope's CEO since the company's founding in 1976. Drendel continued as the chairman of the board. In July 2011, CommScope received the 2010 Communications Solutions Product of the Year Award from Technology Marketing Corporation for its product, Wired For Wireless. On August 2, 2013, CommScope filed with the SEC to raise up to $750 million in an initial public offering. The initial public offering and first public trading took place on October 25, 2013 at NASDAQ. In 2015 CommScope acquired TE Connectivity's Broadband Network Solutions (BNS) division. Also in 2015 CommScope acquired Airvana, a privately held company that specialized in small cell solutions for wireless networks. In November 2016, the Carlyle Group announced the sale of its remaining stock. On May 16, 2017, CommScope introduced a High Speed Migration platform. On November 8, 2018, CommScope announced that it would acquire Arris International (the owner of the former cable and satellite division of General Instrument) in a cash deal valued at $7.4 billion including the repayment of debt. This acquisition brought back together two of the General Instrument companies from the 1997 split. The transaction was completed on April 4, 2019. Acquisitions In 2004 the company acquired Avaya's Connectivity Solutions business. The Avaya business acquisition included the legacy intellectual property and patents from Western Electric, AT&T;, Lucent Technologies, and Avaya. In June 2007, CommScope acquired Andrew Corporation for $2.6 billion. Andrew's products included antennas, cables, amplifiers, repeaters, transceivers, as well as software and training for the broadband and cellular industries. In January 2015, CommScope agreed to purchase a unit of TE Connectivity for $3 billion. The transaction closed August 28, 2015. In October 2015, CommScope acquired Airvana, a manufacturer of small cells and femtocells. In November 2018 CommScope agreed to purchase Arris International, maker of a variety of networking equipment including set top boxes, WiFi routers and Ethernet switches for $7.4 billion. In February 2019, Arris shareholders approved the purchase.  Board of Directors  * Frank M. Drendel - CommScope's Founder and Chairman of the Board * Austin A.

With about 6,000 graduate engineer students and 800 PhD doctorate students, a total faculty of 700 permanent academic members, 2200 part-time lecturers and associate professors, 450 technical and administrative staff, 2000 researchers, the Ecoles Centrales Group annually approves hundreds of PhD doctorate dissertations and grants 1500 Centrale graduate engineering degrees and other master's degrees. Already more than 35,000 Centrale alumni are active today in business, entrepreneurship, research & development, and management in small and large industries worldwide.  Goals  Based on nearly two centuries of recognized Centrale educational know-how in France, the Ecoles Centrales Group's goal is to promote and implement engineering education with the following characteristics, defined as the Centrale Programme: * multidisciplinary curriculum for engineers, with a broad scope of scientific, engineering and management fields taught to all students (civil engineering; mechanical engineering; electrical engineering; information theory & computer science; control science and signal processing; telecom; chemistry, physics and material sciences; micro-nano technologies; manufacturing; safety, logistics; mathematics; economics; statistics, finance; management ...) applicable for French-speaking students with a solid scientific background knowledge and intellectual agility; * first two years for acquisition of a Centrale common body of knowledges, with core and elective thematic flexibility, and at least one year of in-depth thematic studies at the end of the programme ; * close contact with the industry through joint projects and training periods, and requirements for international exposure ; * academic education and applied research closely related to industry stakeholders ; * a unique Centrale graduate diploma in each school.  Admission  Education programmes implemented in CentraleSup√©lec, Lille, Lyon, Marseille and Nantes include * Ing√©nieur Centralien (Centrale graduate engineering degree) * Masters and PhD doctorate studies * Specialized masters (Mast√®re MS Sp√©cialis√©) The Centrale Programme (Centrale graduate engineering degree - Grade 300 ECTS) includes a threeThe Centrale Programme typically includes a three-year curriculum with two years as the core programme ; the third year curriculum may be performed in an Ecole Centrale different from the first two years ; the third year may also include a Master (M2) degree as an elective part of the curriculum, that may be attended in either any Ecole Centrale or in other selected institutes in France or Europe, depending on the target research labs. Alternatively, students from the Centrale programme may decide at the end of the second year to enrol into the TIME double degree process which requires two additional years to get both the Centrale degree and another Master degree, instead of one third year. or fourStudents enrolled as part of the TIME double degree process have to spend two years in their home institute and two years in an Ecole Centrale in order to be granted both Master degrees.-year curriculum. Application to the Centrale Programme is possible after two/three yearConcours Centrale-Supelec competitive exam is opened to any French-speaking undergraduate students. Only bright second-year undergraduates and third-year undergraduates may actually have a chance to succeed at the exam, due to high requirements upon maths and physics knowledge. The scope of knowledges needed is up to and may be beyond a standard Bachelor of Science curriculum. For this reason, about 47,000 undergraduate French students usually attend scientific Classe Pr√©paratoire aux Grandes √âcoles for two or three years, in order to reach the appropriate body of knowledges in these fields. The selective exam takes place every year, with several written parts taken in April‚ÄìMay by about 9,000 candidates simultaneously in many examination centres worldwide ; then multiple individual test sessions take place in June‚ÄìJuly at Centrale Paris for those candidates allowed to proceed on the exam process. Candidates are then ranked by order of merit. About 1,300 of them are able to enter Ecoles Centrales Networks each year and proceed with Centrale Graduate cursus. (To be compared with the 500,000 students who pass the Baccalaur√©at exam so as to start the French undergraduate cursus and to the 20,000 undergraduate students who actually succeed and enroll in a French engineering school, including Ecoles Centrales Networks among others, each year). undergraduate studies in other educational institutes. Admission to an √©cole centrale requires success in either: * a French nationwide selective exam with numerus clausus : concours Centrale-Supelec, with examination centres located throughout FranceEcoles Centrales Network admission process for Centrale programme : Concours Centrale-Supelec examination centres are located in France m√©tropolitaine (Europe) and in France Outre Mer including examination centres in Guadeloupe and Martinique (Caribbean), La R√©union (Indian Ocean) and New Caledonia (Asia Oceania), and in Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia;Cycle International - Ecoles Centrales Network admission process for Centralien programme in international examination centres :Concours Centrale-Supelec * an entrance exam for Bachelor of Science : CASTing - Concours d'Admission sur Titre Ing√©nieur ; * a selection process as per TIME double degrees procedures applicable in Europe ; * a selection process as per TIME Overseas double degree procedures applicable for selected universities in Brasil, Canada, Chile, China, Indonesia, Japan, USA ; * a specific application process for other international students presented by their originating University. Thus undergraduate studies + the Centralien Programme account for more than a cumulated 300 ECTS credit in the European education system. Admission to the master's degree programme (workload is either M1+M2 = 120 ECTS or M2 = 60 ECTS) is possible upon application assessment based on academic criteria or is possible as a part of the Centralien Programme. Several master's degrees are available from the different √©coles centrales and may be taught in English and/or French, targeting diverse science and engineering domains : * Master's degrees at Centrale Lille * Master's degrees at Centrale Lyon * Master's degrees at Centrale Marseille * Master's degrees at Centrale Nantes * Master's degrees at Centrale Paris Admission to specialized master's degree programmes (Mast√®re sp√©cialis√©) for master's-level specialization and continuing education in specific engineering and management fields (workload is 75 ECTS) is possible upon application assessment based on candidate profile.

A co-production between BBC Television and HBO Films, the series was first broadcast on BBC Two (in the United Kingdom) in four parts between 30 July and 20 August 2008. Episodes=Part I= A pre-title sequence is set in March 2003, showing Saddam watching the broadcast of President George W. Bush's ultimatum to leave Ba'athist Iraq within forty-eight hours. As the bombing of Baghdad commences, Saddam and his family flee the Presidential Palace. 1979: Shortly after the Iranian Revolution, Iraqi Vice President Saddam Hussein fears the increasing influence of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, as well as Iraqi president Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr's proposed union with Syria. Saddam instigates the overthrow of President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr. After being appointed president, Saddam orders his half-brother, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, to initiate a bloody purge of the Ba'ath Party leadership in order to wipe out \\"traitors\\". Saddam himself executes his closest friend and ally, Adnan Hamdani, as a show of strength. The Islamic Dawa Party rocks Baghdad with a series of terrorist attacks while Saddam is on a hunting trip in Tikrit with his wife Sajida Talfah and son Uday. Saddam attempts to maintain good relations with the United States as he declares war on Iran while trying to maintain his relationship with his sons Uday (Aris Sahin) and Qusay (played by Raed Khelfi). Meanwhile, he begins an affair with married school teacher Samira Shahbandar. Saddam orders the execution of two Iraqi generals after a military defeat at Khorramshahr, and turns against Barzan following the death of their mother; this puts the arranged marriage of Raghad, Saddam's daughter, and Mohammed, Barzan's son, in jeopardy. After Saddam survives an assassination attempt in the Dawa stronghold of Dujail, Barzan fears for his own life and razes the city in retribution. Saddam exiles Barzan to Switzerland and marries Raghad to Hussein Kamel al-Majid, forming an alliance with the al-Majid clan. Hussein Kamel takes over Barzan's post and becomes the new leader of the Special Republican Guard. =Part II= 1988: As the war with Iran ends, an unstable Uday fires a gun in a Baghdad nightclub. Meanwhile, Saddam declares victory over Iran, even though Iraq has suffered heavy losses and is facing bankruptcy; the Iraqi economy is also being hampered by Kuwait, which is over-producing oil and driving down its price. Sajida learns that Saddam has married Samira as a second wife, and blames his trusted valet, Kamel Hana Gegeo, for assisting their affair. Uday almost kills the valet for the sake of his mother's honour, sparing him only so that he can control him when he succeeds his father. Hussein Kamel attempts to rise within the regime's inner circle by sowing mistrust between Saddam and Adnan Khairallah, Sajida's brother. Saddam's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, travels to an OPEC meeting in Geneva and reveals that Kuwait has been slant drilling into Iraqi oil fields, demanding that the Kuwaitis cease. Saddam's new marriage to Samira leaves Uday fearful that the couple's presumptive children will jeopardize his status as Saddam's heir. Uday confronts Kamel Hana at a late-night party and beats him to death to the horror of witnesses. After having Uday arrested, Saddam ponders on killing his first-born son in his cell. Adnan Khairallah questions Uday's abilities as Iraq's future leader, but is not supported by Hussein Kamel, who continues to gain Saddam's trust. Not long after, Adnan is killed in a suspicious helicopter explosion. Sajida confronts Saddam about her brother's death, but he dismisses her with claims that it was merely an accident. 1990-1991: Saddam meets with April Glaspie, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, and takes her statement of \\"no opinion\\" as giving him tacit approval to invade Kuwait. However, President George H. W. Bush immediately decries the action and organizes an international coalition to drive out Saddam's forces. Saddam refuses to back down, and is forced to move between safe-houses as the First Gulf War commences with the U.S.-led bombing of Baghdad. Samira is seriously injured in a car accident during the bombings. The Iraqi Army is quickly forced into retreat as the coalition unleashes its ground offensive. However, the U.S. declares a ceasefire and withdraws from the Iraqi border, leaving Saddam defiant as American bombers drop propaganda leaflets encouraging Iraqis to stand against him. =Part III= 1995: The Gulf War has left Iraq economically crippled. The United Nations refuses to lift sanctions unless the government agrees to dismantle Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Saddam states he has nothing to hide, resulting in a stand- off between him and the U.N.'s chief weapons inspector, Rolf Ekeus. Saddam is more preoccupied with tracing his roots than with the U.N. stand-off, and ignores his other son, Qusay, when he tries to warn his father about Uday's erratic behaviour. Instead, Saddam presents a family tree purportedly proving a familial relation to the prophet Muhammad. Qusay is clearly worried about his father's state of mind, but quietly leaves him to his devices. The rivalry between General Hussein Kamel and Uday spirals out of control, as the heir apparent pelts the general with food at a dinner with Saddam's closest allies. The frustrated Hussein Kamel states his disillusionment with Saddam's regime, which allows the spoiled Uday to run wild with impunity. His patience finally ends when Uday hijacks a shipment of medical supplies intended for Hussein Kamel's brother, Saddam Kamel. The brothers discuss Hussein Kamel's plan to cooperate with Ekeus and the CIA, hoping that he will be installed as Iraq's new president after Saddam is overthrown. During a holiday celebrating Iraq's \\"victory\\" over Iran, the Kamel brothers cross the border to Jordan with their wives, Raghad and Rana Hussein. The women, Saddam's daughters, warn their husbands of the potential consequences should Saddam discover their absences. Meanwhile, at a holiday party, Uday rapes a waitress. Qusay realises that his sisters are missing and notifies Saddam. In Jordan, King Hussein grants the self-exiled group asylum just as Saddam declares them traitors in Iraq. Hussein Kamel plans to oust Saddam with Western support, and to reveal state secrets once installed as president. His plans are undermined when Saddam decides to reveal the information himself. Kamel becomes increasingly isolated in Jordan, and begins to lose the support of the king and the CIA. Saddam has Sajida to talk their daughters into coming back to Iraq, promising her that they will be safe upon their return. He also offers a pardon to the Kamel brothers. Believing he will be forgiven, and disturbed by his increasing loss of social status, Hussein Kamel and the others return despite warnings from Raghad and Rana. Once they return to Baghdad, Hussein and Saddam Kamel are humiliated by Uday and Qusay, who force them to divorce their wives and strip them of their Iraqi uniforms and ranks. However, they allow them to return to their family home, while Raghad and Rana go to their mother's house. Saddam Hussein then tells General Ali Hassan al-Majid that the honor of the al-Majid clan will be tainted as long as the pair go unpunished. Ali subsequently surrounds the brothers' house with troops, offering the brothers weapons so that they can die fighting. In a pitched battle, Hussein and Saddam Kamel are killed. =Part IV= 2003: Saddam, along with Uday, Qusay and Aziz, watch television reports of the unfolding Second Gulf War. Qusay seizes Saddam's money from the Central Bank of Iraq on his father's orders. Meanwhile, Saddam orders his troops, particularly those from the Special Republican Guard, to fiercely resist the U.S.-led coalition forces. During a meeting with his sons in a Baghdad restaurant, Saddam advises Qusay to take care of Uday, who is commanding the Fedayeen Saddam paramilitary force. On 9 April, Saddam is forced from power as U.S. forces take over Baghdad. As U.S. troops begin manhunts for all the high-ranking regime members, Saddam flees to rural Tikrit and goes underground with his loyal confidants. He phones Samira from a call box and tells her to leave for Lebanon. Saddam hides out in a rustic building with his remaining bodyguards. He befriends Ahmed, a lively local boy who initially does not know his identity. Saddam broadcasts messages from his hideout insisting that the Iraqi people continue to resist the U.S. occupation. Meanwhile, Sajida and her family anxiously watch news coverage of the war. Uday, Qusay and Qusay's son Mustapha take refuge at a house in Mosul. Uday wishes to flee, but Qusay contemptuously refuses. Saddam is informed that there is a monetary reward for his family's betrayal, but he insists that they will not be caught. However, the owner of Uday and Qusay's safehouse betrays them to the Americans, and a large number of 101st Airborne Division troops surround the building with tanks and APCs. After refusing to give themselves up, and exchanging fire with the troops, the Americans fire a rocket at their position and all three are killed. Sajida is distressed to learns of her sons' deaths from TV news. After being informed of the deaths, Saddam secretly visits the graves of his sons and grandson, laying Iraqi flags on them. He continues trying to rally the Iraqi people against U.S. forces, saying that his fallen sons are heroes of jihad. Saddam's bodyguards build a tunnel where the former dictator can hide, but one of them is captured by U.S. troops when he visits his girlfriend. Saddam decides to move elsewhere, but Ahmed warns him of U.S. patrols. He offers to hide Saddam, but the former president refuses to involve him. In Operation Red Dawn, Saddam is captured and taken into custody. 2006: Saddam is placed on trial for crimes against humanity and is sentenced to death by hanging for five different crimes against humanity, including the Dujail Massacre.

The brick farmhouse on the property was built in the 1820s or 1830s, and is still used as the family's residence; its builder made the brick for the house himself. The main body of John Hunt Morgan's forces traveled by the farm on July 11, 1863. Afterwards, before 1863 was over, Harmon died and his property went to a local Methodist church.

The film was distributed by United Artists and directed by Zoltan Korda, and features Gregory Peck, Joan Bennett, and Robert Preston.. The screenplay was written by Casey Robinson and Seymour Bennett and adapted by Bennett and Frank Arnold, based on \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\\", the 1936 Ernest Hemingway short story. The film was rereleased in 1952 by Lippert Pictures as The Great White Hunter. Plot The film opens in the Kenya Colony of British East Africa. Distraught American woman Margaret \\"Margot\\" Macomber (Joan Bennett) is unhappily married to her American husband Francis Macomber (Robert Preston). As their plane lands in Nairobi, Kenya, accompanied by Robert Wilson (Gregory Peck), an English big- game hunter, Francis is dead from a gunshot wound to the back of his head. The film then pans back in time to before Francis Macomber's injury. Francis and Robert meet at the Norfolk Hotel to plan their safari over a whiskey. Then the story begins chronologically. What happened was this: Francis, a wealthy man, has alienated his wife Margot with his displays of cowardice and physical delicateness while on safari. Margaret is attracted to Robert so, to prove his masculinity, Francis sets out to kill a lion. He succeeds only in wounding it. Robert insists the animal must be tracked and killed so it will not suffer. When the wounded lion charges, Francis runs and Robert must shoot it. Francis is repeatedly, and accidentally, emasculated by Robert throughout the day. A furious Margot humiliates her husband by kissing Robert on the lips. As the couple's animosity grows, Francis is cruel and abusive to an African servant and Robert has to restrain him. The next morning, Francis wounds a cape buffalo with a courageous shot, comes to terms with his physical weaknesses, reconciles with Wilson (to whom he also expresses forgiveness for his wife), and thereby becomes a man. When the wounded cape buffalo charges and is not immediately dropped by shots from Macomber and Wilson, Margot takes aim and shoots; but her bullet strikes Francis and he falls dead. Robert tries to get her to admit that the shot was accidental as Margot prepares to go on trial. It is left unclear whether she intentionally shot her husband or merely feels guilt that the accident validated what was in her heart.

A period work, it takes place in D√ºsseldorf, Germany, in the late 1930s. Plot summary Rosalie, a 50-year-old widow, finds her youthful manner diminished by the \\"organic phenomena of her time of life,\\" or menopause. She lives with her adult unmarried daughter and an adolescent son, both of whom juxtapose youth to her \\"superannuated\\" purpose in life. The family hires a young, American-born man to tutor for her son. Rosalie is strongly attracted to him and is soon infatuated. Her daughter disapproves more strongly now of her still socializing mother. Then, seemingly miraculously, Rosalie's menopause reverses. Where her vitality, and sexual awareness would be in decline, she is in a heightened state of sexual awareness including the return of menstrual bleeding. Rosalie plans a family trip and declares her intentions and availability to the young man. They plan a liaison in the Rhine castle Schloss Benrath, but it never takes place. She is later found in her bed unconscious due to a hemorrhage caused by what would soon prove to be a fatal metastatic tumor in her uterus. The surgeons' commentary include a discussion on the possible causes of Rosalie's newfound youth. Cancer was an obvious cause of her tumor, but one doctor insinuates that it could have been the yearning for love and her altered or re-awakened erotic personality that stimulated her ovaries thereby causing the cancerous growth. Themes The setting for the story and Europe in transition after the First World War creates the old- fashioned and modern age comparisons which are developed strongly in the characters of Rosalie's family. The graphic descriptions in female biology, symbolic and overt sexuality and death create a dark picture for life's twilight. He revisits mortality and like Death in Venice, of 1912, comments on societal attitudes and age. As in that work, Rosalie dies before any interest is consummated. Cultural impact It stands as one of the first works to bring hard medicine into popular culture.

For this part of the abdominal examination, the patient can be asked to lift the head and shoulders from the examination table to tense the abdominal muscles. An alternative is to ask the patient to raise both legs with straight knees. A positive test indicates the increased likelihood that the abdominal wall and not the abdominal cavity is the source of the pain (for example, due to rectus sheath hematoma instead of appendicitis). A negative Carnett's sign is said to occur when the abdominal pain decreases when the patient is asked to lift the head; this points to an intra-abdominal cause of the pain. History This test was first described by John B. Carnett in 1926.Carnett JB (1926) Intercostal neuralgia as a cause of abdominal pain and tenderness. J. Surg. Gynecol. Obstet. 42:625-632 The first clear description of anterior abdominal wall pain arising from structures other than the underlying viscera was Cyriax in 1919.Cyriax EF (1919) On various conditions that may stimulate the referred pains of visceral disease, and a consideration of these from the point of view of cause and effect. Practitioner 102:314-322 Cyriax considered that pain could be mimicked by lesions that arose from the vertebra, ribs or other associated structure or that they were the result of direct irritation of intercostal nerves. By identifying conditions such as alterations in the normal vertebral curves, minor subluxation of vertebral bodies and pressure on the peripheral portions of the intercostal nerves, he was able to employ various mechanical treatments to correct the abnormalities and relieve his patients‚Äô symptoms. Despite this paper little attention was paid to this problem until Carnett developed his simple clinical test. Carnett thought that lower abdominal pain was commonly caused by the lower six thoracic nerves and wanted to be able to distinguish this origin from that arising from the viscera. Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of a positive Carnett's test includes hernias, nerve entrapment syndrome, irritation of intercostal nerve roots, thoracic disk herniations,Chronic Abdominal Syndrome Due to Nervous Compression. Study of 100 Cases and Proposed Diagnostic-Therapeutic Algorithm Francisco Javier P√©rez Lara,nJ. Quintero Quesada, J. A. Moreno Ramiro, R. Bustamante Toledo, A. Del Rey Moreno, and H. Oliva Mu√±oz J Gastrointest Surg. 2015; 19(6): 1059‚Äì1071. anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment, rib-tip syndrome, myofascial pain, trigger points and rectus sheath hematomas. All abdominal wall hernias may be associated with pain and Carnett's test may be useful in their evaluation. The hernias of the anterior abdominal wall include: epigastric hernias, umbilical hernias, spigelian hernias and incisional hernias. Those of the groin include: direct inguinal hernia, indirect inguinal hernia, femoral hernia and sports hernia. Those of the pelvic wall include: sciatic hernia, obturator hernia and perineal hernia. The support hernias include: vault prolapse, enterocele, cystocele, rectocele and uterine decensus. Although most hernias can be detected clinically with the presence of a lump with an expansile cough impulse some may be difficult to detect either because they are small or because the patient is obese. In cases where the diagnosis is suspected but clinically unconfirmed, additional investigation using radiography or ultrasonography may be helpful. Herniography, in which contrast medium is introduced into the peritoneal cavity, has been successfully used to reveal previously unsuspected inguinal hernias in patients with groin pain of uncertain origin and to detect impalpable interparietal lesions such as Spigelian hernias. Rib tip syndrome is characterized by pain along the costal margin and is caused by hypermobility of the eighth, ninth and tenth ribs. These ribs do not articulate with the sternum but instead are bound to each other by a thin band of fibrous tissue. If this fibrous attachment becomes divided, the rib(s) may ride up and irritate the intercostal nerve(s) causing pain. Clinically the patient may be aware of a snapping or clicking sensation as the ribs move relative to one another. The clinician can reproduce the symptoms by hooking his or her fingers under the costal margin and pulling upwards. Relief can be provided by anesthetizing the relevant intercostal nerve with local anesthetic. If symptoms persist, rib tip resection may be necessary. Spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma arises from rupture of the epigastric vessels. The patient usually presents with a sudden well-localized abdominal pain associated with a tender nonpulsatile abdominal mass, usually in the lower abdomen. There is frequently a plausible precipitating factor such as local trauma, a bout of coughing or anticoagulant therapy. The diagnosis can be confirmed on ultrasound examination and a conservative approach to treatment can be adopted provided that the hematoma does not enlarge. Carnett's test may be diagnostic in this setting.

Shepherd played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from through for the Philadelphia Phillies (1992), Colorado Rockies (1993), Boston Red Sox (1995) and Baltimore Orioles (1996). Listed at 6' 2\\", 205 lb., Shepherd batted and threw right-handed. Career Shepherd was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1986 MLB draft. Shepherd pitched for nine different MLB organizations from 1986‚Äì1997, including parts of four seasons in the MLB. He posted a 2-5 record with a 6.71 earned run average and three saves in 41 appearances for the Phillies, Rockies, Red Sox and Orioles. In 185 minor league appearances, he went 19-31 with 4.97 ERA and 32 saves. Keith Shepherd has pitched since 1998 for various teams in the Fort Wayne, Indiana 18 and over league. He also served as the assistant baseball coach under Justin Denney at Wabash High School. Shepherd also pitched in the Brother Elephants of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL). Personal Issues Keith was involved in a shooting that occurred in the City of Wabash on December 23, 2016. Wabash Police identified the victim of the shooting as Keith W. Shepherd, 48, Wabash. Wabash Police alleged at the time that the suspect in the shooting was Christina M. Bowman, 50, Wabash. He had surgery for a shot to the head and survived. The alleged attacker and ex-girlfriend, Christina Bowman, cut or stabbed herself after the shooting and after driving back to her home. She survived and was prosecuted in Wabash County, Indiana. During the Court Process it was revealed that she did, in fact, walk into his house on Allen Street in Wabash Indiana and quickly shot him in the face with a .380 Caliber Handgun that she had purchased just 8 days prior. She immediately fled the scene and was later captured by local Police at her resident on Sunset Drive where she was attempting to harm and or kill herself. She was later tried for Attempted murder and was found Guilty and Sentenced to 25 Years in Indiana Department of Corrections with 5 years suspended on Probatio, Bringing her likely Release Date in around 13 years time. Wabash County Prosecutor William C. Hartley Jr. represented the State of Indiana and the Defendant was represented by Attorney Mark Small of Indianapolis. After the Conviction of Bowman Keith filed suit against Bowman and Dunham‚Äôs Athleisure Corp., alleging that the store was negligent in the sale. In September 2018, Dunham‚Äôs filed a request for summary judgment against Shepherd and a Wabash County Superior Court judge denied Dunham‚Äôs request. That decision was reversed Wednesday by the Indiana Court of Appeals. The court said Dunham‚Äôs is immune for liability and the court erred when it denied summary judgment for the store. There are still questions whether the sale to Bowman was lawful. However, the appellate court referred to previous state rulings in which a shooting victim cannot rely on the harm caused by the misuse of a firearm, even if sold unlawfully, in order to sue the seller. In an earlier filing by Bowman‚Äôs attorney, Emily Guenin-Hodson, wrote, ‚ÄúThis is not a case about the 2nd Amendment. It is not a case involving the creation of new gun laws. This is a case about holding a gun dealer responsible for following federal and state regulations imposed on the commercial sale of arms.‚Äù In another filing, Dunham‚Äôs attorney, Robert Ahlgrim, wrote, ‚ÄúDunham‚Äôs employee did not have actual of knowledge that Bowman intended to commit a crime. The undisputed facts reveal that Bowman told the Dunham‚Äôs employee she wanted the firearm for her personal protection. According to Court Documents in the fall of 2016, Keith Shepherd and his girlfriend, Christina Bowman, went to a Dunham‚Äôs sports store in Wabash. She asked him to buy her a gun. He refused, and the couple argued. Shepherd told the clerk at the gun counter: ‚ÄúWhatever you do, don‚Äôt ever sell that little girl a gun. She‚Äôs dangerous. She would shoot me.‚Äù Shepherd didn‚Äôt leave Bowman‚Äôs name with the clerk. On Dec. 15, Bowman went back to Dunham‚Äôs and bought a gun. She was cleared in a background check, although Shepherd would later claim the paperwork wasn‚Äôt completed properly. This was finalized and closed in May of 2019 but Keith has been quoted as saying he Plans to continue to recover damages caused by Bowman and the Negligence of Dunhams.

Nilo-Saharan specialists have vacillated on a genealogical relationship between the Koman and Gumuz languages, a relationship called Komuz. Greenberg (1963) had included Gumuz in the Koman language family. Bender (1989, 1991) classified them together in a distant relationship he called Komuz, but by 1996 he had reversed himself, though he kept both groups in core Nilo-Saharan. Dimmendaal (2008) kept them together, though expressed doubts over whether they belonged in Nilo-Saharan, later referring to Gumuz as an isolate (2011). Ahland (2010, 2012), on the basis of new Gumuz data, resurrected the hypothesis. Blench (2010) independently came to the same conclusion and suggested that the Shabo language might be a third, outlying branch. The classification of Shabo is difficult because of a strong Koman influence on the language that is independent of any genealogical relationship between them. Schnoebelen (2009), moreover, sees Shabo as a likely isolate. Languages Shabo is included per Blench (2010).

Claxton, and produced by Robert L. Lippert. The film stars Raymond Burr, Martha Hyer and Joan Bennett. The screenplay was written by Charles Lang, based on a novel by Harry Whittington. Plot Lonnie Wilson (Ken Scott), the son of a sharecropper, Zuba Wilson (Douglas Fowley), returns to his small southern hometown of Clinton, Louisiana after spending six years on the chain-gang for killing Colonel Ben Marquand's son, Davey, in an automobile accident. He revives his love affair with Melinda Marquand (Martha Hyer), who is now Mrs. Melinda Thomas, having married Dr. Ned Thomas (Brett Halsey) while Lonnie was serving time in her place for the accident she caused.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053762/ IMDB Somewhat miffed about all this, Lonnie incites Dr. Ned about his wife's infidelity, which Dr. Ned verifies when he catches Lonnie and Melinda in a semi-torrid embrace in Colonel Marquand's hunting lodge. Melinda, looking for an explanation, shoots and wounds Lonnie to defend her innocence by claiming she was being raped. Colonel Marquand (Raymond Burr), who had bribed Lonnie to take the blame for his daughter, uses her story to have Sheriff Wheaton (Kelly Thordsen) kill Lonnie, thereby putting an end to all this mess. Mrs. Marquand (Joan Bennett) eventually faces Davey's death and realizes that she witnessed Melinda run down her little brother. Peter Marquand (Jack Ging) and Ned return to the lodge and inform Otis that the charges against Lonnie are all lies. Exonerated, Lonnie gives Zuba the deed to the farm, and the old man dances in delight, thrilled to finally own his land.https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/89222/Desire-in-the-Dust/overview Cast *Raymond Burr as Col.

It, along with Freckles and The Purple Hills, was the first in a new eight- picture deal between API and 20th Century Fox. (It was later followed by Squad Car, Secret of the Purple Reef and Frontier Judge.) Lippert said he wanted to film the novel to attract a more adult novel and \\"attract important people in the business to what we're trying to do.\\" Dana Andrews was originally cast in the lead but backed out. He was replaced by Raymond Burr, then three years into Perry Mason, which was on a production break due to a writers strike. Filming started in July 1960 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

It is based in Westland, Michigan. Named after its most successful game at the time of debut, Rifts, its content pertains to all the games in the Palladium system, though after the first three years they ceased accepting articles specifically for games based on licenses (Specifically, Robotech, Macross II, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but would apply to any other licenses should they be acquired), over concerns with the licensing agents. History In 1988 through 1991, Palladium published a small newsprint product called \\"The Magic of Palladium Books\\"https://index.rpg.net/display- entry.phtml?mainid=7906, meant for sale or give-away at stores and conventions. Consisting of 6 issues, it had a letter column, errata for games, a few fan-submitted articles, and a selection of house ads and official supplements. The last issue was a double issue numbered 7/8https://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=7943, consisting of the contents of what had been planned for the two issues had they been printed separately. After Wayne Smith joined Palladium, the subject of a new Palladium periodical along the line of West End Games Star Wars Adventure Journal was proposed, to cover the entire line of Palladium's role playing games. Like the WEG product, it would be printed more like a conventional sourcebook, to increase its durability. Wayne was named the editor for magazine, and Palladium Books began requesting submissions for The Rifter via word of mouth, forums, and posts on their now-defunct official mailing list, during 1997, with the first issue seeing print in the first quarter of 1998. Special Issues Beyond standard numbering, there is also a digital-only \\"The Rifter 0\\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/92159/The-RifterR-0, a \\"Best of The Rifter\\" compilation released in 2006 for the Palladium 25th anniversaryhttp://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/60703/Best-of-The-RifterR, and a limited-edition \\"Wayne Smith's The Rifter 9.5\\". The 9.5 issue was an \\"April Fools\\" issue compiled of comedy, parody and satire subjects, mostly ones that would not have fit the themes of the standard issues, and had been accumulating in the submission pile. https://index.rpg.net/display- entry.phtml?mainid=6902 It was assembled, printed & solicited to distributors without editor Wayne Smith's knowledge by the rest of the Palladium staff, with the \\"Wayne Smith's\\" tag added as a tribute to Wayne for his hard work on the series, in parody of the style of several movie titles. Due to the financial crisis resulting from the embezzlement and theft from Palladium by an employee/minor stockholder, Issue #34 of The Rifter had an exceptionally small print run compared to other issues, and its print version is sought after by Palladium collectors. Issue #35 had an editorial discussing the incident, in addition to being a \\"Swimsuit Issue\\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/60704/The-RifterR-35 with a selection of art by Palladium artists and friends, including drawings of some of the male staff. Publishing Frequency While officially a quarterly publication, the actual printing and distribution dates are irregular from other products being higher priority. This results in some issues being \\"late\\", with the next issue following only 1‚Äì2 months later, in order to maintain four issues per year. Often, the 4th issue of a year might be pushed into January of the next. A discounted subscription to a year's worth of The Rifter is usually offered during the first quarter of each year by Palladium.

Harry refuses to believe his football days are over. While his wife Kathy supports the family, Harry spends time with his son, Willie, teaching him football. But while battling his depression, Harry becomes attracted to Dee Shane, who persuades him to become an entertainer, telling his old football stories on stage. Harry thinks he's a natural for that, but flops before a big audience and proceeds to go on a three-day drinking binge. Kathy begins seeing another man, Gordon, and it appears Harry has lost her. He tries wrestling to make a living, but his heart isn't in it. His old football coach gives Harry a last shot in a big game against the Navy, but he plays poorly and is benched. Harry asks if he can remain on the sideline for the sake of his son in the bleachers. When the war-depleted team runs out of healthy bodies, though, Harry is needed again and scores a touchdown.

(Haydn was in his mid-20s at the composition of this symphony.) =First Movement= Similarities have been drawn between the opening movement and the finale to Georg von Reutter's Servizio di tavola in C major from 1757. The two knew each other because Reutter was the director of music in St. Stephen's Cathedral where Haydn sang as a child. =Second Movement= The work is one of the few symphonies of the Classical era to place the Minuet second (others include Haydn's 32nd and 44th, and his brother Michael's 15th and 16th). The IMSLP reverses the order of the Menuet e Trio and the Andante, thus bringing the movement order to the standard that was eventually established as common practice. =Third Movement= The slow movement is very similar to the slow movement in one of Haydn's earliest piano sonatas, Hob.

Suitability models might aid in finding a favorable location for a new facility, road, or habitat for a species of bird.Wade, T. and Sommer, S. eds. A to Z GIS Overlay analysis is a common method for creating a suitability model which involves using GIS techniques and software.‚ÄúUnderstanding overlay analysis‚Äù. Esri. http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2/index.html#//009z000000rs000000 Overlay techniques were originally advanced by Ian McHarg who used a manual overlay cartographic process which he describes in his 1969 book Design with Nature.Malczewski, J. 2004. ‚ÄúGIS-based land-use suitability analysis: a critical overview‚Äù. Progress in Planning, 62(1), 3-65. With the advancement of computer mapping software, suitability modeling has become much easier and faster to implement, and today it is used for many varying tasks.  Overview  There are seven general steps required to create an acceptable suitability model: # Define the problem # Break the problem into submodels # Determine significant layers # Reclassify or transform the data within a layer # Weight the input layers # Add or combine the layers # Analyze Mitchell, A. 2012. The Esri Guide to GIS Analysis, Volume 3: Modeling Suitability, Movement, and Interaction. Esri Press. http://esripress.esri.com/display/index.cfm?fuseaction=display&websiteid;=215&moduleid;=0 = Define the Problem= Without a clear understanding of the problem that needs to be solved a suitability model cannot be successful. All other steps in the process will contribute to the objective of solving this problem. The components of this objective should also be defined, as well as a way of knowing when the problem has been solved. Consider the issue of deforestation, to lower deforestation rates a suitability model could be created to model areas most likely to be deforested in the immediate future; laws and regulating entities could then be focused on those areas most susceptible to deforestation. The overall goal of the deforestation suitability model would be to slow the rate of deforestation. = Break the Problem into Submodels = The complexity of most suitability modeling problems can be overwhelming and confusing; for this reason, it is advisable to break the model into submodels. For deforestation there are many different drivers, therefore a variety of submodels would be needed. Population, population density, movement of people, elevation, slope, land cover type, hydrology, location of protected areas, soil type, laws, roads and infrastructure, the list could go on, all of these things affect where deforestation happens and the intensity. Combining these factors could lead to a submodel for physical environment (elevation, slope, land cover, land use, soil type, and hydrology), for built environment (roads, infrastructure, and other relevant transportation networks), and for demographic characteristics (population, population density, population growth rate, and poverty rate) . = Determine Significant Layers = Each submodel should be defining an aspect of the overall model, and only submodel factors which contribute to solving the original problem should be included in a submodel. It is in this step that data must be gathered and layers created; for example, it may be known that deforestation usually happens a certain distance from city/road/agricultural areas, therefore a Euclidean distance tool (within a GIS software package) could be used to create a distance raster around these areas. = Reclassification/Transformation = There are many different datasets going into the model, all with varying number systems; this means that attempting to combine these datasets would give meaningless results. Therefore, a common number scale should be chosen (usually 1 to 9 for a weighted overlay and 0 to 1 for a fuzzy overlay; with larger values signifying more favorable areas) and each dataset reclassified to the new scale (there should be a tool for this in most GIS applications).‚ÄúOverlay analysis approaches‚Äù. Esri. http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2/index.html#//009z000000rt000000 = Weight = If there is strong evidence that some factors contribute more to the main goal these factors should be weighted based on their level of contribution. For instance, focusing specifically on deforestation in Africa, previous research shows that one of the main causes of deforestation is fuel wood extraction; therefore, variables associated with fuel wood extraction should be weighted more heavily than other variables. Weighting should not be done if a fuzzy overlay is used. = Add/Combine = To complete the model, all factors must be combined, usually through a weighted overlay or fuzzy overlay technique. For a weighted overlay all the factors would be added together and reclassified to form a new data layer where high values signify more favorable locations and low values less favorable locations. A fuzzy overlay analysis produces the same type of results but through more complex methods. = Analyze = Once the suitability model is complete the results should be analyzed. It is always a good idea to examine the results closely to verify that they make sense and no mistakes were made. Before the model is used the results should also be verified and validated. Ideally, the value of predictive methods based in habitat suitability to estimate for instance the population size of common species should be tested before conducting large- scale monitoring, rather than a posteriori. Although logistically challenging, this can be achieved by designing monitoring programs including an intensive sampling of abundance in ad hoc reference areas of variable size. After the analysis is complete locations can be selected using the model and this information can be applied to the original problem. = References = Geographic information systems ","title":"Suitability model"},{"id":"18587030","text":"Bill C-27 was proposed legislation that would have changed to Canadian laws to help prevent identity theft. A bilingual copy of the Bill is available on the Parliament of Canadas website. The bill was never passed, as it died on the order paper when Stephen Harper's government prorogued parliament in December 2008.  Proposed legislation = Official document = An official document was defined as follow in the Bill: \\"For the purposes of this section, \\"identity document\\" means a Social Insurance Number card, a driver's licence, a health insurance card, a birth certificate, a passport as defined in subsection 57(5), a document that simplifies the process of entry into Canada, a certificate of citizenship, a document indicating immigration status in Canada or a certificate of Indian status, issued or purported to be issued by a department or agency of the federal or a provincial government, or any similar document issued or purported to be issued by a foreign government.\\"C-27 The bill did not include debit cards and credit cards. For someone to possess someone else's official document, they would have had to have the document owner's permission or provide a valid reason. Valid include genealogical research and administration of justice. =Credit cards and debit cards= Possessing, using, and trafficking are at the same level, without colour of right. It is not legal to possess someone else's credit card. It is not legal to possess any material that can copy or falsify credit cards. This bill would have made illegal all devices used to copy credit card data, something that was not clearly defined in previous bills. =Mail= Mail provides another avenue for identity theft. Businesses and governments send mail containing cheques, credit cards, bank statements, and other important information. Even personal letters can contain information potentially useful to identity thieves. To protect the public, bill C-27 would have clarified the definition of identity theft. Absconding with correctly delivered mail \\"after it is delivered but before it is in the possession of the addressee or of a person who may reasonably be considered to be authorized by the addressee to receive mail\\" is considered stealing. Before, the definition ended where the mail is delivered. It was unclear whether deliver meant the post office put the mail in the mailbox or the intended recipient had it in their hands. This revision would have removed the ambiguity. =Forging documents= The bill stated that people should not accept or use any document as genuine when it seems forged. A person should not make available any document they suspect are forgeries. Regardless of intent, it is a crime to make it available. Basically, one cannot claim, \\"People are free to do what they want with a forged document.\\" The bill stated that using, buying, exporting, importing, repairing any device that is used to build forged documents is unlawful. One needs an authorization, or a lawful excuse. New content= Identity theft and identity fraud = Identity information is any and all data that could be used to identify a person. Such information can be in the form of name, date of birth, signature, credit card number, debit card number, SIN, or other information. The bill also would have included other identifiers such as biological identifiers, DNA, fingerprint, retinal image, iris image, and voice print. Early in 2008, the Province of British Columbia began testing the use of such biometrics in a new enhanced drivers license.ICBC Bill C-27 defined identity theft as the following: \\"Everyone commits an offence who transmits, makes available, distributes, sells or offers for sale another person's identity information, or has it in their possession for any of those purposes, knowing or believing that or being reckless as to whether the information will be used to commit an indictable offence that includes fraud, deceit or falsehood as an element of the offence.\\" The bill stated that a trial would occur in the province in which the allegation has happened, or, if the accused is not in that province, the trial cannot happen without the approval of the Attorney General of that province.

While it may occur naturally in any visual field, the term is most commonly used in design (especially graphic design and Cartography), where elements are intentionally designed to make some look more important than others. This order is created by the visual contrast between forms in a field of perception. Objects with highest contrast to their surroundings are recognized first by the human mind. A representation of hierarchical feature extraction and combination in the visual system. Theory The concept of visual hierarchy is based in Gestalt psychological theory, an early 20th-century German theory that proposes that the human brain has innate organizing tendencies that ‚Äústructure individual elements, shapes or forms into a coherent, organized whole,‚Äù especially when processing visual information.Jackson, Ian. ‚ÄúGestalt‚ÄîA Learning Theory for Graphic Design Education.‚Äù International Journal of Art and Design Education. Volume 27. Issue 1 (2008): 63-69. Digital. The German word Gestalt translates into ‚Äúform,‚Äù ‚Äúpattern,‚Äù or ‚Äúshape‚Äù in English.Pettersson, Rune. ‚ÄúInformation Design‚ÄîPrinciples and Guidelines.‚Äù Journal of Visual Literacy. Volume 29. Issue 2 (2010): 167-182. Digital. When an element in a visual field disconnects from the ‚Äòwhole‚Äô created by the brain's perceptual organization, it ‚Äústands out‚Äù to the viewer. The shapes that disconnect most severely from their surroundings stand out the most. This is commonly encapsulated as the Von Restorff effect, which states that isolation attracts attention. =Physical characteristics= The brain disassociates objects from one another based upon the differences between their physical characteristics. These characteristics fall into four categories: color, size, alignment, and character.Feldsted, CJ. Design Fundamentals. New York: Pittman Publishing Corporation, 1950. Each type of contrast can be used to construct a visual hierarchy. The same characteristics are also sometimes categorized (especially among cartographers) according to the visual variables of Jacques Bertin.Tait, A. (2018). Visual Hierarchy and Layout. The Geographic Information Science & Technology Body of Knowledge (2nd Quarter 2018 Edition), John P. Wilson (ed.). DOI: 10.22224/gistbok/2018.2.4 In this 1905 map, the rivers and parks are at the top of the visual hierarchy due to color contrast and size, the title stands out due to size and alignment, and to a lesser degree, the central city stands out due to character, because the angled street pattern contrasts with the rest of the grid. Even the empty space in West Denver attracts attention due to its contrast with the overall complexity of the map and its central position. The individual streets and their names are at the bottom of the visual hierarchy due to lack of contrast, even though that was probably the intended primary purpose of the map. * Color encompasses the hue, saturation, value, and perceived texture of forms. Dark figures will stand out on a light background, light figures will stand out on a dark background, brightly- colored figures will stand out on a muted background, and so on. The fluorescent colors used for tennis balls and other sports equipment is intended to make them instantly stand out against almost any natural visual field. * Size has a strong influence on visual hierarchy. Large elements will almost always attract attention, as long as they can be recognized as figures. * Alignment is the arrangement of forms relative to one another. For example, items in the upper left corner of a page are often seen first (at least for those readers accustomed to western languages), the center of the field has prominence. Negative space can also be employed: a figure isolated among large amounts of white space will stand out more than one amid other figures. * Character includes several kinds of contrasts based on shape. For example, complex patterns attract more attention than simple or predictable patterns, intricate shapes attract more attention than generalized ones. Even large- scale patterns can attract attention if they contrast with the pattern in the remainder of the visual field. Camouflage is an example of eliminating contrast in character in color and/or character specifically to reduce visual hierarchy. The \\"squint test\\" is often suggested as a simple, if unscientific, method to evaluate the visual hierarchy of a graphical product like a map or web page.Jeff Gothelf, The Squint Test: How quick exposure to design can reveal its flaws, Usabilla When viewed out of focus (or from a great distance), the viewer is not distracted by details, but can only see overall (gestalt) patterns such as visual hierarchy. All of the above patterns, except some aspects of character, are recognizable by this method. Application Visual hierarchy is an important concept in the field of graphic design, a field that specializes in visual organization. Designers attempt to control visual hierarchy to guide the eye to information in a specific order for a specific purpose. One could compare visual hierarchy in graphic design to grammatical structure in writing in terms of the importance of each principle to these fields. =Cartography= In cartographic design, visual hierarchy is used to emphasize certain important features on a map over less important features.Robinson, Arthur H. Elements of Cartography. 6th ed., Wiley, 1995. Typically, a map has a purpose that dictates a conceptual hierarchy of what should be more or less important, so one of the goals of the choice of map symbols is to match the visual hierarchy to the conceptual hierarchy.https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/resources/carto-design/clear- visual-hierachy.html. The Visual hierarchy of a map may apply to individual geographic features (such as making a single country stand out), to map layers of related features (e.g., making lakes stand out more than roads), and to the entire layout of map and non-map elements (e.g., making the title look more important than the scale bar). Like the main map elements, such features have weight, and the properties that apply to visual hierarchy of map layers also apply to other elements on the page. Size and alignment are the two main determinants of the visual hierarchy for these features.Slocum, Terry A. Chapter 5 in Thematic Cartography and Geovisualization, Pearson, 2014. Cartographers often utilize principles of negative space and figure-ground contrast to design an appropriate visual hierarchy by employing contrast between unused space and layout features. =UX Design and Behavioral Design= In user experience design and behavioral design, such as website design, visual hierarchy is used to prioritize navigational structures and content, so that audiences focus on elements that facilitate system usage, or increases the chance that they notice content that contains psychological nudges. Color is one of many factors used in the design of a visual hierarchy, and a key factor due to the high salience of color perception. Cugelman, B. Cugeman, R. et al. (2019) Color Psychology.

The song was released on September 14, 2008 in the Rock Band 2 video game. The song was written by vocalist Axl Rose, guitarists Robin Finck and Buckethead, drummer Bryan Mantia, producer Caram Costanzo and engineer Pete Scaturro. It was included as the b-side to the single \\"Chinese Democracy\\". Background Guitarist Ron \\"Bumblefoot\\" Thal plays the solo on fretless guitar, some rhythm guitar, guitar in the pre- chorus, and the ending solo. He stated it was one of the first songs he worked on with the band after joining in 2006. Shackler's Revenge was announced as being included in the Rock Band 2 game on July 14, 2008. The song marks a major departure from Guns N' Roses typcal sound, incorporating elements of industrial rock, electronic rock, nu metal, sludge rock, and alternative rock. The song was leaked to the internet in August 2008. At the time, Rolling Stone described the song, saying \\"the song‚Äôs low crunch sticks with the album‚Äôs long-stated industrial leanings, and again, layers upon layers of Axls create a particular sort of demented choir.\\" The song was released when the game launched on September 14, 2008, making the song it the first official release of new Guns N' Roses material since 1999's \\"Oh My God\\". The song was picked for the game because the developers wanted a Guns N' Roses song, then decided they want one that will be on the \\"mysterious\\" Chinese Democracy album; Rose helped the team to select the specific song. The song has been described as having industrial influences, and according to vocalist Axl Rose, was written in reaction to \\"the insanity of senseless school shootings and also the media trying desperately to make more out of one shooter's preference for the Guns song Brownstone to no avail\\". Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho had written a play based on the lyrics of the Guns N' Roses song \\"Mr. Brownstone\\". Former Guns N' Roses drummer Bryan \\"Brain\\" Mantia created a club inspired remix in 2009 for a pending remix album of songs of Chinese Democracy. Reception The song drew many comparisons to industrial and electronic acts Nine Inch Nails, The Prodigy, Marilyn Manson, Korn and Rob Zombie. IGN gave the song a 5.5 (Mediocre) rating, saying \\"Shackler's Revenge reeks of affluence, sounding more like a one-time wizard of rock playing with ProTools and faceless hired guns in his bedroom palace, creating a song that will ultimately be a disposable hit without any legs to stand on.\\" Common Sense Media gave the song 3 out of 5, stating \\"There's still some of that dated sound to \\"Shackler's Revenge\\", but Axl's distinct wail and a sharp chorus save the song, making it a respectable comeback.\\" Chuck Klosterman, writing for The A.V. Club stated \\"A song like \\"Shackler's Revenge\\" is initially average, until you get to the solo‚Äîthen it becomes the sonic equivalent of a Russian robot wrestling a reticulating python.\\" Consequence of Sound reacted positively to the track, saying \\"(Shackler's) keeps it in the digitized realm, only now there‚Äôs this decadent dance swing to it. The sludge rock verses may require an adjustment, but the pre-chorus is bouncy and fun, which all lead up to an anthemic chorus that will have everyone‚Äôs fists in the air. ABC News cited \\"Shackler's Revenge\\" and \\"Chinese Democracy\\" as \\"hyperactive bashers that recall GNR splendor.\\" Music Radar gave the song a negative review, stating \\"Ultimately, Shackler's Revenge finds Axl Rose trapped in a cul-de-sac of his own design. The one-time brash confrontationalist now holes himself up in his Hollywood Xanadu, on his own with no direction home\\" and criticized it for sounding dated. Metal Injection reacted positively, stating \\"Axl sounds like he's catching up to the mid-'90s industrial craze, but he's way overdue to cash in on NIN's success. Here it's unlike anything he's tried before, much less anything huge on rock radio these days. I didn't think much of it when it hit Rock Band 2 last fall, but after last night the chorus won't get out of my head.\\" In February 2016, Spin ranked the song the 18th best Guns N' Roses song, stating \\"In some ways, this Rock Band-debuted single is just a steroidal update of what the flailing, pointless ‚ÄúOh My God‚Äù was probably supposed to be: screeching Deftones opening riff, programmed industrial funkadoodles last heard in 1997, and disco midsection, check, check, double-check. But in other ways, there‚Äôs just no other band that sounds like this.\\" In a June 2018 column, Loudwire ranked it 67th out of 87.

The street, El Mio, is named after the house, which is how the Smith family referred to it during their residence. Built in 1887, the house was designed in the Queen Anne style by Abram M. Edelman. It has been the residence of a judge who wrote books on occultism, the head of the Los Angeles Railway, and a deputy mayor; and as a shooting location for the cult films Spider Baby, Silent Scream and Insidious: Chapter 2. It has also been declared a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Occupants of the home=Judge Hatch= Original occupant Judge David Patterson Hatch The house was built for Judge David Patterson Hatch (1846‚Äì1912). While the National Register indicates the house was built in 1890, a newspaper article from July 1887 reported that the house was already under construction: > \\"The frame of Judge Hatch's $10,000 residence, which is to overlook the > beautiful Highland Park when completed, has now been raised and the owner is > pressing the workmen to their greatest endeavors to get it completed.\\" Hatch became a judge in 1880 and gained fame presiding over the Perkins- Baldwin case‚Äîa breach of marriage promise case against Lucky Baldwin, a gold prospector who became one of the wealthiest men in Los Angeles and founded Santa Anita Park on his estate. The jury awarded the plaintiff $75,000‚Äîat the time \\"the highest amount of damages in the history of the bar of California.\\" (The case was followed daily by the press, and a search of the Los Angeles Times archives reveals more than 50 articles reporting on the contents of Lucky Baldwin's love letters and every other detail of the case. Some of the more colorful and breathless headlines from the case are included below.) In 1886, Hatch left the bench and became the senior member of the Los Angeles law firm of Hatch, Lloyd & Hunt. Hatch also became known nationally as a writer on philosophy and the occult, with works including \\"Scientific Occultism\\", \\"The Twentieth Century Christ\\", \\"The Blood of the Gods\\", \\"Text Book of Christian Hermit Philosophers\\" and the novel \\"El Reschid\\" (one of a series of books written under \\"the Hindoo name of Karishka\\"). When he died in 1912, the Times called him \\"a remarkable man\\" who was \\"exceptionally versed in the deep philosophies of life\\" and who had \\"obtained a deep knowledge of universal laws, which, although natural to himself, appeared as mysticism to those who had not followed his great mental strides.\\" =Smith family= The family of railroad man C.W. Smith owned the house for more than 60 years. Though Judge Hatch was the original occupant, the house was acquired by Charles Warren Smith in the mid or late 1890s and remained in the Smith family until the early 1960s. For this reason it became known as the Smith Estate. Charles Smith was a railroad man who was at various times the first vice president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, the receiver of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad and the general manager of the Pasadena and Los Angeles Electric Railway Company. In 1900, Henry Huntington named Smith, described as \\"an old-time employe (sic) of the Southern Pacific, having been with the road in its early days,\\" as the superintendent of the Los Angeles Railway's streetcar lines. At the time of his retirement, the Los Angeles Times reported: \\"Manager Smith has earned a rest, if any one has, from years of arduous toil as the manager of great transportation properties.\\" During the Smiths' occupancy, the home became known for its parties. In 1901, the Smiths held a Fourth of July party at the home, which the Los Angeles Times described as follows: > \\"From 8:30 until 12 o'clock dancing was enjoyed at the home of Misses Smith. > The music room was decorated with pepper boughs and roses and streamers of > red, white and blue ribbon hung from the center chandelier to the sides of > the room. Punch was served on the side veranda, which was decorated in > roses.\\" And in June 1904, Mrs. Smith hosted a Japanese tea at the house featuring Japanese music, tea served by Japanese girls, stereoscopic views of Japan, and an address by a woman who had lived 12 years in Japan. The tea was a fundraiser, and the admission was 25 cents. One long-time Highland Park resident in the 1930s recalled the Smith house as one of the first in the area: \\"There were few homes in our section of Highland Park then. The C.W. Smith house which pointed an architectural finger from its hill top, a beacon for lost souls who traveled out that far ... A few other dwellings there were, but these were the landmarks.\\" The Smiths' son, Stanley Quay Smith, married Clara Maurer in 1911, and lived at the house until his death at age 72 in 1958. According to his obituary, he had lived at the family's landmark home since 1895. =Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Gage= Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Michael Gage bought the house in 1988 for $515,000. At the time, the Los Angeles Times noted that Gage was an ardent preservationist and he and his wife, Lacey, had both fallen in love with the home. The Times noted that the house, built on a hilltop with four bedrooms and maids' quarters, had a view of Gage's office at Los Angeles City Hall.\\" Gage was credited in the late 1980s with reviving the political pulse of Mayor Tom Bradley's administration. (\\"Political insiders say the credit for reviving a sagging Bradley administration goes to Michael Gage, his Deputy Mayor for the last year and a half. ... 'There has been a total change of attitude in the Mayor's office with Gage there,' said Dorothy Green, president of Heal the Bay.\\") =Current ownership= Smith Estate from the base of El Mio Street As of 2008, the house had been owned for approximately eleven years by Tim and Mari Parker. On film In 1964, Jack Hill shot the horror comedy cult film Spider Baby (also known as Attack of the Liver Eaters)The Internet Movie Database at the Smith Estate. A short clip from the film showing a full view of the estate and the front porch can be viewed on YouTube.com.YouTube Spider Baby clip here starting at the 5:53 mark In 2007, writer/director Hill recalled: \\"We did a documentary for the DVD where I went back to the house and showed where we shot this, where we shot that. Today, of course, it's been remodeled and people are living there and it's probably worth a couple of million.\\" Silent Scream was also shot at this location. The exterior of the house can be viewed in the opening ten minutes of the film. Insidious: Chapter 2 was shot extensively at El Mio, and the home is featured - inside and out - as one of the film's major locations. Historic designation Front facade The house was declared a Historic Cultural Monument (HCM #142) by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission in 1975, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

Lessac's voice text teaches the ‚Äúfeeling process‚Äù for discovering vocal sensation in the body for developing tonal clarity, articulation, and for better connecting to text and the rhythms of speech. Development of ideas He first studied voice as a student on scholarship at the Eastman School of Music where he graduated in 1936. Lessac's big break into the professional performance scene occurred with Pins and Needles in 1937, a production written and performed by members in the cultural program of the International Ladies Garment Workers‚Äô Union (ILGWU). Lessac taught his ideas of feeling sensation to the amateur performers and helped them develop their voices and bodies. Lessac's next Broadway job came in 1939 with a group of European refugees needing accent elimination for their show From Vienna. Lessac taught the cast how to feel and enjoy the sensations of the consonants. When the show opened, famed critic Brooks Atkinson wrote the cast spoke better English than those for whom English is their native language. Lessac pursued his interest in health and wellness with voice and movement and gained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Voice-Speech Clinical Therapy from New York University in 1941. Four years later he founded the National Academy of Vocal Arts (NAVA) and taught there until 1950. He further developed the feeling process of voice and movement studies with his 21 teachers. In 1951 he continued discovering the benefits of his work when he taught voice in the Stella Adler Theatre Studio for one year, furthering his explorations of voice and movement for actors. In the same year Lessac began his 20-year tenure with the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. Lessac was in charge of teaching the students seeking ordination how to deliver sermons with good speech, voice and enthusiasm. Instead of simply reading the sermons from the weekly scrolls, Lessac taught them how to commune with the text and inspire their audiences through their vocal delivery. Several important events happened during his time with the Jewish Theological Seminary. First, Lessac earned a Master of Arts degree in Voice-Speech Clinical Therapy from New York University in 1953 and worked with speech therapy patients at Bellevue Hospital throughout the 1950s. Lessac continued his studies in neurology and anatomy as he helped patients regain sensation in their faces and mouths through vocal explorations. Lessac helped patients with a myriad of afflictions ranging from stuttering to gaining mobility in parts of the face lacking nerve action due to Bell's Palsy. Lessac's work on employing the spirit toward the benefit of a healthy voice developed. By focusing on what a patient could do (and not focusing on disability or lack), patients became empowered in their abilities, engaged their spirits in therapy. Moreover, Lessac's work reiterated the importance of allowing the pleasure of feeling vocal vibration or body's energy guide one towards optimal expression and wellness. Professional development Lessac's work with actors changed with the publication of his book in 1960. Famed directors Elia Kazan and Robert Whitehead appointed Lessac as teacher of voice, speech, singing and dialects for their historic repertory company at the Lincoln Center in 1962. Here Lessac worked with two of the top teachers in acting and dance, Robert Lewis and Anna Sokolow. Although the company only lasted one season, working with the most respected theatre professionals at the time reveals how much of an impact his work made on the theatre community. In the summer of 1969, the theatre program at the State University of New York (SUNY) in Binghamton hired Lessac as full professor with immediate tenure with the mandate to develop the undergraduate and MFA acting program. The summer after his first year, he began teaching intensive workshops over 8 weeks that included all the tenets of his voice and body work. The intensives continue today each summer over 4 weeks and are taught by his master teachers of the work. Lessac left SUNY in 1981 as Professor Emeritus, but continued teaching in training programs all over the United States, Puerto Rico, Germany, Yugoslavia, South Africa, and Mexico. Lessac's teachers and disciples felt the urgency of maintaining the pedagogical practices of the work plus the desire to expand kinesensic research into new terrain. They founded the Lessac Institute in 1998 and developed an examination for teaching certification in 2000. The Lessac Institute now has dozens of certified trainers in sixteen states as well as trainers in South Africa, Germany, Belgium, and England. In addition, there are dozens of practitioners on track for certification. Software Lessac's work is the basis for a new software for text-to-speech technology being developed by Lessac Technologies, Inc. (LTI) of West Newton, Massachusetts.

It claims the territory of the 18th- century colony of West Florida, which includes land that the US currently splits between parts of the states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida. The Dominion claims to be \\"striving for Dominion Status as a Commonwealth Realm, on a par with Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and The Bahamas\\". The organization neither is acknowledged by any government nor exercises any authority over its claimed territory, and its activities are largely limited to the internet.  History  The micronation was founded in November 2005 in order to \\"reassert Britain's rights\\" over the region, by an individual identified on the micronation's website only as \\"Robert VII, Duke of Florida\\". The website asserts that Duke Robert \\"inherited the Peerage of the Dominion\\" in 1969, and \\"accepted the position of Governor General\\" in 1994. The micronation has issued cinderella stamps and has minted several base metal coins, produced by Jorge Vidal and issued in denominations based on pre-decimal pounds. The US got Florida from Spain, after Spain got Florida from Great Britain in the Peace of Paris. But the founders of the micronation assert that control of the region had actually defaulted to the United Kingdom in 1808, upon the removal from office of King Charles IV of Spain. This interpretation of historic events is not supported by any mainstream historian.Mathson, S and Lorenzen, M.G. (2008).

Synthesis The 1,2-addition of 2-methylcyclohexanone (I) with 2-thienyllithium (II) or 2-thienylmagnesium bromide (III) gives cyclohexanol (IV) as a diastereomeric mixture, which was treated with sodium azide (NaN3) in trichloroacetic acid to yield the azide (V).

He was a Ministerialist member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for the seat of Gympie from 1896 to 1899 and a Commonwealth Liberal Party member of the Australian House of Representatives for Lilley from 1913 to 1917. Early life and career Stumm was born in Germany, but was brought to his Australia by his parents at the age of 2 and raised in Toowoomba, Queensland, where he was educated at public schools. He moved to Gympie at the age of 15 and lived there for the rest of his life, with the exception of a few years at Maryborough. He worked as a Hansard reporter and worked as a journalist for The Gympie Times before purchasing the newspaper in partnership with A. G. Ramsey in 1880. Stumm subsequently took on the newspaper's editorship. He was also a member of the Ambulance Brigade Committee, Fire Brigade Board and Gympie Turf Club Committee and the School of Arts and Technical College Committee. Stumm used his newspaper to campaign against the sitting member for Gympie, Andrew Fisher (who later became Labor's second Prime Minister of Australia), accusing Fisher of being a dangerous revolutionary and an anti- Catholic. State and federal politics Stumm ran against Fisher for his Gympie seat as in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland at the 1896 colonial election, contesting as a Ministerialist, and won. However, he retired from parliament in 1899 after only one term, citing a need to attend to his business interests and his frustration with \\"the growing tendency to make the Legislative Assembly a mere House of Talk\\". Stumm returned to his business interests after his retirement from state politics. He was involved in the formation of the Wide Bay Dairy Co-Operative Ltd in 1906 and served on its board of directors, later serving several years as chairman. He also had significant interests in mining investments. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Wide Bay at the 1910 federal election. In 1913, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Commonwealth Liberal Party member for the new seat of Lilley and was re-elected in 1914. Stumm encountered substantial prejudice during World War I as a consequence of his German birth, and he spoke out publicly in 1917 about the \\"humiliating treatment\\" he had received. He subsequently retired from parliament at the 1917 election, having had to be talked out of resigning and causing a by-election earlier that year. Later life After his retirement he again returned to The Gympie Times, which he had continued to own throughout, though he had ceded the editorship to his brother, A. L. Stumm. Stumm died in 1921 in the Gympie Hospital after suffering a brain hemorrhage in The Gympie Times' office the previous day.

Her interest in Neuropsychology began at the Baltimore City hospitals of Johns Hopkins University, where her research unit focused on neurological patients with language or cognitive impairments. In papers published between 1976 and 1982, Dr. Saffran spelled out the methodological tenets of ‚Äúcognitive neuropsychology‚Äù exemplified in her studies of aphasia,http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/410865_print Aphasia and the Relationship of Language and Brain, by Eleanor M. Saffran alexia (acquired dyslexia), auditory verbal agnosia, and short-term memory impairment. Career In 1980, Saffran joined the Neurology Department of Temple University and established the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience. Here she built an interdisciplinary research group composed of neurologists, psychologists, and speech-language pathologists. Under her leadership, this group extended the cognitive neuropsychological approach to the analysis of neurological disorders of perception, visual attention, and semantics. These years also marked the continuation of her longstanding collaboration with Myrna Schwartz of MossRehab (part of the Einstein Healthcare Network) which began in Baltimore in 1975. An innovative aspect of their research was its emphasis on application of language theory to diagnosis and treatment of language disorders. This model was embraced by other researchers of language and remains a standard approach in aphasia research today. As the field of cognitive neuropsychology matured, Saffran became recognized as one of its most influential practitioners. In 1989, her grant on the psycholinguistic analysis of language disorders was awarded the Claude Pepper Award of Excellence by the National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders. In 1991, Saffran was appointed as professor in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders at Temple University. She continued teaching her courses even after progression of a degenerative condition had weakened her speaking voice and use of her hands. Her contributions to research were recognized posthumously when she was awarded the Temple University Faculty Research Award for excellence in research in 2003.http://www.temple.edu/temple_times_archives/2003/4-10-03/saffran.html Eleanor Saffran Receives Posthumous Research Award Legacy Longtime colleague Nadine Martin, associate professor of communication sciences and disorders at Temple University, started working with Saffran in 1982 and then completed her Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology at Temple University in 1987. Today she continues Saffran's tradition of scholarship and mentorship as Director of the Eleanor M. Saffran Center for Cognitive Neuroscience. Her daughter Jenny Saffran has also pursued a career in research in cognitive science. She leads the Infant Learning Laboratory at University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison.

The dialect in modern Tokyo is often considered to be Standard Japanese, but they differ in a number of areas and social classes. Yamanote (red) and Shitamachi (blue)  Overview  Traditional dialects in central Tokyo are generally classified in two groups: and . The Yamanote dialect is characteristic of the old upper class from the Yamanote area. Standard Japanese was based on the Yamanote dialect during the Meiji period. The Shitamachi dialect is a working-class dialect, and it preserves features of Edo Ch≈çnin (Edokko) speech (see Early Modern Japanese), so also called . Tokyo-style rakugo is typically played in the Shitamachi dialect. Yamanote dialect and Shitamachi dialect can be compared to the British RP and Cockney in English. Tokyo dialect dates back to Tokugawa Ieyasu's establishment of Edo. Large groups of people, speaking a range of dialects migrated across the country. The Kyoto dialect was the de facto standard of the time and strongly influenced the Edo dialect in the early Edo period; the dialect grew inside the largest city in Japan and became the new de facto Standard Japanese in the late Edo period. Because of its unique history, especially in relation to the Kyoto dialect, Tokyo is a language island in the Kant≈ç region. For example, traditional Kanto dialects have been characterized by the use of volitional and presumptive suffix -be, which is rarely used in Tokyo.  Phonology  The Shitamachi dialect is primarily known for its lack of distinction between some phonemes that are distinct in Standard Japanese. Most famously, it neutralizes and so shiohigari (\\"shellfish gathering\\") becomes shioshigari, and shichi (\\"seven\\") becomes hichi. Also, it famously fronts to so Shinjuku becomes Shinjiku, and shujutsu (\\"operation\\") becomes shijitsu. Another notable feature is the monophthongization of to in the Shitamachi dialect. For example, hidoi (\\"terrible\\") becomes shidee, and taihen da (\\"It's serious\\") becomes teehen da. That feature is used in Standard Japanese as informal masculine speech like wakan'nee (wakaranai \\"I don't know\\") and sugee (sugoi \\"great\\"). In addition, is pronounced as a trill to convey a vulgar nuance in Shitamachi speech. In informal speech, intervocalic is often changed to or sokuon so okaerinasai becomes okaen'nasai (\\"welcome back home\\") and s≈ç suru to becomes s≈ç sutto (\\"then, and so\\"). = Pitch accent = A few words are pronounced different pitch accent between Yamanote and Shitamachi. The following words are typical examples: * Band≈ç (another name of Kant≈ç region): accent on ba in Yamanote, Accentless in Shitamachi. * saka (\\"slope\\"): accent on ka in Yamanote, on sa in Shitamachi. * tsugi (\\"next\\"): accent on gi in Yamanote, on tsu in Shitamachi. * sushi: accent on shi in Yamanote, on su in Shitamachi. * suna (\\"sand\\"): accentless in Yamanote, accent on na in Shitamachi. * asahi (\\"morning sun\\"): accent on a in Yamanote, on sa in Shitamachi. * aniki (\\"big brother\\"): accent on a in Yamanote, on ni in Shitamachi. * itsumo (\\"always\\"): accent on i in Yamanote, on tsu in Shitamachi. * hanashi (\\"talk\\"): accentless in Yamanote, accent on na in Shitamachi. * tamago (\\"egg\\"): accent on ma in Yamanote, accentless in Shitamachi. * accentless word -sama (a honorific): accent on sa in Yamanote, accentless in Shitamachi.  Grammar  Most of the grammatical features of the Tokyo dialect are identical to the colloquial form of Standard Japanese like the examples mentioned here. Noticeable features of the Tokyo dialect include the frequent use of interjectory particle sa, which is roughly analogous to \\"like\\" as used in American English slang; ts≈´ (common style) and tee (Shitamachi style), instead of to iu (\\"to say\\" or \\"is called\\"); the frequent use of emphasis sentence-final particle dai or dee in Shitamachi, which is famous for a typical Shitamachi verbal shot teyandee! ([nani o] itte iyagaru n dai!, \\"What are you talking about!?\\"). Historically, Kanto dialects lacked keigo (honorific speech). However, because of its connection with Kyoto and the stratification of urban society, the Tokyo dialect now has a refined keigo system. The Yamanote dialect is primarily known for an extreme use of keigo and the keigo copula zamasu or zƒÅmasu, sometimes zansu, derived from gozaimasu. The feminine courtesy imperative mood asobase or asubase is also a well-known keigo word from the traditional Tokyo dialect. For example, \\"Won't you please wait for me?\\" translates to for o-machi kudasai in standard Japanese, and o-machi asobase in the traditional Tokyo dialect.  Vocabulary  Though it also includes a few distinctive words, it is largely indistinguishable from the standard speech of Tokyo except for phonology. Famous Shitamachi words are the swear word berab≈çme! or beranmee! (masculine Shitamachi speech is commonly known as Beranmee kuch≈ç or \\"Beranmee tone\\"), atab≈ç for atarimae \\"of course\\", mattsugu for massugu \\"straight\\" and choito for chotto \\"for a moment, a bit.\\" Atashi is a first-person feminine pronoun in Standard Japanese, but in Shitamachi dialect, it is often used by both men and women. An emphasis prefix o is used frequently with verbs such as oppajimeru for hajimeru \\"to start\\" and ottamageru for tamageru \\"to be startled.\\"  New Tokyo dialect  Traditional Tokyo dialects are now barely used as most families living in Tokyo speak Standard Japanese. The distinction between Shitamachi and Yamanote is now almost extinct. Historically, many people moved to Tokyo from other regions and sometimes brought their dialects into Tokyo with them. For example, jan („Åò„ÇÉ„Çì), which is a contraction of ja nai ka (\\"isn't that right?\\"), comes from the eastern Ch≈´bu and Kanagawa dialects, and chigakatta, a nonstandard form of chigatta (\\"it was different\\"), comes from the Fukushima and Tochigi dialects.

The experiment began operation in November 2009.CLOUD experiment provides unprecedented insight into cloud formation, CERN The primary goal is to understand the influence of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) on aerosols and clouds, and their implications for climate. Although its design is optimised to address the cosmic ray question, (as posed by Henrik Svensmark and colleagues in 1997) CLOUD allows as well to measure aerosol nucleation and growth under controlled laboratory conditions. Atmospheric aerosols and their effect on clouds are recognised by the IPCC as the main source of uncertainty in present radiative forcing and climate models, since an increase in cloud cover reduces global warming.  Setup  The core of the experiment is a stainless steel chamber of 26m¬≥ volume filled with synthetic air made from liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen. The chamber atmosphere and pressure is being measured and regulated by various instrumentations. The aerosol chamber can be exposed to an adjustable particle beam simulating GCRs at various altitude or latitude. UV illumination allows photolytic reaction. The chamber contains an electric field cage to control the drift of small ions and charged aerosols. The ionisation produced by cosmic rays can be removed with a strong electric field. Besides, humidity and temperature inside the chamber can be regulated, allowing for fast adiabatic expansion for artificial clouds (compare cloud chamber) or experiments on ice microphysics. According to Kirkby \\"the level of cleanliness and control in a laboratory experiment is at the limit of current technology, and CERN know-how has been crucial for CLOUD being the first experiment to achieve this performance.\\"  Results  CERN posted a 2009 progress report on the CLOUD project.2009 Progress report on PS215/CLOUD Kirkby, Jasper, The CLOUD Collaboration, CERN, Geneva, SPS and PS Experiments Committee, CERN- SPSC-2010-013, April 7, 2010 J. Kirkby (2009) reviews developments in the CERN CLOUD project and planned tests. He describes cloud nucleation mechanisms which appear energetically favourable and depend on GCRs.Cosmic Rays and Climate Video Jasper Kirkby, CERN Colloquium, 4 June 2009Cosmic Rays and Climate Presentation Jasper Kirkby, CERN Colloquium, 4 June 2009 On 24 August 2011, preliminary research published in the journal Nature showed there was a connection between Cosmic Rays and aerosol nucleation. Kirkby went on to say in the definitive CERN press Release \\"Ion-enhancement is particularly pronounced in the cool temperatures of the mid-troposphere and above, where CLOUD has found that sulphuric acid and water vapour can nucleate without the need for additional vapours. The first CLOUD experiments showed that sulphuric acid (derived from sulphur dioxide, for which fossil fuels are the predominant source) as such has a much smaller effect than had been assumed. In 2014, CLOUD researchers presented newer experimental results showing an interaction between oxidised biogenic vapours (e.g., alpha-pinene emitted by trees) and sulphuric acid. Ions produced in the atmosphere by galactic cosmic rays enhance the formation rate of these particles significantly, provided the concentrations of sulphuric acid and oxidised organic vapours are quite low. This new process may account for seasonal variations in atmospheric aerosol particles, which are being related to higher global tree emissions in the northern hemisphere summer. Besides biogenic vapours produced by plants, another class of trace vapours, amines have been shown by CLOUD to cluster with sulphuric acid to produce new aerosol particles in the atmosphere. These are found close to their primary sources, e.g. animal husbandry, while alpha- pinene is generally found over landmasses. The experiments show that sulfuric acid and oxidized organic vapors at low concentrations reproduce suitable particle nucleation rates. The nucleation mechanism used on global aerosol models yields a photochemically and biologically driven seasonal cycle of particle concentrations and cloud formation in good agreement with observations. CLOUD insofar allows to explain a large fraction of cloud seeds in the lower atmosphere involving sulphuric acid and biogenic aerosols. CLOUD researchers note that cosmic rays have little influence on the formation of sulphuric acid‚Äìamine particle formation: \\"The ion-induced contribution is generally small, reflecting the high stability of sulphuric acid‚Äìdimethylamine clusters and indicating that galactic cosmic rays exert only a small influence on their formation, except at low overall formation rates.\\"Almeida et al. (2013) Molecular understanding of sulphuric acid‚Äìamine particle nucleation in the atmosphere. Nature, 502:359-363. At http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038/nature12663 This result does not support the hypothesis that cosmic rays significantly affect climate, although a CERN press release states that neither does it \\"rule out a role for cosmic radiation\\" in climate. Dunne et al. (2016) have presented the main outcomes of 10 years of results obtained at the CLOUD experiment performed at CERN. They have studied in detail the physico-chemical mechanisms and the kinetics of aerosols formation. The nucleation process of water droplets/ice micro- crystals from water vapor reproduced in the CLOUD experiment and also directly observed in the Earth atmosphere do not only involve ions formation due to cosmic rays but also a range of complex chemical reactions with sulfuric acid, ammonia and organic compounds emitted in the air by human activities and by organisms living on land or in the oceans (plankton). Although they observe that a fraction of cloud nuclei is effectively produced by ionisation due to the interaction of cosmic rays with the constituents of Earth atmosphere, this process is insufficient to attribute all of the present climate modifications to the fluctuations of the cosmic rays intensity modulated by changes in the solar activity and Earth magnetosphere.

It is a white powder with a melting point of . Mixed phase materials in the Li4SiO4 Li2TiO3 system Journal of Nucl Materials Lithium titanate is the anode component of the fast recharging lithium-titanate battery. It is also used as an additive in porcelain enamels and ceramic insulating bodies based on titanates. It is frequently utilized as a flux due to its good stability. In recent years, along with other lithium ceramics, metatitanate pebbles have been the subject of research efforts towards tritium breeding materials in nuclear fusion applications. Crystallization The most stable lithium titanate phase is Œ≤-Li2TiO3 that belongs to the monoclinic system. A high- temperature cubic phase exhibiting solid-solution type behavior is referred to as Œ≥-Li2TiO3 and is known to form reversibly above temperatures in the range 1150-1250 ¬∞C. A metastable cubic phase, isostructural with Œ≥-Li2TiO3 is referred to as Œ±-Li2TiO3; it is formed at low temperatures, and transforms to the more stable Œ≤-phase at 400 ¬∞C. Uses in sintering The sintering process is taking a powder, putting it into a mold and heating it to below its melting point. Sintering is based on atomic diffusion, the atoms in the powder particle diffuse into surrounding particles eventually forming a solid or porous material. It has been discovered that Li2TiO3 powders have a high purity and good sintering ability.Sahu, B. S; Bhatacharyya, S.; Chaudhuri, P.; Mazumder, R. (2010) \\"Synthesis and sintering of nanosize Li2TiO3 ceramic breeder powder prepared by autocombustion technique\\". Department of Ceramic Engineering; National Institute of Technology, Rourkela. Uses as a cathode=Molten carbonate fuel cells= Lithium titanate is used as a cathode in layer one of a double layer cathode for molten carbonate fuel cells. These fuel cells have two material layers, layer 1 and layer 2, which allow for the production of high power molten carbonate fuel cells that work more efficiently.Prohaska, Armin et al. (1997) \\"Double layer cathode for molten carbonate fuel cells and method for producing the same\\" =Lithium-ion batteries= Li2TiO3 is used in the cathode of some lithium-ion batteries, along with an aqueous binder and a conducting agent. Li2TiO3 is used because it is capable of stabilizing the high capacity cathode conducting agents; LiMO2 (M=Fe, Mn, Cr, Ni). Li2TiO3 and the conduction agents (LiMO2) are layered in order to create the cathode material. These layers allow for the occurrence of lithium diffusion. Lithium-titanate battery The lithium- titanate battery is a rechargeable battery that is much faster to charge than other lithium-ion batteries. It differs from other lithium-ion batteries because it uses lithium-titanate on the anode surface rather than carbon. This is advantageous because it does not create a solid electrolyte interface layer, which acts as a barrier to the ingress and egress of Li-ion to and from the anode. This allows lithium-titanate batteries to be recharged more quickly and provide higher currents when necessary. A disadvantage of the lithium- titanate battery is a much lower capacity and voltage than the conventional lithium-ion battery. The lithium-titanate battery is currently being used in battery electric vehicles and other specialist applications. Synthesis of lithium-titanate breeder powder Li2TiO3 powder is most commonly prepared by the mixing of lithium carbonate, Ti-nitrate solution, and citric acid followed by calcination, compaction, and sintering. The nanocrystalline material created is used as a breeder powder due to its high purity and activity. Tritium breeding Fusion reactions, such as those in the proposed ITER thermonuclear demonstrator reactor, are fueled by tritium and deuterium. Tritium resources are extremely limited in their availability, with total resources currently estimated at twenty kilograms. Lithium-containing ceramic pebbles can be used as solid breeder materials in a component known as a helium-cooled breeder blanket for the production of tritium. The breeding blanket constitutes a key component of the ITER reactor design. In such reactor designs tritium is produced by neutrons leaving the plasma and interacting with lithium in the blanket. Li2TiO3 along with Li4SiO4 are attractive as tritium breeding materials because they exhibit high tritium release, low activation, and chemical stability.

It was originally designed as a generic sport safety helmet by CIG (Commonwealth Industrial Gases, now BOC) and then developed by Rosebank. Due to government regulations and promotion by various State governments, the sturdy bright orange Stackhat had a near monopoly on bicycle helmets in the country for teenagers and children. Its distinctive design, initial release in a bright orange colour, ubiquitous ownership in the 1980s, and fast disappearance in the 1990s, have combined to make it a defining symbol of the 1980s for Australians. While the variety of helmet colours expanded throughout the years, the design did not. Background Australia was the first country to introduce national standards for bicycle helmet safety.http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=69132 The Stackhat was one of the first helmets to meet that proposed standard and was promoted heavily by State governments. An imaginative and colourful television campaign featuring Molly Meldrum riding through an early computer-generated model of the Sydney Harbour Bridge also cemented the helmet in popular imagination. The helmet was designed by PA Technology, Clayton (now Invetech), which was recognised with an Australian Design Award in 1986.http://ianwongresearch.blogspot.com.au/2011/07/stackhat- classic.html/https://collection.maas.museum/object/59601 Appearance The sturdy Stackhat was designed to emphasise safety over aerodynamics. Its appearance was more like something a crash test dummy would wear than an elite cyclist. This aesthetic was a selling point for the various governments promoting the device to safety-conscious parents. The Stackhat is designed to protect the skull and temple and is light, comfortable, colourful and streamlined. The 'hi-tech' graphics are designed to appeal to the youth market. Made from impact-modified and shock absorbent expanded polystyrene it is designed for use in sporting and leisure activities including cycling, cricket, equestrian and skiing. The Stackhat is significant as it was one of the first helmets designed in Australia to comply with the Australian Standard 2063. The helmet was initially only available in orange but after several years other colours, including black, white and pink became available. Naming The Stackhat derives its name from the verb \\"to stack\\", which means \\"to crash\\".

Founded in 1898 and formally incorporated in 1905 as an Orthodox synagogue, it hired its first rabbi in 1916, and joined the Conservative movement in 1931. The congregation moved to its most recent building in 1967, and soon afterwards membership peaked at over 180 families, but by 2008 had been reduced to 50. From 2005 to 2007 the synagogue was repeatedly targeted by vandals; after some of these incidents a federal investigation was started and two people were arrested, convicted, and sentenced. Samuel Porrath served as rabbi from 1931 to 1934, and, though employed elsewhere, would subsequently often serve as interim rabbi; he was appointed \\"rabbi emeritus\\" in 1968. Melvin Kieffer was the congregation's longest serving rabbi, from 1947 to 1957. Haim Cassorla, Beth Israel's last rabbi, served from 1988 to 1995. In the 2000s, its president was Dr. Lawrence Wolfgang. In May 2011 the congregation stated it would disband by the end of the year. Early history Founded in Niagara Falls in 1898,Adamczyk, Ed. \\"As temple closes, a tradition continues\\", Niagara Gazette, May 10, 2011.Gellman, Jack A. Temple Beth Israel Dedication 1968, p. 10. Temple Beth Israel formally incorporated in 1905, when it was granted a charter by the State of New York, and purchased land for $1,600 ($ today) on Cedar Avenue. Construction of a building did not start until 1911, when the cornerstone was laid. At the time the congregation had 33 members.Gellman, Jack A.Temple Beth Israel Dedication 1968, p. 11. The building was completed in 1912 at a cost of approximately $12,000 ($ today) of which half was borrowed as a mortgage. Jacob Schiff, the New York City philanthropist, donated $250 towards the costs. Annual dues averaged around $17 ($ today).Gellman, Jack A. Temple Beth Israel Dedication 1968, p. 12. In its early years Beth Israel could not afford a rabbi, Sunday School, or Hebrew school; High Holiday services were run by guest rabbis, and the rabbi of Niagara Falls' Temple Beth El would help out. In 1915 Beth Israel started providing Hebrew school classes,Gellman, Jack A. Temple Beth Israel Dedication 1968, p. 14. and in 1916 hired its first full-time rabbi, Moses Abramson, who served until 1918. Subsequent rabbis were Abraham Helfman (1919‚Äì1922), Israel Holtzman (1923‚Äì1924), and Alter Abelson (1925‚Äì1926).Gellman, Jack A. Temple Beth Israel 100th Birthday Celebration 1898‚Äì1998 , p. 31. During Abelson's final year at Beth Israel the congregation opened a permanently organized Sunday School; prior to that classes had not been \\"on a steady or permanently organized basis\\". Abelson was followed by Jacob Landy (1927‚Äì1928) and Isser Muskat (1928‚Äì1930). 1930s, 40s, and 50s Though the synagogue had always called itself Orthodox, it also had liberal leanings, and in 1931 it affiliated itself with the United Synagogue of America (now United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism).Gellman, Jack A. Temple Beth Israel Dedication 1968, p. 15. That year Beth Israel hired Samuel I. Porrath as rabbi, a position he would hold until 1935. Porrath subsequently moved away from Niagara Falls, but would eventually return. Though employed elsewhere (including Temple Beth El in Buffalo, New York, and Niagara University, where he chaired the Institute of Transportation, Travel and Tourism), he would often serve as Beth Israel's interim rabbi when the congregation was between permanent rabbis. A founder of Niagara County Community College, Porrath was appointed Beth Israel's \\"Rabbi Emeritus\\" in 1968, and died in 1989.\\"Rabbi Samuel Porrath Dies; Prominent Leader\\", The Buffalo News, May 14, 1989. After Porrath, Beth Israel went through another series of short-tenured rabbis: Jacob Friedman (1936‚Äì1937), Herman Glatt (1938‚Äì1940), and Mordecai Waxman (1941‚Äì1942).Goldman, Ari L. \\" Mordecai Waxman, Rabbi Who Chided Pope, Dies at 85\\", The New York Times, August 15, 2002. Waxman would subsequently serve as an Army chaplain in World War II, go on to become a prominent rabbi in the Conservative movement, and serve as rabbi of Temple Israel of Great Neck, New York from 1947 to his death in 2002.Fischler, Marcelle S. \\" LONG ISLAND JOURNAL; Celebrating a Rabbi's 55 Years of Service\\", July 7, 2002. Waxman was followed by Simon Shoop (1942‚Äì1943), Philip Miller (1943‚Äì1944), and Jay Kaufman (1945‚Äì1946). The congregation began work on an addition to the synagogue in 1947, which it completed in 1948. The total cost was $30,000, of which $20,000 was raised, and $10,000 borrowed.Gellman, Jack A. Temple Beth Israel Dedication 1968, p. 16. In 1947 Beth Israel also hired Melvin Kieffer; he served until 1957, the synagogue's longest serving rabbi, and during his tenure, in 1955, Beth Israel's mortgage was finally paid off.Gellman, Jack A. Temple Beth Israel 100th Birthday Celebration 1898‚Äì1998 , p. 37. Kieffer was followed by Seymour Schorr, who was hired in 1958. New building By 1965 the congregation had approximately 175 families, and had outgrown its building on Cedar Avenue, which had inadequate facilities, and too few (and unsafe) classrooms.Gellman, Jack A. Temple Beth Israel Dedication 1968, p. 20. In 1961 Beth Israel had acquired from the New York Power Authority of land at College Avenue and Madison Avenue, valued at approximately $100,000, in exchange for of land the Authority needed in Beth Israel's cemetery. Funds were raised for a new building,Gellman, Jack A. Temple Beth Israel Dedication 1968, p. 21. and in 1966 construction began on facilities on College Avenue. The work was completed in time for High Holiday services to be held there in 1967.Gellman, Jack A. Temple Beth Israel Dedication 1968, p. 23.Our Building , Synagogue website. Accessed October 26, 2008. That year Schorr asked to be released from his contract, and was replaced by Morris A. Cohen for 6 months, and then Samuel Porrath, who came out of retirement to assist. In 1968 Yosel I. Dick was hired as rabbi; he would serve until 1971. Membership peaked at over 180 families soon after the move to the new building.Gellman, Jack A.

Decline During the 1970s Niagara Falls had entered a long economic downturn: plants run by major employers closed, and the city's population dropped by over 40 percent. Jewish employees were laid off when the plants closed, and many Jewish businesses moved or went out of business. Jewish families left the area, and synagogue membership declined. During this period Israel Zimmerman was rabbi from 1972‚Äì1975, and Lawrence Pinsker, a graduate of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College,Meet our Clergy Team, About Us, Shaarey Zedek Synagogue website. Accessed August 15, 2008. from 1976 to 1980. Jerome Kestenbaum joined as rabbi in 1981, and, feeling that the mortgage was a drain on the congregation, in 1982 he and synagogue president Samuel Wineburgh asked Jack A. Gellman to head a campaign to retire it. The original mortgage for the new building had been $350,000, and by 1982 the balance remaining was $42,000. The campaign was a success, and a mortgage burning dinner was held in October of that year. Kestenbaum was replaced by Bruce Adler in 1983; Adler had just been ordained at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College.\\"Rabbi Bruce Adler\\" , Congregation B'nai Tikvah / The Jewish Reconstructionist Centrer of Southwestern Ohio website. Retrieved December 23, 2011. He served for a year, moving to Beth Israel Synagogue of Hamilton, Ohio. In 1985 Kestenbaum returned, serving until 1986, when he was replaced by David Harary. Haim Cassorla replaced Harary in 1988; when he left, in 1995, the congregation could not afford to hire a replacement. Dr. Laurence Boxer acted in place of a rabbi, without remuneration, conducting all services and grave-side rituals.Gellman, Jack A. Temple Beth Israel 100th Birthday Celebration 1898‚Äì1998 , p. 30. By 1998 Beth Israel's membership had dropped to 65 families, and by 2008 membership was 50 families.Gee, Denise Jewell. \\"Temple to honor supporters after vandalism\\", The Buffalo News, May 11, 2008. In the 2000s, Beth Israel's president was Dr. Lawrence Wolfgang. From 1978 on the temple held an annual fundraising dinner which, by 2011, typically raised $10,000. In May of that year the congregation stated it would donate all proceeds of the 2011 fundraising dinner to the Catholic Mount Saint Mary's Hospital in Lewiston, and disband by the end of the year. The members bestowed the annual fundraising event on the hospital's foundation.

However, a more sustained set of attacks started in 2005 and escalated in the summer and fall of 2006. Incidents occurred on a near-daily basis, and included urinating on the synagogue's doors and carving swastikas into them: a \\"skateboard club\\" named \\"DNA\\" had apparently claimed the Temple's property as its own \\"turf\\", and refused to leave. A federal investigation involving a Joint Terrorism Task Force agent and local police was begun when the message \\"Kill the Jews\\" was duct-taped to the building's door on January 12, 2007. The investigation was hampered because witnesses were afraid to speak, in fear of retaliation.Pfeiffer, Rick. \\"NIAGARA FALLS: Arrests made in temple vandalism case\\", The Journal-Register (Niagara Gazette), February 14, 2007.\\"ADL Welcomes Arrest In Niagara Falls Synagogue Attacks\\" , Anti-Defamation League, February 16, 2007. In February 2007 two people, one a juvenile, were arrested and charged in connection with the incidents. The suspects initially pleaded not guilty,Fischer, Nancy A. \\"2 Falls teens deny vandalizing synagogue: Repeated incidents at Temple Beth Israel lead to arrests; third suspect faces charges.\\", The Buffalo News, April 3, 2007. but in early June were offered a plea bargain,Prohaska, Thomas J. \\"2 offered a deal in synagogue vandalism\\", The Buffalo News, June 2, 2007. and later that month Shawn M.

Founded in 1903 or 1904, though tracing its roots back to 1857, it is the oldest Orthodox congregation in the New Orleans region. Originally located on Carondelet Street in New Orleans' Central City, it constructed and moved to a building at 7000 Canal Boulevard in Lakeview, New Orleans, in 1971. At one time the largest Orthodox congregation in the Southern United States, its membership was over 500 families in the 1960s, but fell to under 200 by 2005. That year its Canal Boulevard building was severely flooded by the 2005 New Orleans levee failure disaster during Hurricane Katrina. Despite attempts to save them, all seven of its Torah scrolls were destroyed, as were over 3,000 prayer books. The building suffered further flooding damage caused by the theft of copper air-conditioning tubing in 2007. In the wake of Katrina another 50 member families left New Orleans, including the rabbis. The congregation began sharing space with Gates of Prayer, a Reform synagogue in Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans. In 2009, the congregation purchased land from Gates of Prayer, and by 2012 had built a new synagogue next to it at 4000 West Esplanade Avenue. the rabbi was Gabriel Greenberg.Our New Rabbinic Family, Synagogue website. Early history Beth Israel is the oldest Orthodox congregation in the New Orleans region,Greenberg (2007). and its most prominent.Nolan (September 13, 2007). Though it was founded as early as 1903, it traces its roots back to much older synagogues. In the mid-19th century New Orleans had a number of small Orthodox congregations of Eastern European Jews, generally \\"structured along nationalistic lines\\". These included a synagogue of Galitzianer Jews (Chevra Thilim), and two of Lithuanian Jews, (one‚ÄîChevra Mikve Israel‚Äîfollowing the non-Hassidic liturgy, the other‚ÄîAnshe Sfard‚Äîfollowing the Hassidic liturgy). In 1857, a congregation consisting primarily of Prussian Jews from Posen organized as Tememe Derech, \\"The Right Way\\". As they followed the Polish rite, they were known as \\"The Polish Congregation\\".Lachoff & Kahn (2005), p. 8.Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2010). Tememe Derech built a synagogue in the 500 block of Carondelet Street in the Central City section of New Orleans in 1867. It was the sole Orthodox congregation to construct its own building; only a minority of New Orleans' Jews were Orthodox, and other congregations rented space or met in members' homes. Tememe Derech's membership, however, never exceeded 50,Lachoff & Kahn (2005), p. 24. and in 1903 or 1904 the synagogue disbanded, and merged with a number of other small Orthodox congregations and a burial society to form Beth Israel. Services were initially held in rented quarters in the same 500 block of Carondelet Street. Beth Israel synagogue building on Carondelet St. In 1905, Beth Israel purchased the home of New Orleans' former mayor Joseph A. Shakspeare at 1610 Carondelet Street. Funds for the new acquisition came from both the Orthodox and Reform communities of New Orleans. After remodeling the building, the congregation began holding services there, in time for the 1906 High Holy Days.Lachoff & Kahn (2005), p. 64.American Jewish Year Book, Vol. 21, p. 379. Membership grew quickly; by 1910 Beth Israel was the second- largest Jewish congregation in the city,Lachoff & Kahn (2005), p. 65. with 180 member families, and by 1914 that number had grown to 250 families. By 1918, however, membership had fallen to 175 families. That year the synagogue's income was $6,000 (today $). Moses Hyman Goldberg was the congregation's first rabbi, but within a year he moved to Chevra Thilim. Goldberg served as New Orleans' mohel until his death in 1940.Lachoff & Kahn (2005), p. 97 1920s to early 2000s Beth Israel rebuilt its synagogue at the Carondelet Street location in 1924. The new building was designed by Emil Weil, a noted Southern architect, particularly of Jewish religious buildings. He designed other New Orleans' synagogues, including the Touro Synagogue and the Anshe Sfard, as well as other non-religious buildings throughout Louisiana.Lachoff & Kahn (2005), p. 82. Beth Israel's new Byzantine Revival building, with its seating capacity of 1,200, reflected \\"the growing economic and social confidence of the membership\\": it had \\"beautiful\\" stained-glass windows, a \\"magnificent\\" imported European chandelier, and \\"hand-carved Stars of David in the ceiling\\".Lachoff & Kahn (2005), p. 67. The building was dedicated on September 12, and a Boston rabbi, Henry Raphael Gold, was a guest speaker. He was so impressed that he stayed on, becoming Beth Israel's rabbi. Menorah Institute building on Euterpe St. In 1926 Beth Israel built the \\"Menorah Institute\\" Talmud Torah building on Euterpe Street, adjoining the Carondelet synagogue. The school, which served as an Orthodox alternative to the existing Communal Hebrew School, comprised a nursery school, a Hebrew school, and a Sunday school. The building also housed Beth Israel's offices, and the \\"Little Shul\\" (\\"shul\\" is the Yiddish word for synagogue), where services were held twice a day.New Orleans City Guide (1938/2009), p. 384. The congregation leased land for burials in the Chevra Thilim Cemetery on Canal Street, a site that had been used by Tememe Derech as early as 1860, and which was shared with several other congregations. In the 1930s Beth Israel purchased its own cemetery on Frenchmen Street.Lachoff & Kahn (2005), p. 55. Uri Miller joined Beth Israel as rabbi in 1935, a post he would hold through the early 1940s.Feibelman (1941), p. 93.Landman (1942), p. 172. He was president of the Hebrew Theological College Alumni from 1936 to 1938, and of its successor the Rabbinical Council of America from 1946 to 1948.Sherman (1996), p. 257. During Miller's tenure the synagogue's neighborhood began to deteriorate. Members started moving uptown, and the congregation embarked on a search for a new location.Lachoff & Kahn (2005), p. 124. In 1963 Beth Israel purchased a block of land at 7000 Canal Boulevard at Walker Street in the Lakeview neighborhood. It moved into its new larger building there in 1971. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke's successful 1989 run for a Louisiana House of Representatives seat in nearby Metairie was a cause for concern in the congregation. Then-rabbi Gavriel Newman spoke out against Duke, feeling that people were being \\"taken in\\" by \\"the modern guise of Klan members of Duke's ilk is the two-piece suit, the blow-dried hair and the sweet smile, which seem to serve them very well to hide the inherent racism and the propensity to violence.\\"Maraniss (1989).Tulsa World, February 13, 1989. During the campaign an anti-Duke rally was planned to be held at Beth Israel by Mordechai Levy of the Jewish Defense Organization (JDO). It was, however, cancelled by Beth Israel, after strong objections by members of Beth Israel and the larger Jewish community, in part because it was felt that the JDO's actions would actually create more support for Duke, and in part because of Levy's statements that the JDO would not rule out violence in its efforts against Duke.Franco (1989).Tulsa World, January 27, 1989. From 1914 through World War II Beth Israel described itself the \\"largest Orthodox congregation in the South\\", and in the 1960s it had 500 member families. By 2005, however, that number had been reduced to fewer than 200. Nevertheless, Beth Israel still held services twice a day, the only synagogue in New Orleans to do so. Hurricane Katrina and aftermath Interior of the Beth Israel Congregation sanctuary after dewatering As a result of Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans, the congregation's building at 7000 Canal Boulevard filled with at least ten feet of water, and Beth Israel garnered national attention after attempts were made to save its Torah scrolls. Beth Israel's rabbi, Yisroel Shiff, who had evacuated to Tennessee before Katrina hit, contacted Rabbi Isaac Leider, who had worked on ZAKA search-and-rescue teams in Israel for five years. After contacting federal officials and the Louisiana National Guard, Leider hired a helicopter to fly him to within a mile of Beth Israel, met with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) search-and-rescue team appointed to retrieve the scrolls. The group used rubber rafts to reach Beth Israel and enter it, where Leider waded into the sanctuary and rescued the Torah scrolls and their silver ornaments.Moore (2005). Despite Leider's efforts, all seven Torah scrolls were unsalvageable, and had to be buried. They had initially been buried in her backyard by Rebecca Heggelund, Beth Israel's non-Jewish secretary, who first received them after their rescue, and were subsequently re-buried next to the grave of Beth Israel's gabbai Meyer Lachoff.Orthodox Union Department of Public Relations (March 21, 2006). Lachoff had died just after Katrina,Lipman (2005). but could not be buried in New Orleans until months later. Hayley Fields leading new Torah dedication ceremony at Beth Israel Congregation on August 27, 2006 In addition to losing all of its Torah scrolls, Beth Israel lost all its furniture, and over 3,000 siddurs and mahzors, and almost all of its members' homes were flooded, forcing them to move.Okun (2006). The congregation did, however, receive assistance in replacing some of its assets; the Orthodox Union immediately sent Beth Israel 50 ArtScroll siddurs, and Brith Shalom Beth Israel Congregation of Charleston, South Carolina, and Congregation Shaare Zedek Sons of Abraham of Providence, Rhode Island each donated Torahs. Hayley Fields, a 14-year-old from Los Angeles, heard of Beth Israel's difficult circumstances, and with the support of her mother, spearheaded a fund-raising drive, selling 3,500 watches. $18,000 was ultimately raised to buy a Torah, which was dedicated in August, 2006, two days before the first anniversary of the hurricane.Simmons (2006). At that ceremony the National Council of Young Israel also donated 150 new Artscoll mahzors, in time for the High Holy Days. In the wake of Katrina 50 families that were members of Beth Israel left New Orleans, and gave up membership in the congregation. These included Rabbi Schiff and his family. After the flood Beth Israel's board of directors informed Schiff, who had joined they synagogue in April 2002, that it would not be able to meet its contractual obligations and pay him past December. Schiff and his family had also lost their home and much of their possessions, and had been living in Memphis. Schiff resigned effective November 1, 2005, citing this loss, and the lack of a functioning Jewish Day School in the area for his children.Smason (2006).Deep South Jewish Voice (October 26, 2005). Soon after the flood, Beth Israel received an offer to temporarily use space from Congregation Gates of Prayer, a Reform synagogue in Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans. The congregation began holding weekly services and renting office space there.Naron Chalew (2009). In 2006 it was unclear if Beth Israel, which had already been in difficult financial shape, would be allowed, or have the means, to re-build its synagogue.Luxner (2006). The building suffered further flood damage in July 2007 when thieves stole the copper tubing for the main air-conditioning system. They broke the water main, and water from the second floor flooded the building for three days, to a depth of three to four feet, before it was discovered. The property was put up for sale.Smason (2007). Recent events In 2007, the congregation began some joint programming with Anshe Sefard,Nolan (March 25, 2007). New Orleans' only other remaining Orthodox synagogue, and in the summer hired Uri Topolosky as its new rabbi.Fausset (2007). A graduate of Yeshivat Chovevei Torah,Lipman (2007). Topolosky had previously served as the associate rabbi of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale,Naron Chalew (2007). and had been one of 21 rabbis arrested at the United Nations during an April 2007 sit-in demanding that Iran be expelled from the U.N.Traiman (2007). The sealed front doors of the Canal Boulevard building in 2010 To help attract new members, in the summer Topolosky started a recruitment campaign, placing an advertisement in the New York newspaper The Jewish Week, and re-designing Beth Israel's website. The campaign's tagline was \\"If you believe in the ability to destroy, you can believe in the ability to rebuild,\\" a saying of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, and by the end of October ten new members had joined.Pfeffer (2007). However, while all New Orleans synagogues lost membership after Katrina, as of 2007, Beth Israel was the only New Orleans synagogue that had not re-opened in its former location. Beth Israel started \\"The Minyan Project\\" in 2008, an effort to attract 10 (see minyan) new Orthodox families to New Orleans. The families were given \\"generous financial assistance\\", and in return had to \\"commit to providing community service, from maintaining the eruv enclosure that's due to be completed within the month to assisting in kosher supervision at a local supermarket.\\" According to Topolosky, with the move of four new families to the area, New Orleans likely had proportionately the fastest growing Modern Orthodox community in the United States.Naron Chalew (2008). In April of that year the Orthodox Union gave the congregation $235,000 towards a new building. At the time, Beth Israel had 80 member families, and 80 \\"associate member\\" families (families who belonged to other synagogues as well).Orthodox Union News (May 28, 2008). By 2009, the congregation had decided to erect a new synagogue on land it had purchased from Gates of Prayer, part of the lot on which the Gates of Prayer synagogue stood.The Temple Observer, Fall 2009, p. 4. For the 2009 High Holy Days, Topolosky planned to launch a capital campaign to raise $1 million towards the construction of the building.Sosnick (2009). The new building at 4004 West Esplanade Avenue was completed and occupied in August 2012. The old building, which still stood vacant, had been purchased by a surgeon for use as medical offices. All that was saved from it and brought to the new building were a bimah (originally from the building on Carondelet Street), a ner tamid, two menorahs, a hanukiah, and \\"a stained-glass window and a wooden plaque honoring pioneer donor families from Carondelet Street\\".Nolan (2012). The hanukiah had previously been featured and lit at the 2010 White House Hanukkah Party.Nolan (2010). Topolosky and his family left Beth Israel the following year, citing \\"the deteriorating Jewish educational landscape in New Orleans\\". New Orleans' only Jewish school, which had been established in 1996, closed for a year after Hurricane Katrina, and was never able to regain its peak enrollment of over 80 students. Although by then New Orleans' Jewish population exceeded its pre-Katrina size, demographic changes negatively affected the school's population. The same demographic changes affected Beth Israel; its Saturday morning service only attracted around 40 worshipers, its Friday night service only 25, and it had no daily minyan.Heilman (2013) In 2012 the school's board opened its doors to more non- Jewish students and changed the name from New Orleans Jewish Day School to Community Day School, but enrollment continued to fall to 29 students, half non-Jewish, by 2013. In 2013 Beth Israel hired Gabriel Greenberg to succeed Topolosky as rabbi, though he could not join the synagogue until the following year. A native of New England, he, like Topolosky, received his rabbinic ordination at Yeshivat Chovevei Torah. , Greenberg was Beth Israel's rabbi. Soon, changes overtook New Orleans. The Day School rediscovered its identity, for example. With a recommitment to its Jewish mission, the renamed-once-more Jewish Community Day School saw renewed interest from Jewish families under the leadership of Head of School Sharon Pollin. When Dr. Pollin left in 2019, enrollment had reached 66 students, and with the expansion of JCDS's Green Preschool, the school reached an enrollment of 76 students in the spring of 2020 under new head and New Orleans native Dr. Brad Philipson. The school is now over 75% Jewish and is expected to exceed pre-Katrina enrollment in the fall of 2020. Much of this success is owed to the active involvement of the Beth Israel rabbis. A loyal friend to the Day School and beloved at Beth Israel, Rabbi Gabe left New Orleans in 2019. He was replaced, however, by the newly ordained Rabbi Josh Pernick. A thoughtful scholar with an ability to connect to young and old, Rabbi Josh has been immediately successful at Beth Israel, and he does so with the support of the jack-of-all-trades synagogue administrator, Rabbi David Posternock. Both Rabbis are active in the Day School and play a pivotal role in the vibrant Jewish life along the West Esplanade Avenue corridor in Metairie. NotesReferences *Beth Israel website.

Conceived by Alexander Lippisch, it was developed and built by Dornier on behalf of the Federal German Ministry of Defense. Lippisch was part of the team. The first flight took place on 18 September 1972. The development ended on 30 November 1972 after successful hovering-flight testing with the aircraft. Experimentation did not continue due to lack of interest in the Bundeswehr (German Armed Forces), and/or the desire to undertake plans for manned helicopters. Description The principle behind the Aerodyne is the combination of lift and thrust production in a single construction unit and flow channel, i.e. a ducted fan. Flaps at the end of the fan divert the outflowing air to produce lift, thrust, or a combination of both. As a result, the Aerodyne could be steered and flown in the entire range between hovering and full-forward flight. For forward flight, the Aerodyne had a conventional tail unit at the rear, which allowed for pitch and yaw control. The equipment was unmanned and operated by remote control. It was intended to be a land- or ship-supported drone (UAV) for aerial reconnaissance.

The film won 1937 Kinema Junpo Award for the best film (director Kenji Mizoguchi)Awards for Gion no ky≈çdai https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027672/awards accessed 7 June 2009 and an award in Vienna in 1998.  Plot  The story centers around two sisters (Umekichi and Omocha), who are geisha, living in a lodging house (okiya) of their own in the licensed pleasure district of Gion, Kyoto. The two women have very different outlooks on relationships with men. Umekichi, the elder sister, is the ideal geisha; she grew up going to dance and music lessons, wears kimono, and has a strong sense of giri, or loyalty, to her patron. Umekichi‚Äôs younger sister, Omocha, was educated in public schools and wears western clothing, except when she is working as a geisha. Unlike Umekichi, Omocha doesn‚Äôt trust men and believes that they will only use geisha and then abandon them without a care. Thus, she uses men to her own advantage. In doing so she is willing to manipulate and lie to her customers. Umekichi‚Äôs patron is a newly bankrupt businessman named Shimbei Furusawa, who Umekichi takes care of after he loses his house and business. Omocha does not believe that her sister should support Shimbei, that doing so will prevent her from providing for herself by finding a new patron, and that she owes him nothing as, in her view, he has received more than he has given in the past. Omocha finds her sister a new patron and, one day when Umekichi is out, gives Shimbei some money to return to his wife in the country and tells him that her sister no longer wants him around. He takes the money but, rather than leaving, spends it drinking and takes up residence with his former clerk. Omocha also attempts to find a patron for herself and appears to be successful in gaining the attention of the owner of a kimono/cloth shop. However, in the process of helping her sister, Omocha has previously taken advantage of the owner‚Äôs clerk, who has stolen from the shop to provide a kimono for Umekichi and been found out. Umekichi throws over her new patron when she learns from the kimono shop clerk of Omocha's deception of Shimbei, and returns to him. The clerk is discovered at Omocha's okiya by the shop owner and dismissed. He seeks his revenge on his former employer by informing his wife of her husband's infidelity, and then exacts his revenge on Omocha by abducting her in a car and injuring her grievously by throwing her from it. Omocha and Umekichi have conflicting outlooks on men and the role of geisha, but ultimately they are both defeated at the end of the film. Umekichi is abandoned by her bankrupt patron Shimbei when he is given the chance to manage a factory in the country where his wife has retired, and she ends up caring for Omocha after her hospitalization for her injuries. Omocha curses the very existence of the geisha system and the sexual subjugation involved.

He was the son of Charles Carnan Ridgely who served as Governor of the state of Maryland from 1815 to 1818.A Hampton Chronology Hampton National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service July 2006) Her husband was the grandson of John Carnan and Achsah (n√©e Ridgely) Carnan. John's great-uncle and Achsah's brother, Charles Ridgely III (d. 1790), was the builder of the Hampton plantation which was built in 1790 and had been the largest private residence in the United States.Experience architectural greatness at Md.'s Hampton Mansion at usatoday.com, accessed July 26, 2008. He was childless and as he approached the end of his life, willed that his sister's progeny should take the Ridgely name and in doing, would inherit his vast estates. Thus, John Carnan Ridgely was, in fact, a fifth cousin of his wife, Eliza Eichelberger Ridgely. When her husband's father died on July 1829, his estate of some was divided, her husband John inherited the main house and . Eliza thus became the third mistress of Hampton. Together, Eliza and John were the parents of five children: * Eliza Ridgely (1828‚Äì1894), who married firstly John Campbell White (1825‚Äì1853) in 1849, becoming the mother of the diplomat Henry White. After his death, she married Dr. Thomas Hepburn Buckler (1812‚Äì1901) in 1865. * Priscilla Ridgely (b. 1831) * Nicholas Greenbury Ridgely (b. 1834) * Charles Ridgely (1838‚Äì1872), who married Margaretta Sophia Howard (1824‚Äì1904) in 1851. * Julia Maria Ridgely (b. 1841) Hampton Mansion Eliza Ridgely had a serious approach to financial affairs. The daughter of a merchant, she had married into a family which recorded the smallest transaction, and she kept careful accounts of all her expenditure, even noting the nine and a half cents she paid for a piece of ribbon. As well as her personal spending, her accounts also show her expenses in ensuring that the Hampton slaves were clothed and shod, a major undertaking.Lancaster, R. Kent, 'Chattel Slavery at Hampton/Northampton, Baltimore County' in Maryland Historical Magazine, vol. 95, no. 4 (Winter 2000) online at Antebellum Plantation Life (see section headed 'chatelaine') She also recorded her subscriptions, such as those to the Baltimore Humane Impartial Society from 1849 to 1854 and her donations to a Widows Asylum between 1849 and 1851.Ridgely Papers, 1664-1882, Maryland Historical Society at mdhs.org, accessed July 26, 2008 Eliza Ridgely ordered church services for her slaves in the attic of the Hampton carriage house. The services were taken by a white minister, Mr Galbraith, until he was dismissed for marrying a woman believed to have African blood. Ridgely herself oversaw funerals and weddings in the house's great hall. One of Ridgely's grandsons, the diplomat Henry White, recalled that she \\"...was very particular in having what she was pleased to describe (and which I then believed to be) 'marriages', performed by a clergyman, between the negro servants, when so inclined: not realizing ‚Äì certainly I did not at the time ‚Äì that slaves were unable to perform any civil act, being mere chattels\\". Ridgely's daughter Eliza recorded having taught a group of slave children the Lord's Prayer. Eliza Ridgely was an avid gardener, and in the 1830s and 1840s she improved the gardens and enhanced the landscape at Hampton, planting exotic trees such as the Lebanon Cedar which still stands on the house's south lawn.Gutek, Gerald Lee & Patricia, Plantations and Outdoor Museums in America's Historic South (University of South Carolina Press, 1996, ) She is said to have brought this herself as a seedling from Europe, carrying it in a shoebox. She and her husband bought furniture for the house which reflected the classical influences already indulged there.A Palace in the Wilderness at nps.gov, accessed July 26, 2008 In 1839, the landscape gardener Henry Winthrop Sargent found that Hampton's venerable appearance and foreign air \\"...quite disturb one's ideas of republican America\\". Lady with a Harp Thomas Sully's painting Lady with a Harp (pictured) is a portrait of Eliza Ridgely done in 1818, when she was only fifteen, showing her wearing an Empire satin gown with a draped shawl as she plucks the strings of a pedal harp. It was commissioned by her father, Nicholas Greenbury Ridgely, who at the same time was himself painted by Sully. Eliza really did play the harp, and her surviving bills and receipts include those for music lessons and for the repair of her harp in the years 1820 to 1826. Whether her arms were as long and her figure as slender as they were painted is uncertain. Sully later commented on all his work \\"From long experience, I know that resemblance in a portrait is essential; but no fault will be found with the artist (at least by the sitter) if he improve the appearance.\\" The painting was kept at Hampton from the 1820s until 1945, when it was sold to the National Gallery of Art.Thomas Sully, American, 1783‚Äì1872, Lady with a Harp: Eliza Ridgely, 1818 at nga.gov, accessed July 26, 2008 After David Finley, director of the gallery, had acquired Lady with a Harp he became an advocate for the preservation of Hampton. He helped to arrange a deal under which the Ridgelys sold the house to Ailsa Mellon Bruce's Avalon Foundation, which in 1948 gave it to the National Park Service. There is now a copy of the painting at Hampton. Surviving papers of Eliza Ridgely A number of financial records kept by Eliza Ridgely have been preserved: *Account book of expenses on trip to Europe (1833‚Äì1834) *Servants Clothing Book, (1835‚Äì1854) *Account Book (1838‚Äì1846) *Accounts of Eliza E.

Ridgely (1858‚Äì1867) Other surviving manuscripts include letters Eliza Ridgely wrote to her daughter Eliza (known as 'Didy') between May 8 and July 12, 1858, a commonplace book of poetry she kept before her marriage, and letters she wrote and received from her friend Lafayette, her son Charles at Harvard and her daughter Eliza traveling in Europe.

antagonist with sodium channel blocking properties. It has been studied for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Because remacemide has only a modest effect on seizure frequency and causes dizziness, it is no longer believed that remacemide will be an effective treatment for epilepsy. Although no such statement has been made about remacemide's potential for treating stroke, Huntington's, or Parkinson's, remacemide is no longer being developed for these conditions. Remacemide is also known as remacemide hydrochloride, (¬±)-2-amino-N-(1-methyl-1,2-diphenylethyl)-acetamide hydrochloride, or FPL 12924AA. Adverse effects *dizziness *nausea =Lack of adverse effects= Unlike many other treatments for epilepsy, remacemide does not appear to impair cognitive performance or driving performance in humans, although the evidence for effects on cognitive performance in animals has been mixed. Remacemide is not a sedative. Toxicity The median toxic dose of remacemide for neural impairment tests in mice is 5.6 mg/kg. Its estimated median lethal dose is about 927.3 mg/kg in mice. It has a favorable therapeutic index of 28.1 in mice. Drug interactions=Levodopa= Remacemide delays the absorption of levodopa (300 mg of remacemide one hour before levodopa treatment delays mean time to peak levodopa plasma concentration by 20%) but not its total absorption (area-under-the-curve for levodopa plasma concentration was unchanged). =Sodium valproate= Remacemide does not interact with sodium valproate, a treatment for epilepsy. =Carbamazepine= Ramacemide does interact with carbamazepine. Remacemide inhibits the metabolism of carbamazepine, while carbamazepine induces the metabolism of remacemide and FPL 12495. =Alcohol=Remacemide salts Remacemide is most commonly synthesized as the salt remacemide hydrochloride. However, there has been some investigation into other remacemide salts and their crystals, as different remacemide salts might taste more pleasant or have a solubility more suitable for a pediatric suspension formulation. Mechanism of action Remacemide binds weakly and noncompetitively to the ionic channel site of the NMDA receptor complex. Remacemide binds both allosterically and in the channel. However, because remacemide binds so weakly to NMDAR, much of remacemide's in vivo effect against excitotoxicity is thought to be caused by its metabolic transformation to the more potent desglycine derivative FPL 12495. That is, remacemide may actually act as a prodrug to deliver the active metabolite FPL 12495 to the central nervous system. =Epilepsy= In a well validated and described genetic model of absence epilepsy, rats of the WAG/Rij strain, remacemide and its metabolite FPL 12495 were found to have a common for glutamate antagonist usual effect on the number of spike/wave dischargesEEG, the drugs decrease spike/wave dischanges dose dependently. However, in contrast to most other glutamate antagonists, FPL 12495 increased the duration of the spike-wave discharges. Pharmacokinetics=Blood‚Äìbrain barrier= The brain uptake index (BUI), a measure of a drug's ability to pass the blood‚Äìbrain barrier that involves the injection of radiolabeled test and reference substances into the common carotid artery of anesthetized animals, for remacemide is 51 ¬± 0.9 SD. Enantiomers The (-)stereoisomer of remacemide is of equal potency to the racemic mixture in preventing maximal electroshock seizures when administered orally to rats, while the (+)stereoisomer is less potent. Metabolites=FPL 12495= Much of remacemide's effect in vivo is thought to be caused by the desglycine derivative FPL 12495 (¬±). FPL 12495 (¬±) binds specifically and non- competitively to NMDAR,. Its effect on maximal electroconvulsive shock is more potent than remacemide. The S isomer (FPL 12859) is even more potent than the racemic mixture, while the R isomer is less potent than the racemate. FPL 12495 is sometimes referred to as ARL 12495AA. =Other metabolites=FPL 15053 FPL 15053 is the N-hydroxy-desglycinate of remacemide, and exhibits modest binding to NMDAR and modest effects on convulsions and mortality in test mice and rats. FPL 14331 and FPL 14465 FPL 14331 and FPL 14465 are the p-hydroxy-desglycinates of remacemide, and they exhibit some efficacy against maximal electroconvulsive shock after i.p. and i.v. dosing. FPL 15455 FPL 15455 is an oxoacetate matabolite of remacemide, but has no demonstrated biological activity. FPL 14991 and FPL 14981 FPL 14991 and FPL 14981 are both Œ≤-Miydroxy-desglycinates of remacemide, and they display modest efficacy against maximal electroconvulsive shock in mice. However FPL 14981 and not FPL 14991 prevents NMDLA-induced convulsions and mortality in mice. FPL 13592 and FPL 15112 The hydroxy-methyl derivative of remacemide (FPL 13592) and its desglycinate (FPL 15112) prevents electric shock-induced convulsions only after i.v. administration; only the desglycine derivative binds to NMDAR. FPL 14467 FPL 14467 (p-dihydroxy-desglycine) is inactive in vivo and weak in binding NMDAR. Pharmacodynamics The values for 50% displacement of [3H]MK801 were 68 ŒºM for remacemide and 0.48 ŒºM for FPL 12495AA. History=Current status= Remacemide is an experimental drug most recently being developed by the British multinational pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. However, there has been little news of its progress since 2000. A few sources indicate that its development has been discontinued. =Changing hands= Remacemide was one of the last drugs under development by the now-defunct English pharmaceutical company Fisons. In 1995, it was acquired along with most of Fisons' research and development operations by the Swedish pharmaceutical company Astra, which in 1999 merged with the British company Zeneca to form AstraZeneca. In 2000, AstraZeneca considered possibly licensing out remacemide to some other pharmaceutical company, but there has been little news about remacemide since then. Remacemide's development may have been discontinued in July 2001. Discovery and development under Fisons In 1990, researchers at Fisons found that remacemide acted as an anticonvulsant in mice and rats . Because of remacemide's potential as a neuroprotective agent through preventing glutamate toxicity, it was soon also under investigation as a treatment for Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease. Astra By 1995, when Astra acquired remacemide, it was already in Phase IIb clinical development as an anti- epileptic drug and Phase I clinical development as a treatment for Huntington's . AstraZeneca By 1998, when Astra announced its merger with Zeneca, remacemide had progressed to Phase III trials for epilepsy and Phase II trials for Parkinson's disease, and Astra was also investigating its potential for treating neuropathic pain In 1999, after the merger, AstraZeneca reported that they were investigating remacemide for its neuroprotective effects, and that they planned regulatory submissions for Huntington's disease in 2001 and for Parkinson's disease and epilepsy in 2003. Remacemide, under the trade name Ecovia, was designated an orphan drug for the treatment of Huntington's disease by the FDA in March 2000. Remacemide was last mentioned in AstraZeneca's reports on its R&D; pipeline in 2000, when it was in Phase III clinical trials for remacemide in the treatment of Huntington's disease and Phase II for treatment of Parkinson's disease. At that time, the submission of the New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA and the Marketing Authorization Application to the CHMP was projected for Huntington's in 2001 and for Parkinson's after 2003, but there has been no news of such submission. In this report, it was also noted that remacemide was \\"under strategic review and a potential candidate for licensing activity\\" (see this external article about drug licensing.) Current news There are no clinical trials of remacemide in progress, according to the Huntington Study Group, and the Parkinson Study Group. Availability Remacemide is an experimental drug not available to the public and not currently undergoing clinical trials. It is available for research purposes from Tocris Bioscience, under license from AstraZeneca.

It follows four retired geisha and their struggles to make ends meet in post World War II Japan. The film is based on three short stories by female author Fumiko Hayashi, published in 1948. The story has been translated into English by Lane Dunlop and is available in the anthology \\"A Late Chrysanthemum: Twenty-One Stories from the Japanese\\". Plot Kin, the first of the geisha, is consumed by the idea of wealth. As a moneylender, she is an embittered businesswoman who is insistent upon being repaid by her former geisha sisters, Tamae and Tomi. She is the love interest of a former soldier in Manchuria, Seki, who was sent to jail after trying to commit suicide with her many years ago. He returns to try to borrow money from her, but is quickly turned away. In the end, he is sent back to jail for a money-related crime. Kin then becomes excited when she hears that Tabe, her former patron and lover, is returning. However, she becomes furious after realizing that he does not love her, but rather just wants to borrow her money as well. She kicks him out and burns his photograph to erase his memory. In the end, she leaves the city on a search for property to buy. Tamae and Tomi, both former geisha, live together. Tamae is plagued by migraines, and as a result, she is unable to work as frequently as she would like as a housekeeper in a hotel. She is troubled by her son Kiyoshi's relationship with an older mistress. Yet, his new job allows her to repay her debts to Kin. Still, Tamae is saddened when her son decides to move away to Hokkaido. Tomi is a gambler who has not taken good care of herself after her days as a geisha. She laments her daughter Sachiko's upcoming marriage to an older man and tries to persuade her against it. Tomi is also indebted to Kin and is unable to repay this money as a result of her addiction to gambling. The last of the four geisha is Nobu. She and her husband own a restaurant, which is frequented by the other women.

Located on the Staten Island waterfront on the west shore of the Narrows, directly across from Fort Hamilton and the now-destroyed Fort Lafayette in Brooklyn, the fort was intended to protect New York from attack by sea. When built, it and a previous fort on the site were named Fort Richmond. History=Early 19th century= The first fort on the site was built by the State of New York beginning in 1806, which was ready for service in 1808 though incomplete. This fort was built of red sandstone and named Fort Richmond, after the county in which Staten Island is located, which was named for Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond.Fort Wadsworth at FortWiki.com It was protected on the landward side by the first Fort Tompkins, also built of red sandstone by the state. Fort Richmond was initially semicircular while Fort Tompkins was a regular pentagon with circular bastions, both very different from their Third System replacements. Although these forts were contemporary with the federal government's second system of seacoast fortifications, they were not part of the federal program. Federal rebuilding of Forts Richmond and Tompkins did not begin until 1847. This fort and others nearby were expanded and completed during the War of 1812. =Third system fort= By 1835 Forts Richmond and Tompkins had deteriorated to the point that they were declared unfit for use, and the next year the federal government began a decade-long process of purchasing them. In 1847 total reconstructions of both forts began, under the federal third system of seacoast fortifications, an across-the-board program of new forts sparked by the burning of Washington, DC in the War of 1812. This program resulted in the forts that are present today. Some sources state that the new Forts Richmond and Tompkins were initially designed by Robert E. Lee during his tenure as post engineer at Fort Hamilton in the 1840s.Fort Richmond at New York State Military Museum Fort Richmond had one landward front and three seacoast fronts, with an unusual four tiers of cannon totaling 116 guns to seaward, plus 24 flank howitzers on the landward front. Among forts as completed, the four-tier arrangement was only duplicated in the United States by Castle Williams on Governors Island and Fort Point in San Francisco, California. The detailed design of the new Fort Richmond was by General Joseph G. Totten, and it was built between 1845 and 1861. In 1865 it was renamed Fort Wadsworth, after Brigadier General James Wadsworth, killed in the 1864 Battle of the Wilderness during the Civil War. =Late 19th through early 20th century= A mine casemate for controlling an underwater minefield was built in the fort in 1875 and was later re-used when mines became a standard part of the harbor defenses in the 1890s.Fort Wadsworth at American Forts Network At that time numerous new gun batteries were built near the fort under the Endicott Program for the Harbor Defenses of New York. Part of that program was a renaming of the entire fortified area at the Narrows on Staten Island as Fort Wadsworth, with the former Fort Richmond becoming Battery Weed, in General Order No. 16 of 1902. Battery Weed was named for Brigadier General Stephen H. Weed, killed at Gettysburg in 1863. In 1903, a small lighthouse was built atop Battery Weed. Its light was visible for . When the Verrazano- Narrows Bridge opened in 1965 the lighthouse became obsolete. Dark for many years, it was restored and converted to solar power by volunteers in 2005.Lighthousefriends.com Present Fort Wadsworth was an active military base until 1994, operated by the U.S. Navy for its final few years. In 1995, Battery Weed, along with the rest of Fort Wadsworth, was transferred to the care of the National Park Service as part of the Gateway National Recreation Area. Battery Weed's interior is open to the public on park ranger escorted tours only, although its exterior can be viewed at all times. A 10-inch smoothbore Rodman gun is preserved in the fort.

He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1901 until his death, representing the electorate of Maranoa.  Early life  Page was born in London, England, and was raised and educated in a Barnardo's Home. He joined the British Army, serving from 1877 to 1883, and fighting as a gunner in the Royal Artillery in the Anglo-Zulu War, seeing action in the Battle of Rorke's Drift, and then again serving in the First Boer War. He \\"bought himself out of\\" the army after his war service and undertook casual work such as bricklaying, before migrating to Queensland in the 1880s on the ship Scottish Hero, arriving in Rockhampton with little to his name. In Queensland, Page worked odd jobs such as fencer, navvy, bush carpenter and bricklayer, as a ganger on the Queensland Central Railway, and as overseer of works for the Barcaldine Divisional Board. He is occasionally reported as having been a shearer, and some form of union leader during the 1891 shearers strike, but that appears to be incorrect. He became the proprietor of the Welcome Home Hotel in Barcaldine in 1893, but gave up that lease in 1897 and took over the Exchange Hotel, which he operated until his election to parliament. He was Provincial Grand Master of the Rockhampton District and later Queensland Grand Master of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and was a Past Master of the Barcaldine Masonic Lodge.  Politics  In 1901, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives in the first federal election, winning the Queensland rural seat of Maranoa for the Labor Party. He held the position of party whip from 1913. He held the seat until his death in 1921. In later years, Page \\"disposed of his western interests\\" and lived for several years in Brisbane. He had reportedly had \\"some months of painful illness\\" in 1920, including an eye condition that left him facing possible blindness. Page died in his bed in Moonee Ponds, Melbourne, on 3 June 1921; although he had been ill the previous year, he had been active in the House as late as the previous day and his death was sudden and unexpected. His funeral was held at St John's Cathedral in Brisbane, and he was buried in Toowong Cemetery.Page James -- Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search. Retrieved 3 January 2015.

Initially a member of the Country Party, he later became one of its key critics and campaigned actively against it in the 1950s and 1960s. His successful court action invalidating the Queensland government's stock levy in 1977, in the last year of his life, was one of his most significant achievements. Early life Russell was born at Willambi, Manilla, near Tamworth in New South Wales. He was the fourth of five children, and the only surviving son, born to grazier Wilfred Adams Russell (who served in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland 1926-32) and his wife Millicent, daughter of pastoralist Charles Baldwin. The family moved to Queensland in 1910, settling at Dalmally station near Roma. In 1923, Wilfred acquired Jimbour Station, a property in the Darling Downs built by Sir Joshua Bell. Charles was educated at Cranbrook School in Sydney, and later worked as a jackeroo on his father's western Queensland sheep stations. In 1930 he became manager of Nardoo station in Cunnamulla. Local politics and advocacy Wilfred Russell died in 1932, and Charles inherited the family properties. Elected to Wambo Shire Council in 1932, he was a prominent spokesman for the wool industry and advocated the construction of all-weather roads. He joined the board of Sturmfels Primary Producers' Co-operative Association in 1937 and was influential in arranging its merger with the Queensland Primary Producers' Co-operative Association. In 1934, Russell travelled to the United States, where he learned to fly and acquired his first aeroplane, a Beechcraft Staggerwing. He enlisted as an airman pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force on 10 February 1941, and by May was a flight lieutenant, serving as an instructor at training schools around Australia until his transfer to the RAAF Reserve on 28 February 1944. Family On 27 July 1944 at St John's Anglican Cathedral in Brisbane Charles Russell married Hilary Maude Newton, daughter of pastoralist Frank Newton. Together they had one daughter and four sons, one of whom is David Russell QC, barrister and politician State and federal politics In 1936, Russell had helped to found the Queensland Country Party, and contested the Legislative Assembly of Queensland seats of Warrego in 1938 and Dalby in 1944. In 1947, the beneficiary of a campaign organised by James Killen, Russell was elected to the seat of Dalby, and focused on transport, land settlement, decentralisation and rural industries. He described the atmosphere of the Parliament as \\"friendly\\" but was frustrated in Opposition, leading to his decision to transfer to federal politics. He was endorsed as the Country Party's candidate for the seat of Maranoa at the 1949 federal election and was easily elected. Disillusioned by the federal party's inability to act on its election promises, Russell resigned from the parliamentary party on 7 October 1950 when the government refused to raise the exchange rate and imposed a tax on wool. He sat on the cross benches for the rest of his term and contested the 1951 federal election as an independent. He polled 29.9% of the vote behind Labor's candidate, Alfred Dohring, and the official Country candidate, Wilfred Brimblecombe. His preferences ensured Brimblecombe's victory over Dohring. Later life Russell was expelled by the Country Party after the election and applied to join the Liberal Party, but was rejected. He was a candidate for the Senate in the 1953 Senate only election as third on a ticket headed by Sir Raphael Cilento. He attempted to regain Maranoa at the 1954 election and came third with 17.4%. The absence of a Labor candidate for Maranoa at the 1955 election gave him 43.7% of the vote, finishing with 48.9% of the two-candidate preferred vote. He later contested the Queensland state seat of Condamine in 1972. Russell's wealth and prominent connexions allowed him to continue to campaign for his beliefs. He continued to challenge both the Country Party and the Menzies Government, losing a High Court appeal against the validity of the federal wool tax in 1965 but successfully invalidating the Queensland government's stock levy in 1977. Russell's views placed him on the right of the political spectrum. He was devoted to anti-socialism and the British Empire, and was associated with several other men who were disaffected with the major political parties, including Cilento, George Griffiths and economist Colin Clark. Russell and Cilento formed the short-lived Australian Democratic Party during the 1950s, and in the 1960s he was a leader in the Basic Industries Group and held membership of the Federal Inland Development Organisation. Although he had links with the Australian League of Rights, he did not join the League as he was opposed to its espousal of Social Credit theories. He joined the Workers Party (later the Progress Party) in the 1970s. Russell and his wife Hilary co- wrote a book on their property in 1955, Jimbour: Its History and Development; Jimbour House was classified by the National Trust of Queensland and became a popular entertainment venue. Russell published his autobiography, Country Crisis, in 1976. Russell died at Dalby Hospital of a cerebral haemorrhage on 20 October 1977, a day after he collapsed while speaking at a meeting of the Maranoa branch of the Progress Party. He was survived by his wife, their daughter and their four sons. He was cremated.

The fluid volume causes hypervolemia. Symptoms and signs The primary symptoms of TACO are dyspnea, orthopnea, peripheral edema, and rapid increase of blood pressure.Noninfectious Adverse Events of Transfusion - Transfusion Transmitted Injuries Section - Blood Safety Surveillance and Health Care Acquired Infections Division - Public Health... TACO must be suspected when there is respiratory distress with other signs, including pulmonary edema, unanticipated cardiovascular system changes, and evidence of fluid overload (including improvement after diuretic, morphine or nitrate treatment), during or up to 24 hours after transfusion.  Risk factors  * Low albumin * Cardiovascular disease * Kidney disease * Lung disease * Severe anemia * Age (less than 3 years old and over 60 years old) Diagnosis The International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) working party on hemovigilance in collaboration with the International Haemovigilance Network (IHN) and AABB produced new reporting criteria in 2018. Patients classified with TACO should have acute onset or worsening respiratory distress or evidence of pulmonary edema, or both during or up to 12 hours after transfusion. They should have at least 3 of the following characteristics: * Acute or worsening respiratory distress (tachypnoea, shortness of breath, cyanosis, and decreased oxygen saturations) in the absence of other causes *Evidence of acute or worsening pulmonary edema (by physical examination, or chest imaging, or other non- invasive assessment of heart function e.g. echocardiogram) * Evidence of unanticipated cardiovascular system changes (tachycardia, hypertension, widened pulse pressure, jugular venous distension, peripheral edema) * Evidence of fluid overload (positive fluid balance, response to diuretic therapy with clinical improvement, change in the patient‚Äôs weight in the peri- transfusion period) * Changes in a relevant biomarker e.g. elevation in natriuretic peptide (NP) levels (e.g. brain-natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal (NT)-pro BNP) to greater than 1.5 times the pre-transfusion value. =Differential diagnosis= TACO and TRALI are both respiratory complications following a transfusion. TACO and transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) are often difficult to distinguish in the acute situation. TACO is usually associated with hypertension and responds well to diuretics, TRALI is often associated with hypotension and diuretics have a minimal effect. A normal natriuretic peptide level post-transfusion is seen with TRALI but not with TACO.  Prevention  Transfusion associated circulatory overload is prevented by avoiding unnecessary transfusions, closely monitoring patients receiving transfusions, transfusing smaller volumes of blood at a slower rate, and considering the use of diuretics. A pre-transfusion TACO checklist can be used to assess patients' risk of developing TACO. Management If TACO is suspected stop the transfusion. Treat with oxygen, diuretics, and other treatments for cardiac failure. Occurrence It is difficult to determine the incidence of TACO, but its incidence is estimated at about one in every 100 transfusions using active surveillance, and in one in every 10000 transfusions using passive surveillance. TACO is the most commonly reported cause of transfusion-related death and major morbidity in the UK, and second most common cause in the USA. The risk increases with patients over the age of 60, patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, renal impairment, hypoalbuminemia or anemia.

He is now remembered mainly for The Wounded Cavalier (1855). Life Burton's grandfather was a printer, and his father was William Evans Burton, a comic actor and playwright who found popular success in the United States -- while leaving his wife and son behind in London, with little money. An only child, the younger Burton worked at copying prints as a teenager. The dramatist and critic Tom Taylor was his sponsor and patron. Taylor helped the teen find work at the magazine Punch, a job designing capitals for illustrations (which provided much-needed income). He was educated at King's College and the Royal Academy School, where he won a gold medal in 1852 for a painting on the subject of Samson and Delilah. To paint his most famous work, The Wounded Cavalier, Burton was said to have dug a hole in the ground to stand in, so that he could paint the grass and ferns at eye level.Christopher Wood, Victorian Painting, Boston, Little, Brown & Co., 1999 (); p. 120. The work shows a scene from the English Civil War: a Cavalier courier has been ambushed and wounded, and is comforted by a Puritan maiden. Her jealous suitor, carrying a large Bible, looks on. The painting was shown at the Royal Academy show of 1856, although through a strange set of circumstances. According to Burton's own account, his picture was left in a remote room with its face turned to the wall (by porters who, Burton believed, had not been sufficiently bribed). The academician Charles West Cope found the picture, brought it to the hanging committee's attention, and even withdrew one of his own works from the show to make room for Burton's, which was hung next to William Holman Hunt's The Scapegoat.For details of Burton's account see The Wounded Cavalier was the artist's single flirtation with the Pre-Raphaelite movement of the 1850s. In later years Burton mainly devoted himself to painting religious subjects.Wood. p. 121. Though plagued by poor health and personal difficulties, Burton remained active as a painter into his eighties. His wife Mina Elizabeth Burton was the author of a novel titled Ruling the Planets (1891).John S.

The author, Nagai Kafu, a Japanese novelist, was born in 1879 and died in 1959. Kafu was an editor of literary magazines before investigating Tokyo's geisha world and writing novels.Winterton, Bradley. \\"'Rivalry' of the Steamy and Sensitive Variety.\\" Taipei Times 2 Mar. 2008: 18. 21 May 2008 . Rivalry is set in the early twentieth century (it begins around 1912) in Tokyo's Shimbashi geisha district. Rivalry aims to capture the lives of Shimbashi geisha at a historically popular time for geisha. Plot summary Rivalry begins with the return of the story's protagonist, Komayo, to the geisha world. Having left the pleasure quarters to live in the countryside, she returns several years later because her husband has died, leaving her to fend for herself. She decides that she would rather relive her days as a geisha than to live as a peasant. Upon her return, she is reunited with a lover from her past, Yoshioka. The two had spent time together before Yoshioka left the country to study abroad. Yoshioka feels a rekindled desire for Komayo and calls for her often to spend much of her time with him attending events. Soon he suggests that he should become her danna. Although Komayo would be glad to have the financial support, she shies away from his proposal. Komayo and Yoshioka go on a weeklong vacation to hot spring resorts, but Yoshioka has to leave early, unexpectedly. Komayo stays and runs into Segawa, a man whom she desires instantly. After a brief, unforgettable affair, Komayo returns to Tokyo. At the Kabuki theater Yoshioka overhears a conversation about the love affair between Komayo and Segawa. He seeks revenge by becoming involved with Kikuchiyo, a promiscuous geisha from Komayo's okiya. As the novel progresses Komayo discovers that Yoshioka betrayed her. She's hurt but pursues her relationship with Segawa with renewed determination. Segawa does not reciprocate the same devotion as Komayo. After a performance, Yoshioka's first mistress, Rikiji, seeks her revenge on Komayo by introducing Segawa to a wealthy former geisha, Kimiryu. This new geisha's financial situation pleases Segawa's mother who never approved of Komayo. The novel concludes with Komayo alone. The man who offered to support her and the man she loved have left her for other geisha. The mother of her okiya dies and her husband, Old Gozan, recognizes his inability to continue the house on his own; he passes it on to Komayo. She realizes that the geisha okiya means a lot to her. Gozan's offer adds a glimmer of hope for Komayo with a life running the household herself. Background information Female entertainers in Japan emerged during the 7th and 13th century. They performed for the nobility. During the Edo period prostitution was legal and was mostly within walled in districts such as Yoshiwara, which were licensed by the Tokugawa Shogunate, known as the pleasure quarters. In the 17th century, high-class courtesans known as oiran, or men working as geisha, would perform at parties. During the 18th century, dancing women called odoriko became popular and began entertaining men at banquets in unlicensed districts. From this time on, the word geisha referred to women entertainers. After the Meiji Restoration the government passed a law liberating prostitutes and geisha. This caused many controversies because the distinction between the two can be unclear. To clarify, the government intervened and stated that geisha were more refined than prostitutes; geisha were expected to be single and if they decided to marry then they had to drop their professions. They were not prostitutes, did not prepare food, and could not be considered wives. They performed at business banquets and were encouraged to have a danna for financial support but that commitment remained optional. Later, greater misunderstandings between geisha and prostitution emerged from the aftermath of WWII when the U.S. occupied Japan. Prostitutes hired to serve American GIs starting calling themselves geisha, which blurred the conceptual line. Themes Nagai Kafu's Rivalry tells the tale of a geisha walking the fine line between companionship and love. Throughout the novel, it becomes evident that a geisha should never fall in love, for she will surely be taken advantage of if she does. Kafu stresses that men are unreliable and that their intentions are never as they seem. It is hard for a geisha who is so dependent on men not to eventually fall in love, but it is this detachment in itself that will ultimately lead to her independence. She must use her power over men to get what she wants and keep her emotions in check. Rivalry shows a woman's struggle to balance the geisha life with her desire for independence.

The main applications are in Sobolev spaces, where spaces of functions that have a noninteger number of derivatives are interpolated from the spaces of functions with integer number of derivatives. History The theory of interpolation of vector spaces began by an observation of J√≥zef Marcinkiewicz, later generalized and now known as the Riesz-Thorin theorem. In simple terms, if a linear function is continuous on a certain space and also on a certain space , then it is also continuous on the space , for any intermediate between and . In other words, is a space which is intermediate between and . In the development of Sobolev spaces, it became clear that the trace spaces were not any of the usual function spaces (with integer number of derivatives), and Jacques-Louis Lions discovered that indeed these trace spaces were constituted of functions that have a noninteger degree of differentiability. Many methods were designed to generate such spaces of functions, including the Fourier transform, complex interpolation,The seminal papers in this direction are and . real interpolation,first defined in , developed in , with notation slightly different (and more complicated, with four parameters instead of two) from today's notation. It was put later in today's form in , and . as well as other tools (see e.g. fractional derivative).  The setting of interpolation  A Banach space is said to be continuously embedded in a Hausdorff topological vector space when is a linear subspace of such that the inclusion map from into is continuous. A compatible couple of Banach spaces consists of two Banach spaces and that are continuously embedded in the same Hausdorff topological vector space .see , pp. 96-105. The embedding in a linear space allows to consider the two linear subspaces : X_0 \\\\cap X_1 and :X_0 + X_1 = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ z \\\\in Z : z = x_0 + x_1, \\\\ x_0 \\\\in X_0, \\\\, x_1 \\\\in X_1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. Interpolation does not depend only upon the isomorphic (nor isometric) equivalence classes of and . It depends in an essential way from the specific relative position that and occupy in a larger space . One can define norms on and by :\\\\x\\\\_{X_0 \\\\cap X_1} := \\\\max \\\\left ( \\\\left \\\\x \\\\right \\\\_{X_0}, \\\\left \\\\x \\\\right \\\\_{X_1} \\\\right ), :\\\\x\\\\_{X_0 + X_1} := \\\\inf \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\left \\\\x_0 \\\\right \\\\_{X_0} + \\\\left \\\\x_1 \\\\right \\\\_{X_1} \\\\ : \\\\ x = x_0 + x_1, \\\\; x_0 \\\\in X_0, \\\\; x_1 \\\\in X_1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. Equipped with these norms, the intersection and the sum are Banach spaces. The following inclusions are all continuous: :X_0 \\\\cap X_1 \\\\subset X_0, \\\\ X_1 \\\\subset X_0 + X_1. Interpolation studies the family of spaces that are intermediate spaces between and in the sense that :X_0 \\\\cap X_1 \\\\subset X \\\\subset X_0 + X_1, where the two inclusions maps are continuous. An example of this situation is the pair , where the two Banach spaces are continuously embedded in the space of measurable functions on the real line, equipped with the topology of convergence in measure. In this situation, the spaces , for are intermediate between and . More generally, :L^{p_0}(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\cap L^{p_1}(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\subset L^p(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\subset L^{p_0}(\\\\mathbf{R}) + L^{p_1}(\\\\mathbf{R}), \\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{when} \\\\ \\\\ 1 \\\\le p_0 \\\\le p \\\\le p_1 \\\\le \\\\infty, with continuous injections, so that, under the given condition, is intermediate between and . :Definition. Given two compatible couples and , an interpolation pair is a couple of Banach spaces with the two following properties: :*The space X is intermediate between and , and Y is intermediate between and . :*If is any linear operator from to , which maps continuously to and to , then it also maps continuously to . The interpolation pair is said to be of exponent (with ) if there exists a constant such that :\\\\L\\\\_{X,Y} \\\\leq C \\\\L\\\\_{X_0,Y_0}^{1-\\\\theta} \\\\; \\\\L\\\\_{X_1,Y_1}^{\\\\theta} for all operators as above. The notation is for the norm of as a map from to . If , we say that is an exact interpolation pair of exponent .  Complex interpolation  If the scalars are complex numbers, properties of complex analytic functions are used to define an interpolation space. Given a compatible couple (X0, X1) of Banach spaces, the linear space \\\\mathcal{F}(X_0, X_1) consists of all functions , that are analytic on continuous on and for which all the following subsets are bounded: :, :, :. \\\\mathcal{F}(X_0, X_1) is a Banach space under the norm ::\\\\f\\\\_{\\\\mathcal{F}(X_0, X_1)} = \\\\max \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\sup_{t \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}} \\\\f(it)\\\\_{X_0}, \\\\; \\\\sup_{t \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}}\\\\f(1 + it)\\\\_{X_1} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Definition.see p. 88 in . For , the complex interpolation space is the linear subspace of consisting of all values f(Œ∏) when f varies in the preceding space of functions, :(X_0, X_1)_\\\\theta = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in X_0 + X_1 : x = f(\\\\theta), \\\\; f \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}(X_0, X_1) \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. The norm on the complex interpolation space is defined by ::\\\\ \\\\x\\\\_\\\\theta = \\\\inf \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\f\\\\_{\\\\mathcal{F}(X_0, X_1)} \\\\ :\\\\ f(\\\\theta) = x, \\\\; f \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}(X_0, X_1) \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. Equipped with this norm, the complex interpolation space is a Banach space. :Theorem.see Theorem 4.1.2, p. 88 in . Given two compatible couples of Banach spaces and , the pair is an exact interpolation pair of exponent , i.e., if , is a linear operator bounded from to , then is bounded from to and :: \\\\T\\\\_\\\\theta \\\\le \\\\T\\\\_0^{1 - \\\\theta} \\\\T\\\\_1^\\\\theta. The family of spaces (consisting of complex valued functions) behaves well under complex interpolation.see Chapter 5, p. 106 in . If is an arbitrary measure space, if and , then :\\\\left( L^{p_0}(R, \\\\Sigma, \\\\mu), L^{p_1}(R, \\\\Sigma, \\\\mu) \\\\right)_\\\\theta = L^p(R, \\\\Sigma, \\\\mu), \\\\qquad \\\\frac{1}{p} = \\\\frac{1 - \\\\theta}{p_0} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{p_1}, with equality of norms. This fact is closely related to the Riesz‚ÄìThorin theorem.  Real interpolation  There are two ways for introducing the real interpolation method. The first and most commonly used when actually identifying examples of interpolation spaces is the K-method. The second method, the J-method, gives the same interpolation spaces as the K-method when the parameter is in . That the J- and K-methods agree is important for the study of duals of interpolation spaces: basically, the dual of an interpolation space constructed by the K-method appears to be a space constructed form the dual couple by the J-method; see below. = K-method = The K-method of real interpolationsee pp. 293‚Äì302 in . can be used for Banach spaces over the field of real numbers. Definition. Let be a compatible couple of Banach spaces. For and every , let :K(x, t; X_0, X_1) = \\\\inf \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\left \\\\x_0 \\\\right \\\\_{X_0} + t \\\\left \\\\x_1 \\\\right \\\\_{X_1} \\\\ :\\\\ x = x_0 + x_1, \\\\; x_0 \\\\in X_0, \\\\, x_1 \\\\in X_1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. Changing the order of the two spaces results in:see Proposition 1.2, p. 294 in . :K(x, t; X_0, X_1) = t K \\\\left (x, t^{-1}; X_1, X_0 \\\\right). Let :\\\\begin{align} \\\\x\\\\_{\\\\theta,q; K} &= \\\\left( \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\left( t^{-\\\\theta} K(x, t; X_0, X_1) \\\\right)^q \\\\, \\\\tfrac{dt}{t} \\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{q}}, && 0 < \\\\theta < 1, 1 \\\\leq q < \\\\infty, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\x\\\\_{\\\\theta,\\\\infty; K} &= \\\\sup_{t > 0} \\\\; t^{-\\\\theta} K(x, t; X_0, X_1), && 0 \\\\le \\\\theta \\\\le 1. \\\\end{align} The K-method of real interpolation consists in taking to be the linear subspace of consisting of all such that .  Example  An important example is that of the couple , where the functional can be computed explicitly. The measure is supposed -finite. In this context, the best way of cutting the function as sum of two functions and is, for some to be chosen as function of , to let be given for all by :f_1(x) = \\\\begin{cases} f(x) & f(x) < s, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{s f(x)}{f(x)} & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} The optimal choice of leads to the formulasee p. 298 in . :K \\\\left (f, t; L^1, L^\\\\infty \\\\right ) = \\\\int_0^t f^*(u) \\\\, d u, where is the decreasing rearrangement of . = J-method = As with the K-method, the J-method can be used for real Banach spaces. Definition. Let be a compatible couple of Banach spaces. For and for every vector , let :J(x, t; X_0, X_1) = \\\\max \\\\left ( \\\\x\\\\_{X_0}, t \\\\x\\\\_{X_1} \\\\right ). A vector in belongs to the interpolation space if and only if it can be written as :x = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty v(t) \\\\, \\\\frac{dt}{t}, where is measurable with values in and such that :\\\\Phi(v) = \\\\left( \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\left( t^{-\\\\theta} J(v(t), t; X_0, X_1) \\\\right)^q \\\\, \\\\tfrac{dt}{t} \\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{q}} < \\\\infty. The norm of in is given by the formula :\\\\x\\\\_{\\\\theta,q;J} := \\\\inf_v \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Phi(v) \\\\ :\\\\ x = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty v(t) \\\\, \\\\tfrac{dt}{t} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. = Relations between the interpolation methods = The two real interpolation methods are equivalent when .see Theorem 2.8, p. 314 in . :Theorem. Let be a compatible couple of Banach spaces. If and , then ::J_{\\\\theta,q}(X_0, X_1) = K_{\\\\theta,q}(X_0, X_1), :with equivalence of norms. The theorem covers degenerate cases that have not been excluded: for example if and form a direct sum, then the intersection and the J-spaces are the null space, and a simple computation shows that the K-spaces are also null. When , one can speak, up to an equivalent renorming, about the Banach space obtained by the real interpolation method with parameters and . The notation for this real interpolation space is . One has that :(X_0, X_1)_{\\\\theta, q} = (X_1, X_0)_{1 - \\\\theta, q}, \\\\qquad 0 < \\\\theta < 1, 1 \\\\le q \\\\le \\\\infty. For a given value of , the real interpolation spaces increase with :see Proposition 1.10, p. 301 in if and , the following continuous inclusion holds true: :(X_0, X_1)_{\\\\theta, q} \\\\subset (X_0, X_1)_{\\\\theta, r}. :Theorem. Given , and two compatible couples and , the pair is an exact interpolation pair of exponent .see Theorem 1.12, pp. 301‚Äì302 in . A complex interpolation space is usually not isomorphic to one of the spaces given by the real interpolation method. However, there is a general relationship. :Theorem. Let be a compatible couple of Banach spaces. If , then ::(X_0, X_1)_{\\\\theta, 1} \\\\subset (X_0, X_1)_\\\\theta \\\\subset (X_0, X_1)_{\\\\theta, \\\\infty}.  Examples  When and , the space of continuously differentiable functions on , the interpolation method, for , gives the H√∂lder space of exponent . This is because the K-functional of this couple is equivalent to : \\\\sup \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ f(u), \\\\, \\\\frac{f(u) - f(v)}{1 + t^{-1} u - v} \\\\ : \\\\ u, v \\\\in [0, 1] \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Only values are interesting here. Real interpolation between spaces givessee Theorem 1.9, p. 300 in . the family of Lorentz spaces. Assuming and , one has: : \\\\left ( L^1(\\\\mathbf{R}, \\\\Sigma, \\\\mu), L^\\\\infty(\\\\mathbf{R}, \\\\Sigma, \\\\mu) \\\\right)_{\\\\theta, q} = L^{p, q}(\\\\mathbf{R}, \\\\Sigma, \\\\mu), \\\\qquad \\\\text{where } \\\\tfrac{1}{p} = 1 - \\\\theta, with equivalent norms. This follows from an inequality of Hardy and from the value given above of the K-functional for this compatible couple. When , the Lorentz space is equal to , up to renorming. When , the Lorentz space is equal to weak-.  The reiteration theorem  An intermediate space of the compatible couple is said to be of class Œ∏ if see Definition 2.2, pp. 309-310 in :(X_0, X_1)_{\\\\theta,1} \\\\subset X \\\\subset (X_0, X_1)_{\\\\theta,\\\\infty}, with continuous injections. Beside all real interpolation spaces with parameter and , the complex interpolation space is an intermediate space of class of the compatible couple . The reiteration theorems says, in essence, that interpolating with a parameter behaves, in some way, like forming a convex combination : taking a further convex combination of two convex combinations gives another convex combination. :Theorem.see Theorem 2.4, p. 311 in Let be intermediate spaces of the compatible couple , of class and respectively, with . When and , one has ::(A_0, A_1)_{\\\\theta, q} = (X_0, X_1)_{\\\\eta, q}, \\\\qquad \\\\eta = (1 - \\\\theta) \\\\theta_0 + \\\\theta \\\\theta_1. It is notable that when interpolating with the real method between and , only the values of and matter. Also, and can be complex interpolation spaces between and , with parameters and respectively. There is also a reiteration theorem for the complex method. :Theorem.see 12.3, p. 121 in . Let be a compatible couple of complex Banach spaces, and assume that is dense in and in . Let and , where . Assume further that is dense in . Then, for every , :: \\\\left( \\\\left (X_0, X_1 \\\\right )_{\\\\theta_0}, \\\\left (X_0, X_1 \\\\right )_{\\\\theta_1} \\\\right)_\\\\theta = (X_0, X_1)_\\\\eta, \\\\qquad \\\\eta = (1 - \\\\theta) \\\\theta_0 + \\\\theta \\\\theta_1. The density condition is always satisfied when or .  Duality  Let be a compatible couple, and assume that is dense in X0 and in X1. In this case, the restriction map from the (continuous) dual X'_j of , to the dual of is one-to-one. It follows that the pair of duals \\\\left (X'_0, X'_1 \\\\right ) is a compatible couple continuously embedded in the dual . For the complex interpolation method, the following duality result holds: :Theorem.see 12.1 and 12.2, p. 121 in . Let be a compatible couple of complex Banach spaces, and assume that is dense in and in . If and are reflexive, then the dual of the complex interpolation space is obtained by interpolating the duals, :: ( (X_0, X_1)_\\\\theta )' = \\\\left(X'_0, X'_1 \\\\right )_\\\\theta, \\\\qquad 0 < \\\\theta < 1. In general, the dual of the space is equal to \\\\left (X'_0, X'_1 \\\\right )^{\\\\theta}, a space defined by a variant of the complex method.Theorem 4.1.4, p. 89 in . The upper-Œ∏ and lower-Œ∏ methods do not coincide in general, but they do if at least one of X0, X1 is a reflexive space.Theorem 4.3.1, p. 93 in . For the real interpolation method, the duality holds provided that the parameter q is finite: :Theorem.see Th√©or√®me 3.1, p. 23 in , or Theorem 3.7.1, p. 54 in . Let and a compatible couple of real Banach spaces. Assume that is dense in and in . Then :: \\\\left ( \\\\left (X_0, X_1 \\\\right )_{\\\\theta, q} \\\\right )' = \\\\left (X'_0, X'_1 \\\\right )_{\\\\theta, q'}, :where \\\\tfrac{1}{q'} = 1 - \\\\tfrac{1}{q}.  Discrete definitions  Since the function varies regularly (it is increasing, but is decreasing), the definition of the -norm of a vector , previously given by an integral, is equivalent to a definition given by a series.see chap. II in . This series is obtained by breaking into pieces of equal mass for the measure , : \\\\x\\\\_{\\\\theta, q; K} \\\\simeq \\\\left( \\\\sum_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}} \\\\left( 2^{-\\\\theta n} K \\\\left (x, 2^n; X_0, X_1 \\\\right ) \\\\right)^q \\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{q}}. In the special case where is continuously embedded in , one can omit the part of the series with negative indices . In this case, each of the functions defines an equivalent norm on . The interpolation space is a \\"diagonal subspace\\" of an -sum of a sequence of Banach spaces (each one being isomorphic to ). Therefore, when is finite, the dual of is a quotient of the -sum of the duals, , which leads to the following formula for the discrete -norm of a functional x in the dual of : : \\\\x'\\\\_{\\\\theta, p; J} \\\\simeq \\\\inf \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left( \\\\sum_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}} \\\\left( 2^{\\\\theta n} \\\\max \\\\left (\\\\left \\\\x'_n \\\\right \\\\_{X'_0}, 2^{-n} \\\\left \\\\x'_n \\\\right\\\\_{X'_1} \\\\right ) \\\\right)^p \\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{p}} \\\\ : \\\\ x' = \\\\sum_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}} x'_n \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. The usual formula for the discrete -norm is obtained by changing to . The discrete definition makes several questions easier to study, among which the already mentioned identification of the dual. Other such questions are compactness or weak- compactness of linear operators. Lions and Peetre have proved that: :Theorem.see chap. 5, Th√©or√®me 2.2, p. 37 in . If the linear operator is compact from to a Banach space and bounded from to , then is compact from to when , . Davis, Figiel, Johnson and Pe≈Çczy≈Ñski have used interpolation in their proof of the following result: :Theorem., see also Theorem 2.g.11, p. 224 in . A bounded linear operator between two Banach spaces is weakly compact if and only if it factors through a reflexive space. = A general interpolation method = The space used for the discrete definition can be replaced by an arbitrary sequence space Y with unconditional basis, and the weights , , that are used for the -norm, can be replaced by general weights :a_n, b_n > 0, \\\\ \\\\ \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\min(a_n, b_n) < \\\\infty. The interpolation space consists of the vectors in such that, and section 2.g in . :\\\\x\\\\_{K(X_0, X_1)} = \\\\sup_{m \\\\ge 1} \\\\left \\\\ \\\\sum_{n=1}^m a_n K \\\\left (x, \\\\tfrac{b_n}{a_n}; X_0, X_1 \\\\right) \\\\, y_n \\\\right\\\\_Y < \\\\infty, where {yn} is the unconditional basis of . This abstract method can be used, for example, for the proof of the following result: Theorem.see Theorem 3.b.1, p. 123 in . A Banach space with unconditional basis is isomorphic to a complemented subspace of a space with symmetric basis.  Interpolation of Sobolev and Besov spaces  Several interpolation results are available for Sobolev spaces and Besov spaces on Rn,Theorem 6.4.5, p. 152 in . :\\\\begin{align} &H;^s_p && s \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}, 1 \\\\le p \\\\le \\\\infty \\\\\\\\\\\\ &B;^s_{p, q} && s \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}, 1 \\\\le p, q \\\\le \\\\infty \\\\end{align} These spaces are spaces of measurable functions on when , and of tempered distributions on when . For the rest of the section, the following setting and notation will be used: :\\\\begin{align} 0 &< \\\\theta < 1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 &\\\\le p, p_0, p_1, q, q_0, q_1 \\\\le \\\\infty, \\\\\\\\\\\\ s, &s;_0, s_1 \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ s_\\\\theta &= (1 - \\\\theta) s_0 + \\\\theta s_1, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] \\\\frac 1 {p_\\\\theta} &= \\\\frac{1 - \\\\theta}{p_0} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{p_1}, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] \\\\frac 1 {q_\\\\theta} &= \\\\frac{1 - \\\\theta}{q_0} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{q_1}. \\\\end{align} Complex interpolation works well on the class of Sobolev spaces H^{s}_{p} (the Bessel potential spaces) as well as Besov spaces: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\left (H^{s_0}_{p_0}, H^{s_1}_{p_1} \\\\right )_\\\\theta &= H^{s_\\\\theta}_{p_\\\\theta}, && s_0 e s_1, 1 < p_0, p_1 < \\\\infty. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left (B^{s_0}_{p_0,q_0}, B^{s_1}_{p_1,q_1} \\\\right)_\\\\theta &= B^{s_\\\\theta}_{p_\\\\theta, q_\\\\theta}, && s_0 e s_1. \\\\end{align} Real interpolation between Sobolev spaces may give Besov spaces, except when , :\\\\left (H^{s}_{p_0}, H^{s}_{p_1} \\\\right)_{\\\\theta, p_\\\\theta} = H^{s}_{p_\\\\theta}. When but , real interpolation between Sobolev spaces gives a Besov space: :\\\\left (H^{s_0}_p, H^{s_1}_p \\\\right)_{\\\\theta, q} = B^{s_\\\\theta}_{p, q}, \\\\qquad s_0 e s_1. Also, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\left (B^{s_0}_{p,q_0}, B^{s_1}_{p,q_1} \\\\right)_{\\\\theta, q} &= B^{s_\\\\theta}_{p,q}, && s_0 e s_1. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left (B^s_{p,q_0}, B^s_{p, q_1} \\\\right )_{\\\\theta, q} &= B^{s}_{p, q_\\\\theta}. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left (B^{s_0}_{p_0,q_0}, B^{s_1}_{p_1,q_1} \\\\right )_{\\\\theta, q_\\\\theta} &= B^{s_\\\\theta}_{p_\\\\theta, q_\\\\theta}, && s_0 e s_1, p_\\\\theta =q_\\\\theta. \\\\end{align}  See also  *Riesz‚ÄìThorin theorem * Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem  Notes  References  *. *. *. *. *Leoni, Giovanni (2017).

The ship was constructed in 1973 for use as an oil field service vessel. The ship sank 23 March 2008, after reporting progressive flooding only hours earlier. Of the 47 on board, 42 were rescued. Of the five fatalities, four were recovered dead, and one was never found. The Coast Guard was initially misinformed about the number of persons on board the vessel, and secured the search with one crew member still unaccounted for. After realizing there was still one person missing, the Coast Guard reinstated the search, but did not find the crew member. Sinking According to the United States NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board), the triggering event in the sinking was the loss of one of the two rudders. This allowed water to pour into the rudder room by way of the 9-inch diameter rudder trunk. The marine architect designed the opening of the rudder trunks to be above the waterline so that water would not enter the rudder room should a rudder fall out. However, United Marine Shipbuilding changed the ship from an oil well service vessel to a fishing vessel in 1988. The changes raised the waterline 2.5 feet. This put the rudder trunk openings below the water line. The ceiling of the rudder room was only 20 inches above the trunk openings. Flooding of the rudder room should not have sunk the ship since there was a watertight bulkhead. The NTSB can only speculate that the door was left open, the seals or latching dogs failed, or that the holes cut in the bulkhead for refrigeration lines needed for fish processing were not watertight. If the conversion had installed a watertight bulkhead between sections of the fish processing area the ship would not have sunk. Whatever the reason, the water flooded the engine room. At some point the water level became high enough to short out the main electrical distribution panel. This caused the loss of electrical power throughout the ship. Other experts suspect that modifications made to the housing surrounding the propeller failed due to poor installing causing the rapid flooding. Evidence of the failure is shown through maintenance records indicating multiple repairs on the propeller housing where it joins the hull. The ship had variable-pitch propellers. This means the captain can keep the diesel engines at a constant RPM needed for the ac electrical generators, and use the variable pitch to change vessel speed or reverse direction. The variable-pitch propellers used a hydraulic actuation system. As designed, there was one electrical hydraulic pump and one engine- driven mechanical hydraulic pump for each propeller. In 1989, Transmarine Propulsion Systems replaced both mechanical pumps with electric pumps, saying they could not get parts for the mechanical pumps. With electrical power lost, all 4 hydraulic pumps stopped. With no hydraulic pressure, hydrodynamic forces on the propellers caused the pitch to reverse. This made the ship run full astern. The rearward motion of the vessel drove the sinking aft section further under water. It also exacerbated water entry into the air intake vents on the trawl deck. The captain of Alaska Ranger died in the sinking so it is unknown why he did not stop the diesel engines. The Coast Guard had tested the engine emergency shutoff system a year before the sinking and reported that it functioned properly. The vessel moving full astern meant that two of the three inflatable liferafts were separated from the ship. This meant that 25 crew members that had jumped into the water never got to one of the three liferafts. United States Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation The United States Coast Guard also investigated the sinking through a Marine Board of Investigation. The Marine Board's Report of Investigation determined a different scenario related to the cause of the casualty. The Marine Board reviewed thousands of pages of documents and photographs related to the maintenance and repair of the vessel, and examined in-depth the installation of the Kort nozzles. The Marine Board also examined in detail the rudder installation.http://www.myballard.com/2011/01/13/coast-guard-releases-report- on-deadly-sinking-of-alaska-ranger/ As a result of this analysis the report concluded that > \\"Though the exact initiating event that created the source of flooding is > unknown, it was likely related to the poor material condition of the vessel > and may have been related to the Kort nozzle struts which are believed to > have experienced excessive stresses where they were attached to the hull.\\" The report added that the owners of the ship \\"failed to properly maintain the structural condition of the Alaska Ranger\\". Crew rescue The unexpected and unexplained flooding of the ship meant that the crew had to abandon the vessel at night, into the frigid waters of the Bering Sea. Radio pleas for help were forwarded to a US Coast Guard vessel, which moved toward the area while dispatching helicopters. By the end of the effort, 42 of the 47-person crew had been located and brought safely to shore, most suffering severe hypothermia. The rescue was carried out by a USCG HH-60 Jayhawk which was stationed on Saint Paul Island, AK and a HH-65 Dolphin which was attached to the USCGC Douglas Munro, which rescued 20 people, and 22 were rescued by Alaska Ranger‚Äôs sister ship FV Alaska Warrior.Key sinking issue: why water spread.

Formed in 2006, the band originally featured vocalist and guitarist Deron Miller and drummer Tim Yeung, with bassist Risha Eryavac and guitarist Luke Jaeger completing the four-piece lineup in 2007. The group released its debut album Tactical in July 2011, which featured contributions from guitarist James Murphy. Following the release of the album, Eryavac and Yeung left World Under Blood, to be replaced by current bassist and drummer Kyle Konkiel and Mike Heller, respectively. However, since 2012 the band has remained largely inactive, due in part to Miller's return to focus on his other bands, CKY and Foreign Objects, as well as the busy schedules of other band members. History=2006‚Äì2009: Early years and demos= The formation of World Under Blood was officially announced in October 2006 by vocalist and guitarist Deron Miller, who revealed to music news website Blabbermouth.net that he was working with drummer Tim Yeung, producer and engineer Logan Mader, and guitarist and mixing engineer James Murphy on the project. Describing the style of the band, Miller explained that the songs he had written for World Under Blood constituted \\"the most honest and brutal material [he'd] ever written\\". By the following month, the band's frontman revealed that a three- song demo was nearing completion, and would feature tracks named \\"Under the Autumn Low\\", \\"God Among the Waste\\", and \\"Dead and Still in Pain\\". World Under Blood released its first recording, \\"Dead and Still in Pain\\", on its MySpace page on November 29, 2006. After a few months of inactivity, \\"A God Among the Waste\\", was released in March 2007, which was eventually followed by the final of the three revealed tracks, \\"Under the Autumn Low\\", in September. In June 2007, it was revealed that Decrepit Birth bassist Risha Eryavac had joined the band, and it was later announced that Sleep Terror guitarist Luke Jaeger would complete the group's lineup. World Under Blood returned to the studio in April 2008 to record four new tracks for its debut album, including a cover version of Megadeth's \\"Wake Up Dead\\". =2009‚Äìpresent: Tactical and future= After more than a year of no updates (due to Miller's return to CKY to record Carver City), in May 2009 it was revealed that World Under Blood had signed with German heavy metal record label Nuclear Blast Records. The band continued working on its debut album throughout 2009 and 2010, with a tentative release date of July 2010 originally scheduled. The track listing for the album, titled Tactical, was revealed in February 2010, and by March it was noted that recording for the release had been completed. As Miller had returned to working with CKY again, for the album B-Sides & Rarities, the release of Tactical was pushed back to July 2011. Upon its release, the album sold around 900 copies in the United States in its first week, reaching number 32 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. In September 2011, it was revealed that Eryavac had been replaced by former In This Moment bassist Kyle Konkiel, and that Yeung had also left the band, with a replacement drummer yet to be appointed. Yeung's replacement was revealed in the form of Malignancy drummer Mike Heller in March 2012. The band released a music video for Tactical track \\"Into the Arms of Cruelty\\" in September 2012. In 2013 it was claimed that the band would be releasing its second album, titled Tetanus Invasive, although as of 2018 this has yet to be released. In a 2015 interview, Miller stated that he was working on a number of new World Under Blood tracks, indicating that he intended to record an album before the end of the year. The following year, Miller revealed that the band would be working on two albums in 2016: Life Is Too Long to Like You, which he described as \\"a therapeutic death metal record; dead serious, with a touch of dark humor\\", and Tetanus Invasive, on which he claimed he was hoping Yeung, Jaeger and Eryavec would perform. Style and songwriting Upon the completion of World Under Blood's debut album, frontman Deron Miller explained that the intention of the band was to create \\"super- fast, extremely brutal and harsh, catchy, melodic, and occasionally offensive and disturbing\\" music. To this end, he has also praised the individual members of the group, stating that each band member brought something to the project in order to make Tactical \\"as sickening and dispicable [sic] as possible\\". Guitarist and producer James Murphy claimed that the band \\"bridge[s] a gap between genres that has never been bridged ... fusing brutal, blasting death metal with a melodic American rock vibe\\". On Tactical, all songwriting is credited to Miller alone, with Yeung assisting with the songs' arrangements. The lyrics on the album deal with a number of different topics, including mental disorders (\\"Pyro-Compulsive\\", \\"Dead and Still in Pain\\" and \\"Under the Autumn Low\\"), politics (\\"A God Among the Waste\\"), child abuse (\\"Into the Arms of Cruelty\\"), crime and punishment (\\"Purgatory Dormitory\\"), religion (\\"I Can't Stand His Name\\") and cancer (\\"Revere's Tears\\").

In chill filtering, whisky is cooled to between , often roughly , and passed through a fine adsorption filter. This is done mostly for cosmetic reasons ‚Äì to remove cloudiness ‚Äì rather than to improve taste or consistency. Method Chill filtering prevents the whisky from becoming hazy when in the bottle, when served, when chilled, or when water or ice is added, as well as precluding sedimentation from occurring in the bottles. It works by reducing the temperature sufficiently so that some fatty acids, proteins and esters (created during the distillation process) precipitate out and are caught on the filter. Single malt whiskeys are usually chilled down to 0¬∞C, while the temperature for blended whiskey tends to be lower because they have lower levels of fatty acid. Factors affecting the chill filtering process include the temperature, number of filters used, and speed at which the whiskey is passed through the filters. The slower the process and the more filters used, the more impurities will be collected, but at increasing cost. Because this process is believed to sometimes affect the taste of the whisky, for example, by removing peat particles that contribute to the smokiness of the flavor, some distilleries pride themselves on not using this process. Non-chill- filtered whisky is often advertised as being more \\"natural\\", \\"authentic\\", or \\"old-fashioned\\". For example, the Aberlour Distillery's distinctively flavored A'bunadh whisky, Laphroaig's Quarter Cask bottles, and all of Springbank distillery's whiskies are not chill-filtered and are advertised as such.

Built in 1754, possibly using parts of an older house, it is one of the town's older surviving structures, made further notable by several of its inhabitants. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 31, 1983.  Description and history  The Amos Fuller House stands in what is now a residential area of central Needham, on the northeast side of Nehoiden Street nearly opposite its junction with Newell Avenue. It is set well back from the road on a parcel over in size, with a 19th-century barn to one side. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof. An ell extends to the rear, and an enclosed porch extends to the side. The rear right side of the house includes a \\"Beverly jog\\", or projecting section that extends part of the rear roof line. The house originally had a central chimney, which was removed in the late 19th century. The house was built in 1754 by Amos Fuller, the son of Thomas Fuller, one of Needham's first settlers. It was built on the site of the elder Fuller's house, and may include timbers from an older building. Amos Fuller served the town as a selectman and in the state legislature. His son Reuben sold the house in 1830 to Rev. William Ritchie, who oversaw a modernization of its interior; the barn also appears to date from this period. Artemas Newell (for whose family Newell Avenue is named) purchased the property in 1852; he was a prominent local attorney. Augustus Newell, who owned the property in the late 19th century, was among the first in the region to manufacture concrete blocks.

The highway's southern terminus is in Shoshone, and its northern is near Challis. It is designated as one of Idaho's scenic byways and provides access to Sawtooth National Recreation Area. It primarily follows the Big Wood River in the south and the main Salmon River in the north, divided by Galena Summit. Route description State Highway 75 begins at a junction with US-93 on Greenwood Street in Shoshone at an elevation of just under above sea level. The highway heads northward, and ascends the Big Wood River valley, into Blaine County, past the Magic Reservoir to the west and crosses US-20 at Timmerman Junction at . It continues northward as the Sawtooth Scenic Byway to pass through the Big Wood River communities of Bellevue, Hailey, and Ketchum. Sun Valley is accessible via a spur route junction in Ketchum at Third Street, which becomes Sun Valley Road. Seven miles (11 km) north of Ketchum, the highway passes by the headquarters of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area at and the Boulder Mountains to the north, with peaks over . SH-75 climbs past the Galena Lodge to the Galena Summit at , then descends to the scenic viewpoint about a mile later, which overlooks the Sawtooth Mountains to the west and headwaters of the Salmon River in the Sawtooth Valley.

At Stanley, the highway intersects with the northern terminus of State Highway 21, the Ponderosa Pine Scenic Byway from Boise, through Idaho City and Lowman. The junction is at and Highway 75 northbound becomes the Salmon River Scenic Byway, continuing north for a mile, then veering east and descending with the twisty river towards Clayton. Both then head north towards Challis, where the route terminates and rejoins US-93 just south of the city limits, at an elevation of . History In 1824, while searching the mountain wilderness of what is presentday Idaho, known to them as Columbia District, for beaver, Alexander Ross came up the Wood River and discovered Galena Summit on September 18. Leading a large brigade of Hudson's Bay Company trappers, he wondered if he could get through unknown mountains and rocky defiles that obstructed his passage back to his base of operations at present Challis. Unwilling to turn back he pressed on to explore Stanley Basin and the difficult canyon beyond.

During the intervening years, the composer completed Job: A Masque for Dancing and began work on his Fourth Symphony. The concerto shares some thematic characteristics with these works, as well as some of their drama and turbulence. Structure #Toccata: Allegro moderato - Largamente - Cadenza #:The concerto begins with driving, energetic music from the soloist set against a threatening, rising theme in the orchestra. A faster, more scherzo-like idea, shared out equally between piano and orchestra, soon contrasts against the opening music. These two blocks of music alternate, forming the basis of the entire movement. It is as though the traditional dialogue between soloist and orchestra has been supplanted by a more generalised dialogue of musical types. At the movement's climax, a brief and thunderous piano solo is joined by the full orchestra. However, the orchestra suddenly cuts off to leave the piano musing alone in a short lyrical cadenza. This leads without a break into the slow movement. #Romanza: Lento #:The Romanza is more delicate, providing the listener with hints of Vaughan Williams's previous studies with Maurice Ravel. Vaughan Williams here quoted the theme from the Epilogue of the third movement of Arnold Bax's Symphony No. 3. Baxworks #Fuga chromatica con Finale alla Tedesca #:Again without a pause from the previous music, the closing movement begins with a fugue that is linked to a waltz finale by flights of virtuosity from the piano soloist. It closes with the ensemble repeating themes from the first two movements, and then abruptly closes. Overview The work was premiered on 1 February 1933 by Harriet Cohen, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra directed by Sir Adrian Boult. The Finale was edited shortly thereafter and the work was published in 1936. The concerto was not well received at first, being considered unrewarding to the soloist. Though the piece provides ample opportunity for virtuosity in all movements, Vaughan Williams treated the piano as a percussion instrument, as did B√©la Bart√≥k and Paul Hindemith during this period, with the texture at times impenetrably thick.Kennedy, 262. While the concerto was rated highly by some‚ÄîBart√≥k, for one, was extremely impressed‚ÄîVaughan Williams took the advice of well-meaning friends and colleagues and reworked the piece into a Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra, adding more texture to the piano parts with the assistance of Joseph Cooper in 1946.Achenbach, 1.

He is commonly regarded as the first territorial governor to be a resident of Arizona at the time of his appointment and was the only bachelor to hold the position. Wolfley's political career was marred by his almost complete lack of political skill. Much of his time as governor was spent in political infighting, which eventually led to his resignation. Background Wolfley was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Lewis and Elanor (Irwin) Wolfley. When he was a young child, his father died, and Wolfley grew up near the border of Ohio and Kentucky. His mother's family, the Ewings of Ohio, arranged for his education which included the study of civil engineering and possibly law. As a young man he worked for railroads operating in Iowa and Ohio. During the American Civil War, Wolfley became a member of the Union Army's 3rd Kentucky Cavalry. He served with distinction, earning the nickname \\"Sherman's Fighting Major\\", and at the end of the war was encouraged by General William T. Sherman to remain with the Regular Army at his war-time rank. Wolfley left the Army with the rank of lieutenant colonel and became a federal revenue officer in New Orleans. In 1872 Wolfley was mining in Colorado, and he also worked in the District of Columbia before moving to Arizona Territory in the early 1880s. In Arizona he worked as a civil engineer performing surveying work on public lands. He gained a reputation as a respected person but due to the large amount of time spent working in the field was not well known. Governorship When Republican President Benjamin Harrison took office, he desired to replace Democratic Governor C. Meyer Zulick with a member of his own political party. Newspaper reports indicated fifteen to sixteen serious candidates were considered for the post, among them being former Governor Anson P.K. Safford and Territorial Delegate Curtis C. Bean. Wolfley applied for the position directly to Harrison two days after the presidential inauguration. The application letter included information on Wolfley's war record, his six years of living in the territory, and a reminder that the Republican platform called for territorial officials to be drawn from the territory. Wolfley supporters included Generals William T. Sherman, Nelson A. Miles, and John Schofield along with U.S. Senator John Sherman, Russell A. Alger, James G. Blaine, and Secretary of the Interior John W. Noble. Opposition to his nomination came from U.S. Senator J. Donald Cameron of Pennsylvania. The senator's nephew, Brewster Cameron of the San Rafael Cattle Company, had a previous billing dispute with Wolfley over a surveying job the nominee had done for the Arizona cattleman. Despite the opposition, Wolfley received unanimous confirmation from the U.S. Senate on March 28 and was sworn in as Governor of Arizona Territory on April 8, 1889. The first issue that Wolfley faced as Governor was dealing with appointment of territorial officers. Democratic Governor Zulick, as part of his normal duties, had submitted a full slate of nominations to the 15th Arizona Territorial Legislature. The Republican controlled legislature rejected Zulick's nominations and postponed adjournment after learning of Wolfley's nomination in order to allow the new governor to appoint his own candidates. Many of the Democratic nominees refused to surrender their offices, arguing that the territorial legislature had exceeded their authorized session limit of 60 days prior to confirmation of the Republican nominees and that the Governor could only make recess appointments following the death or resignation of a current office holder. As a result, Arizona Territory effectively had two sets of territorial officers with the Democratic office holders, due to their earlier appointment, controlling the buildings and records needed to perform various duties. The territorial government's ability to function was severely impacted by the two sets of territorial officials. As an early step in resolving the issue, a lawsuit was filed to declare the Republican nominee for Territorial Treasurer the legitimate office holder. The court ruled in favor of the Republican nominee, but the details of the ruling left other Republican nominees reluctant to also file suit. While the courts eventually ruled in favor of Wolfley's appointments, it was his administration's withholding of salary payments that eventually forced all the Democratic nominees to surrender their offices. Wolfley's problems with infighting also extended to members of his own party. William Christy, an unsuccessful candidate for the governorship, worked with a group of supporters to remove the Governor from office. Wolfley was also perturbed by his political opponents receiving federal appointments. An example was George Christ, who assisted Brewster Cameron in opposing Wolfley's nomination, being appointed collector of customs in Nogales, Arizona. Another was the appointment of Richard E. Sloan as judge in Arizona Territory's First Judicial District. Wolfley initially supported this appointment but change position after Sloan made Brewster Cameron his clerk. The primary accomplishment of the Wolfley administration was refinancing the territorial debt. The lower interest rate obtained by the refinancing reduced annual interest payments by US$59,006.40 per year. In an effort to reduce transportation related price disparities between different parts of Arizona, he lobbied for creation of new railroads to connect the northern and southern halves of the territory. The governor also faced several event driven concerns. The possible return of Chiricahua Apache to Arizona became an issue following their move from Florida to Alabama by the Federal government. After several possible locations were considered, the Apache were finally settled at Fort Sill in the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). Continued migration of Mormon settlers into the territory, with their tendency to vote as a unified block, worried Wolfley to the point that he called them \\"a most dangerous and unscrupulous factor in politics\\". Finally James Reavis, with his fraudulent claim of a land grant in excess of , caused a disruption that took till 1904 to completely settle. By the end of 1889, most of the territory's newspapers were calling for Wolfley's removal. To counteract the hostilities of these papers and his political enemies, Wolfley helped found The Arizona Republican as a forum to express his views. His efforts were not enough to save his job. After being asked for his resignation, Wolfley submitted his letter of resignation on August 20, 1890. After office After his resignation, Wolfley moved to Prescott and worked as a civil engineer and surveyor. One project Wolfley worked on was surveying of along the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad's right of way. Another projects was an earthworks dam on the Gila River. After nearly $750,000 had been spent building the dam, a flood washed out the work. During the subsequent legal proceeding, Wolfley demanded all justices on the supreme court be removed following an adverse ruling. Wolfey made another request to become governor in 1897, but was not nominated by President William McKinley. By 1908, he had moved to Los Angeles, California, where he attempted to use ocean waves to generate electricity. Wolfley died on February 12, 1910, after being struck by a streetcar. He was buried in Prescott's I.O.O.F. Cemetery.

The house, built in the early 16th century in the Alfama neighbourhood, has a curious fa√ßade of spikes, influenced by Italian Renaissance palaces and Portuguese Manueline styles. It survived the disastrous 1755 Lisbon earthquake that destroyed much of the city, but over time was abandoned as a residence and used as a warehouse. After a 20th- century renovation, it became the headquarters of the Jos√© Saramago Foundation and a location of the Museum of Lisbon. History A view along the Tagus River, c. 1730, showing the area in Santa Maria Maior and the Casa dos Bicos (tenth from the right in front of the right square) A public image from between 1910-1920, published in Lisboa Velha (Afonso Lopes Vieira), showing the former codfish warehouse in 1925 The historical record indicates that as of 1506, Afonso de Albuquerque, the first governor of Portuguese India, had buildings in the area, if not ownership of the lands. In 1521, Albuquerque travelled to Italy in the company of the Infanta Beatrice, Duchess of Savoy, and spent some years there, where he observed the new trends in Renaissance architecture. The young Albuquerque, a courtier recognized for his humanist cultural leanings, was responsible for the construction of the Quinta da Bacalh√¥a. It is presumed that he was influenced by urban palaces such as the Palazzo dei Diamanti (in Ferrara), so called in reference to its fa√ßade made up of thousands of small diamond-shaped pyramids. Between 1521 and 1523, Albuquerque returned to Portugal, and began work on this Casa dos Diamantes (House of Diamonds), incorporating Manueline (Portuguese late Gothic architecture) windows and portals, but died in 1581. Between 1620 and 1642, after a protracted period of litigation within the family, the house passed into the hands of Jo√£o Afonso de Albuquerque. The building was still in the possession of his heirs, the Menezes e Albuquerque family, when the 1755 Lisbon earthquake caused significant damage to the residence. It destroyed the principal fa√ßade (which was oriented to face the Rua Afonso de Albuquerque), and two floors along the Rua dos Bacalhoeiros. It is unclear whether or not the building was completely reconstructed following this period, but by 1772 the building was partially reconstructed, but the 15th century structure had been profoundly restructured. In 1827, Francisco Menezes e Albuquerque, owing to debts, allowed the house to be sold at public auction. It was sold to Caetano Lopes da Silva, a fishmonger, then a renter in the home. In 1838 the residence was returned to the Albuquerque family by a judicial decision. In 1873, the 11th and last Duke of Albuquerque, owing to debts, sold the building to another fishmonger, Joaquim C. Lopes da Silva, who began using the building as a warehouse for salted codfish. The building remained in private hands until the 1960s, when it was acquired by the municipal council of Lisbon. The council commissioned architect Raul Lino to adapt the Casa dos Bicos, then known as the Casa de Goa, for use as a museum. The project was still unrealized by 1979, and passed to architects Jos√© Daniel Santa-Rita Fernandes and Manuel Vicente. Once again, the project was never completed, and in 1982, the commissioner for the 18th European Art, Science and Culture Exposition (XVII Exposi√ß√£o Europeia de Arte, Ci√™ncia e Cultura) commissioned Ant√≥nio Marques Miguel to restore and adapt the spaces for the event. The restoration began under the guidance of the Direc√ß√£o-Geral de Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGEMN). A team of archeologists began systematic excavations at the construction site, revealing remains from the Roman and Moorish periods. The two floors destroyed during the 1755 earthquake were restored, using the pre-1755 drawings and paintings; these included a Renaissance loggia along the third floor and Manueline-style windows. In the following year, architect Ant√≥nio Marques Miguel was responsible for restoration of the windows and fa√ßade. Following the public works, it became one of the nuclei of the European Art, Science and Cultural Exposition, exhibiting paintings of the Avis dynastic family. On 22 August 2006, the Dire√ß√£o Regional de Cultura de Lisboa (DRC Lisboa) incorporated the building in the Special Protection Zone that included the Pombaline downtown area, as well as the Castle of S√£o Jorge, its walls and surrounding buildings. The Conselho Nacional de Cultura (National Council for Culture) proposed that the Special Protection Zone should be archived on 10 October 2011, and on 18 October asked the director of the Instituto de Gest√£o do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico e Arqueol√≥gico (IGESPAR) to define a new Special Protection Zone. In June 2012, the Casa dos Bicos became the head office of the Jos√© Saramago Foundation, whose statutes were updated to reflect its new status as a public foundation, by an agreement with the Lisbon city council. The foundation opened a permanent exhibition titled The Seed and the Fruits about the life and public works of Jos√© Saramago. Other cultural events are presented in the building, including book releases, minor theater plays, talks and debates. Architecture Detail of the front fa√ßade and varanda Detail of the front fa√ßade The Casa dos Bicos is situated along the northern side of the urban area, contiguous with other buildings and identifiable by the surface treatment of its fa√ßade. It is a rectangular building of four floors, with irregular fenestrations (windows) and a tiled roof. The principal fa√ßade, to the south, is decorated in diamond-shape protrusions. The floors are demarcated by frames that run along the fa√ßade. The first and second floors are framed by doors and windows in stonework; the first floor includes four simple doorways of varying dimensions and asymmetrical distribution (some rectangular, while two doors marked by convex arcs). On the second floor are four rectangular windows of varying dimensions and asymmetrical distribution. The third and fourth floors are marked by windows of varying dimensions and asymmetrical placement, using stylized single, double and triple rounded windows. Two styles of windows prevail on these floors: simple rounded-arch windows (a triple-frame on the third floor and two double-framed windows on the fourth floor) and styled curvilinear windows, based on Manueline elements. The interior has been substantially altered from its early conceptions, and includes a steep, clear marble staircase with bold lines and contrasting black walls.

Though never got married and never had children, caring for the children of others was always her favorite way to spend time. vehemently argued against the prohibition of prostitution in Japan. She stated that although no-one became a prostitute to enjoy it, it was merely human instinct to find a way to make a living when no other venues were open. Although she agreed it was probably well-intentioned, stated that she could not have survived if sex work had not been an option for her. Furthermore, she argued that simply banning prostitution would not stop people from engaging in it, as people who wanted it would inevitably find ways. Reception Although finished second in the writing competition, after writing Autobiography of a Geisha, was harshly criticised by her community, and eventually had to move to another town. Largely because of this, she almost always communicated with people through her publisher, emphasising that her goal was only to tell her story and never to become famous. She refused to meet with most people interested in discussing her book. Upon its translation into English, the book received positive reviews from anthropologist Liza Dalby and author Arthur Golden, as well as several other book reviewers. Despite academic reviews, the book has been largely ignored in many publications about geisha. In her autobiography Geisha, a Life (also known as Geisha of ), published in 2002, claims to be the first geisha to come forward to tell her story.

Washington Informer. August 6, 1981. p. 1. Without sufficient valid signatures, the referendum was not on the November ballot.

Cable TV\\". The Washington Post. December 29, 1982. p. C5.Sherwood, Tom. \\"D.C. Commission Asks Extension Of Cable Study\\". The Washington Post. February 15, 1983. p. C2. The Council gave the Commission 90 days to write the request for proposal, but the Commission asked for another six months to complete it. Lightfoot was opposed to the additional time, saying it unnecessarily delayed the awarding of a cable franchise. The Commission released the request for proposal in July 1983. The Commission determined that there should be minimum offering of 60 channels for residents and 25 channels for businesses and governmental agencies.Teeley, Sandra Evans. \\"Approval of 60-Channel Cable System With Few Changes Predicted for City\\". The Washington Post. July 6, 1983. p. D3.

Gibson had been a commissioner of the District of Columbia Board of Parole; a community organizer for the United Planning Organization and the Washington Urban League; and a staff member for the District of Columbia Board of Education, the District of Columbia Office of Personnel, and the Department of Housing and Community Development. Gibson said he was surprised that Lightfoot had decided to run because he was under the impression that Lightfood had said he would support his campaign. Gibson speculated that perhaps someone had mistakenly told Lightfoot that Gibson would not actually run for the office. Lightfoot dropped out the following month, saying, \\"By remaining in the race, I would have split votes with Mr. Gibson, who shares my views on the issues. ...

Lightfoot introduced a bill that would eliminate that strategy by including donations by corporations and partnerships in each owner's total maximum donation.

It is commonly called papel√≠o and algodoncillo.Felger, Johnson, & Wilson, p. 133 Description The branches and trunk, in diameter, are erect to ascending, making it more tall than wide. Large, flaky, papery, gray plates cover its smooth, white bark. Young twigs, petioles, and flower axils sometimes have short, tiny hairs, but are mostly glabrous. The crown is spread out and sparse. The leaves, exstipulate and 2-6 cm in length, alternate and vary in shape between lanceolate, elliptic, and obovate. Flowers tend to be 7.5-8 mm wide, white to cream colored, bisexual, with 5 petals on 5 sepals, and arranged in axillary cyme. The fruits, 1‚Äì1.4 cm across, are papery, one- seeded, three-lobed samaras, similar to species of Dodonaea. Wimmeria mexicana mass flowers around July to October, or often after heavy Autumn rain, attracting a large number of insects, particularly bees and flies. The leaves have serrated edges due to insects. Uses Wood from the tree is commonly used to make fence posts, house beams, and firelogs. Also, the Guarij√≠o prepare herbal tea, malo en el cuerpo (pain in the body), from W. mexicana, chamomile, and cilantro. Taxonomy Wimmeria confusa, a synonym of W. mexicana, was so named because it had been previously confused with Wimmeria concolor and was so figured in William Hooker's Icones Plantarum. W. confusa was named by William Hemsley in 1878, based on a plant collected by Karl Hartweg. The same year, Ludwig Radlkofer described W. pallida, based on the same Hartweg specimen as well as specimens collected by Thadd√§us Haenke (perhaps in Acapulco) and Frederik Liebmann. This was confusingly also called W. confusa in Biologia Centrali-Americana.Contributions from the U. S.

Background When performing a linear regression with a single independent variable, a scatter plot of the response variable against the independent variable provides a good indication of the nature of the relationship. If there is more than one independent variable, things become more complicated. Although it can still be useful to generate scatter plots of the response variable against each of the independent variables, this does not take into account the effect of the other independent variables in the model. Definition Partial residual plots are formed as: : \\\\mathrm{Residuals} + \\\\hat{\\\\beta}_iX_i \\\\mathrm{\\\\ versus\\\\ } X_i where :Residuals = residuals from the full model :\\\\hat{\\\\beta}_i = regression coefficient from the ith independent variable in the full model :Xi = the ith independent variable Partial residual plots are widely discussed in the regression diagnostics literature (e.g., see the References section below). Although they can often be useful, they can also fail to indicate the proper relationship. In particular, if Xi is highly correlated with any of the other independent variables, the variance indicated by the partial residual plot can be much less than the actual variance. These issues are discussed in more detail in the references given below. CCPR plot The CCPR (component and component- plus-residual) plot is a refinement of the partial residual plot, adding : \\\\hat{\\\\beta}_iX_i \\\\mathrm{\\\\ versus\\\\ } X_i.

Therefore, the Counts of Vimioso were closely related to the Braganzas. This title was created on February 2, 1515, by King Manuel I of Portugal for his 3rd cousin, Francisco de Portugal (Francis of Portugal), also known as Francis I, 1st Count of Vimioso, a natural son of Alphonse of Portugal, Bishop of √âvora. The House of the Counts of Vimioso had also close links with the Portuguese Royal family, as members of the King's Council, ambassadors, and viceroys. The 2nd Count, Alphonse I of Portugal, joined King Sebastian in his crusade in Morocco, and died there (during the Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir in 1578 or, according to others, imprisoned by the moors after the battle). This was one of the few Portuguese high aristocracy families to support Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato against Philip II of Spain claims, during the War of the Portuguese Succession (1580‚Äì1583). The 3rd Count, Dom Francisco de Portugal (Francis II), was appointed Ant√≥nio Constable, leading the Portuguese armies in the Battle of Alc√¢ntara (1580); he found death, two years later, in the naval Battle of Vila Franca, off S√£o Miguel Island, in the Azores. The family supported the 1640 revolution against the Spanish Habsburgs, receiving a new title from the Braganzas (Marquis of Aguiar, in 1643). In 1687, the 7th Count, Dom Miguel de Portugal (Michael of Portugal), died without legitimate issue. To avoid that such an illustrious family would be extinct, the King Pedro II of Portugal, through a special decree, issued on December 13, 1681, legitimated the count's natural son, Francisco de Paula (or Francis III), as 8th Count, giving him all his father's honours and titles. During the romantic period, the 13th Count of Vimioso (1817‚Äì1865) was quite a popular personality not only among aristocracy but also throughout the Portuguese society: he was a remarkable horse-rider, participating in bullfightings, with a bohemian life style; his mistress was the quite known fado singer, Maria Severa, and the story was later popularized by literature, music (the famous Fado do Conde de Vimioso), theatre and movies (A Severa).

Family name The Counts' family name was de Portugal, as they descended from King John I of Portugal. In the late 17th Century, the 8th Count, Francisco de Paula, also known as Francis III, joined the name Castro, given that he had inherited from an aunt properties and titles belonging to the Castro family and, from then on, the Counts bore de Portugal e Castro (of Portugal and Castro) as their family name. In the late 19th Century, the Counts' family name became Sousa Coutinho, due to the marriage of Maria Jos√© de Portugal e Castro, the 13th Count's heir, with Fernando Luis de Sousa Coutinho (Marquis of Borba).

He served in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II from 1944 to 1946, seeing action in New Guinea and being discharged with the rank of leading aircraftman. Prior to entering politics, he was superintendent of the waterside employment bureau of the Australian Stevedoring Authority for sixteen years. He was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1961 federal election, defeating Liberal Party minister Alan Hulme. His defeat of Hulme in what had been regarded as a safe Liberal seat was viewed as a surprise. During his time in parliament, he opened a drive-in constituent service with the slogan \\"Call on Reg\\", which saw more than 1000 visits in eighteen months. O'Brien was outspoken around employment issues, especially on the wharves: he argued that employment was a government responsibility which the Menzies government was placing on citizens, and suggested that the federal government establish an authority to take over the employment of waterside workers (which was attacked by the government as an attempt to \\"socialise\\" the waterfront) and criticised the practice of disproportionately fining unionists compared to employers for industrial breaches. He was defeated by Hulme at a rematch at the following election in 1963. Following his defeat, he went to work as a clerk for Patrick Stevedoring.

The Douglas DC-6B plane crashed near 100 Mile House, British Columbia, taking the lives of all 52 aboard.. Retrieved on July 25, 2008. An inquest determined that the explosion was the result of a bomb, but the crime remains unsolved.  Incident  While en route from Vancouver to Prince George the DC-6 Empress of City of Buenos Aires, piloted by World War II veteran John 'Jack' Steele, crashed after passing Ashcroft, British Columbia. About 15:40, three mayday calls were heard by air traffic control in Vancouver. An explosion had occurred in the left aft lavatory. The tail separated from the fuselage. The aircraft spiralled and crashed into a wooded area. All 46 passengers and 6 crew perished. The crash site is west of 100 Mile House. Remnants of the DC-6 remain at the crash site near Dog Creek.  Aftermath  A coroner's inquest concluded \\"an explosive substance foreign to the normal contents of the aircraft\\" caused the crash. A witness on the ground saw the tail of the aircraft separate from the fuselage and debris trail out behind the aircraft. The debris turned out to be the bodies of passengers forced out by the depressurization of the aircraft. The fuselage was consumed by fire where it fell but the tail, found 500 metres away, was not. Rescue crews reached the crash site while the fire continued to burn but no survivors were found. Crash investigators found traces of acid that led them to believe a bomb in the lavatory was involved. Traces of potassium nitrate and carbon, consistent with a \\"low-velocity explosion\\" were found. Gunpowder or stumping powder causes a low-velocity explosion. The explosion damaged bulkheads in the lavatory, severed pipes in the tail and tore a metre-wide hole in the side of the fuselage. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation focused on four passengers although none was a suspect. No one claimed responsibility and no charges were ever laid. The source of the explosion remains unknown. 2018 investigation The crash was re-examined by experts during six episodes of the second season of the CBC true crime podcast Uncover.

The film is notable for the unauthorized use of footage of Greta Garbo, in what turned out to be the legendary actress's final appearance on film. Set in Paris during springtime, Adam & Yves is about the French Yves (Marcus Giovanni) and his pursuit of the American tourist Adam (Michael Hardwick). The men have a brief affair, but a long-lasting relationship is prevented by Yves' insistence that they not share personal information.Adam & Yves review, Film Threat While making the film, director Peter de Rome reportedly stalked Greta Garbo around New York City, where the retired star was living. After much searching, De Rome located her and was able to shoot footage of Garbo walking across First Avenue. The footage was inserted into Adam & Yves, and its presence was explained by having Adam recalling how he once saw the elusive star. The Garbo footage was used without the star's knowledge or permission, and she was not paid for her appearance.
