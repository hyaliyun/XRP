The Vologne near Deycimont, slightly above the confluence with the Barba Flooding of the Vologne can also be significant. Thus the maximum instantaneous flow rate recorded was on 9 April 1983, while the maximum daily average flow rate was the following day. The instantaneous maximal flowrate 2 (IMFR2) and IMFR5 metrics were respectively. The IMFR10, or flow rate calculated from the 10-year flood, is , the IMFR20 is and the IMFR50 was . These values are of the order of a fifth of those of the Meurthe, and thus comparable when one takes into account the respective extents of their watersheds. It also appears from this that the floods of April 19 discussed above were of the order of 50-year floods, i.e. which might be expected to occur twice per century. The Vologne is a very substantial river despite the relative smallness of its basin. The rainfall of the Vosges region which feeds it is also very significant. The runoff curve number in its watershed is annually, which is very high, almost three times the ensemble average over France, and almost twice the French basin of the Moselle, at Hauconcourt. The specific flow rate reaches 27.4 litres per second per square kilometre of basin. Water quality In 2006, the Rhine-Meuse water agency assigned the Vologne's water analysed at the level of Jarménil, a quality rating of 1B, or \\"bonne\\" (good) during each of the years in the 10-year period 1997–2006, except in 2002, when the river achieved level 1A, or \\"très bonne\\" (very good). In 2006 a slightly excessive level of ammonium (NH+) ions were observed, but with an oxygen saturation of 79 percent (or 7.9 mg/l) the oxygenation was sufficient. History and economy The Lac de Longemer is traversed by the Vologne. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the famous \\"pearls of the Vologne\\" were harvested. Their harvest is attested from the 16th century. The pearls, rather small, were prized by the bourgeoisie and the nobility up until the 19th century, at which time their rarity caused interest to wane. Pearl fishing was regulated and overseen by \\"gardes-perles\\" watchers. The name of lordly residence which dominates Cheniménil, the Château sur Perle, refers to the old pearl industry. The molluscs which produce these pearls are called freshwater pearl mussels (scientific name Margaritifera margaritifera). They measure about and have a life expectancy of about 80 years. This substantial lifetime gives rise to a very slow regeneration rate for the population, which in turn explains the quasi-disappearance of the species owing to fishing, certainly, but also to the pollution of the river by textile factories. The textile industry itself has now almost disappeared, and while this is a cultural, economic and social setback, it has afforded the Vologne a steady improvement in water quality over recent years. Its high trout population density won it the right to hold certain rounds of the World Fly Fishing Championships in July 2002. The upper Vologne valley is a popular destination for tourism in the Vosges department. Places to visit there, aside from the lakes, include the Saut des Cuves cascade on an ancient glacial lock, and the Pont des Fées (Fairies' Bridge) built in 1763. The Vologne is classed as a cours d'eau de première catégorie (category 1 watercourse) over the whole of its length. Grégory Villemin On 16 October 1984, the body of a four-year-old, Grégory Villemin, was found in the Vologne near Docelles. The case was highly publicised in France and became known as the Affaire Grégory. As of 2019 the case remains unsolved. Environmental protection The site known as de la Vallée de la Vologne has been protected since 8 December 1910. Only the part within the commune of Granges, about , benefits from protection. This valley is flanked by two steep slopes rising from that are covered from the base to the summit with ancient trees, enormous rocks or scree. The Vologne flows at the foot of the valley, past naturally growing trees and dark rocks which line its route. The river, the railway line and the road occupy the bottom of the valley, whose width, at certain places, is no more than ; the slopes are so close to each other that the sun can barely penetrate.

Established on 5 March 2007, the park protects the endemic ecosystems of Les Hauts, Réunion's mountainous interior, and covers around 42% of the island. Notable endemic species include the Réunion cuckooshrike and the Reunion Island day gecko. Plans for a park date back to 1985, and in a public survey in 2004, the communes of Réunion approved the creation of a national park. It officially came into existence in 2007. The park's volcanic landscape, including the Piton de la Fournaise, an active volcano, was designated a World Heritage site in 2010, under the name \\"Pitons, cirques and remparts of Reunion Island\\". The park's mission, other than preserving landscape and biodiversity, is to share knowledge and welcome visitors, and to work together with local communes. It is a popular destination for hiking and mountaineering. Controversies have emerged over economic development in the park, notably the exploitation of geothermal power. In 2016, the Regional Council of Réunion had plans to downgrade the national park to a regional nature park to ease tourism development. This was contested by the park authorities and opposition politicians. History Proposals to create a park were first raised beginning in 1985. The Réunion Environmental Charter and the Regional Development Plan formally established the principle that a park should be created in Les Hauts, the mountainous interior of the island. The French Ministry of the Environment was officially consulted for the creation of a national park. Between 2000 and 2003, a consultation process was launched, in which the state, the region, the département, and the association of mayors agreed on a protocol and established a steering committee. 27 of 29 institutions endorsed the plan of establishing a national park, and on 29 March 2003, the French Prime Minister signed a decree acknowledging the project. Debates and negotiations on the limits and objectives of the future national park intensified. Between August and September 2004, the plan was the subject of a public survey, organised by the prefect in the 24 communes of the island. The communes responded positively to the project, adding some recommendations. The park officially came into existence on 5 March 2007 through a decree taken after advice by the Council of State. In April 2007, the Administration Council took office; between 2007 and 2009, personnel were employed and installations made on the site. In 2008, work began to set up the charter of the national park. On 1 August 2010, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee acknowledged the value of the natural sites within Réunion National Park, and included the \\"Pitons, cirques and remparts of Réunion Island\\" in its World Heritage list. Mission In its charter, the national park identifies four main objectives: First, to preserve the diversity of landscapes and accompany their evolution. Second, to inverse the loss of biodiversity. Third, to preserve and add value to the culture of the highlands and ensure the transmission of its values. Fourth, to foster economic development for the highland. Geography Core area (blue) and buffer zone (green) of Réunion National Park The core of Réunion National Park covers in the interior of the island, corresponding to 42% of its surface and extending over the land of 23 communes. This core area also includes some inhabited and cultivated land. Adjacent to the core is an area of voluntary commitment (aire d'adhésion, buffer zone) covering and touching all 24 communes on the island. Altogether, the park extends over more than 75% of the island. The island of Réunion is volcanic in origin and sits over a hotspot. Two volcanoes form its backbone: The Piton des Neiges, over high, and the still active Piton de la Fournaise. Four major areas form the heart of the national park, listed as World Heritage site: *' forest at Saint-Philippe, including some of the best-preserved remains of low-altitude tropical forest, termed '; *the Cirque de Cilaos with the Pain de Sucre and La chapelle rock formations, in the narrow gorge of the Bras Rouge River, and 100,000-year-old accessible magma chamber; *the Cirque de Salazie with the ', a high dominant massif; *La Grande Chaloupe between Saint-Denis and La Possession, one of the last remainders of the semi- evergreen forest once common in the west of the island, preserved and restored here. Wildlife Réunion shares a common natural history with the other Mascarene Islands, Mauritius and Rodrigues. All three islands were uninhabited before the 1600s. Human arrival led to massive extinction and introduced species, such as giant land snails in Réunion, which threatened native habitats and species. Less than 25% of Réunion is thought to be covered with original vegetation according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), mostly restricted to higher altitudes. The forests of Réunion and the other two islands have been classified as the \\"Mascarene forests\\" ecoregion by the WWF, with a conservation status of \\"endangered\\". Conservation International includes Réunion in the \\"Madagascar and Indian Ocean Islands\\" biodiversity hotspot, a priority area for conservation. The isolation of the island and its diversity of habitats and microclimates have favoured the diversification of a highly endemic flora: Of the 850 known native plant species, 230 are endemic, and half of those are endangered. This native flora is found at various altitudes. Nearly as many exotic plants as native ones, 830, have become naturalised on the island, and 50 are considered invasive, threatening native flora and habitats. The park's fauna includes notably several endemic bird species, such as Barau's petrel, the Réunion harrier, and the Réunion cuckooshrike. In total, 18 bird species are found at Réunion, half of which are endemic. At least 22 bird species have already gone extinct since human colonisation. A major threat to the bird fauna are introduced cats and rats. Of mammals, the Mauritian flying fox recolonised the Réunion after going extinct from the island. Notable butterfly species include Papilio phorbanta and Salamis augustina, and an endemic reptile is the Reunion Island day gecko.

Its mountains are a popular destination for hiking and mountaineering; there are more than of marked trails, crossing such different landscapes as rain forests, sugar cane plantations and volcanic fields. They include three long-distance trails approved by the French Hiking Federation, with mountain lodges along the trail. More than 400,000 people each year visit the Piton de la Fournaise volcano, for which a discovery trail has been established. The park's visitor's centre, La Maison du Parc at La Plaine-des-Palmistes, was inaugurated on 21 August 2014 by French President François Hollande. Management The park is governed by an administrative council (Conseil d'Administration, CA) composed of 88 members, the majority of them local representatives. It is elected for 6-year terms. A 15-member executive committee (Bureau du Parc national) was established during the first administrative council's term and acts on its behalf. A scientific council (Conseil Scientifique, CS), with 18 members from various disciplines and 11 outside experts, advises the administrative council and the park's director. Further, there is an economic, social, and cultural council (Conseil économique, social et culturel, CESC) composed of public figures and representatives from local institutions and associations. The park's regulations, notably regarding the core of the area, are stated in its charter. Controversies Since the national park's creation, debates have arisen on its management and the impacts on the population of the upland. Inhabitants of the area criticized management for not respecting their history and traditions, and cited farming activities banned on several occasions. Park officials maintained that every activity was possible under certain conditions. The volcanic setting holds potential for renewable energy production from geothermal power. However, this conflicts with the national park's vocation of preserving the natural and cultural landscape. , pilot studies were carried out for two 5 MW geothermal power plants, at the foot of the Piton des neiges and on the ', on which a project had already been considered and later abandoned. Both sites fall in the aire d'adhésion outside the park's core area, but proposals have also been made for sites within the World Heritage site boundary. In February 2016, the conservative majority in the Regional Council of Réunion with president Didier Robert announced plans to transform the national park into a regional nature park. Too restrictive rules, which hindered tourism development, was cited as a motive. A regional nature park, unlike a national park, functions on the basis of mutual agreements and has no power to establish its own regulations. Park officials and opposition politicians rejected the plan, saying it would threaten the island's biodiversity, the World Heritage listing, and critical access to state funding. It would be the first case of a national park in France being downgraded. In September 2016, the national park's director, Marylène Hoarau, announced her withdrawal upon pressure from Ségolène Royal, head of the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy. This led the park's president, Daniel Gonthier, to suspect political interference; Hoarau had criticised Robert for launching a call for proposals on the future of the park. In an interview, Robert denied involvement in Hoarau's departure and criticised the minister for her decision.

He is the assistant coach of Liga I side Dinamo București. Playing career  Born in Drănic, Gane played professionally in Romania for Universitatea Craiova, Electroputere Craiova, Dinamo Bucureşti, Rapid Bucureşti, and Argeş Piteşti; in Spain for CA Osasuna; in Switzerland for FC St. Gallen and Grasshopper Zürich; in China for Tianjin Kangshifu; and in Germany for VfL Bochum. He also represented Romania at international level.  Coaching career  In July 2009, he started working as assistant coach for FC Braşov. He was also an interim coach for FC Universitatea Craiova, during which time the club played a match against FC Dinamo Bucharest. In September 2013, he became head coach of newly promoted in Liga I Corona Brașov. He became manager of Petrolul Ploiești in March 2016, and CSM Râmnicu Vâlcea in June 2016, leaving that position in December 2016. In February 2017, he was appointed assistant coach of Dinamo București under Cosmin Contra. In September 2017 he took up a similar role with the Romanian national team. In August 2020, he returned to Dinamo, again as assistant coach under Contra. Trivia His name is Tersinio because his father was a fan of Brazil's 1970 World Cup winning team and his favourite player from that team was Jairzinho, but he wrote the name by the way he used to pronounce it: Jersinio, that is why Ionel's nickname is Jerry. Later when Ionel was 14 years old and had to get an identity card, the people who made the card misspelled the name putting the letter \\"t \\" instead of \\"j\\", thus resulting Tersinio.

History  In 1893, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR;) obtained Parliamentary approval for the extension of its line from Annesley in Nottingham to London.

The link line, which ran for a distance of 8.25 miles, was opened without formality on 1 June 1900. The route had no intermediate stations but soon became an important freight route with 60,796 wagons exchanged between the MS&LR; (now known as the Great Central) and the Great Western within the first six months of operation; by 1904 this figure had risen by 50%.

Bubba was 7 years old and Kathy was 5 when Kathy was killed by their father in 1953. Early career Russell G. Tongay, the children's father, began training Kathy and Bubba when they were very young. Time magazine reported in 1953 that by the age of ten months Kathy could swim 20 feet deep. By the time the children were 17 months old, according to Time, they were swimming a quarter of a mile per day. In 1950, Tongay staged a swimming performance by his children in the Mississippi River, 22 miles away from St. Louis. Tongay followed in a boat while his children swam along the river. Kathy, aged 2, swam 5 miles and Bubba, aged 4, swam the entire 22 miles to St. Louis. The performance was recorded by gathered reporters and served as a national introduction for the two children. Tongay then announced that his children would swim across the English Channel. Following the Mississippi River swim, Tongay began to actively promote the children as an entertainment act. Bubba would leap from a 30-foot diving platform and swim underwater with his hands and feet bound. The family later moved to Miami, where the children continued to perform. They were promoted by their father, who bragged of their diet, which consisted entirely of baby food. Europe The Tongays arrived in Europe in June 1951, but their act was regarded there more as abuse than as entertainment. Both the British and the French governments forbade the Tongays to force their children to swim the English Channel. Upon their arrival in London, the entire family was placed under \\"technical arrest.\\" Tongay argued with the British Home Office to permit the swim across the Channel. Letters to the editor and a general sense that the swim was exploitative caused Home Secretary James Chuter Ede to say: \\"I cannot help thinking that swimming the Channel at that early age is rather a severe test even for an infant prodigy.\\" Initially the Home Office intended to expel the Tongays from the country, but the next day an officer declared they could stay for one month provided that the children did not swim for profit. Although the Daily Mail had offered the children a $20,000 prize for the stunt, and they had received much publicity, the Tongays eventually gave up and returned to the United States. The publicity surrounding the Aquatots continued to increase after their return from Europe. The children were featured in newsreels and made a cameo appearance in the 1952 musical film Skirts Ahoy!, starring Esther Williams. Death and the end of the Aquatots Both Kathy and Bubba were accomplished platform divers. In May 1953, Kathy Tongay attempted to complete a one-and-a-half layout dive from a height of 33 feet at Miami's Macfadden-Deauville Pool. Her attempt failed and she ended up bellyflopping. Afterward, she complained of back pain. Tongay then took her to the Treasure Isle Pool, a pool at which the children trained five days a week. A lifeguard at the pool later reported that Kathy was badly bruised and ill. Her father fed her some baby soup and told her to get into the water. The same lifeguard later stated that Kathy was crying and did not swim for long. By noon, the Tongays had returned home, where Kathy went into convulsions and died before 6 p.m. Homicide detectives stated that Kathy apparently had been beaten and had died from a ruptured intestine, internal bleeding, and an infection. Tongay was charged with second degree murder. He was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to ten years at hard labor.  Life after the tragedy  Bubba became a beach patrol officer in Miami Beach, Florida in his adult years.

Biography Laskov was born in the village of Lokorsko, today administratively part of Sofia. He graduated from the Sofia Seminary, from where his nickname Popeto (Попето; \\"the little priest\\") stems. His youth team was FC Pobeda from the Sofia neighbourhood of Orlandovtsi, for which he played in 1939–1940. In 1940, Laskov moved to PFC Levski Sofia and featured for their senior team between 1941 and 1946 as their number 9 striker. Laskov appeared in 56 Bulgarian Championship matches, scoring the remarkable 40 goals. In 46 Bulgarian Cup matches, he scored 21 times; he also appeared in 9 international games, scoring 5 goals, as well as 35 other games with 24 goals on his name. During his stay with Levski, Laskov won the Bulgarian Championship twice (in 1942 and 1946), the Bulgarian Cup three times (in 1942, 1946 and 1947) and the Sofia Championship four times (in 1942, 1943, 1945 and 1946). For the Bulgaria national football team, his tally stands at 8 matches and 2 goals. At the 1946 Balkan Cup in Tirana, Albania, he was proclaimed the best footballer of the Balkans. Reportedly, France Football also deemed him the best footballer in Europe later on. On 15 February 1946, Laskov immigrated to Brno, Czechoslovakia, where he studied medicine at the Masaryk University and played for SK Židenice, the modern 1. FC Brno. In 1947, he moved to Bratislava, where he married a Slovak beautician and was granted Czechoslovak citizenship. In Bratislava, he played for ŠK Slovan Bratislava between 1947 and 1952, winning the Czechoslovak First League in 1949, 1950 and 1951. In Czechoslovakia, he has also played for FK Inter Bratislava (then Cervena Hviezda) and TTS Trenčín players, until 1960. In the Czechoslovak Championship, he played a total of 169 games, of which 98 (with 48 league goals) for Slovan; he also featured in 3 games for the Czechoslovakia national football team. He was awarded several fair play prizes in Czechoslovakia. Later on, he worked as a manager, managing FK Inter Bratislava, FC Spartak Trnava and Trenčín. He also served as a professional physician specialized in otolaryngology and was an active member of the Bulgarian association in Slovakia. Laskov died in Bratislava on 2 April 2007.

It is on the Kalgoorlie to Leonora Road. History Initially called Kurawah, this was where gold was first discovered in 1893, triggering a gold rush in the region north of Kalgoorlie. The Broad Arrow Goldfield was gazetted on 11 November 1896, and in 1897 the municipality of Kurawah was declared. The town derives its name from the markers, in the shape of a broad arrow, left on the ground by a miner, Reison, who left them to direct his friends who were following him to a gold discovery he had made. His mine was also named Broad Arrow. Extensions to the Eastern Goldfields Railway line from Kalgoorlie to Menzies was begun in August 1897, and reached Broad Arrow on 6 November the same year. The railway station included a passenger platform. At its peak the town had 15,000 residents, eight hotels and two breweries as well as a stock exchange. Other facilities included a hospital, three churches, Salvation Army Hall, a chemist, two banks, police station with resident magistrate, a mining registrar, a post office, a cordial factory, six grocery stores and two draperies, and blacksmith and bakers' shops. The town was the administrative centre for smaller settlements in the area including Ora Banda, Smithfield, Black Flat, White Flag and Grant's Patch. It had its own newspaper, The Broad Arrow Standard, from 1896 to 1899. A dam was built for the Public Works Department in Broad Arrow in 1897. The population of the town was 337 (218 males and 119 females) in 1898. By the 1920s the gold had run out and the town had been abandoned. The movie Nickel Queen was filmed here in 1971, using the town's remaining hotel, the Broad Arrow Tavern. The Tavern remains open for travellers today and is noted for having almost every wall covered with handwritten notes from past visitors. In recent years the area has had renewed life with mining companies re-establishing operations, like the Paddington Gold Mine.  Local authority relative to development of Kalgoorlie  The town first gained local government with the Municipality of Broad Arrow in 1897. It amalgamated with the nearby Municipality of Paddington to form the Municipality of Broad Arrow-Paddington in 1903. The merged municipality was then merged into the surrounding Broad Arrow Road District in 1910, which in turn was merged into the Kalgoorlie Road District in 1922. 400px References Further reading * Populated places established in 1896 Ghost towns in Western Australia Mining towns in Western Australia Goldfields-Esperance ","title":"Broad Arrow, Western Australia"},{"id":"19188466","text":"Helen Gregory (born 1946) is a prominent historian, author and retired public servant in and of Brisbane, Queensland Australia and its surrounds.

The ultimate goal of the approach is to provide people such as resource managers and designers of marine reserves with information that they can then use to respond, in advance, to future changes, a form of adaptation to global warming. One of the most important environmental factors for organisms today is global warming. Most physiological processes are affected by temperature, and so even small changes in weather and climate can lead to large changes in the growth, reproduction and survival of animals and plants. The scientific consensus is that the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human activity caused most of the warming observed since the start of the industrial era. These changes are in turn affecting human and natural ecosystems. One major challenge is to predict where, when and with what magnitude changes are likely to occur so that we can mitigate or at least prepare for them. Ecological forecasting applies existing knowledge of how animals and plants interact with their physical environment to ask how changes in environmental factors might result in changes to the ecosystems as a whole. One of the most complete sources on the topic is the book Ecological Forecasting written by Michael C. Dietze. Approaches Ecological forecasting varies in spatial and temporal extent, as well as in what is being forecast (presence, abundance, diversity, production, etc.). * Population models may be used to generate short-term abundance forecasts using knowledge of population dynamics and recent environmental conditions. These models are used especially in fisheries and disease forecasting. * Species distribution models (SDMs) may be used to forecast species distribution (presence or abundance) over longer ecological time scales using information about past and projected environmental conditions across the landscape. ** Correlative SDMs, also known as climate envelope models, rely on statistical correlations between existing species distributions (range boundaries) and environmental variables to outline a range (envelope) of environmental conditions within which a species can exist. New range boundaries can then be forecast using future levels of environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, and salinity from climate model projections. These methods are good for examining large numbers of species, but are likely not a good means of predicting effects at fine scales. ** Mechanistic SDMs use information about a species' physiological tolerances and constraints, as well as models of organismal body temperature and other biophysical properties, to define the range of environmental conditions within which a species can exist. These tolerances are mapped onto current and projected environmental conditions in the landscape to outline current and forecasted ranges for the species. In contrast to \\"climate envelope\\" approaches, mechanistic SDMs model the fundamental niche directly, and are therefore much more exact. However, the approach requires more information is also usually more time-consuming. *Other types of models may be used to forecast (or hindcast) biodiversity over evolutionary time scales. Palaeobiology modeling uses fossil and phylogenetic evidence of biodiversity in the past to project the trajectory of biodiversity in the future. Simple plots can be constructed and then adjusted based on the varying quality of the fossil record. Forecasting examples Biodiversity Using fossil evidence, studies have shown that vertebrate biodiversity has grown exponentially through Earth's history and that biodiversity is entwined with the diversity of Earth's habitats. Temperature Forecasts of temperature, shown in the diagram at the right as colored dots, along the North Island of New Zealand in the austral summer of 2007. As per the temperature scale shown at the bottom, intertidal temperatures were forecast to exceed 30 °C at some locations on February 19; surveys later showed that these sites corresponded to large die-offs in burrowing sea urchins.

On May 6, 1829, Cyrill and his sons presented a new instrument to the authorities for patent - the accordion. The patent was officially granted on May 23, 1829.  Demian's accordion description  (Translated Summary of Original Old-German Manuscript) Its appearance essentially consists of a little box with feathers of metal plates and bellows fixed to it, in such a way that it can easily be carried, and therefore traveling visitors to the country will appreciate the instrument. It is possible to perform marches, arias, melodies, even by an amateur of music with little practice, and to play the loveliest and most pleasant chords of 3, 4, 5 etc. voices after instruction.  The first accordion debate  The advent of the accordion is the subject of debate among researchers. Many credit Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann, as the inventor of the accordion, while others give the distinction to Cyrill Demian, an Armenian from the Transsylvanian town of Szamosújvár (Gherla) (ancient Armenopolis) living in Vienna, who patented his Accordion in 1829, thus coining the name. A modification of the Handäoline, Demian's invention comprised a small manual bellows and five keys, although, as Demian noted in a description of the instrument, extra keys could be incorporated into the design. Numerous variations of the device soon followed.  The accordion assembly  (Translated Summary of Original Old-German Manuscript) 1st - In a box 7 to 9 inches long, 3½ inches wide and 2 inches high, feathers of metal plates are fixed, which were known for more than 200 years as Regale, Zungen, Schnarrwerk, in organs. 2nd - With bellows fixed to the above box and its 5 claves fixed below, even an amateur of music can play the loveliest and most moving chords of 3, 4 and 5 voices with very little practice. 3rd - Each claves or key of this instrument allows two different chords to be heard, as many keys are fixed to it, double as many chords can be heard, pulling the bellows a key gives one chord, while pushing the bellows gives the same key a second chord. 4th - As this instrument can be made with 4, 5 and 6 or even more claves, with chords arranged in alphabetical order, many well known arias, melodies and marches, etc. may be performed similar to the harmony of 3, 4 and 5 voices, with satisfaction of all anticipations of delicacy and vastly amazing comfort in increasing and decreasing sound volume. 5th - The instrument is of the same size as the attached illustration, with 5 claves and 10 chords, not heavier than 32 to 36 Loth [1 Loth = approx. 16 g, MW], only if there are more chords will it become longer and some Loths heavier, so it is easy and comfortable to carry and should be a welcome invention for travelers, country and parties visiting individuals of both sexes, especially as it can be played without the help of anybody. Bellows With the cover of the bellows, the entire instrument may be doubled, in order to play more chords or more single tones, in this case, keyboard, the bellows remain in the middle, while each hand controls in turn, either the claves or the bellows. The above- mentioned duplication of the instrument or adding more chords, would not make anything better to anybody, or give something new, as only the parts would increase, and the instrument more expensive and heavier. The instrument costs 12 to 16/M M, the difference in price results in a more elegant or worse- looking appearance. \\"We think that it is the most excellent innovation, that with one claves, a complete chord can be played.\\"  In popular culture  In the comic strip Garfield, Jon states that Demian is his hero. In the colombian novel Antes del Juglar, the author makes a fictional narrative about the making of the accordion, taking Cyrill Demian's son, Guido Demian, as central character.

It was opened in 1899 and served the nearby village of Finmere. The station was closed 1963 and the line through it was closed in 1966.  History   Construction and opening  Finmere station was on the Great Central Main Line, the last English main line - built in 1899, and the first to be closed in 1966. The section of the line between and was to be constructed by Walter Scott & Co., civil engineers from Newcastle- upon-Tyne at a cost of £420,000. The construction of the section through Finmere necessitated considerable earthworks, the remains of which can still be seen today. To the north, a cutting of 180,000 cubic yards had to be excavated, while to the south the railway crossed an embankment which required the excavation of nearly 200,000 cubic yards. The earthworks were required as a consequence of the Great Central's policy to eliminate level crossings on the London Extension, regarding them as a source of danger, inconvenience and cost. This resulted in the construction of bridges for crossings both large and small, including a timber overbridge to the north of Finmere for the convenience of the local Grafton Hunt. Opened in March 1899, Finmere typified the Great Central's style of station which was reached via a flight of steps leading up from the centre of a road underbridge, each track having a separate bridge span. A house was provided for the stationmaster and land set aside for the future provision of railway cottages. At a distance of from and from Finmere village, the station had a small goods yard with a cattle pen, coal staithes and a goods store. The station was originally named \\"Finmere for Buckingham\\", but as Buckingham was away and served by the LNWR's Buckingham station, it was hardly convenient to alight at Finmere in order to reach the historic county town. Traps waited under the shelter of the road underbridge to ferry passengers to their destinations. Local entrepreneurs soon took advantage of the railway's presence to launch new ventures - a livestock market was opened on land adjacent to the station by Paxton & Holiday, while construction of the Shelswell Inn began in May 1900. A further bonus for the railway was the opening of Stowe School in 1923; the school's nearest main- line station was Finmere and it provided a useful form of transport for staff and pupils alike. Buckingham station was far closer physically, but not on a main line.  Operations  The station became a popular alighting place for day-trippers from London and two or three special services ran on Sundays bringing as many as fifty or sixty excursionists to the area who often found they had to walk the four miles to Buckingham in the absence of local conveyances. A slip coach service to Buckingham was introduced in 1923 to take advantage of the wealthy and prominent commuters who were now living in the area; these included Admiral Roger Keyes and Captain Ferrass Loftus who both lived at Tingewick, the banker L. Fleischmann of Chetwode Manor and Charles William Trotter, a director of the LNER who lived at Barton Hartshorn Manor. A slip coach on the 18.20 from Marylebone reached Finmere at 19.28, the guard releasing the last carriage as the service approached the station and this carriage braking as it entered Finmere which enabled expresses to continue without stopping. After setting down at Finmere, slip coaches were worked forward to . The fastest service to Marylebone from Finmere in 1922 took one hour and nine minutes on an express which only stopped at , although the first service of the day took slightly longer, departing at 07.59 and not arriving in Marylebone until 09.48.  Decline and closure  Although the station saw regular use during the Second World War due to its proximity to military camps and airfields, patronage began to decline after the war in the face of increased competition from buses and the private motorcar. Eventually, the only really busy periods came at the start and end of the school terms at Stowe. Proposals to close the station circulated by the British Transport Commission in 1961 and Finmere Parish Council joined with Oxfordshire County Council in objecting to closure. It subsequently closed to passenger traffic in March 1963, goods facilities being withdrawn a year later. After the station closed trains continue to pass through it until closure of the Great Central Main Line in September 1966.  Present day  The twin road overbridge has survived, although in an overgrown state. The route chosen for HS2 passes through the site of Finmere station. Until 2020 the station site was owned by the Coulsdon Old Vehicle & Engineering Society, which initially used it for the storage of vintage road vehicles, but subsequently brought it back into rail use. A running line has been laid using track from the East London Line project and rolling stock brought on to the site, including Class 73/1 No. 73130, and two ex- 2EPB units. More recently a 4CIG unit, No. 1753, has been acquired. The station was opened to the public for the first time during the weekend of 13–14 August 2016 by the Network SouthEast Railway Society (NSERS), which marked the 30th anniversary of its namesake passenger sector by staging a special gala at Finmere. The NSERS's Honorary President and former Network SouthEast (NSE) managing director, Chris Green, unveiled a nameplate in his honour on 4CIG's MBSO No. 62043. He also inaugurated the NSERS's mobile museum housed in a modified ISO container in NSE livery and numbered ADB 300778-4. The site remained private and was only open on selected days or by prior arrangement. In January 2020 the station site was vacated by NSERS and handed over to HS2.

In her book Self Defense Handgun Ownership and the Independence of Women in a Violent Sexist Society (edited by Don B. Kates Jr.), Silver argued that, by carrying guns, women advance the cause of women's rights: \\"For men know that throughout all the prior ages of history the bottom line in male-female relationships has always been woman's need for male protection. Women could not live alone for fear of predation by males. So they lived with a male protector and accepted his dictation of their role, either as a condition of receiving his protection, or because he would impose it upon them by physical force, or both. Access to firearms gives women, for the first time in history, the capacity to live independently and apart from men in safety and freedom.\\"Silver, Carol Ruth and Don B. Kates Jr. (1979) Self Defense Handgun Ownership and the Independence of Women in a Violent Sexist Society. North River Press: Hawthorne, New York. Page 24. (This book is hosted online by the Second Amendment Foundation.) (Retrieved Mar 24, 2015.) Career Silver moved to California and served on the faculties of Golden Gate University, Lone Mountain College (now the University of San Francisco), and San Francisco State. She served with the California Rural Legal Assistance program. She began her political career in 1970, running for city auditor in Berkeley. She then moved to San Francisco and ran for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Silver's 1977 election was part of a shift toward diversity on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors; she was described as \\"the board's first unwed mother.\\"Ledbetter, Les (January 12, 1978). \\"San Francisco Legislators Meet in Diversity; An Unusual Coalition Is Challenging the Establishment\\". The New York Times. p. 14 \\"As a colleague of Harvey Milk, our legacy was to significantly shift the balance of power to younger and less affluent people in the city of San Francisco. We were the first district- elected supervisors who had roots in the ethnic communities of the city,\\" Silver said in 2011. Moscone-Milk assassinations In 1984, six years after he shot and killed Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone, former city supervisor Dan White reportedly confessed to San Francisco Police Department homicide detective Frank Falzon that the murders were premeditated. Falzon said White told him he planned to kill not just Milk and Moscone, but also Silver and state assemblyman Willie Brown. White had been acquitted of first-degree murder and convicted of voluntary manslaughter after his attorneys argued he had diminished capacity at the time of the murders, using what became known as the notorious \\"Twinkie defense\\". White served five years in prison for the two murders. In 1998, Falzon quoted White as having told him, \\"I was on a mission. I wanted four of them. Carol Ruth Silver – she was the biggest snake of the bunch. And Willie Brown. He was masterminding the whole thing.\\" Falzon indicated that he had believed White's initial claim, saying, \\"I felt like I had been hit by a sledgehammer … I found out it was a premeditated murder.\\" White reportedly blamed all four for refusing to allow him to be reappointed to the board, days after he had resigned. Silver was in her law office during the time of the shootings, while Brown, the future mayor, had just left the building. During White's trial in 1979, Silver testified for the prosecution, stating she did not believe his claim of being mentally ill. Silver maintained her stance following White's acquittal, saying, \\"Dan White has gotten away with murder. It's as simple as that.\\" During the White Night riots that erupted in the city following the news of White's acquittal, Silver was injured when struck by a flying object. Later career Silver served three terms on the Board of Supervisors, stepping down in 1989. Silver ran in the Democratic primary for California's 1st congressional district, in 1996,Sweeney, James W. (December 30, 1995). They're off and running for office. The Press Democrat but lost to Michela Alioto (who then lost to incumbent Frank Riggs).Rose, Bleys W. (March 27, 1996). Alioto leads Marvin in bid to face Riggs; GOP's Hughes will face Woolsey. The Press Democrat Silver ran in the 2000 District 6 supervisorial race, coming in fourth. Silver then retired from politics and continued her philanthropic work, which had included founding San Francisco's Chinese American International School in 1982, the first and most modeled Mandarin Chinese immersion program in the United States. In the summer of 2002 she traveled to Afghanistan to explore ways that American citizens could extend a hand of friendship to the Afghan people, and she has founded or co-founded three organizations dedicated in different ways to supporting and promoting education in Afghanistan, particularly of women and girls. In 2007, Silver was appointed director of the San Francisco Sheriff's Department's Office of Prisoner Legal Services. She resigned the position in 2009, stating her reluctance to work in a system that supported the war on drugs. She wrote in her resignation letter, \\"I have found myself having to bite my tongue in talking to some prisoners about their charges – at least half of them with nonviolent drug charges. I find it difficult to discuss the financial or child custody problems of a prisoner, when I cannot look them in the eye and justify their being in jail.\\" She has since lent her support to Law Enforcement Against Prohibition.  Milk  Silver played a small part as Thelma, a speechwriter, in the 2008 Academy-Award-winning film Milk, a biographical film of her late friend and coworker. She herself was portrayed by actress Wendy King.  Published works  References 1938 births American Jews American gun rights activists Living people University of Chicago alumni John F.

It was released on August 24, 2007 in Europe for Microsoft Windows and the PlayStation 2 and on August 26, 2008 in the United States for the PlayStation 2. The game is aimed at young children and was released with a price point lower than most PS2 games.  Gameplay  In Falling Stars, players control Luna, a young girl who lives in the peaceful land of Dazzleon. Luna's uncle, Matt, discovers a curious mine and decides to take up residence in Dazzleon to investigate. The mine slowly takes over Matt's mind and he begins to perform evil experiments. Eventually, Matt turns on his pets, changing them all into evil monsters. Realizing her uncle's madness, Luna sets out to save him and prevent the world from suffering dire consequences.  Combat  Monsters are unleashed upon Dazzleon. The player cannot fight until they've obtained their pet, Komi. Battles require input to progress. When Komi's time bar fills, he can attack. When the monster's time bar fills, Komi can defend. The strength of the attack depends on the strength of the defense. If the two match, less damage is done. Monsters have attack patterns players can learn and use to compensate. For example, the Red Dog will begin his attack pattern with either Red (strong) or Yellow (fast). In either case (Red or Yellow), the pattern will follow as Yel, Red, Yel, Red, Yel, White. Since the Red Dog's pattern ends with White (mega), it's easy to tell when a new pattern is beginning. The player can heal Komi with magic or the more effective Health Potions when Luna's time bar fills. Luna's time bar can be rushed by rotating the RAS (right analog stick). Komi's stats can be boosted through equipped accessories, special items, and experience. Enough experience gains Komi bonus training points for use in Luna's home. Plot Ending At the end of the game, after beating Uncle Matt's spider, the spirit reveals itself, explaining that it had taken over Luna's body to prevent her from seeking out the ultimate power. It asks that Matt ensure Luna does not seek this power out and he promises to protect her. Characters Some information about characters that appear in the game (with their Russian names):  Lilou, or Luna - a young girl who's always there to help her friends. Her parents are dead and since their ruin, Lilou's uncle Shikoracks (Matt) is taking care of her.  Shikoracks, or Matt - he was always interested in science, and he was ordering science magazines and new science tools. But after he'd found a curious mine, he changed into someone else - his skin colored in green and he lost his mind and no-one knows what will happen next with him.  Bobo - he's a dwarf and he loves animals and hates everyone who hates them. As all dwarfs, Bobo can count money and he'll never miss a chance to earn some. But sometimes he makes a discounts for his friends.  Artus - he's working on his boat station, giving his boats for lease. When he's not working, he likes to lay with his favorite smoothie and sunbathing.  Thomash - an old military man. He loves kids and telling stories about his past, and if you don't stop him, his stories will last for hours. But also he knows some really great fighting methods.  Isla - clever and beautiful girl. She's a little selfish but she loves making potions and medicine from everything - but they are too expensive.  Olee - he's a science candidate. He hates magic and thinks that everything must be explained by scientific point of view. He can always help you with his inventions.  Hoka - one more guy who likes science and dreams to be a scientist. But he's too boring and slow to start his career.  Keira - laughing-out-loud girl with the worst memory in Lydonia (Dazzleon). She has a crush on Hoka, but it's her biggest secret. Reception and Criticism Few official reviews for Falling Stars exist but those that do are critical of the gameplay. Criticisms include 'sterile combat' and 'flat characters'. The game currently holds a score of 32% on Metacritic, pooling reviews from 6 separate online sources. Other critiques include frequent slow-loading screens, slow character movement/reaction, sprinting which requires stamina (a slow- refilling bar potions fill instantly), etc. Positive notes would highlight the rare \\"dress-up\\" system featuring multiple character's opinions, the complexity of mini-games, conversations which begin automatically upon approach, plays in six different languages, opening movie is pretty if short, there is no \\"game over\\", the battle mechanics are relatively interesting.

Slavery in Pre-Achaemenid Iran  Slaves are attested in the cuneiform record of the ancient Elamites, a non- Persian people who inhabited modern southwestern Iran, including the ancient cities of Anshan and Susa, and who were eventually incorporated into the Achaemenid Empire. Because of their participation in cuneiform culture, the Elamites are one of the few pre-Achaemenid civilizations of Iran to leave written attestations of slavery, and details of slavery among the Gutians, Kassites, Medes, Mannaeans, and other peoples of Bronze Age Iran are largely unrecorded. Classical Antiquity  Slavery in the Achaemenid Empire (c. 550–330 BC)  In general, mass slavery as a whole has never been practiced by Persians, and in many cases the situation and lives of semi-slaves (prisoners of war) were, in fact, better than those of the commoner.Farazmand, Ali (1998) “Persian/Iranian Administrative Tradition”, in Jay M. Shafritz (Editor), International Encyclopedia of Public Policy and Administration. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, pp 1640–1645 – Excerpt: \\"Persians never practiced mass slavery, and in many cases the situations and lives of semi-slaves (prisoners of war) were in fact better than the common citizens of Persia.\\" (pg 1642) Slavery was an existing institution in Egypt, Media and Babylonia before the rise of the Achaemenid empire. On the whole, in the Achaemenid empire, there was only small number of slaves in relation to the number of free persons and moreover the word used to call a slave was utilized also to express general dependence.M. A. Dandamayev, BARDA and BARDADĀRĪ in Encyclopedia Iranica Usually, captives were prisoners of war that were recruited from those that rebelled against Achaemenid rule.M. A. Dandamayev, BARDA and BARDADĀRĪ in Encyclopedia Iranica Modern historians handle the book of Herodotus with care and according to Pierre Briant: \\"It is hard to separate history from fairy tale in Herodotus\\".Pierre Briant, From Cyrus to Alexander, 1195 pp., Eisenbrauns Publishers, 2006, , . Herodotus has mentioned enslavement with regards to rebels of the Lydians who revolted against Achaemenid rule and captured Sardis.Pierre Briant, From Cyrus to Alexander, 1195 pp., Eisenbrauns Publishers, 2006, , , p.37 He has also mentioned slavery after the rebellion of Egypt in the city of BarceJ. D. Fage, R. A. Oliver, The Cambridge History of Africa: From C.500 BC to AD1050, 858 pp., Cambridge University Press, 1979, , (see page 112) during the time of Cambyses and the assassination of Persian Satrap in Egypt. He also mentions the defeat of Ionians, and their allies Eretria who supported the Ionians and subsequent enslavement of the rebels and supporting population.David Sansone, Ancient Greek Civilization , 226 pp., Blackwell Publishing, 2004, , (see page 85) According to Dandamayev:M. A. Dandamayev, BARDA and BARDADĀRĪ in Encyclopedia Iranica : Slavery in Hellenistic Iran (c. 330–238 BC)  Slavery in Parthian Iran (c. 238 BC–224 AD)  According to Plutarch, there were many \\"slaves\\" in the army of the Parthian general Surena.Ehsan Yar-Shater, W. B. Fisher, The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods , 1488 pp., Cambridge University Press, 1983, , (see p.635) However, the actual meaning of the term \\"slaves\\" (doûloi, ') mentioned in this context is disputed, as it may be pejorative rather than literal.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arsacids- iihttp://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/class-system-iii Other than this mention, slave-soldiers are not securely attested in Iran until the Islamic period. Slavery in Sassanid Iran (c. 224–642 AD) Under this period Roman prisoners of war were used in farming in Babylonia, Shush and Persis.Evgeniĭ Aleksandrovich Beliyayev, Arabs, Islam and the Arab Caliphate in the Early Middle Ages, 264 pp., Praeger Publishers, 1969 (see p.13) = Sassanid Laws of Slavery = Some of the laws governing the ownership and treatment of slaves can be found in the legal compilation called the Matigan-i Hazar Datistan, a collection of rulings by Sasanian judges.K. D. Irani, Morris Silver, Social Justice in the Ancient World , 224 pp., Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995, , (see p.87) Principles that can be inferred from the laws include: * Sources of slaves were both foreign (e.g., non-Zoroastrians captives from warfare or raiding or slaves imported from outside the Empire by traders) or domestic (e.g., hereditary slaves, children sold into slavery by their fathers, or criminals enslaved as punishment). Some cases suggest that a criminal's family might also be condemned to servitude. At the time of the manuscript's composition, Iranian slavery was hereditary on the mother's side (so that a child of a free man and a slave woman would be a slave), although the author reports that in earlier Persian history it may have been the opposite, being inherited from the father's side. * Slave-owners had the right to the slaves' income. * While slaves were formally chattel (property) and were liable to the same legal treatment as nonhuman property (for example, they could be sold at will, rented, owned jointly, inherited, given as security for a loan, etc.), Sasanian courts did not treat them completely as objects; for example, slaves were allowed to testify in court in cases concerning them, rather than only permitted to be represented by their owners. * Slaves were often given to the Zoroastrian Fire Temples as a pious offering, in which case they and their descendants would become temple-slaves. * Excessive cruelty towards slaves could result in the owners' being brought to court; a court case involving a slave whose owner tried to drown him in the Tigris River is recorded, though without stating the outcome of the case. * If a non-Zoroastrian slave, such as a Christian slave, converted to Zoroastrianism, he or she could pay his or her price and attain freedom; i.e., as long as the owner was compensated, manumission was required. * Owners could also voluntarily manumit their slaves, in which case the former slave became a subject of the Sasanian King of Kings and could not lawfully be re-enslaved later. Manumissions were recorded, which suggests that a freedman who was challenged would be able to document their free status. * Uniquely in comparison to Western slave systems, Sasanian slavery recognized partial manumission (relevant in the case of a jointly owned slave, only some of whose owners were willing to manumit). In case of a slave who was, e.g., one-half manumitted, the slave would serve in alternating years. To free a slave (irrespective of his or her faith) was considered a good deed.K. D. Irani, Morris Silver, Social Justice in the Ancient World , 224 pp., Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995, , (see p.87) Slaves had some rights including keeping gifts from the owner and at least three days of rest in the month.K. D. Irani, Morris Silver, Social Justice in the Ancient World , 224 pp., Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995, , (see p.87) Medieval Iran Slavery under the Umayyads, Abbasids, and Persianate Muslim dynasties (c. 642–1220 AD) Slavery under Mongol and Turkoman rule (c. 1220–1502 AD) Early Modern Iran Slavery in Safavid Iran (c. 1502–1736 AD) Slavery under Nader Shah and his successors (c. 1736–1796 AD) A Qajar-era aristocratic family with their slaves standing behind them Slavery in Qajar Iran (c. 1796–1925 AD) At the beginning of the 19th century both white and black slaves were traded in Iran. The 1828 war with Russia put an end to the import of white slaves from the Russian Empire borderlands as it undermined the trade in Circassians and Georgians, which both Iran and neighboring Turkey had been practicing for quite some time. At the same time and under various pressures the British Empire decided to curb the slave trade through the Indian Ocean. Consequently, by 1870 the trade in African slaves to Iran through the Indian Ocean had been significantly diminished. Although the diplomatic efforts of the Russians and the British did result in a decline in the trade, slavery was still common in Iran under the Qajar dynasty and it was not until the first half of twentieth century that slavery would be officially abolished in Iran under Reza Shah Pahlavi.  Modern Period  Abolition of slavery (1929 AD) What ultimately led to the abolition of the slave trade and the emancipation of slaves in Iran were internal pressures for reform. On February 7, 1929 the Iranian National Parliament ratified an anti-slavery bill that outlawed the slave trade or any other claim of ownership over human beings. The bill also empowered the government to take immediate action for the emancipation of all slaves.

Fashion influence  Van Runkle rejected the advice of Edith Head to \\"do everything in chiffon\\" when she started her work on \\"Bonnie and Clyde.\\" Instead she followed her instincts to create an image of the \\"romantic and tragic Depression-era gangsters.\\" At first Dunaway did not want to wear the fluid, easy to wear and pack clothing and calf-length skirts, but as soon as the movie was released \\"maxiskirts replaced miniskirts, the production of traditional French berets increased, and \\"women all around America began to search vintage stores and their grandmothers' closets for 1930s vintage pieces.\\" Beatty's double-breasted suits, worn by his character Clyde, also brought the 1930s back in style for 1970s menswear. A similar thing happened after Van Runkle's work on The Thomas Crown Affair and Bullit. She collaborated with Steve McQueen to create clothes that made McQueen \\"the king of cool.\\" According to Bauer, \\"The costume design for both of these films had an immediate and lasting impact on fashion.\\"  Influence on actors  Van Runkle was able to distill the character into the costume design. According to Shelley Long, who played the leading role of Phyllis Nefler in Troop Beverly Hills, \\"When I put the dress on, I knew who Phyllis was, and that was perfect, and that had never happened to me before, where a costumer showed me who my character was.\\" Death Theadora Van Runkle died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles of lung cancer on November 4, 2011. She was survived by her son, Maxim Yorick Van Runkle, her daughter, Felicity Van Runkle, and her grandson, Michael Teo Van Runkle. Filmography Film * Bonnie and Clyde (1967) * I Love You, Alice B.

It also became a Chivers Audio book read by Tony Robinson. This was a keenly observed book of school stories, and comprises two short novellas. Time and the Hour The story takes place at an all boys' school with one particular class called 1x. One of the students, Martin Bennett is keeping a record of how much time is being wasted and saved during each school day for fun. When school troublemaker Addison realizes what Martin is up to, him and some of the other classmates Forbes, Hopkins, Luckhurst and Traill decide to make a wager of how much they can save and waste during the next week with Martin being the bookmaker and Forbes being his supervisor, despite the Deputy Headmaster issuing a gambling ban. Whoever won would collect his winnings at the 125 bus stop, if it came out even, no one would win. The next week becomes chaotic mostly with Hopkins (who bet wasting 49 minutes) and Addison (who bet saving 15 minutes) trying to win their bets by incidents and distractions, whilst annoying quite a lot of their teachers. However eventually all the teachers find out what's going on, especially when Martin accidentally hands in the time wasting sheet instead of his test paper to one of the teachers Mr. Holland by mistake and after a fire drill, no one ends up winning the wager much to Addison's annoyance. Chutzpah The story is about a teenage girl called Eileen Skeates who decides to visit a mixed comprehensive named Shepway school, she causes a lot of chaos during her visit and turns the school into an uproar.

Later after a long chat with each other, the teachers realize what Eileen has been up to and one of them catch her. Whilst being taken to the Headmaster's office, she escapes after the teacher is trying to deal with the sixth form incident that Eileen had caused which allows the girl to sneak away.

The work, by Michael Nyman, is paired with The Protecting Veil by John Tavener featuring Josephine Knight on the cello. The photography and liner notes indicate that Nyman was directly involved in the album (his 31st), the premiere recording of the work, while Tavener, whose piece, eleven years old at the time of the recording, has been recorded more than once, is represented by a headshot and stock commentary from Richard Steinetz. Strong on Oaks, Strong on the Causes of Oaks Strong on Oaks, Strong on the Causes of Oaks, written in 1997, was commissioned from Nyman by the English Sinfonia. The work he gave them is a five-movement orchestral work based on the String Quartet No. 4, which in turn was based on the solo violin work, Yamamoto Perpetuo. The title is derived from the name of the town of Stevenage, where the Sinfonia moved in 1997. The Anglo-Saxon name of the town, \\"Sithenaece\\" means \\"Strong on Oaks.\\" Nyman then took a cue from Tony Blair's campaign slogan (in fact coined by Gordon Brown), \\"Tough on Crime, Tough on the Causes of Crime.\\" He dedicated the work to Simon Jeffes, founder of the Penguin Café Orchestra, and a friend and colleague. Jeffes died on December 11, 1997. Nyman was orchestrating the final page when he learned of his death, and in honor of him, styled 4-note pizzicato chords in the style of Jeffes's ukulele work. The Protecting Veil The Protecting Veil is a work composed by John Tavener in 1987 and premiered in 1989, based on his conversion from the Anglican Church to the Eastern Orthodox Church. It is scored for strings with a solo cello, but unlike in a concerto, the cello part is an \\"endless arch\\" in the style of music from Byzantium rather than being virtuosic.

The company was founded in 1992 as The Northeastern Theatre Ensemble by Zeve Ben Dov and played in Scranton for eight years before moving to Keystone College for four years. Artistic leadership was taken up by David Zarko in 2001, and he continued in that position through the company's final season in 2011. The theatre returned to downtown Scranton in 2005 and began the 2008-2009 season under its new name.http://www.electrictheatre.org/5%20About%20ETC/History.html From 2005 until its demise in 2011, it performed in the old Hotel Jermyn's main ballroom, which was converted into a 99-130 seat, flexible black box theatre. Also within the facility was The Ballroom, a space used for parties, workshops, theatre lab experiments, and classes. ETC closed in June 2011 and was officially disbanded within the following year due to difficulties in maintaining funding levels; although numbers of both donors and audience continued to grow into the final season, dollar amounts fell below a sustainable level. The Electric Theatre Company offered between five and twelve mainstage productions each year from September through May, including a monodrama series called Acting Alone. Among its mainstage projects were at least one, often several, world premieres each season, including works by Mark Medoff and Ed Simpson, and devised creations by Zuppa del Giorno. Other highlights include the first professional production outside of New York City of John Cariani's Almost, Maine and a regular series of radio plays under the rubric, Lackawanna Rails directed and edited by Don Wildman. The production staff was composed of four to six full-time employees, varying numbers of part-time, and a core of volunteers. The artistic company was drawn from a pool of talent from the local region, New York City and Philadelphia, California, and abroad. The theatre was a professional, Equity house that operated under a Small Professional Theatre Contract. Electric Theatre Company also ran an extensive Learning program that included The Griffin Conservatory professional level training for the actor (and director) and In Bocca al Lupo, a study abroad in Italy (more below).

He frequently explores themes of grief, loss, love and friendship. He has also directed much of his own work. Biography Nielsen was brought up near Kingston upon Thames in South London, though he is adopted. He has little contact with his birth family. The parents who raised him were English and Danish, and he has a strong interest in Danish Culture. Nielsen's interest in the media began with acting in school and college theatre productions. Nielsen worked in the US and Africa teaching disadvantaged children drama and video production and creative writing. While attending Epsom School of Art and Design in Surrey he also worked almost full-time at his local cinema in Kingston upon Thames. He won an industrial tribunal against his former employers which enabled him to produce his first film. He has two nephews called Thomas and William. He also supports Arsenal and Liverpool football clubs, the latter because of his connection to Hillsborough. Nielsen is a member of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign. He is also an avid supporter of the independent music band, Rubylux, whom he first saw playing on the streets of Brighton.http://rubylux.net/blog/ Nielsen is a member of the Timber Theatre Improvisational Acting Class, run by Graham Fletcher-Cooke. He also ran some of the classes back in 2005. Early work Nielsen's early work began in Nottingham where he and fellow film director Shane Meadows began directing their low-budget film projects in almost the same week. Nielsen was an early supporter of Meadow's short film festival events in 1996 that were held in the city. Nielsen's first film, Death Comes From The Touch Of The Funnyman was loosely based upon his time spent at Esher College. Filming took place over 18 months and used all the real locations where events had actually occurred. The film was shot on a video format, making it unsuitable for broadcasting. He also directed a number of shorts and workshops while in Nottingham with Best Shot Films and assisted with casting and directing a number of other shorts. On his return to London he directed Waiting For Hillsborough about the Hillsborough football disaster. Nielsen, who lived in the south was compelled to write the play after feeling he was duped by the media about who was to blame for the disaster.http://www.londonscreenwritersfestival.com/speakers/lance-nielsen Nielsen moved back to North London in September 1997 and his work began to focus on theatre. He quickly became the writer in residence at the North London Arts Venue, the Jacksons Lane Theatre, writing and directing two plays a year for the next six years under The Gutted Film and Theatre Company. These included several award-winning productions which included 11 Years Down the River – The Marchioness Inquiry, Those Who Trespass Against Us – The Victoria Climbie Inquiry, and Sticks and Stones, which was a drama set against the conflict in Northern Ireland. The comedy short play Making Time went on to win a Peter Brook award and was praised by the Evening Standard.Evening Standard, Patrick Marmion, 15 February 2002 He also shot a second feature film 30 but was not happy with the result and after limited screenings he withdrew it from release. During this time Nielsen also ghost wrote for a number of biographies and did re-writes on a number of other scripts for films and episodes of television. Nielsen spent a considerable amount of time living and working in Los Angeles. During this time he became friends with actress Sherri Howard and they developed a number of script ideas together. Taking a break In an interview given to the Irish Post, Nielsen announced he intended to take a break from heavy drama, he wrote some comedies and then he turned his hand to musicals writing and directing The East End of Chicago, a musical comedy drama set in the 1920s. The music for the show was written by Richard Erickson. During the production Nielsen was experiencing severe headaches and vomiting. Shortly after the production Nielsen collapsed with a stroke and fit which hospitalised him for three months. It was discovered he had a large blood clot in his brain which left him with minor brain damage and some memory loss. His doctor told him to avoid stress and he did not direct again for two years. Recent work Nielsen directed two plays with Tom Hardy's Shotgun Theatre Company in 2006 and early 2007 respectively and wrote Pressure, the documentary drama about the life of Colin Stagg. This is loosely based on a script he wrote six years earlier for the theatre, which even back then advanced the proposition that Stagg was entirely innocent of the offences he was then accused of. Nielsen was also involved in another production with actors Dan Styles and Gideon Turner called Jericho's Walls Are Falling, which he also wrote and directed. Dan Styles was also the producer of the trailer. Although the trailer was produced, funding for the film was found and lost five times during the 2008 crash and it is now in turnaround. Jericho was wrongly called The Band Plays again in an interview on line Nielsen directed two plays in 2010, 12 Angry Women, with an all female, all ethnic cast, which was a success and Fragile, co-written by Angela Thomas. Fragile was a financial and critical failure. After this Nielsen briefly left the industry, but in February 2012 was invited by his friend Chris Jones, to attend a weekend of the Guerrilla Filmmakers Network that he was running which resulted in him meeting Greek film makers Carmen Zografou, Iria Pizania, Kyriaki Fotiadou, Angela Angelidis and Ioanna Petinaraki. The six of them began producing The Journey which Nielsen was already writing for actor Jason Flemyng. He also wrote a short for the 48-hour Sci-Fi Challenge, 'By The Lake', which was produced by Adele Kirby. He wrote two other scripts in 2012, \\"The Last Submarine\\" and \\"Gaddafi\\" which is about the last ninety minutes of the life of the former Libyan Dictator. He directed a short about Londoners views on Gaddafi in August 2012. He wrote the screenplay of 'We Are Home' which is a drama based on the events which led to the underdog Zambian football team winning the African Cup of Nations in 2012. The script includes the background of the Zambian Air Disaster of 1993.http://www.lancenielsen.co.uk He has no plan to return to theatre until one of these features makes it to the big screen. Nielsen is also making a short documentary about the life of Danny Nicoletta who found fame himself by his association with Harvey Milk in San Francisco. Nielsen plans to tell his story through his Nicoletta's own pictures, taken during his role as a professional photographer over three centuries. He is also making a documentary about the life of Cameron Adams who is better known as Cameron Bay, the porn star infected with HIV. He has completed shooting The Journey with actors Duncan Pow, Dickon Tolson, Mitchell Lewis, Marc Zammit, Lindsey Coulson and Jason Flemyng. The cast also includes Mitchell Lewis in his first major role since Rise of the Footsoldier and Velile Tshabalala from Doctor Who in her first big screen role.thejourneythemovie.com In 2016, Nielsen commenced pre-production on the war film Pegasus Bridge about Operation Deadstick, the mission to capture the Bénouville Bridge across the Caen Canal on 6 June 1944 as part of the Normandy landings of World War II. Dedications Nielsen is known for dedicating his work to friends or actors whom he admires. Many of his dedications have been for people who have inspired him, some of whom have died. He has made dedications to regular collaborators Danny Webb and Jason Flemyng. Two of his plays have been dedicated to Rebecca Holland. His play Making Time was dedicated to the actress Charlotte Coleman, one of stars of the movie Four Weddings and a Funeral. He dedicated The Marchioness Inquiry to Michael Williams; along with his own established acting career Williams is known for being the husband of Dame Judi Dench. Williams met Nielsen earlier in his career at Shepperton Film studios and encouraged him to pursue his writing. Nielsen was also good friends with actress Angela Thomas. Thomas, who had asked Nielsen to co-write both a book and a play based on her life, died on 24 July 2009 of a brain aneurism. Nielsen was one of the friends present during her time in hospital where she fought for but ultimately lost her life over a three-day period. Nielsen produced their unfinished play, Fragile in 2010 which he had to complete without her. It was not a success. The film The Journey is also dedicated to Thomas, and a character loosely based upon her appears briefly in the film and is played by actress Charlene Collins.https://vimeo.com/87888392 References  External links  * 1974 births Living people English screenwriters English male screenwriters English dramatists and playwrights English male dramatists and playwrights ","title":"Lance Nielsen"},{"id":"19188865","text":"Herbert Marshall (1888–1977) was a Canadian academic, statistician, and third Dominion Statistician from 1945 until his retirement in 1956.

Service Forward barbette on Turret on 111-ton gun on proof mount Elswick had already supplied similar guns to Italy's Regia Marina and fitted in the of 1885 and the Royal Navy required parity for its Mediterranean Fleet. The adoption of this gun was influenced by the slow rate of production of the preferred new guns: the Royal Navy had the option of delaying the completion of the new s until sufficient 13.5-inch guns were available to equip them with four guns in two twin barbettes as planned; to use guns, or to equip them with the new guns. The decision made was to install 16.25-inch guns in in 1887 in single barbettes fore and aft, each gun substituting for two 13.5-inch guns. For the following and the 16.25-inch guns were mounted in pairs in a single turret placed forward. Weaknesses such as droop and cracking were discovered in the early design, and the many subsequent changes meant that none of the twelve guns built were identical, so the Mk I denomination was discontinued and the individual guns were referred to by their serial numbers. The great weight, low rate of fire and short life of less than 75 rounds meant that the guns were less than successful and were in fact never fired in action.

Service The 7th Kentucky Infantry Regiment was organized at Camp Dick Robinson and mustered in for a three-year enlistment on September 22, 1861. It was mustered in as the 3rd Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry under the command of Colonel Theophilus Toulmin Garrard. Another regiment was also mustered in as the 3rd Kentucky Infantry, so the designation was changed. Despite the change, members of the regiment continued to refer to it as the 3rd Kentucky Infantry (or \\"Old 3rd\\") well into 1863. The regiment was recruited in Clay, Knox, Laurel, Owsley (including what is now Lee County), and Whitley counties. The regiment was attached to Thomas' Command, Army of the Ohio, to January 1862. 12th Brigade, 1st Division, Army of the Ohio, to March 1862. 24th Brigade, 7th Division, Army of the Ohio, to October 1862. 3rd Brigade, District of West Virginia, Department of the Ohio, to November, 1862. 2nd Brigade, 9th Division, Right Wing, XIII Corps (Old), Department of the Tennessee, to December 1862. 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division, Sherman's Yazoo Expedition, to January 1863. 2nd Brigade, 9th Division, XIII Corps, Army of the Tennessee, to February 1863. 1st Brigade, 9th Division, XIII Corps, to July 1863. 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, XIII Corps, Department of the Tennessee, to August 1863, and Department of the Gulf to November 1863.

District of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to April 1865. Provisional Brigade, District of Baton Rouge, Department of the Gulf, to March 1866. While at Cumberland Gap, supplies ran desperately low. General George W. Morgan ordered a handpicked detachment of 400 men be mounted on artillery and supply wagon horses, and move toward Lexington, Kentucky, to obtain supplies. Colonel Garrard was with these men at a small skirmish at the mouth of Bear Creek. Garrard then left the detachment in the command of Major Isaac N. Cardwell. These men rode into the Battle of Richmond, and were scattered by a rear attack from Scott's Louisiana Cavalry. Some returned to their homes in eastern Kentucky, others rejoined the army at Cumberland Gap, and a small number retreated with the Union forces to Lexington and then to Louisville. Enough men remained to form one company from the 7th Kentucky, one company from the 32nd Kentucky, and one company from the 3rd Tennessee to form Garrard's Detachment at Louisville. (Garrard joined the shattered remains of General William \\"Bull\\" Nelson's army at Louisville.) Many men of the 7th Kentucky were captured and paroled at Richmond, and ordered to report to Cincinnati to await exchange. The 7th Kentucky Infantry mustered out of service in Louisville, Kentucky, on October 5, 1864. On December 24, 1864, veterans of the 7th Kentucky, 19th Kentucky Infantry, and 22nd Kentucky Infantry who reenlisted were organized with new recruits as the 7th Kentucky Veteran Volunteer Infantry in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Credited with breaking down barriers for both women and Jamaican-American motorcyclists, Stringfield was inducted into the Motorcycle Hall of Fame. The award bestowed by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) for \\"Superior Achievement by a Female Motorcyclist\\" is named in her honor.  Early life  Stringfield was born Bessie Beatrice White to Maggie Cherry and James White, living in Edenton, North Carolina. In later years, she created a different version of her life, saying she was born in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1911 to a black Jamaican father and a white Dutch mother, James Ferguson and Maria Ellis. Her birth date has been publicized as February 1911 with the birth name Betsy Leonora Ellis, though her death certificate says she was born in March 1911 in Kingston with parents names as James Richard White and M. Cherry, but a Social Security record has her birth date as March 1912. Other public records verify she was born to Cherry and White in North Carolina. Esther Bennett, Stringfield's niece, told The New York Times in 2018 that Stringfield had lied about her origins. Ann Ferrar, author of Stringfield's authorized biography, said she helped perpetuate some of the stories Stringfield had made up about her life because Stringfield had asked Ferrar \\"to tell her truth as her friend,\\" and that Stringfield \\"running from her early past\\" did not diminish her achievements or inspirational influence on younger generations. In the popular account of Stringfield's life, her family migrated to Boston when she was still young. Her parents died when Stringfield was five and she was adopted and raised by an Irish woman. At the age of 16 Stringfield taught herself to ride her first motorcycle, a 1928 Indian Scout. In 1930, at the age of 19, she commenced traveling across the United States. She made seven more long-distance trips in the US, and eventually rode through the 48 lower states, Europe, Brazil and Haiti. During this time, she earned money from performing motorcycle stunts in carnival shows. Due to her skin color, Stringfield was often denied accommodation while traveling, so she would sleep on her motorcycle at filling stations. Due to her sex, she was refused prizes in flat track races she entered.Bill Kresnak, Motorcycling For Dummies. John Wiley & Sons, July 28, 2008.  World War II and later life  During World War II Stringfield served as a civilian courier for the US Army, carrying documents between domestic army bases. She completed the rigorous training and rode her own blue 61 cubic inch Harley-Davidson. During the four years she worked for the Army, she crossed the United States eight times. She regularly encountered racism during this time, reportedly being deliberately knocked down by a white male in a pickup truck while traveling in the South. In the 1950s Stringfield moved to Miami, Florida, where at first she was told \\"nigger women are not allowed to ride motorcycles\\" by the local police. After repeatedly being pulled over and harassed by officers, she visited the police captain. They went to a nearby park to prove her riding abilities. She gained the captain's approval to ride and did not have any more trouble with the police. She qualified as a nurse there and founded the Iron Horse Motorcycle Club. Her skill and antics at motorcycle shows gained the attention of the local press, leading to the nickname of \\"The Negro Motorcycle Queen\\". This nickname later changed to \\"The Motorcycle Queen of Miami\\", a moniker she carried for the remainder of her life.  Personal life  She married and divorced six times, losing three babies with her first husband. She kept the last name of her third husband, Arthur Stringfield. Stringfield died in 1993 from a heart condition, having kept riding right up until the time of her death. Robert Scott Thomas, whose family had employed Stringfield as a housekeeper when Thomas was a child, was named executor and beneficiary of Stringfield's estate, unaware of any relatives at the time.  Legacy  In 2000 the AMA created the \\"Bessie Stringfield Memorial Award\\" to recognize outstanding achievement by a female motorcyclist. Stringfield was inducted into the Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2002. In 1990 the AMA paid tribute to her in their inaugural \\"Heroes of Harley-Davidson\\" exhibition she having owned 27 of their motorcycles.Ernestine G. Miller, Making Her Mark: Firsts and Milestones in Women's Sports, McGraw-Hill Professional, May 29, 2002. In 2017 Timeline released free and online a short film about Bessie Stringfield, \\"Meet Bessie Stringfield, the Black ‘Motorcycle Queen’\\" In 2018 The New York Times published her obituary.

It was forbidden 1937 in Nazi Germany because of its resistance to Aryan paragraphs and Internationalism, but was founded again in 1947 as \\"Evangelische-Ökumenische St.-Johannes-Bruderschaft\\". The first Apostolischer Vorsteher of the confraternity was Friedrich Heiler (1929-1967). He arranged to receive the episcopal consecration from a bishop of the independent Gallican Church (Petite L'Eglise) in Syrian-orthodox tradition.

And Do They Do is a modern dance work commission by Siobhan Davies and The London Contemporary Dance Theatre, which premiered at Sadler's Wells Theatre on 25 November 1986. Zoo Caprices is a multi-stop violin solo for Alexander Balanescu based on the score for Peter Greenaway's film, A Zed & Two Noughts. The album was issued on LP in 1986 by Ter Records under license from Jay Records. It was issued on compact disc first in 1989 by Ter Records, which had released A Zed & Two Noughts. Jay Records then reissued the album on CD on 15 June 1999. And Do They Do And Do They Do consists of four linked \\"Songs\\" (although none of them are actually sung), that were used for Siobhan Davies's dance production, which the album photos suggest was done entirely in the nude. (The back cover of the booklet shows male full frontal nudity.) However, production photos and a video recording of the first performance in 1987 show that the dancers were fully clothed. The album cover art appears to have been taken from the stage design artwork for the play. The third song, although it has the jazziest qualities, is based on Robert Schumann's Nachtlied Opus 19, No.1, a \\"spin-off\\" from his opera, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, which was written concurrently and in which Schumann's music is an important element of the story. Zoo Caprices Zoo Caprices was written for the virtuosity of Alexander Balanescu, who premiered the work in Paris on 8 April 1986. The score is a reduction of the score for A Zed & Two Noughts, but allows for Balanescu's ability to create multiple harmonies on a single instrument through multiple stops.

(1973). It was also the second single released from the album. A cover version titled Spirits in the Night (spirit being plural), performed by Manfred Mann's Earth Band, was released on the album Nightingales and Bombers and as a Top 40 single. Original version The original version of \\"Spirit in the Night\\" was released on Bruce Springsteen's debut album, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. It was one of the last songs to be written and recorded. Springsteen and producer Mike Appel submitted the finished album to Columbia Records on August 10, 1972, but Clive Davis, president of the record label, was concerned that none of the tracks had the commercial appeal required to be released as a single. Springsteen quickly wrote, and on September 11 recorded, two additional songs, \\"Spirit in the Night\\" and \\"Blinded by the Light\\". Since recording sessions had been completed in late June, most of the band members had since become engaged elsewhere. As a result, the lineup for \\"Spirit in the Night\\" was limited to Vini Lopez on drums, and Springsteen on all other instruments, but featured the addition of Clarence Clemons on saxophone, adding a new dimension to the music. Although most of the songs on Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. were packed with lyrics to the extent that sometimes they overwhelm the musical arrangements, \\"Spirit in the Night\\" has been described as the one song on the album on which the music and narrative fit together. Clemons' sax playing and Lopez' drumming match the freedom and ebullience described in the lyrics. The lyrics themselves describe a group of teenagers—Wild Billy, Hazy Davy, Crazy Janey, Killer Joe, G-Man and Mission Man, who is the person in the song telling the story—going to a spot called \\"Greasy Lake\\" near \\"Route 88\\" for a night of freedom, sex, and drinking. But although their escape to the freedom of Greasy Lake is short lived, the emphasis is on the friends' togetherness. The lyrics of the song echo the Crazy Jane poems of Irish poet William Butler Yeats.  Live performance  Although the release of the song as a single was unsuccessful, \\"Spirit in the Night\\" was a favorite at Springsteen concerts into the 1980s. Live versions of the song have appeared on the 3-CD compilation Live/1975–85 and on both the CD and video versions of Hammersmith Odeon London '75, released in 2006. A version with Springsteen playing the song solo on piano appears on the 2003 DVD Live in Barcelona. This version is memorable as Springsteen has to start the third verse over again after playing the wrong chords on piano. The studio version of the song was released on the compilation album The Essential Bruce Springsteen in 2003. With 572 live performances as of May 2020, \\"Spirit in the Night\\" is by far the most frequently played song from Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. The song live involves important crowd participation, with the audience singing the \\"all night\\" verse during the chorus while Springsteen interacts very closely with the front rows, sometimes even throwing himself into the pit. In the 1970s, the twenty-something Springsteen usually played \\"Spirits\\" third, and nightly ventured out into the audience, sometimes with Clarence Clemmons in tow. Personnel *Bruce Springsteen – vocals, bass, piano, congas, hand claps *Vini \\"Mad Dog\\" Lopez – drums, backing vocals, hand claps *Clarence Clemons – saxophone, backing vocals, hand claps *Harold Wheeler – additional piano Manfred Mann's Earth Band version Manfred Mann's Earth Band covered \\"Spirit in the Night\\" for their album Nightingales and Bombers, with the title \\"Spirits in the Night\\" on the European album and single releases, but \\"Spirit in the Night\\" on the U.S. and Canadian albums and singles. The Manfred Mann version differs from Springsteen's version mostly in its arrangement, relying heavily on keyboards and using different harmonies in the chorus. Billboard compared Manfred Mann's treatment to ELO. The album version, featuring Mick Rogers on vocals, peaked at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1976. The following year, Manfred Mann's Earth Band again released the song as a single with the titles \\"Spirit in the Night\\" (U.S. and Australia) and \\"Spirits in the Night\\" (other parts of the world), this time with vocals by Chris Thompson. That version reached Billboard's Top 40, peaking at #40. This version was released as a bonus track on the 2004 CD release of The Roaring Silence. Also available on 'blue' Roaring Silence LP in the 1970s. \\"Spirit in the Night\\" was to be the first of three songs from the Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. album that Manfred Mann would cover—the others being their number-one hit \\"Blinded by the Light\\" and \\"For You\\". Greasy Lake Greasy Lake, where the action takes place, may be a mythical place. Former E Street Band drummer Vini Lopez has stated that it is actually a composite of two locations that band members used to visit. One was Lake Carasaljo, near the intersection of U.S. Route 9 and New Jersey Route 88 in Lakewood, New Jersey. The other was an unnamed swampy lake near Garden State Parkway exit 88. However, \\"greasers\\" is the local slang term for the homeless, used by Springsteen in the second verse of another favorite, \\"4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy), and \\"Greasy Lake\\", other locals insist, was near Howell, New Jersey, where people bathed and washed dishes. These homeless people were referred to as \\"Gypsy Angels\\" or \\"Spirits in the Night\\". The fun is not in solving these mysteries, it is in the journey. The Greasy Lake in the song inspired a short story named \\"Greasy Lake\\" by T. Coraghessan Boyle. Like Springsteen's characters, Boyle's characters are restless and looking to party, although they have a more dangerous edge than Springsteen's.

At the 2001 census, it had a population of 4,752, increasing slightly to 4,776 at the 2011 Census. The village lies to the north eats of Doncaster Town centre. History Edenthorpe is mentioned in the Domesday Book as a Saxon manor called Stirestrop, later known as Tristrop. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, it became Streethorpe, a village on the street, a road from Doncaster to Goole. The modern derivation of the name came about because of the Eden family (the Eden's of Streethorpe), whose influence in the 1920s, resulted in a shortening of the address into just Edenthorpe. Another story states that Lord Auckland, a member of the Eden family, bought the manor house in 1874 and renamed the estate Edenthorpe, from where the village took its new name. The village's first major residents were the Swyfts, who built the Manor House. In 1605. After the family fortune passed to Mary Swyft, she married Beau Fielding, a member of Charles II's court. Fielding enjoyed the high life; he squandered his wife's money and as a result Streethorpe was sold. After Mary's death, Fielding remarried to a rich widow in the hope of continuing his lavish lifestyle. The widow was an impostor- Fielding had been tricked. On discovering this, he married a third time, to the Duchess of Cleveland, a former mistress of Charles II. Fielding was tried at the Old Bailey for Bigamy, found guilty and subsequently pardoned by the queen. Streethrpe's new owner was a wealthy London Merchant, Daniel Baker; his grandson John Baker- Holroyd, inherited it and sold it to George Cooke-Yarborough in 1769. Between the years of 1770 and 1786 Cooke-Yarborough built the villages Georgian hall. In Victorian times the North and South wings were added and this was all that remained when fire destroyed the Central section in the 1920s. The south wing was converted into a house for Lord and Lady Moncrief, now owners of the estate, on returning to Scotland; the estate was leased to the Eden family. After the Second World War, the two wings came into the ownership of the Hodkins, who converted the north wing into flats. On the death of Mr Hodkin, the estate agents \\"Bell Watson\\" bought the North wing; a Primary school was established in the South wing in 1958. When the flats in the North wing required a considerable amount of money spending on them, the site was sold to the then \\"West Riding County Council\\", who demolished the building and used the land to expand the school. The parish church is the Church of the Good Shepherd, part of a group based in Kirk Sandall which adjoins the village to the north. Village pubs are the Eden Arms on Eden Field Road, the Holly Bush on Church Balk, the Ridgewood (named after the 1949 winner of the St Leger) and the Beverley Inn both on Thorne Road (A18). The Edenthorpe Canon Popham C of E and Hungerhill School are in the village. There is another primary school, Edenthorpe Hall. 47th Edenthorpe Scouts are an active scout group. Pegasus ESU is the Explorer Scout Unit. Geography Edenthorpe is bi-sected by the A18. The A630 passes the south of the village from junction 4 of the M18 and meets the A18 to the west of the village at a roundabout. There is the Kirk Sandall railway station less than a mile away on the Hull and Doncaster Branch and the South Humberside Main Line. From this station you can go direct to Doncaster town centre and to Cleethorpes amongst other destinations.

He was a French astronomer, physicist and traveller. He worked on lens design and crystal optics, inventing the Rochon prism polariser.  Biography  In 1769, Rochon was part of an expedition under Ensign Grenier to find new, quicker maritime routes between Isle de France and India. On 30 May 1769, the expedition departed, with the corvettes Heure du Berger, under Grenier, and Vert-Galant, under Commander La Fontaine. They were bound for Saint-Brandon, where they arrived on 2 June. They then sailed on the 5th Nazareth bank, then on Saya de Malha bank on 5 June, and continued North before sailing West to reach Seychelles, arriving at Mahé on 14 June. they then sailed to Praslin, spending the night of 14 there, and departed on 15. They sailed through the Maldives and arrived at Malabar coast on 29 July, and eventually at Pondichéry on 6 August. From there, Grenier sailed to Sumatra, arriving there on 9 September. He continued to Diego Garcia, where he arrived on 24, and returned to Port Louis on 6 October. Grenier's new route allowed a one-month journey to India, dramatically cutting on the three-month route then known, which made a large detour South before sailing North-West. Grenier was also the first to survey the Seychelles. Publication of the route yielded a polemic between Grenier and Rochon, but the Académie de Marine ended up backing Grenier. On 1 May 177, Rochon departed France on the 56-gun Berryer, under Lieutenant Kerguelen, bound for Isle de France. The new expedition made new surveys of Grenier's route, and found in Grenier's favour.

The name literally means \\"steamed chicken of Andong.\\"  Origin  Andong Gu Market where Andong-jjimdak is believed to be originated There are many speculations on the origin of the dish. One is that it is a specialty food of the inner rich village of Andong during the Joseon period, prepared and eaten for special occasions. Another assumption is that during the 1980s in the Dak golmok (닭골목, literally \\"chicken alley\\") of the \\"Andong Gu Market,\\" restaurant owners there made a dish including ingredients that regulars demanded, which became the current Andong-jjimdak.Andong, the Home of Confucianism and the Noble Class The most plausible speculation among existing assumptions is that merchants of the Dak golmok at the market created the dish to keep their position against the rapid expansion of Western fried chicken shops.  Preparations  A plate of Andong-jjimdak Since Andong-jjimdak is cooked over high heat, it has less fat and can have various tastes by adding diverse ingredients according to recipe. It is popular among students and blue-collar workers due to the abundant portions compared to the price (generally around 20,000 won). Andong-jjimdak is also considered a nutritious dish due to the high protein content from the chicken, and various vitamins provided by the vegetables in the dish. To make the dish, the broth is prepared first by boiling a cleaned chopped chicken, whole garlic, onions, ginger and a type of fresh green chili pepper called \\"Cheongyang gochu\\" (청양고추) altogether in a pot. The pepper is famous for its extreme spiciness and plays an important role in tasting the dish. Cellophane noodles are soaked in water. The cooked chicken is simmered with a sauce made from ganjang, mullyeot (물엿, syrup-like condiment), sugar, and pepper in the broth. Slices of shiitake, and diced carrots, potatoes, and other vegetables are added in the pot and boiled over high heat for ten minutes. Whilst the carrots and potatoes are almost getting cooked, a little amount of wheat flour and spinach, sliced cucumber, scallions and the noodles are added to the pot as well. After cooking, the dish is put on a plate and sesame seeds are spread over it.

Received on 22 January 1939. From 1942 to 1944, von Droste was at the Reichsuniversität Straßburg, which had been founded in 1941 in German re-occupied Alsace, formerly part of France. He held his position there until 1944, when the Allied military forces liberated Strasbourg from German occupation. From 1944 to 1945, he was at Walther Bothe's Institut für Physik (Institute for Physics) of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für medizinische Forschung in Heidelberg.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for von Droste. After World War II, the denazification process began. When Droste faced the proceedings, he turned to Werner Heisenberg, a prominent member of the Uranverein, for testamentary support – a document known as a Persilschein (whitewash certificate).Persilschein a play on words using the name of the German detergent Persil. Heisenberg was a particularly powerful writer of these documents, as he had never been a member of the NSDAP, he had publicly clashed with the NSDAP and the Schutzstaffel (SS), and he had been appointed by the British occupation authorities to the chair for theoretical physics and the directorship of the Max-Planck Institut für Physik then in Göttingen. Heisenberg wrote the document. In February 1947, Droste also requested support from Meitner; for complex reasons, she provided a document carefully vouching for his behavior without commenting on his character. Hahn too provided a Persilschein for von Droste, but Hahn also sent a critical letter to von Droste.Mark Walker German National Socialism and the Quest for Nuclear Power 1939-1949 (Cambridge, 1993), pp. 197–199, 263n57, and 263n52.Ruth Lewin Sime Lise Meitner: A Life in Physics (California, paperback edition, 1997) pp. 350–351.Mark Walker Otto Hahn: Responsibility and Repression, Physics in Perspective Volume 8, 123–124 (2006).Ruth Lewin Sime The Politics of Memory: Otto Hahn and the Third Reich, Physics in Perspective Volume 8, 34 (2006). From 1946 to 1951, von Droste was in the Physics Department of the University of Heidelberg. From 1951 until his retirement in 1973, he was employed at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Federal Physical and Technical Institute), in Braunschweig. He also held a position at the Technische Universität Braunschweig from 1967 to 1972 and was Regierungsdirektor (Government Director) from 1951 to 1973.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for von Droste.Mark Walker Otto Hahn: Responsibility and Repression, Physics in Perspective Volume 8, 124n* (2006).

Kurdish newspaper ends publication after 73 years The newspaper was founded in March 1930. It was the organ of the Kurdish section of the Communist Party of Armenia. At the time, it was a four-page newspaper, published every two weeks and with a circulation of six hundred copies. The editor at the time was Cerdoyê Genco. Publication was discontinued in 1937. In 1955 publication of Rya Teze (in Cyrillic script) was resumed with Miroyi Asad as its editor. As of the early 1970s it was published semiweekly and had a circulation of 2,800. By 1976 circulation reached 5,000. As of the 1980s Rya Teze had a weekly circulation of 4,000 and was read by Kurds across the Soviet Union; a smaller number of readers existed among the Kurds in Europe, who sometimes adopted material from it in their own publications published in Germany and Sweden. In 1989 Tital Muradov took over as editor, and in 1991 the editorship was handed over to Emirike Serdar. Following the disintegration of the Soviet Union the newspaper faced financial difficulties as it no longer received state support. It survived, however. It was converted into a monthly with a circulation of five hundred. In 2000 the script was changed back to Latin alphabet. The newspaper was shut down in 2003 due to economic problems.

Founded in 1909, it is one of the oldest sports associations in Poland.  History  The club, whose hues are white-red-blue, supports two departments - soccer and men's basketball. Soccer team plays in the regional league of the Subcarpathian Voivodeship, while the basketball side plays in the second division, group three. Polonia's basketball team was a powerhouse in Poland in the mid-1990s, when it was second in Poland (1995) and third (1996). The idea of creating a football club came from Lviv (which was under Polish control.) The team itself was created by Z. Ritterschild and J. Theobald. The new organization was formed in the fall of 1909, and adopted the name \\"San\\" - Przemyśl was still under Austrian rule, the name \\"Polonia\\" could not therefore be accepted. The first official meeting of the team 'San' played in 1910, against the team's rival \\"Slavia\\", composed of Czech and Slovak military members in the garrison of Przemyśl. The team \\"San\\" lost \\"inaugural\\" match 2–3. The team is one of the oldest Polish football teams. In the years 1910 -1914 the team played a total of 26 games, including the victory in 1914 against Resovia 2–1. Polonia Przemyśl finished the III liga during the 2012/2013 season 7 out of 16 teams.

(c) Nicholas Hartmann Erich Hartmann (July 29, 1922 in Munich – February 4, 1999 in New York City) was an American photographer. Life in Germany Erich Hartmann was born July 29, 1922 in Munich, Germany, the eldest child of Max and Irma (Blattner) Hartmann who lived in Passau, a small city on the Danube near the Austrian border in which they were one of a five Jewish families. Erich Hartmann's family belonged to the middle class, and his father, a social-democrat who served during World War I and been imprisoned by the British, was highly respected. In 1930, only eight years old, Erich took his first photographs.In The Camps, W.W. Norton Company Life became increasingly difficult after the Nazi takeover in 1933, including personal, financial, business, and family restrictions and the beginning of deportations of Jews to the first so-called 'labor camp' in the village of Dachau. The Hartmann family moved to Munich that year, in search of a more tolerant and cosmopolitan environment. The situation only worsened, however, and the family determined that they had to leave Germany. In August 1938, they accepted the opportunity to emigrate to the United States, having received the necessary affidavit of support from distant relatives there. They sailed from Hamburg to New York, staying initially in Washington Heights, before settling outside Albany, New York. Early photographic work The only English speaker in the family, Erich Hartmann worked in a textile mill in Albany, New York, attending evening high school and later taking night courses at Siena College. On December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the US entered the war, and Erich enlisted in the US Army. Trained in Virginia and at Ohio State University, he had to wait until 1943 before serving in England, Belgium (Battle of the Bulge) and France, and with the liberating forces as a court interpreter at Nazi trials in Cologne, Germany.Biography provided by The United World College of the Adriatic. At the end of the war he moved to New York City where, in 1946, he married Ruth Bains; they had two children, Nicholas (born in 1952) and Celia (born in 1956). During these years, he worked as an assistant to portrait photographer George Feyer, and then as a freelancer. He studied at the New School for Social Research with Charles Leirens, Berenice Abbott, and Alexey Brodovitch. His portrait subjects over the years included architect Walter Gropius, writers Arthur Koestler and Rachel Carson, musicians Leonard Bernstein and Gidon Kremer, actor Marcel Marceau, fellow photographer Ed Feingersh, and many other literary and musical personalities. Music played a great role in his life and work: \\"Music captured me before photography did,\\" he recalled. \\"In my parents' house there was not much music except for a hand-cranked gramophone on which I surreptitiously and repeatedly played a record of arias from \\"Carmen\\". This was before I could read!″Brochure from \\"Music Makers\\" photographic exhibition, The United World College of the Adriatic, Italy, 2000 In the 1950s Hartmann first became known to the wider public for his poetic approach to science, industry and architecture in a series of photo essays for Fortune magazine, beginning with The Deep North, The Building of Saint Lawrence Seaway and Shapes of Sound. He later did similar essays on the poetics of science and technology for French, German and American Geo and other magazines. Throughout his life he traveled widely on assignments for the major magazines of the US, Europe and Japan and for many corporations such as AT&T;, Boeing, Bowater, Citroën, Citibank, Corning Glass, DuPont, European Space Agency, Ford, IBM, Johns Hopkins University, Kimberly-Clark, Pillsbury Company, Nippon Airways, Schlumberger, TWA, and Woolworth, for all of which he used color. In 1952 he was invited to join Magnum Photos, the international photographers’ cooperative founded in 1947 by Robert Capa, David Seymour, George Rodger and Henri Cartier-Bresson, he served on the board of directors from 1967 to 1986, and as President in 1985–1986. Photojournalism and essays His first solo exhibition Sunday with the Bridge, a photographic study of the Brooklyn Bridge, opened at the Museum of the City of New York in 1956. In 1962, his book and exhibition Our Daily Bread toured widely around the United States. Many more exhibits followed over the years, in the United States, Japan, and throughout Europe. He lectured at the International Summer Academy in Salzburg, Austria, at the Syracuse University School of Journalism, and elsewhere, taught at workshops and seminars, and received commendations including the Photokina award (Cologne, Germany), the CRAF International Award (Italy), the Newhouse Citation in Photography (US) and numerous Art Directors Club awards. His principal interest, in photography as in life, was the way in which people relate both to their natural surroundings and to the environments they create. Our Daily Bread and The World of Work were continuing long-term projects. He documented not only industry and technology – glass-making, boat-building, farming, food production, aviation, construction, space exploration, scientific research – but also the human cultural and geographical context: Shakespeare's England, James Joyce's Dublin or Thomas Mann's Venice. \\"Writing with Light\\" (c) Erich Hartmann/Magnum. His personal projects reveal a fascination with the way technology can embody beauty: the abstract patterns of ink drops in water, intimate portraits of tiny precision-manufactured components, or laser light in natural and man-made environments. His obsession with laser light began in the 1970s, Ruth Hartmann remembers: ″He saw there a way to make light truly \\"write\\", to \\"photo\\" \\"graph\\". He began experimenting with diffusing laser light through different kind of glass, through prisms, lenses of all kinds, through faceted doorknobs, breaking the light into pieces to make designs, to write. He then refined his techniques so as to be able to impose a controlled image of concentrated light on landscapes, then on people. This culminated in a major show in New York and other smaller shows.″Ruth Hartmann in \\"Where I was\\", Fotohof Im Otto Müller Verlag publishing company, Austria, 2000 This concern with dehumanization led him undertake in his late years a very personal and intimate project that both honored and transcended memory. In The Camps Auschwitz, Bełżec, Bergen-Belsen, Birkenau, Buchenwald, Bullenhuser Damm, Chełmno, Dachau, Emsland, Belower Wald, Gross Rosen, Majdanek, Mauthausen, Natzweiler, Neuengamme, Ravensbrück, Sachsenhausen, Sobibor, Theresienstadt, Treblinka, Vught, Westerbork... For more than eight weeks in 1994, Erich and Ruth Hartmann undertook a winter journey to photograph the remains of the Nazi concentration and extermination camps, and places of deportation, throughout Europe. He was determined to take only black and white photographs and to capture only what he saw, immediately when arriving, no matter whether days looked like nights. Concentration Camp of Natzweiler-Struthof, France (c) Erich Hartmann/Magnum. He returned to New York with 120 rolls of film, from which he made a first edit of 300 photographs and a final selection of only 74 frames. These, together with text by Ruth Bains Hartmann, formed the book and exhibition In the Camps, published in 1995 in English, French, and German and exhibited in more than twenty venues in the US and Europe in the years since: ″If I have learned any lesson from having been in the remains of the camps,\\" says Hartmann, ″it is that thinking or living for oneself alone has become an unaffordable luxury. Except perhaps in dreams, life no longer takes place on a solitary plane. It is now irrevocably complex, and we, whoever we are, have become intertwined one with the other, whether we like it or not. Acting on that belief may be a more effective tribute to the memory of the dead than mourning alone or vowing that it shall not happen again. And it may also be the most promising way of doing away with the concentration camps. I am not an optimist, but I believe that if we decide that we must link our lives inextricably – that \\"me\\" and \\"them\\" must be replaced by \\"us\\" – we may manage to make a life in which gas chambers will not be used again anywhere and a future in which children, including my granddaughters, will not know what they are.″Erich Hartmann: \\"In the Camps\\" Where I Was In all of his travel, for work and pleasure, Hartmann carried a small camera with a few rolls of black and white film, prepared for every visual opportunity. He also deliberately pursued a series of imaginative projects including experiments with ink in water, stroboscopic light effects, beach pebbles constrained in boxes, and others. In the late 1990s, with an eye to a future retrospective exhibition, Hartmann began making a definitive selection from fifty years of this personal work in black and white. Just a few months before his death he began discussions with a gallery in Austria about organizing an exhibition called \\"Where I Was\\". Ruth Hartmann continued and completed the project after he died, and \\"Where I Was\\" opened at Galerie Fotohof in Salzburg on June 27, 2000, traveling subsequently to Germany, New York, and Tokyo. ″Different from most posthumous exhibits″, writes Ruth Hartmann, ″the beginning, the idea and impetus for this came from the photographer himself in his lifetime and has been realized by others attempting to continue the idea in accordance with his notes″.A few weeks before his death, Erich Hartmann made notes about the topics from his fifty years of work. ″ \\"Where I was\\" was not always a specific geographic spot; it was often a frame of mind, as when he found the mannequin factory and saw there a simple and seemingly innocent metaphor for the dehumanizing horrors of our time. (...) These are personal pictures of a busy working photo-journalist, traveling all the time; home briefly in between. Although much of his assigned work was in color, he was never without a camera loaded with black and white film and a small box of extra rolls, which he used to capture what intrigued and fascinated him always: life in progress, people in their environments, enigmatic, unfinished, ambitious. His devotion to photography was lifelong and intense; he saw pictures everywhere. Taking these personal pictures kept his own course steady even as he worked, with equal devotion, on widely varying assignments which often bred new passions and fascinations, as evidenced in his involvement with the intricate beauties of technology. Some of these pictures here come from such assignments. He was There, too.″Ruth Hartmann in \\"Where I was\\" ″I have earned my living as a magazine photographer and photojournalist″ says Hartmann, ″working in many parts of the world for major magazines and businesses, often on subjects of general interest and most often on topics having to do with high technology. Alongside and intertwined with that photographic life has been another, an exploration mainly of aspects of my middle-class (and now late middle-age) self and some of the forces that had an effect on it. I have chosen autobiography as main theme of my personal work for more than one reason. I believe that I can speak most convincingly of what I have known the longest if perhaps not the best, I have derived from seemingly everyday aspects of an outwardly quiet and undramatic life an endless and rich source of challenge, and I am tempted to believe that the results resonate beyond the specific and personal and speak for other lives as well.″Erich Hartmann's text in \\"Where I was\\" On February 4, 1999 Erich Hartmann died unexpectedly from a heart attack in New York.

History The Manuscript was probably purchased by Archbishop James Ussher, who from 1603 was sent to England on frequent voyages to buy books \\"to furnish the Library of the University of Dublin\\". The name \\"Dublin Virginal Manuscript\\" is modern, and there is no mention of any specific instrument for which the music was intended. Description The manuscript, consisting of 72 pages, is contained in a small oblong volume 5.5 x 7.4 inches. At some time it was bound together with the Dallis Lute Book (of perhaps 1583), but the two volumes are in different hands and the collection of keyboard pieces forms a separate and independent manuscript. The manuscript is undated and its 30 pieces are without titles apart from one, ascribed to a \\"Mastyre Taylere\\". All but four of the pieces are arrangements of popular song and dance tunes found in other, mainly continental sources, such as Tielman Susato, Adrian Le Roy and Petrus Phalesius the Elder. From these, together with stylistic evidence, the manuscript can be dated to circa 1570. Most of the music is written in a neat hand on seven-line staves. That for the right hand is written with a c-clef placed on the first or second line from the bottom. Music for the left hand is written with an f-clef, usually placed on the fourth or fifth line from the bottom. All repetitions are copied out, even if there is no change in the music. The Dublin Virginal Manuscript is important in the history of English keyboard music because of its date, being one of only five English secular keyboard sources that predate William Byrd's My Ladye Nevells Booke of 1591. It is also the second-oldest surviving English source (after the Mulliner Book) of early Almain tunes, of which it contains four. The Dublin Virginal Manuscript also represents an important step in the development of secular English keyboard music from around 1530 to its golden age in the late 16th century, with examples of developing counterpoint in some pieces.[The History of Keyboard Music to 1700, Willi Apel, Hans Tischler, trans.

The encryption key is stored such that no one, not even LaCie that operates the service, can decrypt the stored files. The disadvantage of this is that Wuala has no password recovery and all data processing needs to be done in the client (for example creating a search index). The advantage is significantly improved privacy. Since the source code to Wuala has not been released, it is difficult to ensure that the software does what it states it does (including proper client-side encryption). Also, updates are pushed automatically to the client machine. These facts mean that users of Wuala are not safe from possible backdoors in code.

Frederick Collins, was a prominent early American experimenter in wireless telephony and prolific author of books and articles covering a wide range of scientific and technical subjects. His reputation was tarnished in 1913 when he was convicted of mail fraud related to stock promotion. However, after serving a year in prison, he returned to writing, including, beginning in 1922, The Radio Amateur's Handbook, which continued to be updated and published until the mid-1980s. Early life Collins was born in South Bend, Indiana, to Captain Thomas Jefferson and Margaret Ann (Roller) Collins. He attended public schools and graduated from the Old University of Chicago, a Baptist school which preceded the present University of Chicago.\\"Collins, A(rchie) Frederick\\", Who's Who in America, vol. 11, 1920-1921, page 595. His brother was author Dr. Thomas Byard Collins. After graduating, he began working for the Thomson-Houston Electric Company in Chicago in 1888. He married Evelyn Bandy on June 28, 1897, and they had a son, Virgil Dewey Collins, who also became an author, sharing writing credits on some of his father's books. Collins resided at a summer home called \\"The Antlers\\" in Rockland County, New York, in the hamlet of Congers, and had a second residence in Florida. His winter residence was New York City, and he died in Nyack, New York.  Wireless telegraphy  Collins conducting experiment to use a human brain as a radio wave detector Collins professional interests focused on radio, an exciting technology which was in its early stage during his lifetime. Heinrich Hertz had discovered radio waves in 1887, and Guglielmo Marconi developed the first practical radiotelegraph transmitters and receivers in 1895. Collins became an expert in radio technology, writing many books on the subject, and conducting research on improving radio components. An unusual example were his experiments in using brain tissue to detect radio waves. The first radio receivers prior to 1904 used a primitive device called a coherer to detect the radio waves. The poor performance of the coherer led to much research to find a better radio wave detector. Collins was intrigued by reports of people \\"predicting weather\\" by aches and pains in their body, and examples of lightning strikes, which were strong sources of radio waves, causing convulsions in nearby people who were not actually struck. Since the brain was known to operate electrically, Collins thought it might be sensitive to radio waves. He applied DC current from a battery to two electrodes in dissected animal brains, causing a small current through the tissue, as in a coherer. Then he radiated the brain with pulses of radio waves from a Hertzian spark radio transmitter, and listened with earphones to the circuit. If the radio waves caused changes in the conductivity of the neural tissue, it would cause transient changes in the current, which would be audible as \\"clicks\\" in the earphones. His research culminated in experiments on a fresh human brain from a cadaver. Collins claimed that the brain had a 'cohering' effect, its conductivity changed when irradiated. However other researchers were unable to reproduce the effect. Wireless telephony Collins demonstrating an induction wireless telephone (circa 1903)\\"Wireless Telephony\\" by A. Frederick Collins, The Technical World, March 1905, page 6. The \\"spark\\" radio transmitters during Collins time could not transmit sound (audio) as modern AM and FM radio transmitters do. This was because the discharge of a spark cannot produce continuous waves, but only damped waves. Instead they transmitted information by telegraphy, the operator turned the transmitter off and on by tapping on a switch called a telegraph key to produce different length pulses of damped radio waves, to spell out text messages in Morse code. By the last years of the century, many wireless researchers such as Reginald Fessenden, Ernst Ruhmer, William Dubilier, Quirino Majorana, and Valdemar Poulsen were working to develop continuous wave transmitters which could be modulated to carry sound, radiotelephony. Collins began researching the topic on his own in 1898. In November 1899, the American Wireless Telephone and Telegraph Company, headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was founded by stock promoter Dr. Gustav P. Gehring as the first American radio communications firm. Initially Collins acted as that company's primary technical advisor, however, he soon had a falling-out and left the firm, even demanding that his photograph in a company prospectus be altered to make him unrecognizable.\\"Wireless Telegraphy that Sends No Messages Except By Wire\\", New York Herald, October 28, 1901, p. 4. (fultonhistory.com) Collins returned to doing his own research, investigating, in turn, wireless telephone systems that employed conduction, induction, and finally radio waves. He established a small laboratory at No. 132 South Sixth street in Philadelphia, forming a developmental company that initially was privately financed and did not sell stock to the public.\\"Telephoning: Via Mother Earth Without Wires System Being Perfected\\", Honolulu Independent, September 4, 1900, p. 4. After doing initial tests within a bowl of water,\\"Wireless 'Phones First Real Test\\", New York World, July 21, 1903, p. 12. he reported that he then made steady, although somewhat limited, progress with the conduction and induction approaches, achieving transmission distances of 60 meters (200 feet) in 1899, 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) across the Delaware River in 1900, and 5 kilometers (3 miles) in 1902. That same year he constructed two experimental stations at Rockland Lake, New York, separated by 1.5 kilometers (1 mile), that successfully established two- way communication. In 1903, he made short-distance tests in the Hudson River in New York City, aboard the ferryboats John G. McCullough and Ridgewood, and in July of that year predicted that \\"in a comparatively short space of time I am confident I shall telephone across the ocean\\". Collins' conduction and induction wireless telephone apparatus was similar to that employed by Alexander Graham Bell, Amos Dolbear and Nathan Stubblefield. Bell's work never went beyond the demonstration stage, and Dolbear's patent, controlled by the American Wireless Telephone and Telegraph Company, was ruled by the U.S. courts be largely impractical. In 1902 Stubblefield sold the rights to his system to the newly formed Wireless Telephone Company of America, and by August that company's advertisements stated that \\"Nathan Stubblefield and Prof. A. Frederick Collins are now working together for the sole benefit of that company\\",\\"Personal\\", Western Electrician, August 30, 1902, p. 145. and there were plans to \\"license subsidiary companies in each state of the Union\\".\\"Wireless Telephone Company of America\\" (advertisement), Paducah (Kentucky) Sun, August 7, 1902, page 4. However, Stubblefield had actually withdrawn from the firm in June, due to his concerns that it was primarily a fraudulent stock promotion scheme.Kentucky Farmer Invents Wireless Telephone by Bob Lochte, 2001, p. 74. In May 1903, Collins formed the Collins Marine Wireless Telephone Company, which was later renamed the Collins Wireless Telephone Company,Wireless Communication in the United States by Thorn L. Mayes, 1989, p. 95. and served as technical director until 1910. Despite Collins' initial optimism, he had no more success than the others in developing a commercial system using conduction or induction transmissions, due to the inherent limitations of these technologies. He next began developing a radiotelephone that employed continuous-wave radio signals. In 1904, Danish inventor Valdemar Poulsen had introduced the arc-transmitter, which, unlike the intermittent pulses produced by spark transmitters, created steady signals that could be used for amplitude modulated (AM) audio transmissions. Poulsen had sold the U.S. rights to his patents to the Federal Telegraph Company, but Collins claimed that he had independently begun research on the same idea in 1902. Collins was granted U.S. patent 814,942 on March 13, 1906, for an arc-transmitter improvement which separated the telephone microphone circuit from the arc circuit, to avoid the problem of the arc current burning out the microphone.U.S. Patent 814,942, \\"Wireless Telephony.\\" Filing date: August 21, 1905. Issue date: March 13, 1906. Retrieved November 1, 2008. Although this was merely an incremental improvement on existing arc-transmitter technology, the company's stock promotion advertisements claimed this patent was \\"a broad one, covering the fundamental principles for transmitting and receiving articulate speech without connecting wires\\" that was supposedly \\"considered by the highest authorities on patent law to be one of the strongest to be issued since the one granted to Bell in 1876\\".\\"The Collins Wireless Telephone Company\\" (advertisement), Los Angeles Herald, February 23, 1908, Part II, p. 7. (Early purchasers of Bell telephone stock had reaped fortunes, so it was a common tactic for early radio company stock promotions, aimed at impressionable \\"get- rich-quick\\" buyers, to suggest that similar increases would occur).\\"Fools and Their Money\\" (fourth article) by Frank Fayant, Success, January 1907, p. 11. The electromagnetic radiation (radio waves) produced by arc-transmitters was created by an electric arc burning between two electrodes. In Collins' case the electrodes rotated in opposite directions, to provide even wear of their surfaces, thus was called a \\"revolving oscillating arc\\".Wireless Telegraphy and High Frequency Electricity by H. LaV. Twining (Wireless Telephony chapter by William Dubilier), 1909, pp. 188–193. Collins also developed multiple unit water-cooled microphones which could carry heavier currents of 8 to 10 amperes. For a receiver, he used a thermo-electric detector of his own design. Collins began making demonstration radiotelephone transmissions from his lab at 51 Clinton Street in Newark, New Jersey, that were sent to increasingly distant locations. On July 9, 1908, a test was heard at the Singer Building in New York City, 19 kilometers (12 miles) away. Transmissions over the next two days were reportedly received in Congers, New York, 56 kilometers (35 miles) distant, and Philadelphia, a distance of 130 kilometers (81 miles).\\"The Collins System of Long-distance Wireless Telephony\\", Scientific American, September 19, 1908, pp. 185–186. After witnessing an October, 1908 demonstration at the New York Electrical Show, Guglielmo Marconi was quoted as saying: \\"Wireless telephony is an accomplished fact, and to Mr. Collins is due the credit of its invention... The clarity of the transmitted voice is marvelous.\\"\\"The Collins Wireless Telephone at the Electrical Show\\", The Edison Monthly (The New York Edison Company), October 1908, Volume 1, no. 6, pp. 151–152. In 1909, Collins claimed that his company had established four radiotelephone links operating simultaneously between Portland, Maine, and a nearby island, although there is little evidence that this was true. That same year he exhibited his wireless telephone at the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition and was awarded a gold medal. Despite Collins' reported successes, his efforts actually fell short of creating a commercially viable radiotelephone. This was also true for other experimenters doing arc- transmitter radiotelephone research during this period, including Lee de Forest and Charles Herrold. Despite their best efforts, arc-transmitters would prove to be too unrefined to be usable for audio transmissions, and a successful radiotelephone would not be realized until vacuum-tube transmitters were developed in the mid-1910s. In December 1909, the Collins Wireless Telephone Company was merged with three others—the Pacific Wireless Telegraph Company, the Clark Wireless Telegraph Company, and the Massie Wireless Telegraph Company—to form the Continental Wireless Telephone and Telegraph Company, with Collins the new company's Technical Director. Advertisements claimed that Continental was in the process of creating a nationwide service. However, in view of the increasingly shady reputation of its officers, both Walter Massie and Thomas Clark soon withdrew from participation. Mail fraud prosecution Advertisement for the Collins wireless phone for automobiles. Collins participated in demonstrations promoting stock sales, which over time included extravagant and misleading claims. A common company tactic was to set up a demonstration at a hotel in a targeted town, and, after successfully talking between two rooms using the short-range induction system, claim that a community-wide radiotelephone exchange had also been perfected, and would be installed pending financing by local stock sales. These tests were widely publicized, featuring promotional photographs of prominent persons, including William Jennings Bryan and U.S. President William Howard Taft, using the company's devices. The company also claimed that soon \\"every auto will be provided with a portable wireless telephone\\".\\"The Collins Wireless Telephone\\" by William Dubilier, Modern Electrics, August 1908, p. 151. However, the radiotelephone systems were never actually constructed. Concerned by excesses in the radio communications industry, the U.S. federal government instituted a series of prosecutions, and in June 1910 inspectors from the United States Postal Department began making arrests, beginning with officials of the notorious United Wireless Telegraph Company. In December 1911 Collins and three of his associates were arrested, and charged with mail fraud in connection with the promotion of both Collins Wireless and its Continental Wireless successor.\\"Swindled Out of $40,000,000\\" Norwich (Connecticut) Bulletin, November 22, 1910, p. 1. The indictment charges included overstating the scope of the company's patents, and also fraudulently claiming that its radiotelephone equipment had been perfected to the point that it was ready for widespread commercial deployment. In a trial that ended in early 1913, Collins was one of the three defendants found guilty, and was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, although he would be released after serving one year. Publications Cover of The Boys' Book of Submarines. Collins began his writing career in 1901, and his articles about wireless telephony appeared in Electrical World, Scientific American, Encyclopedia Americana, and other encyclopedias. He also wrote numerous technical articles and books on wireless telegraphy and telephony in the first two decades of the 20th century. His 1913 Manual of Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony provided a detailed and illustrated explanation of his electric arc wireless telephone transmitter and receiver, along with a general coverage of the state of the art. Following his release from prison in 1914, Collins did no further work as an electrical engineer. Embittered by his treatment, in 1917 his wife, Evelyn, filed for a separation, stating that Collins \\"had come back to freedom... with his disposition ruined\\", \\"soured against the world, soured against even his benefactors, and soured against her\\", and engaging in \\"long harangues and tirades of invectives against the world in general and the United States government in particular\\".\\"His Prison Grouch Wrecks Own Home: Wife Says Jail Made Collins, Wireless Inventor, a Misanthrope\\", New York Sun, August 5, 1917, Section 2, p. 1. However, he eventually re-established himself, and, appearing as himself in one of his juvenile novels, proclaimed that although he had suffered \\"hard falls\\" and was \\"stoop-shouldered\\" from \\"the weight of his own tragedies\\", he was persevering because he was \\"a bit battle scarred but my skin is as thick as that of a rhinoceros\\".Jack Heaton: Wireless Operator by A. Frederick Collins, 1919, pp. 231–232. He continued authoring an impressive number of books covering a variety of topics, many intended for younger readers. In particular, he was an enthusiastic proponent of amateur radio, writing in the 1915 The Book of Wireless that \\"All you need to become a member of the great and growing army of wireless boys is the desire to own a station, and the rest is easy\\", while offering to personally answer any letters requesting assistance with technical problems.The Book of Wireless by A. Frederick Collins, 1915, p. viii. In 1922 his The Radio Amateur's Hand Book was introduced, which was reprinted in at least 15 revised editions over the next 61 years. In the fiction arena, his three-part \\"Jack Heaton\\" adventure series reviewed its title character's exploits as a Wireless Operator (1919), Oil Prospector (1920) and Gold Seeker (1921).The Jack Heaton Series (c.web.umkc.edu) However, most of his works were non-fiction. By 1919 his books included Inventing for Boys, Handicraft for Boys, and The Boys' Book of Submarines. The 1922 edition of The Book of Wireless Telegraph and Telephone lists 22 additional titles, ranging from Boys' and Girls' Book of Outdoor Games to numerous scientific and technical subjects, including The Amateur Chemist and Gas, Gasoline and Oil Engines. Many of his books, such as The Boy Scientist, (1925) had comprehensive illustrations and few equations, with an emphasis on \\"hands-on\\" experimentation, at a level intended for high school students. After discussing the \\"Einstein Theory,\\" Collins tells his readers how to build a spectroscope, a radio receiver, and an x-ray machine for home experimentation. Inventing Modern: Growing Up with X-Rays, Skyscrapers, and Tailfins., Lienhard, John H. Oxford University Press U.S., 2003, pp. 198–199. . In 1941, a book review reported that \\"A. Frederick Collins has to his credit some 37 'self-help' and practical books ranking from chemistry and electricity and the stars to household mechanics, your car, and gardening.\\"\\"Home Repair Manual\\", The (Madison) Wisconsin State Journal, November 2, 1941, p. 11. He eventually wrote about 100 books on scientific and technical subjects, hobbies, and sports, plus over 500 articles in technical and scientific magazines and journals. Legacy The only surviving Collins Wireless Telephone, c. 1908, SPARK Museum of Electrical Invention, Bellingham, Washington, U.S. Collins' writings played an important role in disseminating information about early radio advances (then known as \\"wireless telegraphy and telephony\\"), and, in the foreword to 1922 edition of The Radio Amateur's Hand Book, he included \\"Historian of Wireless 1901–1910\\" among his accomplishments. (He also claimed the title of \\"Inventor of the Wireless Telephone 1899\\"). Donald McNicol, who would later serve as president of the Institute of Radio Engineers, stated that Collins' \\"How to Construct An Efficient Wireless Telegraph Apparatus at Small Cost\\", which appeared in a 1902 issue of the Scientific American Supplement, \\"did more to introduce the art of amateur radio than anything else that had appeared\\".\\"The Early Days of Radio in America\\" by Donald McNicol, The Electrical Experimenter, April 1917, pp. 893, 911. McNicols later expanded his remarks, writing: \\"amateur experimenters in wireless were at that early date provided with descriptive text enabling them to set up equipment for the duplication of experiments performed by the foremost workers. Undoubtedly Collins's articles on wireless started many of the amateurs and engineers on the road to whatever success they achieved\\".Radio's Conquest of Space by Donald McNicol, 1946, pp. 228–229. Alan MacDiarmid, the 2000 Nobel Prize Laureate in chemistry, said that Collins' 1924 book The Boy Chemist so inspired him as a boy in New Zealand that he kept renewing it from the public library for almost a full year in order to complete all the experiments.\\"Alan MacDiarmid: Plastic Fantastic\\" by John Campbell, October 10, 2001.

The battalion is now subordinate to the 655th Regional Support Group of the 316th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary).316th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary), United States Army Reserve. Retrieved 21 June 2016. Activated in 1971 as the 167th Support Group (Corps), it was reorganised as a battalion in 2006. The 167th is a logistical support battalion capable of a variety of actions, capable of independent operations and taking on subordinate units to fulfill a larger scale sustainment operation for the United States Army.  Organization  Due to the battalion's modular design, it is also capable of gaining additional subordinate units upon deployment to a theatre of operations.  History  Established at Grenier Field U.S. Army Reserve Center, on Galaxy Way, on the grounds of Manchester-Boston Regional Airport (the former Grenier Air Force Base), the 167th Support Group used a nominal Manchester, New Hampshire postal address, although that portion of the airport was on the Londonderry side of the city boundary. In 1980, the peacetime Army Reserve chain of command was overlaid with a CAPSTONE wartime trace. In an expansion of the roundout and affiliation program begun ten years earlier, CAPSTONE purported to align every Army Reserve unit with the active and reserve component units with which they were anticipated to deploy.James T. Currie and Richard B. Crossland, Twice The Citizen: A History of the United States Army Reserve, 1908–1995 (2nd revised & expanded edition), Washington, DC: Office of the Chief, Army Reserve (1997), pp. 254–255. Like other Army Reserve units, the 167th Support Group maintained lines of communication with the units – often hundreds or thousands of miles away in peacetime – who would presumably serve above or below them in the event of mobilization. This communication, in some cases, extended to coordinated annual training opportunities. Many of the 167th's units and individual soldiers rotated through Honduras in the 1980s. Operation Fuertes Caminos (\\"strong roads\\") provided villagers with roads on which to move their crops to market, while providing invaluable real-world training and experience to reserve engineers, medical personnel, logisticians and others. Operation Nordic Shield was held in the summer of 1987. Units of the 94th Army Reserve Command; principally the 167th Support Group, the 187th Infantry Brigade (Separate), and their subordinate battalions and companies; deployed to Canadian Forces Base Gagetown in southern New Brunswick, to simulate the defense of Iceland against Warsaw Pact forces, the CAPSTONE mission of both the 187th and 167th. Units under the 167th participated in a series of mobilization exercises in the 1980s, including the Selected Reserve Call-Up (23–25 October 1987), Golden Thrust '88 (November 1988), and Proud Eagle 90 (12 October through 2 November 1989). Each of these was designed to evaluate not only the units' ability to prepare to mobilize, but to examine the mobilization processes, systems, and logistical coordination so as to find and correct the unanticipated flaws. In 1990–1991, many of the soldiers from the 167th Support Group's units were called to active duty and served both domestically and overseas in support of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Despite the commonly held belief that CAPSTONE traces were set in stone, the process of selecting units to mobilize and deploy largely ignored CAPSTONE. Operation Nordic Shield II was held in the summer of 1992. As they did five years before, the 167th Support Group, 187th Infantry Brigade and other units of the 94th ARCOM deployed to Canadian Forces Base Gagetown in southern New Brunswick, to simulate the defense of Iceland against Warsaw Pact forces, the CAPSTONE mission of both the 187th and 167th. Part of the 1992 exercise included lanes training as part of the United States Army Forces Command's \\"Bold Shift\\" initiative to reinforce unit war-fighting task proficiency. In the 1990s, the airport's expansion necessitated a land-swap between the airport authority and the federal government, resulting in a new Army Reserve Center being built on the south edge of the airport's periphery. Since relocating, the 167th and its co-located units use a Londonderry postal address. The 167th Support Group deployed soldiers to Honduras and Guatemala in 1999 in support of Operation New Horizon.  Global War on Terror  In 2003, the 167th Corps Support Group was mobilized in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and deployed to the Persian Gulf in February 2004. In March 2004, the 167th deployed into Iraq, to FOB Speicher. In 2006, the group was reorganised as a battalion.

He was educated in the public schools of Michigan and at the Business College of Utica, New York. From 1867 to 1870, he was in the employ of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad between Utica and Binghamton. On November 11, 1873, he married Gertrude Hollenbeck (d. 1903). In 1875, he was appointed Assistant to Chief Engineer Thomas W. Spencer of the Utica and Black River Railroad. After Spencer's resignation, Bond became Chief Engineer, a position he held until 1886. He was in charge of the construction of the railroad from Louisville, New York to Clayton, New York and Ogdensburg, New York. In 1886, he was appointed Chief Engineer and General Manager of the Carthage and Adirondack Railroad from Carthage, New York to Benson Mines and the Oswegatchie River.

Released in 1908 as the Colt Army Special, the revolver was renamed the \\"Colt's Official Police\\" in 1927 in order to better market to law enforcement agencies. It became one of the best selling police firearms of all time, eventually in the 1950s coming to exemplify typical law enforcement officer weaponry.“Colt's Official Police Revolver” , Shooting Times magazine Web site – Handgun Reviews. Accessed August 13, 2008. The Official Police was also used by various U.S. and allied military forces during World War II. Development and history As the 20th Century began, the older .32 caliber revolvers which had been standard-issue for the majority of American police departments began to be phased out in favor of the larger-bore .38 caliber. In 1908 Colt introduced a sleek and modernized revolver they dubbed the Army Special, which in the powerful (for the time) and popular .38 Special quickly became the issue service revolver of many departments.Ayoob, Massad. “The Colt Official Police: 61 years of production, 99 years of service”, Guns magazine. BNET Web site – Find articles. Accessed August 13, 2008.“Colt Official Police” , Bellum Web site. Accessed August 20, 2008. During the same period, revolvers began to fall out of favor with the U.S. Military, especially after the adoption on the U.S. Model of 1911 semi-automatic pistol. As military sales of their revolvers dropped off, Colt searched for an alternative market and realized the popularity and strong sales of their product line with civilian law enforcement agencies could form their replacement market. By 1927 the overwhelming sales of two popular models, the Army Special and Colt Police Positive, had assured Colt's dominance of the law enforcement firearms market. Colt's marketing strategy was further fine-tuned by making a few superficial alterations to the Army Special revolver and then renaming it as the “Official Police” model. The changes included adding checkering to the trigger, matting the topstrap of the frame and widening the rear sight groove. Colt also upgraded the quality of the gun's finish from a dull blued finish to a highly polished blued surface. In 1930, Colt scored a marketing coup when they publicized that their Official Police model could easily handle the firing of heavily loaded .38 rounds intended for competitor Smith & Wesson's new large N-frame revolver, the .38-44, none of the comparable S&W; revolvers could manage this feat. By 1933 the Colt sales catalog listed many law enforcement agencies as having adopted the OP as a sidearm, including the New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Kansas City police departments. In addition many state police organizations and even the Federal Bureau of Investigation chose the OP as their issue revolver. The U.S. Army also bought some of the revolvers, issuing them to military police and to federal agencies in need of a revolver for their armed agents, such as the Treasury Department, Coast Guard, and the Postal Inspection Service. Many Official Police revolvers were also bought by the police forces and militaries of various South American countries. Between May 1940 and June 1941, 49,764 Official Police revolvers in .38 New Police or .38/200 caliber were purchased by the British Purchasing Commission and shipped to the United Kingdom for use by British and Commonwealth armed forces as a substitute standard sidearm. These revolvers bore British military acceptance markings and had a 5\\" barrel; the butt was fitted with a military-style lanyard ring. Most of these OP revolvers were assembled from commercial-grade parts made before 1942.Pate, Charles, U.S. Handguns of World War II, Andrew Mowbray Publishing, , When the U.S. became involved in World War II, the U.S. government requested contracts to supply .38 revolvers required for arming security personnel charged with the security of government buildings, shipyards, and defense plant installations against sabotage or theft. Commencing in 1941, small quantities of the .38 Colt Official Police were procured directly from the Defense Supplies Corporation (DSC). When government purchasing officials objected to production delays of the OP, as well as the unit cost, Colt responded by simplifying the gun. Savings were achieved by eliminating all unnecessary exterior polishing operations, substituting a smooth-face trigger and hammer, and fitting the gun with simplified checkered wood grips with the Colt medallion; the latter was soon replaced by 'Coltwood' molded plastic grips. Instead of the normal bluing, the revolver was given a dull parkerized finish. Dubbed the Colt Commando, the weapon was primarily used to arm units of Military police, security guards at U.S. defense plant installations and shipyards, as well as limited clandestine issue to agencies involved in overseas espionage and military intelligence.“Colt Commando” , Bellum Web site. Accessed August 21, 2008. In mid-1942 the Springfield Ordnance District (SOD) was given control over procurement and distribution of the Commando, which transferred the revolvers to the end user. A few Commandos were shipped to the U.S. Maritime Commission and used as small arms equipment on U.S. merchant ships and ships provided to the Allies under Lend-Lease.Pate, Charles, The World War II Commando Revolver , Man At Arms Magazine, Mowbray Publishing (October 1997), retrieved 3 April 2011 Most Commando wartime production went to the Defense Supplies Corporation (DSC).Pate, Charles, The World War II Commando Revolver, Man At Arms Magazine, Mowbray Publishing (October 1997), retrieved 3 April 2011 for use by security and police forces, while approximately 1,800 Commandos were used by the U.S. Navy, with another 12,800 revolvers distributed to various military intelligence agencies. Control over procurement changed in 1944, after the DSC formally objected to being charged additional handling fees by the armed forces, and was then authorized to procure the Commando directly from Colt. After the Allied victory, Colt resumed commercial production and returned to the prewar polished blued finish, but retained the plastic grips which they labeled “Coltwood” until 1954 when the checkered wooden grips were reintroduced. During the postwar period, Colt fell on difficult financial times and the company introduced few new models. At Smith & Wesson, both output and new model civilian and police sales improved, and the sales margin gap between the two corporations progressively tightened. Finally in the 1960s S&W; took over the lead. A contributing factor to this change may have been Smith & Wesson's generally lower cost per unit, accompanied by a double-action trigger pull on their military & police model that was preferred by many agencies teaching the new combat-oriented double-action revolver training. Colt announced the discontinuation of the Official Police in 1969, stating that competitive production of the design was no longer economically feasible. With a total production of over 400,000 pistols, the Official Police ranks as one of the most successful handguns ever made. Features The Official Police was machined of fine carbon steel, with bright royal Colt blued as well as nickel- plated finishes, and was offered in barrels. Built on Colt's .41 or “E” frame, it was manufactured in a variety of chamberings including .22 LR, .32-20 (discontinued in 1942), .41 Long Colt (discontinued in 1938), and the most common and popular, the .38 Special. Colt's “Positive Lock” firing pin block safety was a standard feature of the revolver, preventing the firing pin from striking the primer unless the trigger was deliberately pulled. The pistol's sights consisted of a blade front with a fixed iron open rear sight, which was a simple V-notch shaped groove milled into the revolver's top strap. The top strap had a matte finish to reduce glare down the sight plane. Variants Commando The Commando was a wartime variant of the Official Police, manufactured with either a two or four inch barrel, and incorporating several production economies including a non-gloss Parkerized finish. The Commando also lacked the usual metal checkering on the hammer, trigger, and cylinder latch, as well as the reflection-deadening treatment of the commercial version's top strap. In addition, plastic material replaced the wood grips of the civilian model. Approximately 48,611 Commando revolvers were purchased by the government during World War II.“The World War II Commando Revolver” , Man at Arms Web site. Accessed August 21, 2008. Of this total, approximately 12,800 Commando revolvers were issued to various intelligence services such as US Military intelligence and the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Many of the latter were procured with the two-inch barrel, referred to as the “Junior Commando”. A few Commandos saw service overseas in the war zone. Regular production deliveries of two-inch \\"Junior Commando\\" revolvers began in March 1943, at approximately serial number 9,000. More than 12,000 of the two-inch Commandos encountered today are actually postwar conversions from four-inch models produced during the war. Marshal A rare variant featuring a rounded grip, with barrel lengths of two and four inches. With a very limited production run of 2,500 units produced from 1955-1956, the Marshal became a true collectable. MK III The moniker “Official Police” was borrowed by one model in a new generation of revolvers Colt introduced in the late1960s, called the “MK III” series. MK III models consisted of simpler versions of several classic Colt revolvers with updated lockwork.“Colt mk. III revolvers: Trooper, Lawman, Official Police (USA)” , World.guns.ru Web site. Accessed August 21, 2008. The MK III product line was actually a different and original design based on a new “J” frame, which failed to attain commercial success and was cancelled after only three years.

It was developed and written by Anthony van der Craats, a system analyst and life member of the Proportional Representation Society of Australia. It is described in a submission into a parliamentary review of the 2007 Australian federal election.House of Representatives Committees - Inquiry into the 2007 Federal Election, Submission number 51, Mr Anthony van der Craats The aim of the system is to provide an alternative to various methods of segmentation and distribution of preferences associated with the exclusion of a candidate from the count. It is named after Jack Wright, former president of the Proportional Representation Society of Australia. Overview The Wright System fulfills the first of the two principles identified by Brian Meek: *Principle 1. If a candidate is excluded from the count, all ballots are treated as if that candidate had never stood. *Principle 2. If a candidate has achieved the quota, they retain a fixed proportion of the value of every vote received, and transfers the remainder to the next non-excluded continuing candidate, the value of the retained total equalling the quota. As regards the second principle it differs in not transferring surpluses to already-elected candidates, a procedure criticised by Meek, but which does make hand-counting more practicable. The system uses the optional Droop quota (the integer value of the total number of votes divided by one more than the number of vacant positions plus one) and the Gregory method of weighted surplus transfer value of the vote in calculating a candidate's surplus transfer value which is then multiplied by the value of each vote received by the candidates whose votes are to be redistributed, as is the case in the Western Australian upper-house elections. Unlike the Western Australian upper-house electoral system, the Wright System uses a reiterative counting process that differs from the Meek's method as an alternative to the method of segmentation and distribution of excluded candidates' votes. On every exclusion of a candidate from the count, the counting of the ballot is reset and all valid votes are redistributed to candidates remaining in the count initially at full value. In each iteration of the count, votes are first distributed according to the voter's first available preference, with each vote assigned a value of one and the total number of votes tabulated for each candidate and the quota calculated on the value of the total number of valid votes using the Droop quota method. Any candidate that has a total value equal or greater than the quota is provisionally declared elected and their surplus value distributed according to the voter's nominated subsequent preference. If the number of vacancies are filled on the first distribution the results of the election are declared with all provisionally declared candidates being declared the winner of the election. If the number of candidates provisionally declared elected is less than the number of vacancies and all candidates' surplus votes have been distributed then the candidate with the lowest value of votes is excluded from the count. The ballot is reset and the process of redistribution restarted with ballot papers being redistributed again according to the voters next available preference allocated to any continuing candidate. This process repeats itself until all vacancies are filled in a single count without the need for any further exclusions. The Wright System takes into account optional preferential voting in that any votes that do not express a valid preference for a continuing candidate are set aside without-value and the quota is recalculated on each iteration of the count following the distribution of the first available preference. Votes that exhaust as a result of a candidate's surplus transfer are set aside with the value associated with the transfer in which they exhausted. The main advantage of the Wright System is that it limits the distortion and bias in the vote that arises from the adopted methods of segmentation and distribution of preferences of excluded candidates. Each vote has proportionally equal weight and is treated in the same manner as every other vote. Under the current system used in the Australian Senate a voter whose first preference is for a minor candidate and their subsequent second preference for a major candidate that has been declared elected earlier in the count is denied the opportunity to have their second preference vote allocated to the candidate of their choice. With the reiterative counting system the voter's second preference forms part of the voter's alternative chosen candidate's surplus and is redistributed according to the voters nominated preference allocation. Definitions Continuing Candidate means a candidate that has not been excluded from or declared not- elected in the process of the count Total Vote (TV) is the total number of ballot papers that express a valid preference allocated to candidates remaining in the count Quota Droop quota (Q) means the number determined by dividing the Total Vote (TV) by 1 more than the number of candidates required to be elected and by increasing the quotient (disregarding any remainder) (Q = integer(TV/(1+No of Vacancies))+1) or Alternatively a Full Proportional Quota (Q) means the number determined by dividing the Total Vote (TV) by the number of candidates required to be elected (disregarding any remainder) Value of the Vote (Vv) means the value allocated to each ballot paper as it progresses though the count. Candidate’s Total Value of votes (Ctvv) means the aggregated sum of the value of each ballot paper allocated to the candidate. Surplus Value (Sv) means the value calculated by subtracting the Quota (Q) from the Candidates Total Value’ of votes (Sv = Ctvv-Q) Surplus Transfer Value (Stv) means the value calculated by the Surplus value (Sv) divided by the Candidate’s Total Value of votes (Ctvv) and then multiplied by the Value of vote (Vv) allocated to each ballot paper ((Stv = Sv/Ctvv)*Vv) Ballot Paper means a record of a voter’s intention and allocation, in ascending order of preference, of support for a nominated candidate for election. It also refers to a vote which is a record in electronic format representing information and preference allocations of a ballot paper. Vote means a mathematical representation and record of a ballot paper Preference means the number in ascending order that represents the order of voter’s preference attributed to a candidate for election as recorded on a ballot paper or data file. Electronic preference data file means an electronic data file representing the allocation and record of preferences and all votes/ballot papers used in the calculation, distribution and determination of the results of the election. Remainders represent the fractional part arising from a mathematical division recorded in double precision and are to be retained with and form part of the value of the vote and/or the total value attributed to a candidate Exhausted Votes means the aggregated value attributed to any votes that do not express a valid preference for a candidate remaining within the count. The ballot paper and it's attributed value are declared exhausted and a tally of all exhausted votes recorded. Bulk exclusion means the method of determining the number of candidates which can be simultaneously excluded from the count Running Sum means the progressive calculation the sum of all candidates total votes from lowest to highest in descending order Quota Breakpoint means highest running sum value that is less than half of the Quota Running Breakpoint means the candidate with a total vote value that is greater than the associated running sum of all candidates with a lower total vote. Applied Breakpoint means the candidate with a highest total vote that is less than the associated running sum of all candidates with a lower total vote and less than the difference between the Quota and the value of the highest scoring candidate that is below Quota. Process of calculation of the results of the election All ballot papers must be checked for formality and reconciled with the electoral roll and polling place returns following the completion of the data-entry process and prior to the commencement of the counting procedure outlined below. Any informal ballot papers must be set aside and recorded with no value. Distribution of Preferences and calculation of Quota Ballot Papers are distributed according to the first available preference in ascending order that corresponds to a Continuing Candidate. #Any ballot paper that does not express a transferable preference for a continuing candidate is declared exhausted-without-value and recorded with a value of zero. #Assign each ballot paper allocated to a Continuing Candidate a Vote value of one. #Ascertain and assign the Candidate’s Total Value of the Vote (Ctvv) for each Continuing Candidate by aggregating the value of the votes allocated to each Continuing Candidate. #Ascertain and assign the Total Vote (TV) value by aggregating the total value of votes allocated to each candidate outlined in (c) above. #Calculate the Quota required to elect a candidate by dividing the Total Vote (TV) by 1 more than the number of candidates required to be elected and by increasing the quotient (disregarding any remainder) by 1 (Q = integer(TV/(1+No of Vacancies))+1). Provisional declaration of elected candidates Any candidate who has received a Total value of votes (Ctvv) equal to or greater than the Quota (Q) is to be provisionally declared elected. Number of vacancies filled If the number of candidates provisionally declared elected equals the number of vacancies to be filled then the count is concluded (Goto Conclusion of the count) Number of elected candidates less than vacancies If the number of candidates provisionally declared elected is less than the number of vacancies to be elected and the number of all other Continuing Candidates is greater than the number of vacancies still remaining then the procedure of the count is as follows:- Calculation of the Candidate’s Surplus Value In descending order of the Candidates' Total value of votes (Ctvv) for each provisionally elected candidate, starting from the candidate with the highest total value of votes whose surplus is to be distributed, calculate the Surplus value (Sv) of the candidate by subtracting the Quota from the Candidate’s Total Value of the Vote and then determine, distribute and allocate the Candidate's Surplus Transfer value according to the procedure outlined below (2.6 and 2.7 inclusive) Calculation of the Surplus Transfer Value and value of the vote The candidate’s Surplus Transfer Value (Stv) is determined by calculating the quotient of the candidate’s Surplus value (Sv) divided by the Candidate’s Total Value of the Vote (Ctvv) and multiplying the result by the value of each ballot paper (Vv) allocated to the Candidate whose surplus is being considered. The resultant becomes the new Value of the vote allocated to each ballot paper the sum of which equals the Surplus value (Sv). Distribution of Candidate’s Surplus votes All ballot papers allocated to the Candidate whose surplus is under consideration are to be redistributed according to the following procedure: All ballot papers that express a preference greater than the preference allocated to the candidate whose surplus is to be distributed shall be distributed and re-allocated to the candidate that remains in the count (excluding any candidate that has already been provisionally declared elected) according to the next available sequentially highest preference recorded on the ballot paper. =Exhausted Ballot papers to be set aside= Any ballot paper that does not express a valid preference for a continuing candidate greater than the preference allocated to the candidates whose surplus is to be distributed shall be set aside and declared exhausted-with-value and its value added to the total value of exhausted ballot papers recorded for the relevant transaction in the count. Exhausted votes that form part of a candidates surplus remain in the count and form part of the initial candidate’s Total Vote and surplus. =Allocate value of quota to candidate whose surplus has been distributed= The Candidate whose Surplus has been distributed is allocated a Candidate’s Total Value of votes equal to the Quota. =Ascertain if any Candidates are to be provisionally elected as a result of the surplus transfer distribution= Any Continuing Candidate who has received a total value of votes equal to or greater than the quota on the completion of the transfer and distribution of all ballot papers associated with the surplus distribution shall be provisionally declared elected. =Number of Candidates provisionally elected equal the number of vacancies= If as a result of the completed surplus transfer the number of candidates provisionally declared elected equals the number of vacancies to be filled then the count is concluded (Goto Conclusion of the count) =Distribution of additional surplus votes= If the number of candidates provisionally declared elected is less than the number of vacancies to be filled and there remain candidates who have a surplus value that has not been transferred and distributed then the votes allocated to the candidate with the next highest surplus value is to be transferred and redistributed according to the procedure outlined above (2.6 and 2.7 inclusive) Exclusion of candidates If the number of candidates provisionally declared elected is less than the number of vacancies to be filled and there are no further candidate surpluses to be distributed then the candidate with the lowest total value of votes is to be declared not-elected and excluded from the count. =Bulk Exclusion (option)= Two or more candidates may be excluded simultaneously by determining the Applied Breakpoint, if the aggregated value of all candidates to be excluded is less than the value of the next lowest candidate or the value required by a candidate to obtain a quota. The calculation of Quota Break point or the highest associated Running Break Point values associated with a continuing candidate. Breakpoints assists in the determination of applying a Bulk Exclusion process. If the Quota, Applied and Running Breakpoints converge then it is generally safe to apply a Bulk Exclusion process to the count. Careful consideration needs to be given to ensure that candidates with a lower total value are not capable of securing a higher total vote than the candidates remaining in the count. =Tie in the value of a candidates the vote= If there are two or more candidates of equal value with the lowest total value of the vote then the candidate to be excluded from the count shall be determined by lot and declared not-elected. Number of candidates declared elected and remaining in the count equal the number of vacancies If as a result of any exclusion the number of candidates provisionally declared elected plus the number of remaining candidates equals the number of vacancies to be filled then the count is concluded and all candidates that remain in the count are all declared provisionally elected (Goto Conclusion of the count) Reset and continuation of the count If the number of Continuing Candidates, including candidates that have been provisionally elected, is greater than the number of vacancies plus one following the exclusion of any candidate, the ballot shall be reset and the distribution of preferences shall be restarted according to the procedures outlined above in sections 2.1 to 2.10 excluding all candidates that have been declared not-elected and excluded from the count. Reiteration of the count The count continues to proceed according to the procedures outlined above until either the number of provisionally declared elected candidates or the number of candidates remaining in the count equals the number of vacancies to be filled in which case all Continuing Candidates are declared provisionally elected. Conclusion of the count At the conclusion of the reiterative count all candidates that have been provisionally elected in the final count reiteration are declared elected following the publication of the election results and a certified copy of the detailed electronic preference data file used in tabulating the results of the election.

It stars Ian McKellen, Aaron Eckhart, Brittany Murphy, Nick Nolte, William Hurt, and Jessica Lange. It was first shown at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. However, the film was never given a full theatrical release, eventually being released straight to DVD in 2007. Plot Zach Riley (Aaron Eckhart) is a psychiatrist who leaves a job at a prestigious university to take up a job at the privately run mental institution, Millwood, belonging to Dr. Reed (William Hurt). What he doesn't reveal at the time of his appointment is that this was the very place where his novelist father, T.L. Pierson (Nick Nolte), spent many years of his life as he battled chronic depression. T.L. later wrote a popular children's classic, Neverwas, about a child (based on young Zach himself) who enters a secret world to free a captive king. T.L. later committed suicide; Riley, who found the body, has always partly blamed himself for his father's death. Riley is assigned to work with a schizophrenic patient, Gabriel Finch (Ian McKellen), and soon realizes that Finch sees himself as the captive king. As he listens to Finch and resumes his acquaintance with childhood friend Maggie Paige (Brittany Murphy) he realizes that more things link him to the book – and also to Finch's recovery – than he ever thought. T.L.'s novel was based on Finch's stories, told to him by Finch while both were patients in the hospital. Finch believes that the book is a sort of oracle confirming his personal reality, and that Riley is the boy hero. Riley comes to see himself this way in a sense, as he discovers that Finch's \\"hallucination\\" concerns actual places and events.

It was produced by Sidney Kimmel and Greg Shapiro, and co-produced by Aaron Eckhart who starred in the leading role. The film was distributed by Neverwas Productions and premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2005. It was distributed by Miramax Home Entertainment for its home media release. Owing to the theme of a fairy tale which is based on real events, the film has often been compared with Finding Neverland (2004).

Overview PLEXIL is a programming language for representing plans for automation. In 2006 Vandi Verma was one of several co-writers of PLEXIL, which is now used in automation technologies such as the NASA K10 rover, Mars Curiosity rover's percussion drill, Deep Space Habitat and Habitat Demonstration Unit, Edison Demonstration of Smallsat Networks, LADEE, Autonomy Operating System (AOS) and procedure automation for the International Space Station. The PLEXIL Executive is an execution engine that implements PLEXIL and can be interfaced (using a provided software framework) with external systems to be controlled and/or queried. PLEXIL has been used to demonstrate automation technologies targeted at future NASA space missions. The binaries and documentation are widely available as open source from Sourceforge.net .http://plexil.wiki.sourceforge.net/ Nodes The fundamental programming unit of PLEXIL is the Node. A node is a data structure formed of two primary components: a set of conditions that drive the execution of the node and another set which specifies what the node accomplishes after execution. A hierarchical composition of nodes is called a plan. A plan is a tree divided in nodes close to the root (high level nodes) and leaf nodes that represent primitive actions such as variable assignments or the sending of commands to the external system. Node Types: As of September 2008 NASA has implemented seven types of nodes. *List nodes: List nodes are the internal nodes in a plan. These nodes have child nodes that can be of any type. *Command nodes: These nodes issue commands that drive the system. *Assignment nodes: Performs a local operation and assigns a value to a variable. *Function call nodes:accesses external functions that perform computations, but do not alter the stateof the system. *Update nodes: Provides information to the planning and decision support interface. *Library call nodes: This nodes invoke nodes in an external library. *Empty nodes: Nodes that contain attributes and do not perform any actions. Node states: Each node can be in only one state. They are: *Inactive * Waiting * Executing * Finishing * Iteration_Ended * Failing * Finished Nodes transitions: *SkipCondition T : The skip condition changes from unknown or false to true. *StartCondition T : The start condition changes from unknown or false to true. *InvariantCondition F/U : Invariant condition changes from true to false or unknown. *EndCondition T : End condition changes to true *Ancestor_inv_condition F/U : The invariant condition of any ancestor changes to false or unknown. *Ancestor_end_condition T : The end condition of any ancestor changes to true *All_children_waiting_or_finished T : This is true when all child nodes are in either in node state waiting or finished and no other states. *Command_abort_complete T : When the abort for a command action is completed. *Function_abort_complete T : The abort of a function call is completed. *Parent_waiting T : The (single) parent of the node transitions to node state waiting. *Parent_executing T : The (single) parent of the node transitions to node state executing. *RepeatCondition T/F : the repeat condition changes from unknown to either true or false.

The asylum was surrounded by almost 106 hectares of farmland, making the hospital self-sufficient with its own piggery, orchards, kitchen gardens, fields, stables and barn. For recreation, the asylum included tennis courts, an oval and cricket pavilion, kiosk and theatre.La Trobe at Beechworth [cartographic material] : heritage gardens and historic walking tour.

One of the distinctive features of both Kew Asylum and Beechworth Asylum is the use of a variation on ha-ha walls around the patients courtyards. These ha-has consisted of a trench, one side of which was vertical and faced with stone or bricks, the other side sloped and turfed. From the inside, the walls presented a tall face to patients, preventing them from escaping, while from outside, the walls looked low so as not to suggest imprisonment.ASAP 'Kew Lunatic Asylum' Historic Walk Brochure Admission process People could be admitted to the asylum as a lunatic patient by a number of means: * At the request of a friend, relative or acquaintance, with medical certificates written by two medical practitioners. This method was amended by The Mental Health Act 1959 which stated a person could be admitted upon the recommendation of a medical practitioner who had examined the person. As soon as possible after admission the superintendent of the hospital was required to examine the patient and either approve the recommended admission or discharge the patient. * Any (lunatic) person found wandering at large or not under proper care and control could be brought before two justices who could order the person's removal to an asylum. The police were usually responsible for bringing the person before the two justices. * Any prisoner of the Crown thought to be a lunatic could be removed from a gaol to an asylum by order of the Chief Secretary. * Voluntary Boarders were those who requested that they be admitted for a mutually agreed period of time (from 1915 onwards).PROV Series VPRS 7456 Admission Warants - Male and Female Patients Accessed 30 August 2008 To be admitted, only two signatures were required.

He performed individually or with his wife Hiroko Tamano and their performance group Harupin-Ha. He has also performed with other artists including Kitaro. They introduced the dance form to the west coast of America.  Early Life and Career  Tamano was born in 1946 near the Ooi River in Shimada, Shizuoka, Japan. In 1964, when he was 18, he began his 10-year apprenticeship under Hijikata Tatsumi at Asbestos-kan, where he earned the nickname \\"bow-legged Nijinsky\\". His first butoh performance was in 1965 in Tokyo in a work of Tatsumi Barairo Dansu (Rose-Colored Dance). In 1968, he performed in \\"Tatsumi Hijikata and the Japanese-Nikutai no Hanran\\". Both he and his wife, Hiroko Tamano, performed with Tatsumi. In 1970, Tamano was a part of the Hangi Daitokan performance series, lasting for 3 years. He was involved in performances such as \\"Gibasa\\", \\"Buy Love\\", and \\"Susamedama\\". He founded Harupin-Ha in 1972 and performed in Tokyo. Harupin-Ha is a reference to Manchuria and has the meaning \\"a studying station from Asia to Europe, a place of journey of mixed culture\\" or \\"starting place of a journey\\". Their first performance was titled \\"Nagasu Kujira\\" or \\"Finback whale\\". He acted as artistic director for Harupin-Ha, choreographing works such as Swamp (1979), Fetus of Nature (1988), Piece on Earth (1989), Wings of a Century - Life (1990), Wings of a Century - Death (1991), and MANDALOVE (1992). In the '70s, in addition to Hangi Daitokan and Harupin-Ha, Koichi performed in \\"Shiki no tame no Nijyuu Nana Ban\\" or \\"27 Nights for Four Seasons\\" and \\"Hosotan\\" or \\"Story of Smallpox\\". Both of these pieces would later be revived during the Tamano's time in San Francisco.  Career in America  Tamano first visited United States in 1976 to perform at the \\"Japan Now\\" SFMOMA exhibition. With this visit, he also had the goal of seeking out his grandfather who had moved to the United States in 1907. In 1978, Koichi Tamano relocated to Berkeley, California with Hiroko Tamano, in search of a place to raise his child.  Artistic Collaborations  In the beginning of 1986, Tatsumi Hijikata passed away. In the same year, Koichi Tamano obtained his green card in the United States. He spent the next years in Japan, performing in memorial of Hijikata. These performances included an appearance at the 1986 \\"Hijikata Tatsumi Photo Exhibition\\", \\"Rashomon\\" in 1987 in Kyoto with Akaji Maro and DaiRakuda Kan, and \\"Romanov's Sea\\" in 1987 in Tokyo with Akiko Motofuji and M. Ishii. In 1993, Koichi appeared as a guest performer in several state-side performances. Among them included \\"Goten, Sora o Tobu\\" with Kazuo Ono Buto and \\"UGETSU\\" with Akaji Maro and DaiRakuda Kan. Koichi and Hiroko Tamano were based in San Francisco where they ran a restaurant, first in Country Station in the Mission, then in Noe Valley.

The company was founded in 1883 with the merger of two major Solingen sword-making companies, Weyersberg and Kirschbaum. In 1900 the company was the largest in Solingen, employing around 1,200 workers. WKC uses traditional hand forging in their production process. The company supplies over 50 militaries, military academies and police forces worldwide with ceremonial swords. The company also makes Japanese Katanas using the traditional hand forging process.  History  Weyersberg, Kirschbaum, and Cie. was founded in 1883 with the merger of two family-owned sword manufacturing and marketing companies in Solingen, Germany: Gebruder Weyersberg, founded by Wilhem, Peter and Johann Ludwig Weyersberg in 1787 and WR Kirschbaum & Cie, founded by Wilhem Reinhordt Kirschbaum. The newly founded company used traditional techniques for sword making and each of their then employees specialised in one task in the sword making process. This was in accordance to the Division of Labor act devised by the Sword makers Guild of Soligen. Prior to the merger Fritz Weyersberg had purchased the patent for a blade roll forge invented in England. This machine allowed the sword manufacturing plant to significantly increase blade production. By 1900 WKC's production was such that it employed around 1,200 workers and was the largest company in Solingen. At this time the company not only produced swords but weapons, motorcycles and bike parts as well. In the year 1922, WKC was bought by the company \\"Siegen Solinger Gussstahlverein\\" who was a previous supplier of theirs. The company continued to flourish until the Great Depression. During this time like most companies in Germany, WKC suffered greatly and worsened as during World War II, the company was a target of Allied bombardment. These bombings resulted in almost all of the buildings and equipment owned by the company at the time being destroyed and so all operations there ceased. In 1955 the company again changed hands with Hans Kolping, a Solingen knife producer, buying the company. He restarted the company and produced swords, knives and pistols. Soon after he discontinued the production of pistols and concentrated on ceremonial sword production and so the company established its own blade etching plant. The company's first orders at this time came from the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps. On 1989 Hans Kolping died and left the company to his life partner, Margard Willms. Soon after the company changed ownership and Joachim Willms undertook large investments in the buildings and the equipment so as to further grow the company. In 1995, André Willms, the current owner, joined the company. In November 2005 the Wilkinson Sword factory of London closed. In order to facilitate production of British ceremonial swords Wilkinson held a sealed bid for its assets. WKC participated and acquired the majority of Wilkinson's tools, spare parts and their roll forge. These items were transported to Germany and implemented in WKC's production process. This allowed the company to produce a greater number of sword types and to supply more countries. WKC won the contract to produce the Model 2011 Swords for West Point Cadets at the United States Military Academy.  Management  In 2001 André Willms took over majority ownership of WKC from his father Ernst Joachim Willms. He is the current Managing Director of the company.

In the book, the author identifies the five steps for a business to take advantage of changing marketing conditions in order to grow dramatically Michalowicz's book are all themed on a \\"common world\\" analogy. In Surge, Michalowicz, relates the process of surfing in the ocean to \\"surfing\\" waves of consumer demand. Profit First (Book) Originally released on July 4, 2014. Revised & Expanded edition release on February, 2017 by Portfolio an imprint of Penguin Group. Profit First is a perennial global Top 20 Book, in the category of Personal & Business Finance, according to the weekly ranking by Publishers Weekly. In the book, the author identifies the four core methods to running a profitable business, and is derived from an article he published in The Wall Street Journal on December 10, 2010. Profit First relates the application of Parkinson's Law to how we spend and/or conserve money. The book further explains that with an understanding of our behavior, as defined by Parkinson's Law, we have the ability to bring significantly profitability to our business using four specific methods. Profit First relates the application of Parkinson's Law to how we spend and/or conserve money. The four core methods Michalowicz identifies in Profit First, and are derived from the healthy lifestyle habits are 1. Use Smaller Plates (the concept of having multiple \\"small\\" accounts to manage money intended for different purposes), 2. Eat Vegetables First (the concept of taking profit first, then owner's pay, then taxes, and lastly using the remainder for expenses), 3. Remove Temptation (make your accumulating profit, tax and under funds difficult to access and view and you will be less tempted to \\"steal\\" from yourself), 4. Use A Rhythm (manage the books twice a month, specifically on the 10th/25th to get a keen sense for cash flow). Michalowicz indicates that the natural tendency of entrepreneurs is to do \\"bank balance accounting\\", where they view their bank balance regularly and that they make financial decisions on the balance they see. The author argues that instead of trying to change this natural tendency in entrepreneurs, that is should be leveraged. By implementing the four core methods documented in Profit First, the entrepreneur can continue this natural habit to great effect, maximizing profit, controlling expenses and mastering cash flow management. The Pumpkin Plan (Book) Released July 2012 by Portfolio an imprint of Penguin Group. In the book, the author defines the seven significant milestones to growing a colossal pumpkin and how a colossal business is \\"grown\\" the same way. In the book a colossal business is defined as a niche or category leader, not necessarily on the size of revenue or number of employees. The author argues that many entrepreneurs fall into the \\"time for money trap\\" and need to change their actions from doing the work to designing how the work is done for it to grow. The entrepreneurs goal is for the business to serve them, not to have them serve the business. The Toilet Paper Entrepreneur (Book) In September 2008, Obsidian Launch released Michalowicz's book The Toilet Paper Entrepreneur. The book has subsequently been translated into multiple foreign languages, such as Spanish, Korean, Czech, Japanese, Polish, Simplified Chinese and Russian. The irreverent book is an entertaining hard-edged read mixed with valuable business lessons from an experienced entrepreneur. The author argues a successful entrepreneur embodies the flexibility and vision many large companies lack. Michalowicz states that hard-line traditional business planning is ineffective and often detrimental; and that successful growth of a business requires a dynamic planning method, called a 3 Sheet Strategy. Among other growth techniques, Michalowicz argues the leap frogging strategy of significantly pushing ahead in one \\"area of innovation\\", either price, convenience or quality. Michalowicz shows examples of this, including the rise and fall of Blockbuster, Netflix and Redbox. In The Toilet Paper Entrepreneur, Michalowicz argues that the General Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), while a standard practice for measuring a company's P&L; (profit/loss), is in fact detrimental to an entrepreneur's money management. He argues the use of a method he calls Profit First Accounting (PFA) instead of GAAP alone. In the book, Michalowicz occasionally pulls from his own entrepreneurial background, explaining how funding actually hampered his company's growth. Ultimately it was the lack of investment funds that helped his businesses grow quickly and healthily. Michalowicz manages a website, also called The Toilet Paper Entrepreneur, with a large volume of resources for entrepreneurs. Philosophy Michalowicz has lectured at US and international universities , keynoted corporate gatherings, authored books, published articles for national periodicals, and made national television appearances and radio broadcasts as an expert discussing entrepreneurial concepts and approaches he terms as a \\"Toilet-Paper Entrepreneur\\". This name is derived from the following analogy paraphrased from Michalowicz's book: > Have you ever been in the bathroom only to realize there are a mere three > sheets of toilet paper left...but somehow, often with the help of the > trashcan remnants, manage to make it work? This is how a Toilet Paper > Entrepreneur runs their business... they make do with what they have, pull > \\"miracles\\" out of the trash and make more and more with less and less. The Toilet Paper Entrepreneur philosophy is based on the notion that not only can one start a business with fewer resources, but that having fewer resources can actually work to your benefit . For example, having fewer resources can force the business to address an issue in highly innovative ways versus simply spending money blindly to solve it. Michalowicz's writing and interview style is blunt honesty, speckled with humor. In an interview with Inc. magazine, Michalowicz was asked, \\"How to balance work and family life\\". His response was: : \\"You don't. And the fact that you are asking this before you have even put in your first five years with a new business, means that you probably are not cut out to be an entrepreneur.\\" Profit First Professionals Michalowicz is the co-founder and CEO of Profit First Professionals, a membership organization for accountants, bookkeepers and consultants who use the Profit First to guide businesses to higher and consistent levels of profitability.

It is the parent company of Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox and Liverpool F.C., a Premier League football team. FSG was founded in 2001 as New England Sports Ventures (NESV) when John W. Henry joined forces with Tom Werner, Les Otten, The New York Times Company, and other investors to successfully bid for the Red Sox.

He appeared in more than 100 films between 1958 and 2009. Biography Born into a humble family, Murgia began working as a laborer from an early age. At the age of twenty he was already a peddler for l'Unità, the newspaper of the Italian Communist Party. The managing directors of the local branch of the party recognized particular political skills in him and send him to Frattocchie, in the province of Rome, where the headquarters of the National School for the party leaders were. After his return, six months later, he became the Secretary of the Young Communist League and got married. After some time, however, Murgia began to entertain a relationship with a comrade of the party. Murgia was then expelled because of this clandestine affair—he already married and father—with the woman, who was also married. Murgia then emigrated to Marcinelle, in Belgium, to work at the Bois du Cazier coalmine which had several thousands of Italian workers as miners, due to the Italian Belgian Protocol of 20 June 1946. There also Murgia established a relationship with the wife of a Belgian coworker and escaped death—in an almost fictional way—that fatal night of the Marcinelle mining disaster, in which a gas explosion killed all the miners of his shift, including the woman's husband. As a matter of fact Murgia was on a fake sick leave from work in order to spend the night with the woman. Murgia returned to his hometown, Oristano, but was forced to emigrate to Rome in order to escape the wrath of the family of another young woman which he wooed despite both of them being already married. In Rome he began working as a dishwasher in a restaurant in the city center (Il re degli Amici, the king of friends) until he was noticed by an assistant of the director Mario Monicelli, who invited him to the studio for an audition after which he was given the part. Since originally his first movie was called \\"The Madame\\"—before the censorship imposed the change of title to \\"Big Deal on Madonna Street\\"—he did not even know the film in which he starred was already in the theatres. He had found himself a job at a construction site at Ponte Milvio, when the production team miraculously tracked him down to give him a contract and an advance of ten million. Following the success of the Monicelli's film, Murgia later acted in about 150 films, usually repeating his first character with slight variations (always playing as sicilian while he was from Sardinia); his films span from several masterpieces of the Commedia all'italiana to genre films, especially Italian sex comedy and musicarelli.

By 1929 fourteen areas in the California Region 5 forests were proposed for this designation. The regulations for wilderness areas, known as the L-20, became − with modifications by Secretary of Agriculture William Jardine − the management policy for these areas.

Waterways Located within the southern Klamath Mountains and Inner Northern California Coast Ranges, the rugged topography of the Yolla Bolly–Middle Eel Wilderness protects headwaters of the Middle Fork of the Eel River, the North Fork of the Eel, the Mad River, and the South Fork of the Trinity River. The eastern side has the watersheds of Cottonwood and Thomes Creeks, which flow into the Sacramento River. The very northern tip of the wilderness—around the summits of Black Rock Mountain and North Yolla Bolly Peak—are in the Klamath Mountains. Both the Middle and North Forks of the Eel River have Wild and Scenic River designation, as does the South ForkLand acquisition proposal on the South Fork by the Bureau of Land Management. of the Trinity River. Several small, shallow lakes occur in remnant glacial basins near the highest peaks. Numerous springs are found off of the main ridgetops. Flora and fauna The wilderness has Coast Range and Klamath montane, mixed evergreen and Douglas fir forest types. Conifers include the California endemic foxtail pine, ponderosa pine, red fir and white fir, western white pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, and the rare Pacific yew. Other tree species include oaks and cottonwoods. The area includes wet meadows and open grasslands supporting abundant deer herds (as well as cattle and sheep). Lower elevations have chamise, manzanita, and ceanothus. Wildlife in the wilderness includes black bear, Roosevelt Elk, black-tailed deer, gray fox, mountain lion, bobcat, coyote, northern flying squirrel, fisher and martin. The northern spotted owl can be found here, as well as eagles, hawks, turkey vultures and smaller birds like grouse, quail, and bandtailed pigeon. Rainbow trout live in most larger streams, such as in the South Fork of Cottonwood Creek, and in Black Rock Lake. The Middle Fork Eel River watershed has summer- and winter-run steelhead and spring-run chinook salmon, but fishing is restricted. Geology Rocks in the northern mountains are predominantly gray greenstone while the southern mountains include sandstone and serpentine of the Franciscan formation. Cirque basins from former glaciers are seen above about elevation. Extensive faulting in the rocks makes the region prone to erosion, slumping and landslides. One modern landslide near Ides Cove, on the north flank of Mount Linn, reached more than two miles (3 km) toward the South Fork Cottonwood Creek,Wenzel, R., de la Fuente, J., Faust, R..

Recreation Recreational activities include backpacking, day-hiking, camping, fishing, hunting, and nature photography. There are 15 trailheads all around the wilderness boundary with the most frequent users being hunters in the autumn months. Visitor use has one of the lowest densities among wilderness areas in California. The Ides Cove Loop Trail is over in length and travels through very scenic areas. This trailhead is also the beginning of the Bigfoot Trail. The US Forest Service encourages visitors to use Leave No Trace ethics when visiting the wilderness to minimize impact to the environment. Access to trailheads on the northwest side of the wilderness is available by paved road from Ruth. Other roads suitable for most passenger vehicles reach the south boundary from Covelo and the east boundary from Corning or Red Bluff.

The spill pallets can come in a variety of sizes to accommodate multiple containers. UK Legislation In the UK, a container of oil or fuel cannot be stored outside unless it is bundled in a secondary containment item (Oil Storage Regulations 2001).

The modern name of this university is «MATI» - Russian State University of Aviation Technology (). It is named after the Russian aeronautics and rocketry pioneer Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovskii. The current name of \\"MATI\\" Russian State Technological University is \\"MAI\\" Moscow Aviation Institute History The University chronicle starts in 1932 with the foundation of Dirigible Engineering Educational Center attached to Civil Air Fleet (CAF) Ministry by joining Aircraft School of Leningrad Institute of CAF Engineers and Moscow Aviation Institute. In 1939 the Center was reorganized into Moscow Institute of CAF Engineers and named after K.E. Tsiolkovsky. Konstantin Eduardovitch Tsiolkovsky (1857–1935) was a great Russian scientist and inventor in the field of aerodynamics, aerospace engineering and the theory of aircraft, rockets and dirigible. He was a founder of contemporary astronautics. For the first time in the old-age Mankind's history K.Tsiolkovsky substantiated the possibility of applying rockets for interplanetary communications, showed the reasonable and rational ways of advancing astronautics and rocketry, made solutions of a number of important engineering problems in rocket designing and liquid fuel jet engines. So, Institute had honestly been credited to bear his name. On June 17, 1940 Moscow Institute of Aviation Technology (or shortly MATI) was established on the basis of the later. MATI attained the University status and name Moscow State Aviation Technology Institute - Russian State Technological University in 1992 - recognition of both the scale and quality of its courses. Today the University is one of the leading Russian technical universities where highly skilled experts in the field of advanced materials and high technologies are trained. Among the University teaching staff there are Academicians of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Russian Engineering Academy, Russian Academy of Technological Sciences and Russian Academy of Natural Sciences. About 260 Professors and Doctors of Sciences as well as more than 700 associate professors and Ph.D. scientists work at the University. University realizes the training according to the 24 specialties of higher professional education and trains researchers according to the 28 scientific specialties, carries out retraining of the specialists from industry and raising the level of their skill according to the various programs. Only in 1991 MATI was opened for the foreign students. Now more than 200 students from Great Britain, USA, Germany, South Korea, Turkey, India,Myanmar, Nepal, Kenya, Morocco, Oman, China, Iran and some other countries are studying at University. University takes part in various international projects, carries out a student and scientific exchange with the universities of the USA, Great Britain, Taiwan, China, South Korea, etc. On the 31st of March 2015 the Ministry of Education reorganized Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI) by annexation of the Russian State Technological University named after Tsiolkovsky (MATI). Cooperation with Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center Cooperation of MATI and Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center (Khrunichev Space R&D; Center - is a leader of national space industry) in the field of training of the specialists for aerospace industry, as well as scientific and research cooperation in development of new technology for space exploration has resulted in establishing MATI's branch at Khrunichev Space R&D; Center. This MATI's branch has received name «Aerospace University for Specialized Training». The main goal for establishing of Aerospace University was specialized training of the specialists in the field of development and production of advanced aerospace technology using for this aim teaching, scientific and production experience of MATI and Khrunichev Space R&D; Center. The main fields of Aerospace University activity are the following: * development of the educational programs for additional education in Aerospace Engineering; * specialized training of the technical staff (engineers, technicians, etc.); * teaching of the foreign students according to the specialized educational programs additional to the undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate programs in Aerospace Engineering short-term educational programs for foreign specialists from aerospace industry (similar program MATI in cooperation with Khrunichev Space R&D; Center is carrying on in the frame of the Russian-Britain Project for additional training of the students and specialists in aerospace technologies).

The charity's HQ is based in Truro, Cornwall UK where a visitor centre was also located up until 2020. The disaster relief visitor centre is now permanently closed due to concerns over coronavirus and the financial impact of the pandemic. It used to host various exhibitions related to the disasters the charity has responded to, a weather lab, and other activities for children and school groups. ShelterBox responds to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tropical cyclones, tsunamis, floods and volcanic eruptions. The charity also provides emergency aid to families who have been displaced by war or conflict, in places such as Syria and the Lake Chad Basin. Typical ShelterBox aid items include tents as temporary shelter or shelter kits to allow people to build or rebuild durable shelters. ShelterBox also provides other aid items such as mosquito nets, water filters, water carriers, solar lights, cooking sets, blankets and mats. A sturdy green box packed with the necessary aid items is often provided to families in places where ShelterBox responds. The aid provided by ShelterBox is tailored to the nature of each individual disaster and location and therefore it is not always the same. ShelterBox Response Teams distribute aid on the ground, working closely with local organisations, local and international aid agencies and Rotary Clubs worldwide.  History  ShelterBox deployed to Kenya following drought and famine across the Horn of Africa in early 2011.  Early years  ShelterBox was founded in 2000 in the town of Helston, Cornwall, UK by Rotarian and former Royal Navy Search and Rescue Diver Tom Henderson, OBE. That same year the Rotary Club of Helston-Lizard adopted it as it's Millennium Project. The first distribution of 143 ShelterBoxes was sent to victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake. Over the next three years the project matured and by the end of 2004 nearly 2,600 boxes had been dispatched, following 16 major disasters. The charity significantly expanded its work in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Tom Henderson was recognized as CNN Hero in 2008, the network’s annual award that honours the everyday citizens from around the globe who are changing the world. In March 2010 he was made an OBE by The Queen at Buckingham Palace for his outstanding contribution to charity and humanitarian work since he founded ShelterBox in 2000. In August 2012, the Board of Directors of ShelterBox removed founder Tom Henderson as CEO, stating it was a unanimous decision. In February 2013, Alison Wallace was appointed CEO of ShelterBox after her position as director of international fundraising at Amnesty International. In August 2014 ShelterBox founder and former CEO Tom Henderson was charged with conspiracy to commit fraud. In the subsequent Old Bailey court case it was alleged that he gave supply contracts to his son. He was cleared of conspiracy to commit fraud: not guilty verdicts were accepted and the Crown Prosecution Service said it would not request a retrial following a 44-day trial, which ended with the jury failing to reach a verdict after more than 30 hours of deliberation.Shelterbox founder Tom Henderson cleared of defrauding charity  Notable responses  One of ShelterBox's largest responses was the 7.0 magnitude earthquake in Haiti in 2010. ShelterBox provided shelter for 28,000 families, or approximately 25% of all tents delivered in areas surrounding Port-au-Prince. After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, ShelterBox provided assistance to about 1,600 families in the disaster region. In 2015 the charity responded in Nepal providing aid to families who lost their home, after a powerful earthquake left 9,000 dead and nearly 22,000 injured. In 2017 ShelterBox responded to category 5 hurricanes Irma and Maria in the Caribbean. Aid was provided in the islands of St Kitts and Nevis, the Dominican Republic, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, and the British Virgin Islands. In terms of conflict-related responses, Syria remains one of ShelterBox's largest projects. Since 2013, the charity has been providing emergency aid to families affected by the war in Syria.  Evolution of the charity  During the early years of the charity's life, Helston was the main location where the headquarters and the main warehouse were located. The aid was pre-packed inside the green ShelterBoxes by volunteers at the warehouse and then shipped to disaster zones. Since then, the charity has grown and evolved a great deal. An office in Truro now houses the main HQ and the charity has another smaller office in London. In 2017, ShelterBox set up ShelterBox Operations Philippines, a locally registered NGO that is supported and guided by ShelterBox Operations HQ in the UK. ShelterBox has responded in the Philippines more frequently than any other country, and the new NGO set up in the Philippines provides a quicker and more efficient way for the charity to respond in the country.  Responding to disasters  Mike Perham talks about ShelterBox in a UK Primary School as part of Big ShelterBox Week 2012 ShelterBox uses tracking systems to monitor weather systems around the globe and anticipate the likely scale of hurricanes and cyclones. In addition, an earthquake alert system gives immediate notice of any seismic activity that could result in a humanitarian disaster. ShelterBox works with local and international aid agencies and Rotary Clubs worldwide who also relay information when they become aware of an urgent need for shelter. With a limit to resources, the charity has developed a framework set of questions to help make decisions on where to respond, ensuring the most vulnerable families are supported. Where this response criteria is met, and visa and security conditions permit, a team could be deployed within 48 hours.  ShelterBox Response Team  Shelterbox's Response Team (SRTs) consists of Operations staff and volunteers based around the world. SRTs are highly trained emergency shelter specialists and where Shelterbox's ‘Response Criteria’ has been met, will deploy after disaster to assess, coordinate and distribute aid.  Funding  ShelterBox relies on donations: About half of the funds come direct from the UK public, the rest is raised by international affiliates.  Patrons  In August 2007, the Duchess of Cornwall became the ShelterBox's President and Royal Patron, following her first introduction to the charity in the previous year. She first met workers for the charity during a visit to the earthquake-hit villages of Pakistan in November 2006, and was so impressed by the charity's innovative disaster relief work that she has supported it ever since.  Partnerships and collaboration   Rotary International  In 2000, the Rotary club of Helston-Lizard adopted ShelterBox as its millennium project. It has since become one of the world's leading humanitarian aid charities providing emergency shelter and supplies to thousands of families worldwide following disaster. Rotary International renewed their three-year Project Partner agreement with ShelterBox in 2019 which increases their joint capacity to help families around the world displaced by disaster. ShelterBox has been Rotary's Project Partner in Disaster Relief since 2012, but the relationship had been long-standing, going back to the birth of the charity. What began as a local connection with one Cornish Rotary Club has led to an international movement that has raised over £54 million for ShelterBox to date. The partnership extends far beyond financial support. Around 1,000 Rotary members are involved in ShelterBox as volunteers, staff or response team members. Rotary clubs worldwide offer practical assistance to help ShelterBox reach more families after disaster or conflict.  International affiliates  ShelterBox affiliates are teams set up in different parts of the world. They work with ShelterBox to provide support in fundraising, volunteering and many more. Some of the largest ShelterBox affiliates are located in the US, Canada and Australia, but the international network of affiliates expands to more than 15 countries worldwide.  In-country humanitarian partners  ShelterBox works with partners all around the world to deliver aid in disaster or conflict zones.

The first storm of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Allison lasted unusually long for a June storm, remaining tropical or subtropical for 15 days. The storm developed from a tropical wave in the northern Gulf of Mexico on June 4, 2001, and struck the Texas coast shortly thereafter. It drifted northward through the state, turned back to the south, and re-entered the Gulf of Mexico. The storm continued to the east- northeast, made landfall on Louisiana, then moved across the southeast United States and Mid-Atlantic. Allison was the first storm since Tropical Storm Frances in 1998 to strike the northern Texas coastline. Tropical Storm Allison was a major flood disaster throughout its path from Texas to the Mid-Atlantic. The worst of the flooding occurred in Houston, Texas, where over 35 inches (890 mm) of rain fell. Allison killed 41 people, of whom 27 drowned. The storm also caused over $5 billion in damage (2001 USD, $6.4 billion 2007 USD), making Allison the costliest and second-deadliest tropical storm on record in the United States.  Preparations  After the storm made landfall, flash flood watches and warnings were issued for numerous areas in eastern Texas. Travel was discouraged due to the threat of flash flood. During the flood event, the National Weather Service in Houston issued 99 flash flood warnings with an average lead time of 40 minutes; only nine warnings were false alarms. Shortly after the storm formed, officials in Galveston County, Texas issued a voluntary evacuation for the western end of Galveston Island, as the area was not protected by the Galveston Seawall. The ferry from the island to the Bolivar Peninsula was closed, while voluntary evacuations were issued in Surfside in Brazoria County. Voluntary evacuations were also suggested near Sabine Pass in Jefferson County, Texas, though few left. Also, when the National Hurricane Center issued the first advisory on Allison, officials issued Tropical Storm Warnings from Sargent, Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana, just three hours before tropical storm winds were observed.  Impact  The Southwest Freeway, near Downtown Houston, lies under water due to flooding from Tropical Storm Allison. The nearest bridge is 16.5 feet above the freeway surface. Allison made landfall with a storm surge of two to three feet. Combined with waves on top, areas of Galveston Island experienced a wall of water 8 feet (2.5 m) in height, creating overwash along the coastline. The storm caused winds of up to 43 mph (69 km/h) at the Galveston Pier. While Allison was stalling over Texas, it dropped heavy rainfall across the state, including 9.77 inches (248 mm) in Galveston, 12.13 inches (308 mm) in Jamaica Beach, Texas, and other similar totals along the coast. Minimal beach erosion was reported, and impact was minimal near the coast. While moving northward through Texas as a minimal tropical depression, Allison produced minor wind gusts. Shortly after making landfall, the storm spawned a tornado in Manvel of Brazoria County, causing damage to one home. Within hours of making landfall, rainfall totals of 8 to 12 inches (200 to 300 mm) were common in Galveston and Harris County. Flash flooding continued for days, with rainfall amounts across the state peaking at just over 40 inches (1,033 mm) in northwestern Jefferson County. In the Port of Houston, a total of 36.99 inches (940 mm) was reported. Houston experienced torrential rainfall in a short amount of time. At one site, 6.3 inches (160 mm) fell in just one hour, while 28.5 inches (724 mm) fell in only 12 hours. The six-day rainfall in Houston amounted to 38.6 inches (980 mm). Houston Hobby Airport received 20.84 inches of rain from June 5 to 10, 2001, while Bush Intercontinental Airport received 16.48 inches. Two- thirds of the bayous and creeks in Harris County experienced 500-year flood events. Houston Intercontinental Airport, which typically receives 46.07 inches (1170 mm) of rain in a year, experienced 35.7% of its expected total in the first nine days of June. The deluge flooded 95,000 automobiles and 73,000 houses throughout Harris County. Tropical Storm Allison destroyed 2,744 homes, leaving 30,000 homeless with residential damages totaling to $1.76 billion (2001 USD, $2.05 billion 2007 USD). Residential neighborhoods inside and to the north of Interstate 610 were hardest hit. Additionally, five of the six bayou systems in downtown Houston were severely flooded. Four of them broke 100-year high-water records, causing excessive surface run-off. Several hospitals in the Texas Medical Center, the largest medical complex in the world, experienced severe damage from the storm, which hit quickly and with unexpected fury on a Friday evening. Hospital personnel were forced to evacuate thousands of patients in a major effort that included Coast Guard and Army helicopters. Many of the hospitals had lost all power, including back-up generators, meaning that patients had to be carried down dark stairwells by the staff in temperatures over . Patients who could not breathe on their own had to be continuously manually ventilated during the evacuation, which lasted hours. Most hospitals lost power and backup power when basements, the area where power and research data were kept, flooded. The Baylor College of Medicine experienced major damage, totaling $495 million (2001 USD, $577 million 2007 USD). The medical school lost 90,000 research animals, 60,000 tumor samples, and 25 years of research data. The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, across the street, lost thousands of laboratory animals, including expensive genetic-specific mice. Decades of research was lost, including, for many scientists, their life's work. The UT-Houston gross anatomy lab, cyclotron, and other important facilities were completely destroyed. Throughout the Medical Center, damage totaled to over $2 billion (2001 USD, $2.3 billion 2007 USD). Most were reopened after a month, though it took much longer to become fully operational. The storm flooded the lower level of the massive law library at the University of Houston Law Center with eight feet of water. An estimated 174,000 books and the microfiche collection were destroyed. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) gave $21.4 million to rebuild the law library collection. Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou at Main Street after Tropical Storm Allison hit Houston The tunnel system, which connects most large office buildings in downtown Houston, was submerged, as were many streets and parking garages adjacent to Buffalo Bayou. In the Houston Theater District, also near Buffalo Bayou in the northern part of downtown, the Houston Ballet, Houston Symphony, Houston Grand Opera, and Alley Theater lost millions of dollars' worth of costumes, musical instruments, sheet music, archives, props, and other artifacts. Local television stations ran all-night coverage of the deluge from June 8 through the next day, including KHOU-TV 11, which was forced to transmit its broadcast to a satellite truck when floodwaters entered its production studio on the Allen Parkway near Studemont/Montrose, near downtown along the banks of Buffalo Bayou. By midnight on June 9 nearly every freeway and major road in the city was under several feet of water, forcing hundreds of motorists to abandon their vehicles for higher ground. Eighteen-wheeled trucks were filmed floating down major freeways and highways, swept along by floodwaters. Despite massive flooding and damage to entire neighborhoods, there were no drowning deaths in flooded homes. In the area, there were 12 deaths from driving, 6 from walking, 3 from electrocution, and 1 in an elevator. Elsewhere in Texas, a man drowned when swimming in a ditch in Mauriceville. Damage totaled to $5.2 billion (2001 USD, $6 billion 2007 USD) throughout Texas. Though Allison's flooding was extreme, it was not unprecedented. Tropical Storm Amelia in 1978 dropped over 46 inches (1170 mm) of rainfall in Bluff, Texas, which remains the record highest rainfall for a single storm in the state of Texas. In addition, Tropical Storm Claudette in 1979 and a hurricane in 1921 produced rainfall totals of over 40 inches (1015 mm).  Aftermath  Aid from the American Red Cross Within weeks of the disaster, President George W. Bush declared 28 counties in Texas as disaster areas. The declarations allowed affected citizens to receive aid for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, and other serious disaster-related expenses. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also provided 75% for the cost of debris removal, emergency services related to the disaster, and repairing or replacing damaged public facilities, such as roads, bridges and utilities. A few weeks after Allison, FEMA opened six disaster recovery centers across southeast Texas, which provided recovery information to those who applied for disaster assistance. The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army opened 48 shelters at the peak of need for people driven from their homes, which served nearly 300,000 meals. After the extensive damage to Houston hospitals, the U. S. Public Health Service team set up a temporary hospital at the Houston Police Academy. The team of 87 medical personnel served over 1,000 patients within two weeks of Allison's passage. Similarly, the National Disaster Medical System deployed a temporary hospital to Houston with 88 professionals, aiding nearly 500 people. Debris removal, which was initially slow, was aided by FEMA to expedite the removal process. FEMA provided 75% of the federal cost of the removal. Thirty-five volunteer services provided aid for the flood victims in Texas, including food, clothing, and volunteers to help repair the houses. Texas Department of Transportation official warns of damaged cars After nearly 50,000 cars were flooded and ruined, many people attempted to sell the cars across the country without telling of the car's history. Following the extreme flooding, a mosquito outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. Health officials also recommended disinfecting private wells with bleach, due to possible contamination from the severe flooding. Many people took advantage of the flood victims, including fraudulent contractors and suppliers raising the price of goods more than is actually justified. By six months after the storm, around 120,000 Texas citizens applied for federal disaster aid, totaling to $1.05 billion (2001 USD, $1.22 billion 2007 USD). Of that amount, 17% of that was spent for temporary housing. In addition, Disaster Unemployment Assistance totaled to just under $1 million, while business loans totaled to $389 million (2001 USD, $454 million 2007 USD).

Combined with decreased glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity and tissue response to corticosteroids, this adrenal insufficiency constitutes a negative prognostic factor for intensive care patients. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis), in which the hypothalamus and pituitary gland control adrenal secretions, undergoes profound changes during critical illness. Both very high and very low levels of cortisol have been linked to a poor outcome in intensive care patients. It has been suggested that high levels could represent severe stress, whereas low levels are due to blunted cortisol production and response. CIRCI can be suspected in patients with low blood pressure despite resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasopressor drugs. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines advocate intravenous hydrocortisone only in adults with septic shock and refractory hypotension. The exact definition of this condition, the best ways to test for corticoid insufficiency in critically ill patients, and the therapeutic use of (usually low doses) of corticosteroids remains a subject of debate. Signs and symptoms The best known feature that suggests a possible underlying adrenal insufficiency is low blood pressure despite resuscitation with intravenous fluids, requiring vasopressor drugs. These patients typically display tachycardia and other signs of hyperdynamic shock. Other symptoms include fever, purpura fulminans, and gastrointestinal or neurological disturbances. All these features are relatively non-specific in intensive care patients. In some patients a specific reason for adrenal insufficiency can be suspected, such as prior intake of corticosteroids that suppressed the HPA axis, or use of enzyme inducing drugs such as phenytoin. Treatment with imidazole drugs such as etomidate, ketoconazole and miconazole can also suppress the HPA axis, as well as drugs used specifically for this purpose, such as metyrapone. Several blood test abnormalities can suggest corticosteroid insufficiency, such as hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, neutropenia, eosinophilia, hyperprolactinemia, and hypothyroidism. Physiology In acute states of severe stress, cortisol secretion by the adrenal gland increases up to sixfold, parallel to the severity of the condition. This is partly due to an increased secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Several cytokines have been also shown to interfere with the HPA axis at multiple levels. There is also an increase in the number and affinity of glucocorticoid receptors. Levels of corticosteroid- binding globulin (CBG) and albumin, which normally bind cortisol, are decreased, resulting in increased levels of free cortisol. Furthermore, anaesthesia drugs like etomidate could interfere with the HPA axis. The secretion also loses its normal diurnal pattern of morning peak levels and evening and night time troughs. Nevertheless, secretion remains pulsatile and there is a marked variation in blood samples from the same individual. High blood levels of cortisol during critical illness could theoretically be protective because of several reasons. They modulate metabolism (for example, by inducing high blood sugar levels, thereby providing energy to the body). They also suppress excessive immune system activation and exert supporting effects on the circulatory system. Increased susceptibility to infections, hyperglycemia (in patients already prone to stress hyperglycemia), gastrointestinal bleeding, electrolyte disturbances and steroid-induced myopathy (in patients already prone to critical illness polyneuropathy) are possible harmful effects. Blood levels of dehydroepiandrosterone increase, and levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate decrease in response to critical illness. In the chronic phase of severe illness, cortisol levels decrease slowly and return to normal when the patient recovers. ACTH levels are however low, and CBG levels increase. Diagnosis The exact diagnostic tests and cut-off values to diagnose critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency are not agreed upon. This also applies to the distinction between absolute and relative adrenal insufficiency, a reason why the term critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency is preferred to relative adrenal insufficiency. The variation in cortisol levels according to disease type and severity, as well as variation within the same patient, hampers the establishment of a clear threshold below which CIRCI occurs. Moreover, in patients whose adrenal glands are already maximally stimulated, a stimulation test would not be informative. Furthermore, a short test might not adequately assess response to the chronic stress of critical illness. Both random total cortisol levels, total cortisol levels or increment after ACTH stimulation tests, free cortisol levels, or a combination of these have been proposed as diagnostic tests. Other stimulation tests for adrenal insufficiency which are used in non-critical patients, such as the test using metyrapone or a test which employs insulin to induce hypoglycemia, are not preferred for CIRCI. Both a metyrapone-induced decrease in cortisol and hypoglycemia are potentially harmful to intensive care patients. The exact dose of ACTH remains a matter of debate. In the CORTICUS study, ACTH stimulation testing predicted mortality whereas baseline cortisol levels did not. However, possible benefits of corticosteroid therapy do not seem to be completely predicted by ACTH stimulation testing. For these reasons, guidelines currently do not recommend that ACTH stimulation testing should guide the decision whether or not to administer corticosteroids. Cortisol immunoassays on the other hand have been shown to be prone to both over- and underestimation. Treatment In adults with septic shock and refractory hypotension despite resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasopressors, hydrocortisone is the preferred corticosteroid. It can be divided in several doses or administered as a continuous infusion. Fludrocortisone is optional in CIRCI, and dexamethasone is not recommended. Little evidence is available to judge when and how corticosteroid therapy should be stopped; guidelines recommend tapering corticosteroids when vasopressors are no longer needed. Corticosteroid treatment has also been suggested as an early treatment option in patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Steroids have not been shown beneficial for sepsis alone. Historically, higher doses of steroids were given, but these have been suggested to be harmful compared to the lower doses which are advocated today. In the CORTICUS study, hydrocortisone hastened the reversal of septic shock, but did not influence mortality, with an increased occurrence of septic shock relapse and hypernatremia. The latter findings tempered enthusiasm for the broad use of hydrocortisone in septic shock. Prior to this study, several other smaller studies showed beneficial effects of long courses of low doses of corticoid. Several factors (such as lack of statistical power due to slow recruitment) could have led a false-negative finding on mortality in the CORTICUS study; thus, more research is needed.

Some members are also found in southern Somalia. They are indigenous foragers, traditionally subsisting on hunting, gathering, and collecting honey. Overview Evidence suggests that the Aweer/Boni, along with the related Dahalo and Wata, are remnants of the early Bushman hunter-gatherer inhabitants of Eastern Africa. According to linguistic, anthropological and other data, these groups later came under the influence and adopted the Afro-Asiatic languages of the Eastern and Southern Cushitic peoples who moved into the area. Dahalo has consequently retained some of the characteristic click sounds of the Khoisan languages. The Aweer have historically been known in the literature as Boni or Sanye, both of which are derogatory terms for low-caste groups. Their lives were drastically changed when the Kenyan government curtailed their traditional way of life in the 1960s, forcing them to settle in villages along the Hindi-Kiunga Road, between the Boni National Reserve and the Dodori National Reserve.(2007, p. 472) Although the majority of the Aweer settled in villages located in this corridor between the two reserves, some established themselves in nearby Bajuni villages. Today, the Aweer in Kenya have been encouraged to adopt farming as their main livelihood. However, they also continue to engage in many of their traditional hunter-gatherer practices, utilizing the nearby forests for the collection of wild honey, plants for traditional medicine and building materials, and bush meat to supplement their diets. With laws banning the hunting of all wildlife in Kenya, the Aweer's traditional way of life is in danger. Although Aweer overwhelmingly reside in the East African nation of Kenya, due to the Aweer's traditional dwellings along the protuberant coastline, the Aweer, as well as other inhabitants of Lamu County are sometimes referred to as Horners.Amin, Rajan, et al. \\"Africa's forgotten forests: the conservation value of Kenya's northern coastal forests for large mammals.\\" Journal of East African Natural History 107.2 (2019): 41-61. Demographics According to the 2019 Kenyan population census, around 20,103 Aweer live in Kenya, where they are an officially recognized group. They have traditionally been concentrated in forests in the Coast Province, particularly the Lamu and Tana River districts. Some Aweer also inhabit southern Somalia's Badhade district.A.H.J.

He appeared in more than 90 films between 1961 and 2010. He was born on 16 February 1939 in Zagarolo, Italy. He died on 12 October 2010 in Tivoli, Italy due to cardiac arrest. Infanti is best known to non-Italian audiences as Fabrizio in The Godfather. Fabrizio was a bodyguard to Michael Corleone who was hiding in Sicily. Fabrizio betrays Michael by setting up explosives in his car, but kills his new bride instead. In the novel, Fabrizio is later shot dead in revenge for the killing. This scene was filmed but cut from the motion picture before its theatrical release. It appears in the 1977 The Godfather: A Novel for Television, which combined the first two films - The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, adding back scenes that had been previously cut and telling the story chronologically beginning with Vito Andolini's childhood in Sicily.

APGA represents the interests of public gas before the United States Congress, federal agencies and other energy-related stakeholders by developing regulatory and legislative policies that further the goals of our members. Through APGA, public gas systems work together to stay informed about new developments in safety, public policy, operations, technology, and the marketplace. APGA organizes meetings, seminars, and workshops to improve reliability, operational efficiency, and the regulatory environment. History The American Public Gas Association began out of a need to provide a voice for municipal gas systems. In November 1961, the founding fathers, J.H. Johnston of Memphis, TN; F.H. King of Holyoke, MA; E. Switzer of Macon, MO; A. Verrips of Sioux Center, IA., and C. Wheatley of Washington, D.C., as well as representatives from systems in 14 states, met in Washington D.C to establish a nationally recognized organization to advocate on behalf of the Nation’s public gas systems. The group appointed Mr. Francis H. King of Holyoke, MA as the Chairman of APGA pending the election of a President at the first annual conference. A month after the November meeting, on December 8, 1961, the American Public Gas Association was officially formed with the signing of the organizational charter. During this first year, APGA had just thirty members, which number has mushroomed during the ensuing fifty years to over 700 members nationwide. Founding Objectives: The group set forth with a wide range of objectives, including specifically to promote cooperation between public entities which own or operate gas distribution systems or gas facilities; to promote the mutual improvement of its members; to render service to its members, particularly in the fields of management • and operations; engineering, research, supply and demand, construction and safety; accounting and commercial practice; to develop comprehensive legal and legislative policy; and to find solution to common problems that affect all public gas systems. Membership The American Public Gas Association (APGA) is the only national association of publicly owned natural gas local distribution companies and has over 730 member utilities in 38 states. The term publicly owned natural gas systems applies to municipal gas distribution systems, public utility districts, county districts and other public agencies that utilize natural gas distribution facilities. Through APGA membership, public gas systems work together to keep informed about new developments in federal public policy and regulations, safety, operations, new technology, and the global markets that could affect the communities and consumers they serve. APGA members participate through their association with the organization's committees. Committees include: *Codes & Standards *Gas Supply *Government Relations *Legislative Issues *Marketing & Sales *Natural Gas Vehicles *Operations & Safety Issues *Regulatory Issues Mayors and utility board members can also be involved in the association's activities through participation in the APGA Public Gas Policy Council (PGPC). The PGPC is made up of elected and appointed officials from public gas communities across the US and assists APGA with its advocacy efforts.

Noddle's Island was historically one of the Boston Harbor Islands off Boston, Massachusetts. Most of the original land of Noddle's Island now makes up the southern part of the neighborhood of East Boston; it is now part of the mainland since the strait connecting Noddle's Island to Hog Island and that connecting Hog Island to the mainland city of Revere were filled in the early 20th century. The original contours of Noddle's Island were also greatly obscured by the 20th-century construction of Logan International Airport, which filled the tidal flats between Noddle's Island and Governor's, Bird, and Apple islands to its east. In some sources it is spelled \\"Noodle's Island\\". History For over three hundred years, the island was known as Noddle's Island, for William Noddle, who was probably sent out by John Brereton, and settled upon it in the 1620s, before Boston was established by the Puritans. The island was used for grazing livestock and there was a fortified structure on the island. Mr. Noddle, a resident of Salem, died in 1632 when his canoe overturned on the South River, according to the journal of John Winthrop.King's Handbook of Boston by M. F. Sweetser Cambridge, Massachusetts, Moses King, Publisher - Harvard Square, 1878. Sometime in the late 1620s or early 1630s, Rev. Samuel Maverick, an Anglican clergyman, became the owner of the island through his wife's inheritance. Maverick was reputed to be New-England's first slaveowner, following a 1638 purchase from a Captain Pierce of the Tortugas. The First Baptist Church of Boston met secretly on the island in the 17th century to avoid persecution by the Puritan state. During the American Revolutionary War \\"on this same island was fought the second battle of the Revolution (also known as the Battle of Chelsea Creek), and the first in which the American artillery was used.\\" After the British left Boston harbor, the island was used as a hospital for the French Fleet in 1780 who dubbed it \\"\\"L'ile de France'\\" and buried numerous troops on the island. Following this the island was heavily fortified by the Bostonians with an earthwork known as \\"Noddle's Island Fort\\", a rebuilding of a 19-gun British work, later rebuilt and renamed Fort Strong in the War of 1812 after Governor Caleb Strong.Noddle's Island at American Forts Network See also *Logan International Airport References External links *East Boston History Boston Harbor islands Boston Harbor peninsulas and former islands East Boston Islands of Suffolk County, Massachusetts ","title":"Noddle's Island"},{"id":"19190501","text":"Desanka \\"Beba\\" Lončar (Serbian Cyrillic: Десанка „Беба“ Лончар, born 28 April 1943) is a Serbian-Italian film actress. She appeared in 52 films between 1960 and 1982. She was born in Belgrade, Serbia. Known for her film career during the 1960s and 1970s, she first became a star in native Yugoslavia before moving to Italy where she achieved considerable success. Early life Growing up in the Belgrade neighbourhood of Dorćol, Lončar got involved with performing at an early age. During the late 1950s she was given on-camera speaking bits in kids' and youth programmes on the recently launched TV Belgrade. She studied acting under tutelage of director Soja Jovanović who gave Lončar her film debut — an uncredited bit part in 1960's '. Career Debut Lončar's break came when she got cast alongside another pair of first-time film performers Boris Dvornik and Dušica Žegarac in France Štiglic's Deveti krug, a Holocaust story about a Jewish family from Ljubljana that would go on to achieve notable critical success. Before Deveti krug was even released, sixteen-year-old Lončar landed her first lead role — the part of the beautiful young girl Sonja Ilić in the teenage comedy '. Early career in Yugoslavia Deveti krug premiered in late April 1960 to good reviews. Although the lead role of Ruth Alkalaj went to another teenage up-an- coming actress — Dušica Žegarac — Lončar's portrayal of Magda also received very positive notices. The film got selected for competition at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival during May with Lončar and Žegarac, both still high school students, getting their first taste of glitz and glamour as they made the rounds at the festival.YU heroina, Beba Lončar: Na ceni je elegancija, a ne ekstravagancija!;Mini džuboks, late 1968 Several months later in August, the film won the Golden Arena award at the 1960 Pula Film Festival in addition to becoming Yugoslav official submission for the best foreign movie and actually getting nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 33rd Academy Awards. Later that fall Ljubav i moda (The Love and the Fashion) came out, creating a sensation the likes of which hadn't been seen in the country up to that point. Teenage Lončar had her voice dubbed in the movie by the twenty-nine-year-old actress . Backed by a pop music soundtrack that achieved its own popularity on the strength of the \\"Devojko mala\\" track sung by Đuza Stojiljković, the cheeky picture became a commercial smash hit in communist Yugoslavia. Carrying the breezy comedy alongside as well as established stars of Yugoslav cinema Miodrag Petrović Čkalja and Mija Aleksić, Lončar's beauty and charm left an impression on the general audiences that paved the way for her movie career. With only two films under her belt, by the end of 1960, seventeen-year-old Lončar's cinematic profile was raised beyond all expectations. She next got cast as the female lead in Aleksandar Petrović's directorial debut — romantic drama Dvoje — alongside Miha Baloh and Miloš Žutić. Playing the role of mysteriously flirtatious Belgrade girl Jovana Zrnić, she once again got plenty of positive reactions in the press. The movie got released in late July 1961, and the following year got selected for the competition programme at Cannes. Although it ended up not quite matching the success of Deveti krug on the festival circuit, Dvoje got very good reviews for its innovative approach as a breath of fresh air in the Yugoslav cinema that up to that point mostly made genre films of very specific and rigid structure and narrative. The movie also marked the first time Lončar was officially billed with her nickname Beba rather than her given first name, a practice that would be continued for the remainder of her career. Already a bona fide film star in Yugoslavia as well as a nationwide sex symbol, Lončar started getting parts in foreign productions being shot in Yugoslavia. Franz Antel cast her in the supporting role of Afra in the Austrian movie ', which was the first time she took part in a foreign film. Following a few more Yugoslav movies where she had notable roles such as Soja Jovanović's comedy ', whose screenplay was based on Branislav Nušić's novel of the same name, and 's ', Lončar took a supporting part in the British over-the-top adventure film The Long Ships directed by Jack Cardiff and starring Richard Widmark, Sidney Poitier, Russ Tamblyn and Rosanna Schiaffino, that was entirely shot in Yugoslavia. She reportedly got the role of Gerda due to another actress already cast for the role leaving the set. Forced to scramble, Cardiff looked for a local replacement and ended up casting blonde Lončar whose physical features fit the requirements of the Viking woman role. Another foreign production in Yugoslavia Lončar took part in was the West German-funded, English-language, musical western Freddy in the Wild West, directed by Sobey Martin, with the young actress in the female lead role opposite Austrian singer-actor Freddy Quinn. In between she also starred along with Milena Dravić (another young Belgrade actress whose career path resembled Lončar's) as well Ljubiša Samardžić, Boris Dvornik, and in a romantic summer youth comedy ' about local boys from the Dalmatian coastline seducing young tourist girls. The Italian period Lončar in 1974 Lončar's career in the Italian cinema began in 1964 when she got cast by Mauro Bolognini for his segment within ', a three-segment film. At only twenty-one years of age she moved to Rome and continued acting in Italian films. The year 1965 was a breakout one for Lončar in Italy as she appeared in six films. In early spring, Carlo Lizzani's La Celestina P... R... premiered where she had a sizable role followed by a bit part in Gérard Oury's Le Corniaud and a bigger one in Steno's Letti sbagliati. The late summer saw her in Mario Monicelli's Casanova 70 playing one of Marcello Mastroianni's many love interests in the film followed by Luciano Salce's Slalom where Lončar and Daniela Bianchi appeared as tandem of temptresses weaving their web around the duo of pals, both of whom are married, played by Vittorio Gassman and Adolfo Celi. She rounded the year off with Massimo Franciosa's Il morbidone alongside Paolo Ferrari, Anouk Aimée, Sylva Koscina, and Margaret Lee. Her early roles in Italy revealed a theme that would continue throughout her career in the country as Italian directors and producers generally cast her in roles of exotic and mysterious seductresses within the commedia all'italiana genre.

The two met in Split during the 1970s and had a son Leo in 1982. After giving birth for the first time at the age of 39, Lončar decided to end her film career. Towards the late 1980s, the couple separated as Radeljak left Lončar for the younger actress Ena Begović. Following a bitter court battle, their divorce was finalized in 1994 with Radeljak getting the custody of their only son. During summer 2000, Lončar started living with Serbian skier Stevan Marinković Knićanin whom she eventually married. In late 2000, she moved from Rome back to her hometown Belgrade where she's been living ever since. Despite not acting for almost 30 years, Lončar is still very much in demand by the Serbian and former Yugoslav media. However, she leads a very quiet, low-key life and rarely makes media appearances. Her latest one was for the 50th anniversary of the release of Ljubav i moda during June 2010.

MAEB stem-loops typically occur in blocks of repeats, usually with 2–6 consecutive instances of MAEB stem-loops separated by a short and conserved linker sequence. As many as 12 consecutive MAEB stem-loops have been observed in a single block. Most MAEB blocks are positioned in the presumed 5' UTR of downstream genes. Out of 141 blocks of consecutive MAEB stem-loops, 132 are positioned in a possible 5' UTR. Therefore, MAEB stem-loops are likely to correspond to a cis-regulatory element. It was observed that the genes apparently regulated by MAEB generally have a role in primary metabolism, i.e., the synthesis, catabolism or transport of small molecules; few MAEB- associated genes are involved in other functions, such as signal transduction, motility or replication. Thus, the motif is associated with a metabolic role, and indeed a weak association with the glycine cleavage system was observed. Three hypotheses for the biological role of MAEB were considered. One is that the MAEB stem-loop is really a DNA-binding domain of a dimeric protein, and that the two subunits of this protein bind on opposite strands of the duplex DNA. However, two nucleotides at complementary positions on the 5' and 3' side of the stem are almost always purines. If the MAEB motif is really a short DNA-binding domain and its reverse complement, then the 3' part of the apparent RNA stem at this position should contain the complementary pyrimidine, and not also be a purine. Therefore, this hypothesis is unlikely to be true. The second hypothesis considered is that MAEB is a repetitive DNA sequence. Although the repetitive nature of MAEB stem-loops supports this kind of a role, the association of MAEB with metabolic genes is inconsistent with known repetitive elements, which are typically the result of selfish replication or errors in replication. Rather the repetitive nature of MAEB stem-loops probably has a functional role for the cell. The third hypothesis advanced is that MAEB stem-loops bind a protein, and the multiple occurrences of MAEB stem-loops within a single RNA molecule would allow the binding of more proteins per RNA molecule. Such an arrangement is similar to CsrB RNA, which contains roughly 18 hairpins, each of which binds one CsrA protein subunit. The true function of MAEB stem-loops remain unknown.

Biography  Tenenbaum was born in Hod HaSharon in 1979. He became famous in 1998 when he was arrested for hacking computers belonging to NASA, The Pentagon, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the Knesset, MIT, among other high-profile organizations. He also hacked into the computers of Palestinian groups and claimed to have destroyed the website of Hamas.Hacker Case Taps Into Fame, Fury - Los Angeles Times To do this, Tenenbaum installed packet analyzer and trojan horse software on some of the hacked servers. The then-US Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre stated that the attack was \\"the most organized and systematic attack to date\\" on US military systems. The military had thought that they were witnessing sophisticated Iraqi 'information warfare'. In an effort to stop the attack, the United States government assembled agents from the FBI, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, NASA, the US Department of Justice, the Defense Information Systems Agency, the NSA, and the CIA. The government was so worried that the warning and briefings went all the way up to the President of the United States. The investigation, code-named \\"Solar Sunrise,\\" eventually snared two California teenagers. After their arrest, a subsequent probe led US investigators to Tenenbaum, who was arrested after Israeli police were given evidence of Tenenbaum's activities. Later, the FBI sent agents to Israel to question Tenenbaum. Before he was sentenced, Tenenbaum served briefly in the Israel Defense Forces, but was released soon thereafter after he was involved in a traffic collision. In 2001, Tenenbaum pleaded guilty, while stating that he wasn't attempting to infiltrate the computer systems to get a hold of secrets but rather to prove that the systems were flawed. Tenenbaum was sentenced to a year and a half in prison, from which he served only 8 months following the \\"Deri Law\\". After the attack, the FBI made a short 18 minutes training video called, Solar Sunrise: Dawn of a New Threat that was sold as part of a hacker defense course that was discontinued in September 2004. In 2003, after being freed from prison, Tenenbaum founded his own Information security company called \\"2XS\\". In September 2008, following an investigation by Canadian police and the US Secret Service, Tenenbaum and three accomplices were arrested in Montreal. Tenenbaum was charged with six counts of credit card fraud, in the sum of approx. US$1.5 million. U.S. investigators suspected Tenenbaum of being part of a scam, in which the hackers penetrated financial institutions around the world to steal credit card numbers. They then sold these numbers to other people, who used them to perpetrate massive credit card fraud. He was later extradited to the United States to stand trial,http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3709692,00.html and was in the custody of the US Marshals for more than a year. In August 2010, he was released on bond after agreeing to plead guilty.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4252506,00.html In July 2012, after Tenenbaum accepted a plea bargain which may have involved cooperation in the investigation, New York district judge Edward Korman sentenced Tenenbaum to the time already served in prison. Tenenbaum was also ordered to pay $503,000 and was given three years' probation.

Kwaadmechelen was first mentioned as Quaedmechelen in 1365. The village became an independent parish in the 16th century. In 1892, Exploitation des Procédés Raynaud, a chemical company nowadays known as Tessenderlo Chemie, was founded in Kwaadmechelen. In 1925, the railway line was extended with a station in Kwaadmechelen. The railway line closed for passengers in 1957, but remains in use as an industrial line. In 1977, Kwaadmechelen merged with Ham. Even though Kwaadmechelen was the biggest village, the new municipality was named Ham, because it was a former heerlijkheid ( landed estate). Nature The nature reserve is located near Kwaadmechelen. The reserve is named after the Dutch word for male rabbits due to the abundance of rabbits and hares in the area. In the 19th century, large parts of the Campine were transformed into agricultural land.

The festival took place in Louisville, Kentucky over Memorial Day weekend but moved across the Ohio River to Jeffersonville, Indiana starting in 2017. Tribute bands, as well as internationally recognized bands, perform over the course of the festival, playing the music of The Beatles, as well as the music of other artists. Abbey Road on the River is a four-time winner of the Kentucky Travel Industry Association's Top 10 Spring Festivals. History Abbey Road on the River was founded and is produced by Cleveland resident Gary Jacob, who has produced the show since its inception. Abbey Road on the River began with three events in Cleveland in 2002, 2003 and 2004. Following the 2004 event, Abbey Road on the River moved its main location to Louisville; it continues to be held annually in that area over Memorial Day weekend. During its tenure in Louisville, the took place primarily on the city's Belvedere, within and around the Muhammad Ali Center and within the event's host hotel. In 2017 it was moved across the Ohio River to Jeffersonville, Indiana, now taking place on that city's riverfront. Event activities and attendees The types of tribute bands that perform at Abbey Road on the River vary greatly. Some bands look, sound and act like The Beatles, while others simply play Beatles' music or the solo music of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and George Harrison. The festival also features other Beatles-related activities, ranging from speakers, discussion panels, and film screenings, to the annual parade complete with costumes and yellow submarine, as well as Beatles merchandise for sale, along with food and drink options on the Belvedere grounds.

He made more than 300 appearances in the Football League, including 168 for Exeter City and 122 for Brentford. Bond was born in Ilminster, Somerset. He began his career as an apprentice with Bristol City, turning professional in September 1971, although he had made his league debut on the last day of the previous season. He remained at Ashton Gate for a further six years, most of which was spent as deputy to John Shaw or Ray Cashley. In November 1974 he was loaned to Exeter City, playing 30 league games. The following season, he was loaned three times, to Torquay United in October 1975, to Scunthorpe United in December 1975, and to Colchester United in January 1976, before joining NASL side St. Louis Stars on loan for the 1976 season. Finally, in August 1977, after 30 league games for Bristol City, Bond moved to Brentford, where he was to find regular first-team football, playing 130 games in the next 3 years. In October 1980 he returned to the south-west, joining Exeter City, playing 138 league games before leaving league football, and joining Yeovil Town. He later joined Weymouth from where he moved to Bath City in October 1987 for a fee of £2,000. He was ever-present for the rest of the season, but chose to return to Yeovil Town after City's relegation from the Conference at the end of the season. He remained with Yeovil until his retirement, although did have a loan spell with Gloucester City from November 1990 and played three games for them the following season. Soon after his retirement, a chance meeting with Alan Ball led to him becoming goalkeeping coach at Exeter City, while also running a newsagents in Exeter. He subsequently worked as a coach at a number of clubs before coaching in the United States. He returned to the UK and worked with a number of clubs as well as coaching the FA's Youth Academy. He spent three years as goalkeeping coach with Bristol City's Youth Academy before another spell coaching in the United States. On his return he coached at Exeter City and Torquay United before returning as goalkeeping coach to Yeovil Town. He then joined Bristol Rovers as goalkeeping coach. In 2011 Bond left Yeovil Town to concentrate on his sportswear business.

SP 9010 generated from two V16 Maybach MD870 diesel engines. It was painted to Southern Pacific's 1958 standard, the so-called \\"bloody nose\\" colors of Scarlet and Lark Dark Gray, for its entire operating career. It was renumbered to SP 9113 in late 1965, rebuilt extensively at SP's Sacramento General Shops (later Sacramento Locomotive Works) during the latter half of 1966, and was initially retired in 1968. It was revived and rebuilt by Sacramento General Shops into a \\"camera car\\" for the purpose of shooting motion picture background plates for a ground-based full-motion locomotive training simulator. As camera car number 8799, it was retired in 1984 and donated to the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento, California. It was de-accessioned by CSRM and acquired by the Pacific Locomotive Association and moved to the Niles Canyon Railway's Brightside, California rail yard in the summer of 2008. At the date of its inception, its type represented the highest-horsepower six-axle diesel locomotives in the world. SP 9010 is the sole surviving ML 4000 C'C' built for use in North America, and the sole surviving mainline diesel-hydraulic locomotive in North America (Several diesel-hydraulic switchers exist in service and in museums). Operational history SP 9010 was delivered as part of the second order of ML 4000 C'C' units in the Spring of 1964, road numbers 9003-9017. (ML: Mechanical Locomotive; 4000: net horsepower; C'C': two powered bogies/trucks with three connected axles each.) The first order of six locomotives—three for SP and three for the Denver and Rio Grande Western) -- were called \\"Prototypes\\" by KM, but were popularly known in the U.S. as \\"cab units\\" due to their fully enclosed car bodies, similar to the EMD F-unit. KM originally suggested to SP and DRGW a \\"center cab\\" unit, which had a cab in between the two prime movers, but both turned it down. SP 9010 was a member of the second production order of fifteen locomotives. These were called \\"Series\\" units by KM, but were known as \\"hood units\\" in the US after the more modern narrow-hood carbody with external walkways. SP's stated motives for ordering the German-manufactured locomotives were a desire for more power per axle, better adhesion to the rails, freedom from electrical malfunctions, and fewer locomotives in 'consist' than the available American diesel-electric locomotives of the time. SP owned a total of 21 ML 4000 C'C' locomotives, and a total of 24 of the diesel-hydraulic type. ML 4000s were originally used in freight service on SP's famous Donner Pass line over California's Sierra Nevada, as they were originally intended to replace the EMD F7, and had a special track set up at the Roseville locomotive shops specifically for servicing the locomotives, with German mechanics and supervisors from K-M taking U.S. residence. However, the locomotives were found unsuitable in mountain service after extensive testing and relegated to service in the flat territory of the San Joaquin Valley, often running in tandem with EMD F7s or EMD GP9s. Retirement as a locomotive The ML 4000s and diesel-hydraulic locomotives in general began to be phased out in the late 1960s, as American locomotive technology progressed and more power with better adhesion control was able to be generated by single-engine diesel-electric locomotives. Maintenance requirements had exceeded the average levels of comparable domestic locomotives, and a planned upgrading of the entire KM \\"Series\\" fleet was halted after only four of the 15 were so modified. ML 4000s began retirement in 1967, coincident with the arrival of high-horsepower American-made EMD SD40s, SD45s, and GE U33Cs. SP announced the end of its diesel-hydraulic program on February 13, 1968, and from that date forward, any wear or damage requiring major repair or overhaul would result in the retirement of that unit. SP 9113 was sidelined on September 18, 1968 with damage to the number 9 cylinder of the forward Maybach V-16 and was officially retired November 22, 1968. Scrapping of the Krauss- Maffei fleet took place at Associated Metals in Sacramento, California, with the exception of SP 9113. Camera car SP 9113 (ex-9010) was converted into a rolling motion picture camera platform between 1968 and 1969 at the Sacramento General Shops. Its purpose was to record picture and audio to create the background motion plates and sound effects for a computerized locomotive simulator for engineer training, developed by Conductron-Missouri, a subsidiary of McDonnell-Douglas. This pioneering six-axis-of-motion locomotive simulator was housed in a fixed-base operation in Southern California. Called the \\"Southern Pacific Engine Service Training Center,\\" it was located in Cerritos, California. SP 9113 when being rebuilt carried the unofficial identity 'SPMW #1'. The railroad's traffic computer required 4 digits, and so it emerged from the shop bearing a small SPMW 1166 stencil. In June 1969 it was renumbered to SP 8799, in standard Southern Pacific locomotive numbering practice. (SP's lowest numbered SD45 was #8800, so a four-digit number was created for the Simulator Camera Car and the simulator itself which occupied the number immediately preceding.) The most drastic change in appearance was the locomotive's short hood (or \\"nose\\"), which had been removed. In its place, a custom structure was fabricated to house twin Mitchell half-frame 35-millimeter film cameras and Nagra III timecode magnetic recording equipment, with stand-up headroom and two seats salvaged from another KM for operators. Heavy, thick steel was used for collision protection and to replace lost weight. The front Voith L830rU transmission was removed to create space for the camera enclosure, while the Number 1 radiator compartment was emptied of radiators and ancillary equipment to house an Onan skid-mount generator to power the camera equipment. The two engines and rear transmission were simply disabled, principally being retained for weight. All gearboxes and Cardan (universal) shafts were removed; gears were left in place on the six axles. All of the controls remained in the cab so that it could control a locomotive pushing behind it, much like a cab car is used on a commuter train. The camera car could be put on the lead of any train, but it primarily operated as special trips with just one locomotive behind it for power. Known locomotives used for power are a single EMD F7 B-unit, an EMD GP-9, an EMD GP35, and a Cotton Belt (St. Louis Southwestern) SD45T-2. Initially reassigned to Roseville, California and making filming runs over portions of SP's Donner Pass line, it was relocated in the 1970s to what became its permanent home at West Colton Yard in Southern California. When in operation, SP personnel referred to SP 8799 as the \\"Simulator Car.\\" SP used the Simulator Camera Car (under its number 8799) to film for a training program set up by SP. Since the camera of the Camera Car sat about at eye level with an EMD SD45's eye level, the unit was used to train engineers on how to operate such a locomotive. A mock SD45 cab was fabricated and installed in the fixed-base simulator facility in Cerritos, California. In the 16 years to 1986 as a simulator locomotive 8799 had assisted in the training of 2186 student engineers. Retirement as a camera car and restoration as a locomotive The camera car was retired in 1984 and donated to the California State Railroad Museum in 1986. Initially, volunteers removed the camera \\"nose\\" and opened up the highly modified cab windows to 1964 profiles, with the goal of restoration to original appearance. However, that restoration was halted, and the engine sat in outdoor storage exposed to weather and vandals, with much of the copper wiring and a good portion of the Behr radiator assemblies being stolen. It was de-accessioned by CSRM and donated to the Pacific Locomotive Association (PLA) in 2008, along with several pieces of rolling stock. They were moved by the Union Pacific Railroad in the summer of 2008 from Sacramento to their interchange with Niles Canyon Railway at Hearst, California. The Niles Canyon Railway then transferred SP 9010 to its Brightside Yard. Restoration by volunteers of the PLA started in 2008, with much of the cosmetic restoration nearly completed in 2012. The restoration process has included the building of a replica of the locomotive's original nose, and returning the locomotive to its original 1964 appearance with its original road number, 9010. It retained cab controls as the Simulator Camera car and was pushed by a locomotive providing power from behind. All gearing was removed during the Camera Car conversion, but a powered bogie (\\"truck\\") was located and salvaged in Europe. New Cardan main driveshafts were created by The Welte Group to original specifications, allowing the rear Maybach Mercedes-Benz V-16 to power the replaced rear truck. That motor, Serial 91168, is under rebuilding with new factory parts by the volunteer crew of the Pacific Locomotive Association. On February 14th, 2017, the Number 2 Maybach MD870 started up for the first time in nearly 50 years. On October 19, 2017, the locomotive moved under its own power for the first time since 1968, and pulled an SD9 and NW2 up a slight grade. After many years of restoration work, the locomotive debuted on July 20, 2019. There are no plans to restore the Number 1 Maybach MD870 due to its long-time exposure to the elements.

Rudolf Leonhard (27 October 1889, in Lissa, German Empire (today Leszno, Poland) – 19 December 1953, in East Berlin) was a German author and communist activist. Life Leonhard came from a Jewish family of lawyers and studied law and Philology in Berlin and Göttingen. In 1914 he volunteered for the German military effort in World War I, but quickly converted to pacifism and was brought before a military court for his convictions. In 1918 he joined the USPD (Independent German Social Democratic Party) and fought alongside Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg in the 1918 revolution. In 1919, he joined the KPD (Communist Party of Germany), but left that party in favor of the left-communist KAPD (German Communist Workers’ Party), which he also left after a year. In 1918 he married the author Susanne Köhler, but was divorced from her after one year. However, Susanne had a son Wladimir Leonhard in 1921 (later called Wolfgang), for whom the presumed father was Rudolf. Susanne Leonhard, Gestohlenes Leben, Steingrüben (1959), p. 13 In the early 1920s he married Frieda Gertrud Riess, a prominent Berlin portrait photographer. From 1919 onwards he was a freelance author for the publication Die Weltbühne, and from the summer of 1922 he worked for the publishing house Verlag Die Schmiede as a lector and as the editor of a series of books, “Außenseiter der Gesellschaft”. In late November 1925, he began and led the Gruppe 1925 which counted Bertolt Brecht, Alfred Döblin, Albert Ehrenstein, Leonhard Frank, Walter Hasenclever, Walter Mehring and Kurt Tucholsky among its members. After a difference of opinion, Leonhard left the group in 1927. In March 1928, he moved to Paris at the invitation of his friend Walter Hasenclever and lived with him until 1934. In April 1933, Leonhard took part in the foundation of the „Ligue des Combattants de la Paix\\" and was co- president of the German sector alongside Albert Einstein. After the “Schutzverband Deutscher Schriftsteller” was taken over by the „Reichsverband deutscher Schriftsteller\\", he successfully founded the „Schutzverband Deutscher Schriftsteller im Ausland\\" and became leader of the French section. He describes his experiences in the Spanish Civil War in his collection of stories “Der Tod des Don Quijote”. From 1939 until 1944, he was detained. First he was held in Le Vernet, then he was transferred to Castres. He fled, was recaptured, and eventually fled again, living in underground Marseille until the end of the war. He returned to Paris in 1944. In 1947 he took part in the first Congress of German Authors. In 1950 he returned to Germany and took up residence in East Berlin. He was very ill at this point. Because he was seen as an immigrant from the West and due to his son’s activities, he was only granted a small place on the East German literary scene. He died in 1953.

St. Pauls' mascot is the saint.  History  St. Paul's Episcopal School was founded in 1947 with one section of twenty kindergarten students. William S. Mann, former Rector of St. Paul's Episcopal Church, nurtured the development of the parish school from 1953 until he left St. Paul's in 1969. With the addition of sections and grades, enrollment grew to 243 students by 1965. In 1966 Jack Noble White joined the staff at the church as organist/choirmaster and minister of youth. He then succeeded Rev. Mann as Headmaster of the growing school. St. Paul's ceased to be a parish school with its incorporation as an independent institution in 1968, yet maintained its parochial core in Episcopal dogma as complement to a growing academic curriculum.. The original Dogwood Lane campus, which included the main building and , was purchased in 1969. Primary grades remained housed at the church property with upper levels moving to the new property only two blocks away. Students of that year's 6th grade class progressed throughout each following school year - becoming original members of each grade level - until expansion was complete through grade 12. In 1974, the first graduation was held for 73 seniors. Mr. White had completed the expansion of the church school that Rev. Mann had begun. That summer of 1974 found St. Paul's with 53 employees and 800 students. Jack Noble White's vision and leadership remained active as Headmaster into 1976 and at the church through 1977. He was followed by Headmasters Webb Reyner (previously Asst. Headmaster under White) and Rufus Bethea. Description Structure The school has a four-level structure: the Lower School (Pre-K through 2nd grade), the Intermediate School (3rd grade and 4th grade), the Middle School (5th grade through 8th grade), and the Upper School (9th grade through 12th grade). Campus The main campus houses the Intermediate School, Middle School, and Upper School grade-levels. The main building, off Dogwood Lane, can be found on \\"The Horseshoe.\\" \\"The Horseshoe\\" is a looping driveway that surrounds Saints' Square, a memorial-square and common meeting place on the school's campus. Also located on the main campus are buildings containing 85 classrooms, auxiliary buildings, two gymnasiums, a football field and track, a baseball field, a softball field, multiple practice fields, and a cafeteria. The Lower School campus is separate from the school's main campus and can be found 0.4 miles down Old Shell Road at the same location as the church associated with the school.  Athletics  St. Paul's has won a total of 178 Alabama state championships in 18 sports, including: baseball, girls' basketball, girls' cross-country, boys' cross- country, football, boys' golf, girls' golf, girls' indoor track, boys' indoor track, girls' soccer, girls' swimming and diving, boys' swimming and diving, girls' tennis, boys' tennis, girls' outdoor track, boys' outdoor track, volleyball, and girls' heptathlon. St. Paul's also has a long-standing athletic rivalry with UMS-Wright, another local private high school that is just 2.2 miles away down Old Shell Road. In football, the two teams meet every year in the \\"Battle of Old Shell Road.\\" St. Paul's has been coined as being a \\"Pathway to the pros\\" by regional news media in recent years referring to the vast number of professional athletes who were local stars appearing first at SPS athletic events.

Permission to re- use this material was obtained from the original copyright holder, the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas, on August 25th 2008. are a class of transcription coregulators that have been shown to be involved in any aspect of signaling by any member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. A comprehensive database of nuclear receptor coregulators can be found at the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas website.  Introduction  The ability of nuclear receptors to alternate between activation and repression in response to specific molecular cues, is now known to be attributable in large part to a diverse group of cellular factors, collectively termed coregulators and including coactivators and corepressors. The study of nuclear receptors owed a debt to decades of historical endocrinology and pathology, and prior to their discovery there was a wealth of empirical evidence that suggested their existence. Coregulators, in contrast, have been the subject of a rapid accumulation of functional and mechanistic data which is yet to be consolidated into an integrated picture of their biological functions. While this article refers to the historical terms \\"coactivator\\" and \\"corepressor,\\" this distinction is less clear than was at first thought, and it is now known that cell type, cell signaling state and promoter identity can influence the direction of action of any given coregulator. Coregulators are often incorrectly referred to as cofactors, which are small, non-protein molecules required by an enzyme for full activity, e.g. NAD+.  Coactivators  As far back as the early 1970s, receptor-associated nonhistone proteins were known to support the function of nuclear receptors. In the early 1990s, some investigators such as Keith Yamamoto had suggested a role for non-DNA nuclear acceptor molecules. A biochemical strategy designed in Myles Brown's laboratory provided the first direct evidence of ligand-dependent recruitment by nuclear receptors of ancillary molecules. The yeast two-hybrid protein-protein interaction assay led to the identification of an array of receptor-interacting factors in David Moore's laboratory and RIP140 repressive protein was discovered in Malcolm Parker's laboratory. The stage was now set for the cloning of the coactivators. The first authentic, common nuclear receptor coactivator was steroid receptor coactivator 1, or SRC-1 (NCOA1), first cloned in Bert O’Malley's laboratory. SRC-1 and two related proteins, GRIP-1 (NCOA2), cloned first by Michael Stallcup, and ACTR/p/CIP (NCOA3), initially identified in Ron Evans and Geoff Rosenfeld's lab, together make up the SRC/NCOA family of coactivators. The SRC family is defined by the presence in the N-terminus of tandem PAS and beta-HLH motifs; a centrally-located domain which binds the coactivators CBP and p300; and a C-terminal region which mediates interaction with the CARM-1 coactivator. Malcolm Parker's laboratory was the first to show that a recurring structural feature of many coactivators is an alpha-helical LXXLL motif (a contiguous sequence of 5 amino acids where L = leucine and X = any amino acid), or nuclear receptor box, present from a single to several copies in many coactivators, which is implicated in their ligand-dependent recruitment by the receptor AF-2. The SRC coactivator family, for example, has a conserved cluster of NR boxes located in the central region of each member of the family. Coactivators can be categorized based upon their varied functional properties. To name a few, classes of coactivators include: * Acetyltransferases, such as members of the Src/NCOA family * Ubiquitin ligases, such as E6-AP * ATP-coupled chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the SWI/SNF/BRG-1 (SMARCA4) complex * Protein methylases, such as CARM-1 and PRMT-1 * RNA transcripts, such as SRA1 * Cell cycle regulators such as cdc 25B * RNA helicases such as p72 (DDX17) * And members of the TRAP/DRIP mediator complex, which foster direct contact with components of the basal transcription machinery  Corepressors  Transcriptional repression by corepressors is in many ways conceptually comparable to the mediation of receptor transcriptional activation by coactivators, but has an opposite outcome. Recruitment of corepressors, generally occurring in the absence of ligand, depends on a critical conformation of the receptor AF-2 domain, as well as upon nuclear receptor box-like helical motifs in the corepressor. Moreover, corepressors themselves recruit ancillary enzyme activities which help to establish or maintain the repressive state at their target promoters. Early cell transfection experiments had shown that discrete regions of certain receptors, such as thyroid hormone receptor, were sufficient to repress, or silence, reporter genes when fused to DNA-binding domains of heterologous transcription factors, suggesting that specific cellular factors – or corepressors - might bind to these regions and silence receptors in cells. Again, using the yeast two-hybrid screen, two corepressors were isolated in rapid succession, nuclear receptor corepressor, or NCoR, in Geoff Rosenfeld's laboratory, and silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors, or SMRT, by Ron Evans. Alignment of the two proteins indicated that they had a largely common domain structure, suggesting parallels in their mode of action. Mitch Lazar's group has shown that inactive nuclear receptors recruit corepressors in part through amphipathic helical peptides called CoRNR boxes, which are similar to the coactivator nuclear receptor boxes. In addition to these structural analogies, corepressors and coactivators have common functional themes. The acetylation state of nucleosomes on a promoter is related to the rate of transcription of the gene. Histone acetylase coactivators increase the rate of acetylation, opening the nucleosome to transcription factors; histone deacetylases recruited by corepressors reverse this reaction, silencing transcription of the target gene. Other histone modifications have similar or opposite effects on transcription.  Biology of coregulators  The physiological role of SRC/p160s, CBP/p300 and other coactivators has been implied by knockout studies in mice of genes encoding these proteins. The effects of these deletions range from the profound effects on viability characteristic of TRAP220, CBP and p300, to the more subtle developmental and metabolic phenotypes associated with members of the SRC family. Using sequences from cloned coregulator genes, laboratories such as those led by Bert O’Malley (SRC-1), Bob Roeder (TRAP220), Geoff Rosenfeld (NCoR), and Pierre Chambon (GRIP1) were able to delete, or knockout these genes in mice. These studies showed that coactivators were required for physiological and developmental functions of steroid and thyroid hormones in living animals, and that corepressors too have crucial roles in the development of certain organs.  Regulation of coregulator function  General model for cross-talk between afferent signaling pathways, coregulators and nuclear receptors at a promoter showing local nucleosomal condensation.A spectrum of post-translational modifications is known to regulate the functional relationships between nuclear receptors, their coregulator complexes, and their target gene networks. Targeted, reversible enzymatic modifications such as acetylation, methylation phosphorylation and terminal modifications such as ubiquitination have been shown to have a variety of effects on coregulator function. Coregulators may be viewed as control interfaces for integrating multiple afferent stimuli into an appropriate cellular response. One possible scenario is that differential phosphorylation of coactivators may direct their combinatorial recruitment into different transcriptional complexes at distinct promoters in specific cells.  General model  Coactivators exist in large, modular complexes in the cell, and are known to participate in many different protein-protein interactions. A current model is that the composition of these complexes can become fluid, mixing and matching subunits to tailor the specific needs of different receptors, ligands or promoters. While spatiotemporal aspects of nuclear receptor and coregulator action remain poorly defined, a broad composite model of nuclear receptor action invokes corepressors as critical mediators of nuclear receptor silencing. In turn, a variety of coactivators are implicated in transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors, including SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling machines, SRC/p160s and TRAP/DRIP. The model accommodates the ability of membrane G protein coupled signaling pathways and tyrosine receptor signaling to cross-talk with coactivator and corepressor functions at the transcriptional level.  Coregulators and human disease  With the well-documented role of nuclear receptor coregulators in a variety of molecular functions within the cell, it should come as no surprise that evidence implicates them in a wide variety of diseases states, including cancer, metabolic syndromes (obesity, diabetes) and heritable syndromes such as Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome, Angelman syndrome and Von Gierke's disease. A comprehensive review of the role of coregulators in human disease has been published, which shows that over 165 of the known coregulators have been implicated in human pathologies.

This also includes the study of material substances, as in physics, chemistry, biology, botany which are under the general heading of physicalism. It is also defined as the study of material bodies or substances, as in the natural sciences, which are under the general heading of physicalism. [Soma is from the New Latin, somatologia, from the ancient Greek somatos + logia, -logy, the study of]. Ancient writers, including St. Paul (see ), said that individual human beings are a complex integration of three components (tripartite): body, mind and spirit — soma, psyche and pneuma. The term “somatology” comes from Greek roots meaning “body” and “study,” so somatology is the study of the body. This term is used in a number of different ways to describe a variety of activities related to studying the body. Several colleges and universities have departments of somatology which may cover various aspects of this field. The confused uses of this term can sometimes be disorienting, but the meaning of the term is usually clear from the context of a discussion. In one sense, somatology is the anatomical and physiological study of the entire body — attempting to learn how the different parts of the body work together. In this sense, somatology can also refer more generally to the properties associated with living organisms other than humans. The study of anatomy and physiology is important for medical practice, among other things, and is practiced in colleges and universities all over the world. People who work in this area of somatology study a variety of topics related to the body and how it functions. They may be interested in pathology, studying what happens when the body is injured or diseased, and they may also be interested in topics like biomechanics, studying the movement and articulation of the body. Training in this field can be applied to the practice of physical therapy, pathology, and many allied medical professions. Some people may refer to physical anthropology as “somatology.” In this sense, people are interested in studying the human body as it appears in different cultures, and as it has evolved over time. Somatology can be used to learn more about a specific individual after death, and also to learn more about collective cultures and the history of humans and their close relatives. Somatologists can study topics such as human osteology, human evolution, and primate morphology as part of their work, and they can be found in the field and in the lab. Some practitioners of alternative medicine may also refer to what they do as somatology. In this sense, the term is used to refer to the study and treatment of the body as a whole, with the application of techniques such as massage, herbal medicine, acupuncture, guided imagery, and so forth to patients. Some people in this branch of the field may focus on providing people with sources of relaxation, with some spas and massage studios referencing somatology in their promotional materials.

The field that the caravans have been moved to is owned by a farmer who orders the children off his property. Unfortunately, the Kirrins are unable to move their caravans without borrowing horses from the performers. Julian and Dick leave to speak to the performers but are unsuccessful in their attempt to borrow the horses. During this time, their old friend Jo (first introduced in Five Fall into Adventure) arrives and joins the Kirrin children. Jo aids Julian and Dick in convincing the fair performers to let them borrow their horses. While Jo and the children are enjoying a picnic on the hill, Dick spots a face in the window of the castle tower. Julian also confirms that he sees a face, and vows to investigate further. The other children try to see the face in the window but do not see it. The children are convinced that the face in the window must belong to one of the missing scientists, but when they search the grounds the next day during a tour of the castle, they find no evidence. The steps leading up to the tower have crumbled, making it impossible to access the rooms at the top. Julian learns from the ticket lady that two men from the Society for the Preservation of Old Buildings visited the grounds yesterday. He calls the Society to confirm, and the Society tells him that nobody has been there. The children decided to investigate the castle at nighttime and find that a chunk of the castle wall has been hollowed. The hollowed spot reveals an entrance to a secret passage in the wall that leads up to the tower itself. There the children find one of the missing scientists, Terry-Kane, being held captive. Quickly, they realize that the other scientist, Pottersham, is holding Terry- Kane captive. The children attempt a rescue which fails, and are captured themselves. The fair performers soon realize that the children are missing and attempt a rescue by climbing up the tower to the window where the children first saw the face. Pottersham is overpowered and is finally defeated by the help of Mr. Slither’s snake. Pottersham is taken to the police, where he gives a full confession.

Past experiences and present situations help to create hypothesis about the forthcoming future and attributes certain probabilities to them. According to probabilistic prognosis, the preparation of an individual occurs to corresponding actions. This ability is the result of biological evolution in a probabilistically organized environment. The prognosis of living creatures optimizes the results of their actions, and therefore they are adequate, exactly to those variable characteristics of environment on which the success of action – satisfaction of needs, achieving goals, depends on. Under some pathological conditions, such as schizophrenia, local damage of the brain, the probabilistic prognosis mechanism can be disturbed. The theory of probabilistic prognosis originated as a continuation of Nikolai Bernstein's ideas stated in his work \\"Essays of the Physiology of Movement and Physiology of Activity\\" (1966). A new direction of studies of probabilistic prognosis started with works of Professor J. Feigenberg (1969), Professor M. Tsiskaridze (1969), and Professor V. Ivannikov (1971), and later were widely explored by other scientists. Studies of probabilistic prognosis remain topical until now and have many followers.

He briefly led a brigade at the Battle of Antietam. Stainrook was killed in the Battle of Chancellorsville. Before Antietam Stainrook was a resident of Chester County, Pennsylvania at the outbreak of the war. Following President Abraham Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion, Stainrook enlisted on April 23, 1861 in the Union Army as the captain of Company C of the 22nd Pennsylvania Infantry, a three-month regiment. He was honorably mustered out following the expiration of his term of enlistment.Hunt, p. 156. Subsequently, Stainrook was involved in organizing the 109th Pennsylvania Infantry and was commissioned its colonel with a nominal date of November 1, 1861. The regiment encamped in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, near the State House before going to Virginia. His unit eventually became a part of the Army of Virginia under Maj. Gen. John Pope. Stainrook was wounded in the abdomen by a shell fragment at the Battle of Cedar Mountain during the Northern Virginia Campaign. The 109th Pennsylvania served in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Henry Prince in the 2nd Division, II Corps at the Battle of Cedar Mountain on August 9, 1862. Brig. Gen. Christopher C. Augur led the division, and Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks led the corps. In their first battle, the 109th advanced under Confederate fire. Stainrook was wounded by Confederate artillery, but he refused to leave the field.Pennsylvania at Gettysburg, vol. 1, p. 565. Eventually the colonel had to order at retreat, because the regiment was being outflanked. The corps missed the Second Battle of Bull Run because it was guarding the army's rear areas. The 109th helped cover the army's retreat, destroying supplies that could not be moved.Pennsylvania at Gettysburg, p. 566. Antietam After the removal of John Pope, his army was dissolved; and its units joined the Army of the Potomac. The old II Corps became XII Corps. Maj. Gen.Joseph K. Mansfield now led the corps, and Brig. Gen. George S. Greene led the 2nd division at the Battle of Antietam. After the I Corps had been exhausted in combat, the XII Corps went into the fray. One brigade (Goodrich) was detached from Greene's Division to join the Iron Brigade in the vicinity of the Miller Cornfield. The other brigades, under Lt. Col. Hector Tyndale and Stainrook, were committed to an attack on the high ground around the Dunker Church (Stainrook was without his own regiment, which was on detached duty.) Stainrook's brigade, after some confusion in deploying, passed through the East Woods, driving away the remains of the division of Brig. Gen. John Bell Hood.Sears, Landscape Turned Redp. 211; Carman pp. 242, 244. Then it advanced with the Mumma farm buildings, already set afire by retreating Confederates on its left. The brigade moved along the axis of the Smoketown Road and reached the high ground at the Dunker Church. Greene's advance stopped there. Once Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick's division of the II Corps had been driven from the West Woods, Greene was forced to retreat. His two brigades rallied behind the ridge line of the Mumma farm. They reformed but did not advance again.Murfin, pp. 232, 235, 238. After the battle, General Greene commended Steinrook for his conduct in the battle.Antietam on the Web After Antietam The XII Corps was not involved in the campaign leading to the Battle of Fredericksburg. It did participate in the Mud March. In between, Stainrook was back in brigade command from December 22, 1862, to January 3, 1863. When Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker undertook the Chancellorsville Campaign in the spring of 1863, Stainrook's regiment was in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Thomas L. Kane in the 2nd Division of the XII Corps under Brig. Gen. John W. Geary. Geary's Division was heavily engaged at Chancellorsville. Stainrook commanded the brigade's skirmish line on May 1 near Hazel Grove, facing southward. On May 2, the XII Corps had to redeploy because of the flank attack launched by Stonewall Jackson on the XI Corps. By the end of the day, the division of Brig. Gen. Alpheus Williams was facing west, while Geary's Division faced south, both deployed the east of Hazel Grove. On May 3 and 4 XII Corps was positioned near the Chancellorsville House, receiving heavy fire from Confederate troops.

The village has a population of about 200. It is home to the municipal kindergarten, an elementary school, a shop, and many thriving clubs and organizations. Dølemo is often called \\"the voluntary village\\", the reason for this being the citizens' dedication when the annual Dølemo Market has to be arranged in the last week of August. The village sits at the intersection of the Norwegian National Road 41 and the Norwegian County Road 413. The village of Eppeland lies about to the northeast, the village of Vehus lies about to the south, and the village of Ytre Ramse lies about to the northwest.  History  Dølemo was founded as a village around 1880. The first houses to be built in Dølemo were old farmhouses which were moved over from Eppeland. At the time, Dølemo had a café, a shoemaker, and a post office. Many of the inhabitants used to work in the surrounding forests for landowners from around Dølemo. Dølemo was a place for people to hold markets and horse races. This tradition becomes apparent in local place names around Dølemo, as well as on two old boundary stones that remind of the times.  Culture  Dølemo is mostly known for the Dølemo Market which was first held in 1980. Every year Dølemo Market attracts about 15,000 visitors to a traditional fair that focuses on commerce and entertainment. Dølemo has also a heavily involved sports club, Dølemo IL, with sections for skiing, cycling, skating, and physical training groups for children and adults. The Dølemo Village Club is responsible for public buildings and outdoor areas and the Shooting Club has meetings for children and adults both in summer and winter time. The youth club gathers every other Friday night and is popular with the local youth.  Tourism  Dølemo is situated along the Tovdalselva river, which provides great opportunities for swimming and fishing. The Kallingsheia heath provides opportunities for recreation and for visiting genuine wilderness. Dølemo IL has constructed a shelter that can be used by all visitors to the heath.

Motto \\"Knowledge Dispels Fear\\" History Patrick Hall shows an interior view of paratroopers undergoing training in a hangar at the Parachute Training School at RAF Ringway. Between June 1940 and early 1946, No.1 PTS provided initial training to all 60,000 allied paratroopers who volunteered or were recruited for that role in Europe. In addition to British troops, men from many nationalities trained to jump at RAF Ringway and nearby Tatton Park including Americans, Belgians, Canadians, Czechs, Dutch, French, Norwegian and Poles. Agents of the Special Operations Executive, both men and women were also given parachute training by No.1 PTS to enable those who were to be dropped into occupied territory to do so safely. To maintain secrecy, these men and women were accommodated in separate secure premises in Bowdon and Styal and were trained in select groups. No.1 PTS moved from Ringway to RAF Upper Heyford on 28 March 1946and has been based at RAF Brize Norton since moving from RAF Abingdon, where it was based from 1950 to April 1976. Throughout its time in Oxfordshire, No.1 PTS has used the airfield at RAF Weston-on-the-Green, adjacent to the M40 motorway, as its drop zone.

There is currently a criminal investigation underway, and two employees of Patria have been arrested on charges of bribery. The CEO stepped down from his position as a result of the affair and is being investigated by the Finnish police on charges of bribery. In early September 2008, just three weeks before the Slovenian parliamentary elections on 21 September 2008, the Finnish broadcasting company YLE published an investigation implicating the corruption of the Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša. Janša, who ignored and attacked also the other report about him published in 2013 by the official Commission for the Prevention of Corruption of the Republic of Slovenia, rejected all accusations and called for the journalists to advance some proof for their claims or to withdraw the accusations. On 11 September 2011, the Slovenian national broadcaster RTV Slovenia published a document disproving the claim about Janez Janša being implicated in the corruption and implicating Bartol Jerković, the director of the Croatian heavy industrial company Đuro Đaković Specijalna vozila.  Background  The Patria case has a European and NATO horizon, and it cannot be understood outside this horizon. First, the rush to modernize the infantry armored vehicles for most Western armies since 2002. Second, the consolidation of the European armored vehicles suppliers through General Dynamics acquisitions. Third, the commercial war between General Dynamics and Patria in this field. Last, the peculiar status of arms deals that implies state secret protection on arms trade and on their collateral agreements. However, the abuse of secrecy to conceal unlawful practices such as fake offset agreement, (equivalent to bribery) is not a Slovenian issue, but a real European problem. The Patria case is a chance to look at what happens in the most politically sensitive and covered areas of Western democracies: arms and state security. Modernization of infantry vehicles President George W. Bush welcoming 7 new states into NATO, March 29, 2004. From left are: Prime Minister Indulis Emsis of Latvia, Prime Minister Anton Rop of Slovenia, Prime Minister Algirdas Brazauskas of Lithuania, Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda of Slovakia, President George Bush, Prime Minister Adrian Năstase of Romania, Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg Gotha of Bulgaria, Prime Minister Juhan Parts of Estonia, and NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. The historic decision of the U.S. Administration to move the conflict against terrorisms outside United States at the end of 2001 led to the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. It is a radical change: U.S. had not deployed large infantry on hostile grounds since 1983.1983 Beirut barracks bombing The decision had implications for U.S. allies. Ground troops need modern types of equipment to fight new infantry wars. Modern armored vehicles become a priority: more protected, faster, easily deployable, interconnected with the new digital wars. New vehicles must be capable to inter-operate at several communication levels. Air superiority was no longer the decisive issue. The capability to control the ground became paramount. The human cost of the new occupation wars is mainly due to infantry lack of adequate protection. More than half of the deaths of U.S. and allies is caused by inadequate armoured protection.Mike Turner, former CEO of BAE: ¨Turner also lamented that Europe had failed to come together on armoured vehicles the way it did with the Eurofighter, so weakening the British armour industry. Current low-intensity wars have seen heavy purchasing of armoured and protected vehicles intended to safeguard Western troops from ambushes and mines, but little of that business has come to Britain.\\"That would have been a great opportunity, but we didn't achieve it\\" said Turner. Arbuthnot suggested that perhaps only Turner could have achieved it - alluding to the fact that BAE might have chosen to buy up European armoured-vehicle firms rather than ones in America as it actually did. BAE's US acquisitions have made a lot of money selling armour to the Pentagon, but the British tank industry is effectively moribund and that of Europe fragmented.¨ Nov 19, 2008 . The issue of armoured vehicles is pressing and the first concern for ground troops: ¨Seven American service members were killed by two roadside bombs in southern Afghanistan on Monday, according to the NATO-led I.S.A.F. ... An American armored vehicle was completely destroyed¨ - New York Times, Aug 31, 2010. Industry consolidation: Light Armored Vehicles Pandur II is produced by Steyr-Daimler-Puch Spezialfahrzeuge, part of General Dynamics European Land Combat Systems, which is also the parent company of MOWAG of Switzerland and Santa Bárbara Sistemas of Spain. General Dynamics is the U.S leader in infantry vehicles which between 2002 and 2003 purchased MOWAG in Switzerland, Steyer-Daimler-Puch Speazialfahrung in Austria, and Santa Bárbara Sistemas in Spain. In 2004, they launched a hostile takeover of Alvis plc.¨In 2004, the board of Alvis approved a £309m takeover bid by General Dynamics. Within three months BAE Systems, which already had a 29% stake in the company, outbid General Dynamics by offering £355m. The action was seen as a defense of the home market from a foreign rival. After completing the acquisition Alvis was renamed BAE Systems Land and Armaments. European war between General Dynamics and Patria Major European nations such as France, the UK, Germany, Italy initiated own domestic programs replacing old generation APCs with modern Armored Vehicles. Smaller nations on the other hand initiated process of international tender and procurement for new advanced armored personal carriers. Portugal, initiated the procurement process right away.¨.Preparation of the tender started in 2002, while the ¨evaluation of the contenders for this procurement program started in autumn 2003¨ Patria and General Dynamics engaged in a competition to win over new defence contracts, notably Belgium, Portugal, where Patria was overpowered by General Dynamics persuasive influence. Patria was astonished when it was excluded from the final round in Portugal and Belgium. Patria is a small national company that produces one of the most competitive Armored Vehicles on the market. Patria's turnover in 2005 was about 300 million Euros and in 2009 reached 500 million Euro. The commercial between Patria and General Dynamics would be akin to fight between David vs. Goliath, as the later is 40 times the size of Finnish Patria. In 2003 Patria and General Dynamics are competitors for the new Portuguese armoured vehicles. General Dynamics won the contract with the Pandur, in competition with itself, that is General Dynamics Piranha; Patria, the third competitor, was disqualified on technical reasons at the end of 2004. Patria naively appealed against the decision, and Lisbon court dismissed Patria appeal in less than 40 days (by February 2005), so Portugal could pay 365 million Euro in exchange for 260 Pandurs and 516 million (150% of the contract value) of General Dynamics offset.Portuguese Pandur General Dynamics - MOWAG Piranha Then in the Belgian tender in 2006 the finalists are: GD-Steyr Pandur, GD-MOWAG Piranha, Iveco Centauro, and Patria AMV. Patria lost, and General Dynamics won: about 700 million Euro for 242 General Dynamics Piranha and 700 million of GD offset, accurately divided between Flanders and Walloonia (delivery between 2007-2012). Then Czech Republic. Defense Daily writes in Dec 2005: \\"As fate would have it, Steyr’s Pandur II (General Dynamics) and Patria’s AMV were the final two contenders for the Czech Republic’s $1 billion wheeled APC contract.\\" Patria won, then the contract goes back to General Dynamics, Pandur.Czechs Choose, Cancel, Then Come Back to Pandur II APCs, 23-Feb-2010 Similar stories for Romania, Ireland, Denmark, Lithuania, Sweden, Spain etc. But General Dynamics has its most conspicuous sales outside of Europe: about $6 billion of Light Armored Vehicles to Saudi Arabia National Guard, via Foreign Military Sales. Patria had some victories against the U.S. giant: Croatia, Slovenia, Poland, Estonia. And most notably, United Arab Emirates. In 2009 Sweden canceled a contract award to Patria of $338 million for 113 Patria AMV, but restarted the contract in 2010. Purchase of Patria AMV In December 2006 Slovenia purchased 135 Patria AMV infantry fighting vehicles.Slovenia signs 278 mln eur deal with Finnish defence firm Patria, Forbes,19/12/2006 It is the largest defense acquisition in Slovenian history of military procurement. Participants to the bid included Patria with Patria AMV and a Slovenian subsidiary of General Dynamics, Sistemska Tehnika with Valuk. The government chose the former.  Alleged scheme  On 1 September 2008, the YLE's investigative program MOT stated that Patria paid 21 million euros in bribes for deals for Patria AMV IFVs for the Slovenian military. The money was said to be channelled to officials in the country's Ministry of Defence, as well as the Prime Minister Janez Janša.YLE Claims Stir Political Storm In Slovenia, YLESlovenia Delivers Note to Finland Over TV Programme AccusationsMot: The Truth about Patria The program covered the ongoing criminal investigation of bribery and gross bribery by Patria officers in Egypt, Slovenia and Croatia. The accusations were said to be based on undisclosed documents which mention the initial letter J., interpreted to mean the premier Janez Janša. According to MOT, the documents were verified from multiple reliable sources. These documents were said to be published when the police investigation is completed and the case is presented to the district court. The police estimates that the investigation should be completed by the end of 2008. Furthermore, former president of the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption of the Republic of Slovenia, described the bribery as \\"very hard to deny\\" in the MOT program and stated people from the government were implicated. Later he said he was only making logical conclusions and has no proof for his claims. According to MOT, 21 million euros, out of the 278 million total in the deal, was paid in bribes. The transfer was concealed by delivering fewer vehicles and less expensive armaments and extensions than officially announced. Money was channeled to a company held by Patria's Austrian agent, Wolfgang Riedl. Riedl would then forward the money to agents, each distributing the bribes to different groups. Businessman Walter Wolf would interact with Slovenian politicians and painter Jure Cekuta with officials at the Slovenian Ministry of Defence. Riedl transferred 2.8 million to businessman Walter Wolf, but Wolf's attempt to forward the money was stopped by his bank, which informed the Austrian money laundering unit.  Response from Janša and the Slovenian government  Janša rejected all accusations, and called for the journalists to advance some proof for their claims or to withdraw the accusations. In the case they would do neither, insisting on the accusations without showing the proof, he announced to bring legal action against the journalists. The following day, the Slovenian Government decided to sue the journalists and the broadcasting company for false accusation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs left two diplomatic notes to the Finnish Government, calling the country enable the disclosure of the documents relative to the investigation in order to bring light in the issue. On September 6 Slovenian Government communication office asked YLE director Mikael Jungner to air a \\"second part\\" of the broadcast, including the viewpoints from other people involved and effectively negating the claims made in the program. This request was declined. In a parliamentary hearing on 9 September 2008, Janša urged the members of parliament to forget the issue for now and bring it back to discussion once some proof has been advanced. There is a clause in the deal that allows its cancellation in the case of corruption. On 5 August 2008, Patria provided the Slovenian government with an account of the criminal investigation, where Patria declared in writing that no unlawfulness has occurred in the Slovenian deal. The Slovenian government accepted the declaration and decided not to cancel the deal. In January 2010 Janez Janša sued Magnus Berglund for 1.5 million euro for defamation in a Slovenian civil court (Novo Mesto) and Ljubljana prosecutors requested 6 months of imprisonment for Berglund.¨The Novo Mesto district court declared itself competent to hear the civil suit although it concerns a programme made by a Finnish TV station that was broadcast in Finland. As regards the criminal case, a justice ministry investigation into its legal basis concluded that case was taken over from the first attorney general in charge Katarina Bergant, who wished to drop the case against Berglund. The head of the Ljubljana District Prosecutors Office Tamara Gregorcic personally take the prosecution against Berglund and push the case forward.¨  Finnish government position  So far, the Finnish government has kept a neutral stance. The state of Finland owns a majority share in Patria. The minister responsible for administration of Patria stock, Jan Vapaavuori, said that the Finnish government does not intend to issue any statements, particularly during the election period, as that would intervene in the internal affairs of Slovenia.YLE Tv-uutiset ja sää, TV1, tiistai klo 20.30 2.9.2008. http://areena.yle.fi/toista?id=1467710 The first diplomatic note was answered by Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexander Stubb, who stated that the government will not intervene against the journalists, in respect of the freedom of the press. Furthermore, Yle is a non-departmental body directly responsible to a parliamentary committee, not the Finnish Council of State. The second note was answered on similarly neutral terms: the Finnish Council of State will not and cannot interfere in an ongoing police investigation. Police investigation and Trial Finland The Finnish police agency investigating the case is National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), and the case was heard at Helsinki district court. Two employees of Patria have been arrested for questioning, of which one has been officially imprisoned by the Helsinki district court and one has been released. The CEO, Jorma Wiitakorpi, is still considered a suspect, charged with bribery and industrial espionage,\\"The Helsinki district court on Friday ordered the release of Jorma Wiitakorpi, a former chief executive of state-owned arms maker Patria, after more than a fortnight in custody. Mr Wiitakorpi is suspected of industrial espionage, aggravated corruption and corrupt business practices in conjunction with an armoured personnel carrier deal in Slovenia.\\" Patria ex-CEO Wiitakorpi released, Helsinki Times, 28/11/2008 although Patria's own investigations found no evidence. Furthermore, Helsinki district court imprisoned an Austrian and a Slovenian businessman in absentia, and their hearings were prepared in co- operation with Austrian and Slovenian officials. However, the appeals court returned a verdict of innocence, and the prosecutor decided not to appeal it to the Supreme Court, citing lack of evidence.http://yle.fi/uutiset/patrian_vapauttava_tuomio_slovenia- jutussa_jaa_voimaan/8227295 The Finnish NBI criticized the actions of their Slovenian counterparts. According to NBI, the Slovenian police has not provided the information requested for the investigation. On the other hand, when NBI sent a classified list of individuals that the Slovenian police should interview, no interviews were arranged, but the secret list was leaked to the public. According to the officer in charge of the investigation, despite Slovenian police being able and willing to co-operate, the difficulties in the co-operation between the officials are already hindering the investigation. Two Patria executives were found guilty of bribing Croatian officials between 2005 and 2008 by the Kanta-Häme District Court. The executives were given conditional sentences and the company was fined 300,000 euros.Patria executives found guilty of bribing Croatian officials Yle, 2015 However, the case was appealed and the appeals court is due to process it in 2015. Austria The Austrian police suspected money laundering and other offenses, when Wolf's bank warned them about the suspicious transactions and blocked his account. The Austrian Interpol notified the Slovenian police about this but the Slovenian police ignored the notification. It replied only after more than a year, when the news about this was published in the Slovenian daily Dnevnik. Slovenia The Slovenian police investigation has been practically stalled, according to MOT. The Slovenian police rejected the accusations of having leaked the secret list. It also started the internal investigation of why the Interpol notification has not been answered to. The Slovenia Times wrote on the U.S. Embassy cables: Slovenian prosecutors filed charges for corruption against Janez Janša on Aug 6, 2010, though Janša affirmed that he did not receive any notification. Janša denied having \\"requested or received any rewards or payments related to the Patria deal\\" in a statement on Aug 27, 2010.

Finland takes it seriously and, in the Patria case, taught a lesson of democracy, of rule of law, and of business ethics to the world. Whether MOT's charges of bribery are true or not, Finland protected the freedom of speech better than United States, and against its own national interest. MOT report is of enormous value for the European Union and its attempt to put some democratic transparency in the European Defense procurement.The Code of Conduct on Offsets, 2008.. See also EDA Offset Portal for the Member States information on their offset rules Arms trade enjoys a particular status in EU, due to its essential connection with national state security, as per Art. 346 of the Lisbon Treaty: Art. 346, while granting member states the right to classify national information on the subject, i.e., to apply the State secret to arms production and trade of member states, explicitly prohibits the use of civilian (indirect) offset as form of distortion of free competition in the common market of the European Union. Some Aerospace and Defense companies abuse of indirect offsets is equivalent to straight bribery, if not worse. This is a level more sophisticated but not different from a bribe, and it is also the level of the commercial war between Patria and General Dynamics, in which Slovenia is just one of the European battles. There are three reasonable hypotheses on the truth or falsity of the MOT program: 1\\\\. Finland and Slovenia are corrupt countries. The rest of European countries are not. Magnus Berglund discovered the corruption, and MOT program is truthful and accurate. It looks that Slovenia is a corruptible country, while countries like Portugal or Belgium (with over one billion euro purchase) are not. Slovenian politicians accept bribes, while the rest of the military sales involving Armoured Wheeled Infantry Vehicles is bribe-free. Furthermore, Finnish companies like Patria are ethnically inclined to corrupt foreign states ¨to obtain and retain business¨,Foreign Corrupt Practices Act while German Siemens,The largest settlement for corrupt practices is by Siemens AG, that in 2008 paid about $1.6 Billion in fines to U.S. and to Germany. see ¨KEEPING FOREIGN CORRUPTION OUT OF THE UNITED STATES: FOUR CASE HISTORIES¨, United States Senate, PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Feb 4,2010 and U.S. General Dynamics¨We do not engage in bribery or kickbacks. A bribe or kickback is the giving or accepting of money, fees, commissions, credits, gifts, favors, or anything of value that is either directly or indirectly provided in return for favorable treatment. You must never offer, give, ask for, or receive any form of bribe or kickback. Favorable treatment often can appear innocent, such as paying an invoice earlier than we normally would. However, favorable treatment is illegal when offered in exchange for a gift.¨ General Dynamics, Standards of Business ethics and conduct, aka, The Blue Book, by Jay L. Johnson, GD CEO, Aug 2009. Earlier version by Nicholas Chabraj, former CEO, in Steyr site: have better policies against active and passive corruption. 2\\\\. Magnus Berglund's MOT Program is populist propaganda to increase audience. No valuable truth content. In fact Slovenian police did not even open an investigation on the corruption charges against its Prime Minister and military. Wiitakorpi is a scapegoat, not very smart, but he is completely innocent. No bribes. A variation on this hypothesis is that Wiitakorpi and friends pocketed themselves the alleged bribe, and used the bribe allegation to enrich themselves.On this see the important distinction between passive and active corruption in the European conventions and OECD Anti-Bribery Convention Another variation on this hypothesis of falsity of MOT allegations is the some journalists have been paid or tricked by some Patria competitors, in order to create a false report.This would not be impossible. See, for instance, a false report like the Niger uranium forgeries. There is also a partisan version on the possible falsity of Berglund's report, understood as conspiracy within Slovenian politics: ¨The ruling coalition insists that the entire Patria case is a conspiracy conceived by the Slovenian opposition and the “Truth about Patria” program’s producers. The opposition refutes these allegations¨. In all these cases there is no bribe, Slovenian politicians and public officials are clean and innocent. 3\\\\. The third reasonable hypothesis is that corruption of state and military officials in arms trade is a European plague. It is not a question about business ethics of Finnish businessmen and political integrity of Slovenian politicians and military (that allegedly shared 21 million Eur, 7,5% of the contract price paid by Slovenian taxpayers). MOT program is a burst of sunlight, in spite of some small errors or minor slips into sensationalism. Actually, the program is sensational, and if it was not, why did Slovenian Embassy in Finland request to stop the broadcast? Follow the money The best angle may be seen by following the money involved in arms trade. Authorities have to complete investigations, but the free press of the Continent has the professional duty and the constitutional right to research on one of the less transparent and most protected items in national budgets. Lack of investigative reporting in the media is a dangerous democracy deficit. In democracy, security issues should not be used to conceal accountability. Defense procurement budgets are but taxpayers money.¨In a recommendation for NATO's new 10-year strategic vision, experts led by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said only six of NATO's 26 European members were meeting their defense spending target of two percent of GDP¨ May 17, 2010 . Slovenia plans to cut and renegotiate the deal with Patria. Corruption in security is one of the most corrosive forms of corrupt practices in democracies, since it is not only about money. It is about citizens trust in the lowest rank policeman up to a President of a country.«A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction...This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence — economic, political, even spiritual — is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together.» President Eisenhower's farewell address, January 17, 1961 European Offset Distribution: Direct, Indirect military, Indirect civilian The actual situation regarding offset agreements in EU is described in details in a study on defense offsets in the Union countries commissioned by the European Defense Agency and published in 2007. According to this studyFinal Report of 06-DIM-022 Study on the effects of offsets on the Development of a European Defence Industry and Market By E. Anders Eriksson with contributions by Mattias Axelson, Keith Hartley, Mike Mason, Ann-Sofie Stenérus and Martin Trybus, 12 July 2007. The study was financed by the European Defense Agency and contracted to FOI and SCS. the volume of EU offset agreements in 2006 was above 4-5 billion euro. The distribution of these offsets is as shown in the diagram: Direct Offsets, Military Indirect Offsets, Civilian Indirect Offsets. One could say that nothing would have emerged, if only Wiitakorpi would have humbly asked the experienced American giant for an advise on how to use indirect offsets. He could have solved the problem of bribes (if any bribe was due) by establishing an offset fulfillers in Liechtenstein, or in one of the convenient branches of LGT. No need to transfer the money through Austria to Liechtenstein. While Austria treasures bank privacy, it abides to money laundry international laws.See also U.S. Senate Report on LGT, July 17, 2008. Liechtenstein tax affair In Austria the alleged Patria case scheme was exposed, perhaps because of a zealous bank clerk (or perhaps because Slovenia did not buy the Austrian Pandur). In any case, the fault is to blame on the naïve Jorma Wiitakorpi, leader of an excellent but dwarfish defense company. To be sure, a wire transfer to Feldkirch (Austria) as compensation for a defense contract is called bribe, while the same wire transfer to Schaanwald (Liechtenstein) as compensation for the same contract is called indirect offset. No much difference, geographical speaking, only 4 km in the Alps, but a great difference in international defense contractors sophistication. LGT Luxembourg branch can transform that money (being it a bribe or a fake indirect offset certificate) in whatever one likes in the Schengen area. Substantially but also legally speaking it is still corruption, but hard to understand even for investigative journalists.It requires knowledge of the complexity of international arms trade and of the byzantine offset mechanisms. See Offset agreement MOT opened up a valuable breach in an obscured area and, if it is right, it reveals a standard of requested bribe percentage to sell weapons in Europe.¨According to estimates by the European Defence Agency, 25 percent of the offsets in Europe are non-military and have no direct connection with the purchase. \\"These contracts totally violate the EU's internal market competition rules,\\" Portuguese Socialist MEP Ana Gomes told EUobserver. \\"They are contracts negotiated among companies with government favouring and in total disregard of the competition rules. There are plenty of reasons why the European Commission should investigate, and make it an exemplary case to deter such behaviour from now on from any member state.\\" So far, the commission has turned a blind eye to the non-military contracts occurring alongside large defence procurements.¨ EU Observer, July 27, 2010  See also  * Patria (company) * Patria AMV * Portuguese Pandur * General Dynamics * MOWAG Piranha * mechanized infantry * Offset agreement * Convention against Corruption (disambiguation) * Foreign Corrupt Practices Act * Politically exposed person * Janez Janša * Walter Wolf * Lockheed bribery scandals * Airbus affair * Agusta scandal * Cunningham scandal * YLE * Group of States Against Corruption * Political corruption * Transparency International * OECD Anti-Bribery Convention  References  External links * MOT: The Truth about Patria * The Janša-Patria Case..., by J.

Its supposed site in Carnoustie, Angus can be seen in early Ordnance Survey maps. The history of the event relies heavily on tradition and it is currently considered to be apocryphal. The battle was named for the Parish of Barry, rather than the village, and was formerly thought to have taken place at the mouth of the Lochty burn, in the vicinity of the area that is now occupied by Carnoustie High Street. While the battle is not historically authentic, its romantic appeal continues to capture the popular imagination.Some popular histories of the area erroneously treat the battle as fact. See, for example: Account of battle The Camus CrossThe account of the battle was first recorded by sixteenth century Scots historian, Hector Boece. Boece informs us that Sueno, king of Denmark and England, unhappy with news of his army's defeat at Mortlach, ordered a naval task force to set sail for Scotland. Part of the force was to sail from Denmark, and the rest from the Thames, both under the command of Camus. According to the legendary account, the army camped at St Abb's Head for several days before sailing north, landing at Lunan Bay in Angus. After sacking Montrose, the Army headed inland and razed the town of Brechin to the ground. Camus received word that King Malcolm II had brought the Scots army to Dundee and ordered the Danish army to march South, reaching the coast near to Panbride. The Scots army set camp at Barry, two miles to the West. The two sides met and fought in the vicinity of the Lochty Burn, near where Carnoustie town centre now lies. The fighting is said to have been so fierce that the Lochty burn ran red with the blood of the fallen. Seeing that the battle was lost, Camus fled to the hills, pursued by Robert de Keith (purported ancestor of the Marischals of Scotland), who caught up with and slew him at Brae Downie where, it is said, the Camus Cross (NO 519379) was erected in memory of him. Afterwards King Malcolm is said to have dipped his fingers in Camus' blood and to have run them along the top of Robert's shield, thus creating the red and gold striped design still used today in the Keith coat of arms. Evidence of battle Written record The first record of the battle can be found in Hector Boece's Historia Gentis Scotorum, written in 1527. Boece's work was popularised following a fairly free translation by John Bellenden into Scots in 1536, and its subsequent translation into English by Raphael Holinshed ca. 1580. No record of the battle is found before Boece. Dickson reports three long cist burials disinterred in 1878. The burials were aligned with feet pointing to the east, signifying Christian burial and, despite Gordon's (1726) assertions about size, gives a femur size of 18\\" (46 cm), suggesting a height of 5'6\\" (1.67 m) for the largest skeleton. Dickson also refers to 30 cists unearthed in 1810 during the construction of what is now the Erskine United Free Church. He also points out the lack of weapons, casting doubt on Boece's account of the Battle of Barry. While George Buchanan (ca. 1579) also mentions the battle in his work Rerum Scotarum Historia, his account borrows liberally from Boece. Boece is thought to have based much of his work on John of Fordun's, Chronica Gentis Scotorum (ca. 1360). Fordun briefly mentions a battle at Mortlach but makes no mention of any at Barry: > Malcolm, thinking over the manifold blessings continually bestowed upon him > by God, pondered anxiously in his mind what he should give Him in return. At > length, the grace of the Holy Ghost working within him, he set his heart > upon increasing the worship of God ; so he established a new episcopal see > at Marthillach (Mortlach), not far from the spot where he had overcome the > Norwegians, and gained the victory; and endowed it with churches, and the > rents of many estates. It is possible that Fordun's account of the Battle of Mortlach is due to a distortion of local tradition. Mortlach is nearby the site of the battle in which Máel Coluim mac Donnchada (Malcolm III) wrested power from Lulach. Máel Coluim's first wife, Ingibiorg Finnsdottir, was the niece of Harald III of Norway, and it has been argued by Alex Woolf that the tradition of a battle between the Scots and Norwegians is due to a Scandinavian involvement on the side of Máel Coluim. It is thought that, as a native of the area in which the Battle of Barry is supposed to have occurred, Boece may have used local folklore as his source. Boece is no longer regarded as a credible historical source. In some versions of the story, Camus and his army camped prior to the battle at a location previously known as 'Norway Dykes', near Kirkbuddo, to the north of Carnoustie, and the battle took place the day after the feast day of St Brigid. For example, Gordon quotes Robert Maule from his 'De Antiquitate Gentis Scotorum' (1609): > About eight miles from Brechin, at Karboddo [Kirkbuddo], a place belongs to > the Earl of Crawford, are to be seen the vestiges of a Danish camp, > fortified with a rampart and ditch, and vulgarly called Norway Dikes; near > which is the village of Panbridge [Panbride], where anciently was a church > dedicated to St Brigide, because on that saint's day which preceded the > battle, Camus, general of the Danes, pitched his camp there. This places the battle on 2 February, St Brigid's day being 1 February. Archaeological evidence The story of the battle appears to have originated due to a romantic misinterpretation of the numerous tumuli that existed towards the eastern boundary of Barry Parish, near the Lochty burn before the town of Carnoustie was founded in the late 18th century. Raphael Holinshed (ca. 1580) claimed that the bodies found in the area were those of Danish soldiers, slain in the battle: > King Malcolme after he obteined this famous victorie (as before is said) at > Barre, he caused the spoile of the field to be divided amongest his > souldiers, according to the laws of armes; and then caused the dead bodies > of the Danes to be buried in the place where the field had baene fought, and > the bodies of the Scottishmen which were found dead were conveied unto the > places of christian buriall, and there buried with funerall obsequies in > sundrie churches and churchyards. There are seene manie bones of the Danes > in those places where they were buried, there lieng bare above ground even > unto this day, the sands (as it often chanceth) being blowen from them. Doubt was cast on this by Robert Dickson in 1878, when he pointed out that, while relatively high-status goods were found in some of the graves disinterred during early building work in Carnoustie, there was a lack of weapons. He also talked of the apparent presence of female skeletons. Subsequent finds pointed to the area being a domestic Pictish Long-Cist cemetery, including the remains of a female aged between 40 and 50 with osteoarthritis, who apparently died of tuberculosis. In contrast with Holinshed's account, the burials there are Christian, found in a supine, east–west orientation. The Danish involvement in the 'battle' centres entirely on an apparently common misinterpretation of Pictish archaeology. For example, Boece interprets the battle scene on the Kirkyard Stone at Aberlemno as being an account of another battle between the Scots and Danes, in the aftermath of the Battle of Barry: > Ane othir cumpany of Danis, fleand in the samin maner, war slane at > Abirlennon, not IV milis fra Brechin: quhare ane gret stane is ingravin with > crafty letteris, to advertis the passingeris of the anciant and illuster > dedis done be our eldaris aganis the Danis. This view was the norm for some time after Boece and is reflected in the Statistical Accounts for Aberlemno. It took until the mid-19th century for it to be pointed out that not only was there no evidence that the stones were Scandinavian in origin, there was also ample evidence that the stones were Pictish/Scottish in origin. The kirkyard stone predates the Battle of Barry by three centuries and the most widely accepted interpretation is that the stone commemorates the Pictish victory at the historical Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 AD. The archaeological remains at Kirkbuddo, previously attributed to a Danish camp are now known to have been a temporary Roman marching camp. Camus No written evidence of Camus exists outside of the body of work which followed Boece. The story of Camus is likely to have been a misunderstanding of the name 'Camuston', or as it is in Boece's account (as translated by Bellenden), Camustane: > Quhil at last, the Danis war vincust, and Camus chasit to the montanis. The > Scottis followit on him with sic fury, that he was finaly slane. In signe > heirof, the place, quhare he was slane, is callit yit, Camustane. Camuston no longer exists as a village, but for location see for example the 1794 map by Ainslie.Ainslie, J. (1794) Map of the county of Forfar or Shire of Angus, www.nls.uk; retrieved 2 September 2008 The Camuston Cross, once thought to mark the place of Camus' death, is now thought to be a late Pictish era monument, dating from the 10th Century.Walker, B. and Ritchie, G. (1996) Exploring Scotland's Heritage: Fife, Perthshire and Angus. 2nd Edition. HMSO, Edinburgh. 'Camus' is not recognisable as a Scandinavian name, and that there are earlier variants of the place name, e.g. 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425–6, which has a Celtic etymology. A burial disinterred near the Camuston cross was attributed by Maule as being the body of Camus: > Nine years after I wrote that treatise, a plough turning up the ground > discovered a sepulchre, believed to be that of Camus, enclosed with four > great stones. Here a huge skeleton was dug up, supposed to have been the > body of Camus; it appeared to have received its death by a wound on the back > part of the head, seeing a considerable part of the skull was cut away, and > probably by the stroke of a sword Quoted in: Little information of the burial exists, but goods found in the cist were kept at Brechin Castle. These were sketched by Jervise and are typical of Bronze Age artefacts, found fairly commonly in the area.

The park encompasses a huge area of 67.9ha (as of 2004) and is famous for Japanese Red Pine forest and cherry blossoms. In particular, the park ranks in the Top 100 Locations in Japan for Cherry Blossoms. The Ōmiya Baseball Stadium was the first stadium to hold NPB's postseason game other than original homegrounds. History Ōmiya Park In 1885, the park opened its door to the public as a prefectural public park. In 1921, a large- scale expansion project was undertaken including the planting of cherry trees and the construction of Ōmiya Park Baseball Stadium. In 1962, the park is designated to be a part of urban planning. In 1980, Ōmiya Second Park opened to the east of Ōmiya Park. In 2001, Ōmiya Third Park was established beyond the southern perimeter of Ōmiya Second Park. Ōmiya Second Park Ōmiya Second Park refers to a section that occupies the western side of Prefectural Road 35. It was established in 1980 with 650 Japanese apricot trees interspersed within the grounds of the park. In 1996, the Fragrance Road accessible to wheelchairs was constructed. Visitors can enjoy displays of flowers and fragrances of trees that change with season year around. Each year between mid-February to March, the Japanese Apricot Festival is held. Ōmiya Third Park Ōmiya Third Park is the name of an area that is located to the south of Ōmiya Second Park. It became accessible to the public in 2001. The initial plan was to relocate Ōmiya Park Baseball Stadium or Ōmiya Park Soccer Stadium to this site. Later, the plan was altered to incorporate the pristine scenery of Minuma and create an open space that accommodates both people and nature. The park highlights the images of greenery, water, and light.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia has two divisions, the Civil Division and the Criminal Division. The Civil Division is responsible for representing federal agencies in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and in appeals before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Unlike the states, District of Columbia is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress. By statute, the U.S. Attorney is responsible for prosecuting both federal crimes and all serious crimes committed by adults in the District of Columbia. Therefore, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia serves as both the federal prosecutor (as in the other 92 U.S. Attorneys' offices) and as the local district attorney. The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, who is elected by the people of the District, handles local civil litigation and minor infractions, comparable with a City Attorney. In January 2020, Attorney General William Barr named Timothy Shea, one of his counselors at the Department of Justice, as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. Shea replaced U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu, who was nominated in January 2020 to become the Treasury Department’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial crimes; her nomination was withdrawn in February 2020 and she resigned from the Trump administration. Liu had been nominated for by Donald J. Trump and confirmed by the Senate as U.S. Attorney in September 2017, replacing acting U.S. Attorney Channing D. Phillips.U.S. Attorneys: District of Columbia on DOJ's U.S. Attorney's Office – District of Columbia website. After Attorney General Barr appointed acting USADC Shea to be acting administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency, Barr appointed Michael R. Sherwin to replace Shea as acting USADC.

Presentation The condition is asymptomatic, and is only noticed when screening for other hemoglobin disorders. Sickle cell disease In persons with sickle cell disease, high levels of fetal hemoglobin as found in a newborn or as found abnormally in persons with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin, the HbF causes the sickle cell disease to be less severe. In essence the HbF inhibits polymerization of HbS. A similar mechanism occurs with persons who have sickle cell trait. Approximately 40% of the hemoglobin is in the HbS form while the rest is in normal HbA form. The HbA form interferes with HbS polymerization.Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; Aster, Jon (2009-05-28). Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, Professional Edition: Expert Consult - Online (Robbins Pathology) (Kindle Locations 33411-33412). Elsevier Health. Kindle Edition. Causes HPFH can be caused by mutations in the β globin gene cluster, or the γ gene promoter region. In addition HbF levels are influenced by polymorphisms in the BCL11A gene and in the MYB gene enhancer. In HPFH the percentage of HbF varies from 0.8-1.0% to about 30% of the total hemoglobin, but levels as high as 100% can be seen in homozygotes for delta beta thalassemia. Epidemiology About 10% of the population has an HbF level >1.0%. HPFH may alleviate the severity of certain hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias, and is selected for in populations with a high prevalence of these conditions (which in turn are often selected for in areas where malaria is endemic). Thus, it has been found to affect people of African and Greek descent.

His Roman counterpart was Cupid (\\"desire\\").Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia, The Book People, Haydock, 1995, p. 215. In the earliest account, he is a primordial god, while in later accounts he is described as one of the children of Aphrodite and Ares and, with some of his siblings, was one of the Erotes, a group of winged love gods. Etymology The Greek ἔρως, meaning \\"desire,\\" comes from ἔραμαι \\"to desire, love\\", of uncertain etymology. R. S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin.R. S. P. Beekes, Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Brill, 2009, p. 449.  Cult and depiction  Eros appears in ancient Greek sources under several different guises. In the earliest sources (the cosmogonies, the earliest philosophers, and texts referring to the mystery religions), he is one of the primordial gods involved in the coming into being of the cosmos. In later sources, however, Eros is represented as the son of Aphrodite, whose mischievous interventions in the affairs of gods and mortals cause bonds of love to form, often illicitly. Ultimately, in the later satirical poets, he is represented as a blindfolded child, the precursor to the chubby Renaissance Cupid, whereas in early Greek poetry and art, Eros was depicted as a young adult male who embodies sexual power, and a profound artist.\\"Eros\\", in S. Hornblower and A. Spawforth, eds., The Oxford Classical Dictionary. A cult of Eros existed in pre-classical Greece, but it was much less important than that of Aphrodite. However, in late antiquity, Eros was worshiped by a fertility cult in Thespiae. In Athens, he shared a very popular cult with Aphrodite, and the fourth day of every month was sacred to him (also shared by Herakles, Hermes and Aphrodite). Eros was one of the Erotes, along with other figures such as Himeros and Pothos, who are sometimes considered patrons of homosexual love between males. Eros is also part of a triad of gods that played roles in homoerotic relationships, along with Heracles and Hermes, who bestowed qualities of beauty (and loyalty), strength, and eloquence, respectively, onto male lovers. The Thespians celebrated the Erotidia () meaning festivals of Eros.Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae, 13.12 - GreekAthenaeus, Deipnosophistae, 13.12 - English Primordial god According to Hesiod's Theogony (c. 700 BC), one of the most ancient of all Greek sources, Eros (the god of love) was the fourth god to come into existence, coming after Chaos, Gaia (the Earth), and Tartarus (the abyss).Hesiod. Theogony, 116–122 Homer does not mention Eros. However, Parmenides (c. 400 BC), one of the pre-Socratic philosophers, makes Eros the first of all the gods to come into existence.\\"First of all the gods she devised Erōs.\\" (Parmenides, fragment 13.) (The identity of the \\"she\\" is unclear, as Parmenides' work has survived only in fragments. The Orphic and Eleusinian Mysteries featured Eros as a very original god, but not quite primordial, since he was the child of Night (Nyx).See the article Eros at the Theoi Project. Aristophanes (c. 400 BC), influenced by Orphism, relates the birth of Eros: :At the beginning there was only Chaos, Night (Nyx), Darkness (Erebus), and the Abyss (Tartarus). Earth, the Air and Heaven had no existence. Firstly, blackwinged Night laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Darkness, and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Love (Eros) with his glittering golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in the deep Abyss with dark Chaos, winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race, which was the first to see the light.Aristophanes, Birds, lines 690–699. (Translation by Eugene O'Neill, Jr., Perseus Digital Library; translation modified.)  Son of Aphrodite and Ares  In later myths, he was the son of the deities Aphrodite and Ares: it is the Eros of these later myths who is one of the erotes. Eros was depicted as often carrying a lyre or bow and arrow. He was also depicted accompanied by dolphins, flutes, roosters, roses, and torches.Conner, p. 132, \\"Eros\\" [Hera addresses Athena:] “We must have a word with Aphrodite. Let us go together and ask her to persuade her boy [Eros], if that is possible, to loose an arrow at Aeetes’ daughter, Medea of the many spells, and make her fall in love with Jason . . .” (Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica 3. 25 ff – a Greek epic of the 3rd century BC) \\"He [Eros] smites maids’ breasts with unknown heat, and bids the very gods leave heaven and dwell on earth in borrowed forms.\\" (Seneca, Phaedra 290 ff.) \\"Once, when Venus’ son [Eros] was kissing her, his quiver dangling down, a jutting arrow, unbeknown, had grazed her breast. She pushed the boy away. In fact the wound was deeper than it seemed, though unperceived at first. [And she became] enraptured by the beauty of a man [Adonis].\\" (Ovid, Metamorphoses 10. 525 ff.) \\"Eros drove Dionysos mad for the girl [Aura] with the delicious wound of his arrow, then curving his wings flew lightly to Olympus. And the god roamed over the hills scourged with a greater fire.” (Nonnus, Dionysiaca 48. 470 ff – a Greek epic of the 5th century AD)  God of Friendship and Liberty  Pontianus said that Zeno of Citium thought that Eros was the God of Friendship and Liberty. Erxias (Ἐρξίας) wrote that the Samians, consecrated a gymnasium to Eros and called the festival which was instituted in his honour the Eleutheria (Ἐλευθέρια) meaning Liberty. The Lacedaemonians offered sacrifices to Eros before they go to battle, thinking that safety and victory depend on the friendship of those who stand side by side in the battle. In addition, the Cretans offered sacrifices to Eros in their line of battle.  Eros and Psyche  The story of Eros and Psyche has a longstanding tradition as a folktale of the ancient Greco-Roman world long before it was committed to literature in Apuleius' Latin novel, The Golden Ass. The novel itself is written in a picaresque Roman style, yet Psyche retains her Greek name. Eros and Aphrodite are called by their Latin names (Cupid and Venus), and Cupid is depicted as a young adult, rather than a child.Apuleius, The Golden Ass (Penguin Classics). The story tells of the quest for love and trust between Eros and Psyche. Aphrodite was jealous of the beauty of mortal princess Psyche, as men were leaving her altars barren to worship a mere human woman instead, and so she commanded her son Eros, the god of love, to cause Psyche to fall in love with the ugliest creature on earth. But instead, Eros falls in love with Psyche himself and spirits her away to his home. Their fragile peace is ruined by a visit from Psyche's jealous sisters, who cause Psyche to betray the trust of her husband. Wounded, Eros leaves his wife, and Psyche wanders the Earth, looking for her lost love. Eventually, she approaches Aphrodite and asks for her help. Aphrodite imposes a series of difficult tasks on Psyche, which she is able to achieve by means of supernatural assistance. After successfully completing these tasks, Aphrodite relents and Psyche becomes immortal to live alongside her husband Eros. Together they had a daughter, Voluptas or Hedone (meaning physical pleasure, bliss). In Greek mythology, Psyche was the deification of the human soul. She was portrayed in ancient mosaics as a goddess with butterfly wings (because psyche was also the Ancient Greek word for 'butterfly'). The Greek word psyche literally means \\"soul, spirit, breath, life or animating force\\".

It leads from the 190 foot high clifftop to a knickpoint approximately one third of way down the cliff face above Chale Bay beach. The Chine is one of three chines that have been eroded by a small unnamed brook that descends from Chale that drains rainwater from the west side of St. Catherine's Hill. The other two chines are Ladder Chine and Walpen Chine. The brook initially wound its way to the cliff face and its descent over the edge created Ladder chine. As the cliff eroded, the brook found a shorter path to the sea and started creating Walpen Chine to the east of Ladder chine. As the cliff eroded further, the brook moved east again and is currently eroding an unnamed chine labelled New Chine. New Chine consists of two small narrow ravines that feed the same knickpoint. The main ravine has the brook running through it for all but the driest parts of the summer. The smaller more westerly ravine is eroded when the brook overflows during flash flooding and the excess water finds a second route to the cliff edge.

He played in Major League Baseball as a right- handed pitcher from to for the San Francisco Giants, Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins. Career Carrithers was drafted out of Lynwood High School in Lynwood, California in the 3rd round of the 1967 Major League Baseball Draft by the San Francisco Giants. After working his way up through their farm system, he made his major league debut at the age of 20 in 1970, pitching 11 games with an earned run average (ERA) of 7.36. Carrithers started the 1971 season back in the minors, but was called up in June and was in the majors for good. Over the next three seasons, Carrithers bounced back and forth between the starting rotation and the bullpen for the Giants, but various injuries limited him to no more than 25 appearances in each season. On May 14, 1972 he gave up Willie Mays's 647th career home run. His performance was below average in each season as well, and just before the 1974 season, the Giants traded him to the Montreal Expos in return for catcher John Boccabella. Carrithers met with more success in Montreal, but injuries still hampered him. After two seasons of performing well in limited action, in 1976 Carrithers stayed healthy enough to throw 140 innings, his career high. However, his performance suffered a setback, as he went only 6–12 with an ERA of 4.43. The Expos became the second team to be frustrated by Carrithers, and they sold his contract to the Minnesota Twins the following spring. After yet another injury-filled campaign in which Carrithers made it into only 7 games, his major league career was over at the age of 28. He returned to the Giants in 1978, pitching for their top farm team, the Phoenix Giants, for whom he'd pitched from 1969-71, to end his professional baseball career.

The current building apparently dates from the 12th and 15th centuries, although it may partly incorporate earlier buildings or some of the masonry thereof. It may have been the site of an early Christian monastery. Temple Cronan is located in the civil parish of Carran, eight miles from Corofin and about sixteen miles from Ennis. History Some have argued on the basis of the existing visible structures that Temple Cronan was originally built to serve as a pagan temple. The current building had a window on the eastern wall as well as a small \\"Cyclopean\\" doorway on the west side, which is currently blocked by rubble. More conventional archaeologists see an early Christian (i.e. pre-12th- century) structure that was likely rebuilt or altered in the 12th and 15th centuries. It probably replaced one, perhaps of wood, set up under the reputed founder in the 7th century, one \\"Cronan\\" who may have been Saint Cronan of Roscrea, who died in 640, or Cronan Mochua, who died in 637. Early features include the \\"cyclopean\\" masonry, trabeate doorway (with inward sloping jambs) and the small window in the west wall. Some parts of an older construction, such as part of a doorway, may have been reused in the 12th-century construction. In the 12th century Temple Cronan was a site for pilgrimages. The building was most likely renovated again in the 15th century as is evidenced by the Gothic arch of the door. left No excavations have been conducted here, so much of the history of the place remains speculative. Construction and building features The possible monastic site includes the chapel/oratory, two shrines, a holy well, a termonn wall, a termonn cross and several domestic buildings. The ruins of the latter are located to the north and they most likely fulfilled non-religious duties for the monastery. Also to the northeast of the monastery is a quarry. It is from this quarry that much of the construction material used to build Temple Cronan and the other nearby buildings was likely gathered. In the northwest corner of the area, there is the remains of a large stone high cross \\"of considerable height\\" and its pedestal, which probably marked the boundaries of the Temple Cronan grounds (a termonn cross). The one-roomed oratory itself is a rectangular building metres long and wide. Because of its age, the high pitched roof, decorated with corbels at its corners, has fallen apart, but the side walls and gables are still erect. The lower walls are made of limestone blocks. The original door on the west side of the oratory is blocked by rubble, and the current entrance to the oratory is located on the north wall. This door, probably constructed in the 15th century during the second renovation, is topped by a carved stone head. There are six or seven Romanesque carved stone human and animal heads at irregular points along the wall as decoration, several apparently not in their original location. The two tomb shrines are constructed of two slabs of stone, on the east side of the building, probably built in the twelfth century and possibly the destination of pilgrims travelling to the Temple Cronan. Around 100 meters to the south of the site is a holy well at the base of a small cliff called Tobar Chronain, most likely named after St. Cronan.

The film is considered by some critics as a notable twist in the artistic career of Kiarostami. The film features close-ups of many notable Iranian actresses and French actress Juliette Binoche as they watch a film based on a part mythological Persian romance tale of Khosrow and Shirin, with themes of female self-sacrifice. The film has been described as \\"a compelling exploration of the relationship between image, sound and female spectatorship.\\" The film depicts the audience's emotional involvement with the story. The story is read between the tragic and kitsch by a cast of narrators led by Manoucher Esmaieli and is accompanied by a historical \\"film score\\" by Morteza Hananeh and Hossein Dehlavi. The film's production is replete with curious anecdotes. According to some reports, the women were filmed individually in Kiarostami's living room, with the director asking them to cast their gaze at a mere series of dots above the camera. The director has also stated that, during the filming process, he had no idea what film they were watching, and settled on the Khosrow and Shirin myth only after shooting had concluded.Maya Jaggi, \\"A life in cinema: Abbas Kiarostami\\" (interview), The Guardian, 13 June 2009.

Udenkwor successfully applied for a Polish passport, and in turn became a citizen. He became the second black African footballer to become a Polish citizen, the other being Emmanuel Olisadebe, who went on to feature for the Polish international team.

He then moved to England and joined Gainsborough Trinity, who were playing in the Conference North league, which is the 6th tier of English football. Udenkwor was firstly given a trial by the club's manager Paul Mitchell, and after scoring a hat-trick in his debut for the reserves, he was given a short term contract. His stay at Gainsborough was well covered in the local media, mainly down to the fact that while at Polonia Warsaw he featured in the UEFA Champions League, which is a notable and attractive achievement for any player playing at that level in the English game. Stanley was also joined at The Northolme by Tam Vo and Lhereux Menga, two French-born forwards who originate from Africa like himself, but both had progressed from the French Non League scene. After only five games, one of them being the club's 3-1 home defeat to Barnet in the first round of the FA Cup, Stanley was released by Trinity after failing to do enough to extend his contract, as well as failing to live up to the high expectations of the Trinity supporterts and his manager. Following his release by the club, he returned to Poland and signed for Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biała, and later went on to play for Mazur Karczew before joining Chrobry Głogów.

In an article in Peter Singer's In Defense of Animals: The Second Wave, Balluch describes his activism in Austria, which he says has given Austria animal protection legislation that, he writes, is among the most advanced in the world. He attributes the effectiveness of the activism to a united front among animal advocacy groups, which are elsewhere often divided by ideology and arguments about tactics. The first Austrian animal rights conference was held in Vienna in 2002, leading to a united press conference, which, he writes, signaled the start of a campaign to change the law. Balluch is notable for his role in persuading the Austrian parliament in 2004 to add a clause about non-human animals to the country's constitution, which now reads, \\"The state protects the life and well-being of animals in its responsibility for them as fellows of mankind. \\" He also helped to establish \\"animal solicitors\\" in each province, who are empowered by start court proceedings on behalf of animals,Balluch, Martin. \\"How Austria Achieved a Historic Breakthrough for Animals, \\" in Singer, Peter.

(dead link) By 2006, there was a ban on battery farms for chickens; a ban on the trade of dogs and cats in pet stores; a ban on the public display of dogs and cats in order to sell them. It is against the law to kill any animal without good cause; kill shelters are outlawed. Each province must appoint an \\"animal solicitor\\" financed by the state. The solicitors may take action on behalf of any animal, and must be kept informed about trials involving animals. When police or prosecutors are made aware of breaches of animal legislation, they are now compelled by law to act. Every two years, the government must write a report on advances made in animal protection. An \\"animal protection committee\\" has been set up, with one member elected by animal advocacy groups. The use of wild animals in circuses is prohibited. And the following statement has been added to the constitution: \\"The state protects the life and well-being of animals due to the special responsibility of mankind with respect to animals as their fellows. \\" He was invited to run as a Green Party candidate in September 2008.Jailed campaigner to run for Greens, Wiener Zeitung, (in German) 1 September 2008.

Charisse Tia Maria Coston and Freda Adler in their book Victimizing Vulnerable Groups analyzed the reasons behind the low crime rate in Bahrain. The society of Bahrain follows the teachings of the Qur'an; the Qur'an influences political, economic and social environment. Islam, which is most important in the structure of Bahraini society, teaches wrongdoings will result in downfall of societies and try to uproot crime by exerting influence upon human conscience. This internalization of the religion of Islam is analyzed as a cause behind law-abiding behavior among Bahraini people where violation of law is considered violation of the principles of God. Bahrain is a destination country for men and women trafficked for the purposes of involuntary servitude and commercial sexual exploitation. Men and women from Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia migrate voluntarily to Bahrain to work as laborers or domestic servants where some face conditions of involuntary servitude such as unlawful withholding of passports, restrictions on movements, non-payment of wages, threats and physical or sexual abuse.

Departing Sasebo 21 October 1950 Grainger returned to Guam on the 28th and resumed her task of logistic support to the Marianas and the Carolines. Departing Kwajalein 2 March 1951, Grainger sailed for Pearl Harbor arriving 13 March. Here she took up duty contributing logistic support to Midway Island and Kwajalein atoll until 18 June 1953. The ship then cleared Pearl Harbor to take up duty in Sasebo, where she arrived 12 July. With the exception of a voyage to Inchon, Korea, with refrigerated and dry stores for occupation troops, 6–13 October, Grainger steamed between Sasebo and Yokosuka until 19 March 1954, returning to Pearl Harbor 2 April, to take up her familiar runs to Kwajalein and Midway Island. Grainger again rotated to Sasebo, sailing on 5 March 1955, and she arrived there 29 March. Her visits included Buckner Bay, Okinawa; Subic Bay, Philippine Islands; Kaohsiung, Formosa; and Hong Kong. Final decommissioning Grainger departed Yokosuka 11 September, and going by way of Pearl Harbor reached Long Beach, California, 20 October 1955; 2 days later she shifted to San Diego, California, to undergo inactivation overhaul. Grainger decommissioned there 7 February 1956, and was turned over to the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. Grainger remained out of commission in reserve there until she was disposed of and her name stricken from the Navy List 1 April 1960. The veteran cargo ship was advertised for sale twice, 7 July and 11 August 1960, but the Maritime Administration rejected both bids. Ultimately, however, The Learner Co., a Japanese firm, successfully bid on 17 October 1960, purchasing the vessel as a scrap hull on 17 October 1960, the title transfer taking place on 14 December 1960 and the vessel being delivered at San Diego. Honors and awards Grainger received two battle stars for Korean service.

The aircraft is a shoulder-wing cantilever monoplane with a wing made from a balsa and plywood sandwich covered in fiberglass and a fuselage built from plywood. Design and development Elfe and Elfe 2 The first Elfe was a 9-metre wingspan glider that was designed by Swiss designer W. Pfenninger before World War II. A new design was introduced by Pfenninger in 1947 and was named the Elfe 2. This was probably the first sailplane to feature a laminar flow airfoil. It crashed due to rudder flutter PM-3 The Elfe series was then taken over, improved and strengthened by the Swiss engineer Markwalder into a third prototype, called the Elfe PM-3.Said, Bob: 1983 Sailplane Directory, Soaring Magazine, page 79. Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499–920 The sole PM-3's construction was started in one factory, but finished in another. It was first flown in 1955 and then went into storage for three years. The aircraft is built from Swiss pine and birch plywood and has a 52.5 foot wingspan. The PM-3 has dive brakes and full-span flaps with aileron interconnects to the flaps. It originally had fixed landing gear, but has been retrofitted with retractable mainwheel. It was retrieved from storage and flown in Europe by Rene Compte who brought it to compete in the U.S. Nationals at El Mirage, Arizona held in 1962. After the US Nationals the aircraft was not returned to Europe, but was sold, remained in the US and registered as N6351U in the Experimental – Exhibition/Racing category. In 1999 the PM-3 was sold again and moved to the United Kingdom. Compte originally reported the glider as being very pleasant to fly, but it did not do well in weak soaring conditions. It performed well only in conditions of strong lift. The PM-3 has a glide ratio of 40:1. Elfe M and S series Albert Neukom then took over the design and developed the Elfe M, Elfe MN and the AN66. The next in the line was the V-tailed Standard Elfe S-1, which first flew in 1964. The second prototype, the S-2, was similar to the S-1, but had a conventional tail. The S-3 was the production version of the S-2 and was first flown in 1966 and entered production that same year. It had a cruciform tail, trailing edge airbrakes and a retractable main wheel. In competition, a Standard Elfe that was flown by Markus Ritzi of Switzerland, placed second in the 1965 World Gliding Championships held at South Cerney, United Kingdom. United States pilot A.J. Smith finished first in the Standard Class at the 1968 World Gliding Championships held at Leszno, Poland in an S-3.

He was signed by the Phillies as an amateur free agent in 1951, but he did not make his big league debut until many years later – on April 15, 1958, against the Cincinnati Reds. The year prior, he'd gone 12–4 with a 2.64 ERA for the Triple-A Miami Marlins. In his first major league game, he gave up a hit and a walk, struck out two, and earned the win in a three inning relief appearance. Overall, he went 13–11 with a 3.92 ERA in 36 big league games (30 starts) that season. Although he was leading the league in wins at mid-season, his success tapered off and he finished with a winning percentage slightly higher than .500. Asthmatic, Semproch never lived up to his rookie season's success. In 1959, he went only 3–10 with a 5.40 ERA in 30 games (18 starts). He was traded to the Tigers on December 5, 1959 with Chico Fernandez for Ken Walters, Ted Lepcio, and minor leaguer Alex Cosmidis. In 17 relief appearances for the Tigers in 1960, he had an ERA of 4.00 and a record of 3–0. Despite that moderate success, he was traded on June 15, 1960 to the Los Angeles Dodgers with cash for Clem Labine. He would never play in a Dodgers uniform. On November 28, 1960, he was drafted by the Washington Senators in the Rule 5 draft (he and John Gabler were the first two player acquired by the \\"new\\" Washington Senators of 1961). On April 7, 1961, the Angels purchased him from the Senators. He'd appear in only two games for the Angels, posting a 9.00 ERA. He played his final major league game on May 2, 1961. Overall, Semproch went 19–21 with a 4.42 ERA in 85 games (48 starts). In 344 innings, he walked 136 batters and struck out 156. He hit .116 at the plate and had a .965 fielding percentage. Following his big league career, he worked as a bar manager at his brother's Italian restaurant.

Escorts launched the Rajdoot 350 (Yamaha RD350B) in 1983 and TVS launched the Ind-Suzuki AX100 in 1984–85. Bajaj Auto, which had a lead in the manufacture of scooters (started with Vespa-150), partnered with Kawasaki of the Fastest Bike in the World Kawasaki \\"Ninja group\\" to bring in the KB100, a two-stroke motorcycle based on Kawasaki KH125, a 125 cc model reduced to 100 cc capacity (97.6 cc due to engine import restriction in India during that era) bearing the same chassis. Production began in 1986–87 and went on until 1996 when the KB125 (all-aluminium engine (block and piston) as compared to cast iron block on earlier models) was launched.  Features  Next came the SX Enduro, which was an off-road scrambler bike with the same engine, but tweaked for lower-end torque. The final variant was the KB100 RTZ \\"Delta Super Tuned\\". This version was given a resonator box and the gearbox casing near the gear shift lever had the words \\"Delta Super Tuned\\". Presumably this version was a last-ditch attempt to rally sales in a market that was dominated by RX100 sales. The ergonomic grips, Front Break + Clutch Lever and the switch gears were directly imported from Japan at first until \\"Minda\\" started manufacturing original equipment including the ignition key cum either-side Steering Lock which had a unique feature of \\"City-light\\" position after locking the steering, we can put on the parking lights keeping all other electrical off, Also, one of the main fascinating features in this bike are it has its carburettor being fitted inside the gear box. This is a revolutionary change in the design of history of bikes. The KB 100 is powered by the oil pump, we fill the another oil called 2T oil which is received and pumped by this oil pump. Both the carburettor and oil pump are manufactured by \\"Mikuni\\" and that oil pump appears to be out, that is, it is not submerged into oil. Even a four stroke vehicle has an oil pump fitting inside its engine, whose principle work is to circulate the oil all over its components. Being a two stroke vehicle, this is the only vehicle which has its carburettor covered. Until this date no Indian bike has this feature. We can say this is even a speciality of this bike which no bike has till date. Other important features like # Right-side engine-killing switch # Speed/Taco cum fuel gauge assembly # Choke lever integrated with left-hand side switch assembly # Carburetor housed inside engine casing to prevent from tampering # Rotary disc intake valve # Long wheel base 1260 mm # Long-travel telescopic Front Shock Absorber # Wider tires # 12 V electrical system a magneto 35+35W \\"Stanley Seal-beamed Headlamp (later models came with user-replaceable bulb assembly) with 12 V 5 amp-hr battery which could easily power 21 W+21 W turn signal indicators with other tale-tell lights with 21 W stop light In March–April 1996 the KB125 was launched. A machine, it looked exactly like th KB100, except that the side panels said \\"KB125\\". A few months on, the paintwork was changed, which gave the bike a more contemporary look. The bike didn't sell too much even though it had more power that the comparable Yamaha RXG (11.8 bhp). Bajaj Engineers also experimented with a five-speed version of the bike, called the KB125 Prowler, but none seem to have been sold.  Legacy  A reliable, (relatively) fuel efficient machine, the KB100 has quite a few patrons, especially in Pune and Bangalore. Though it does not enjoy the same status or reputation of the Yamaha RXs or the Suzuki Shoguns 110 cc 14 bhp, it still is an important milestone in the history of Indian motorcycling. It was produced until 2000. When emission regulations were made more stringent by Indian government, Bajaj was forced to halt its production. The looks and a big bike feel and superior engine noise is noteworthy. The RTZ have a tachometer and fuel gauge from its first production.

His compositions were praised worldwide during his lifetime and he is arguably the most important composer of the Ionian School (music). He composed also the Olympic Hymn on lyrics of Kostis Palamas. Biography Samáras in young age Samaras was born in Corfu. His mother was from Constantinople and his father Skarlatos Samaras, a diplomat from Siatista. As a young man, he studied with Spyridon Xyndas (Σπυρίδων Ξύνδας). From 1875 to 1882 he studied at the Athens Conservatory with Federico Bolognini, Angelo Mascheroni and Enrico Stancampiano. His first opera Torpillae (now lost) was premiered in Athens in 1879. He went to Paris in 1882 to study at the Paris Conservatoire and became a favorite of Jules Massenet. His other instructors included Léo Delibes, Théodore Dubois, and Charles Gounod. He worked successfully as a composer in Paris for three years and then migrated to Italy in 1885. Initial page of the Olympic Hymn for the 1896 Summer Olympics. \\"The Princess of Sasson\\" operetta (1915). Samaras quickly became an important figure in the opera scene in Italy. His opera Flora mirabilis première in Milan in 1886 and in 1888 Medgé was successfully staged at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome with French opera star Emma Calvé in the title role. He became closely associated with Edoardo Sonzogno, a Milanese publisher. Sonzogno founded the Teatro Lirico Internazionale and chose Samaras' La martire for the theater's opening on 22 September 1894. The opera had premiered previously that year in Naples and is based on a libretto by Luigi Illica with many naturalistic elements, which gave space to Samaras' musical personality for an equal treatment. Samaras' works enjoyed wide distribution; his operas were staged in Paris, Monte Carlo, Cologne, Berlin, Vienna, Malta, Bucharest, Constantinople, Smyrna, Alexandria, Cairo, Greece and Italy. He wrote fifteen stage works, the last three on texts by Paul Milliet; Storia d'amore o La biondinetta (1903), Mademoiselle de Belle-Isle (1905) and Rhea (1908). He returned to Greece in 1911, thinking that he would be appointed director of the Athens Conservatoire . However he was not, partly because of the \\"National School controversy\\". The composers of the so-called \\"National School\\" considered the composers of the Ionian School, like Samaras, too much Italian influenced. He supported himself by composing operettas aiming at satisfying a variety of audiences, rather than continuing in his usual creative vein. His last opera, Tigra, although started about this time and containing some of his best music, was never finished. Samaras was chosen by Demetrius Vikelas for composing the Olympic Anthem, on lyrics by Kostis Palamas. The Anthem was first performed during the opening ceremony of the 1896 Summer Olympics, the first modern Olympic Games. It was declared the official anthem of the Olympic movement by the International Olympic Committee in 1958 and has been used at every opening ceremony since the 1960 Winter Olympics. He died, aged 55, in Athens. A bust of Samaras was toppled in Corfu in August 2020. Compositions Complete stage works Original libretto's cover for Flora mirabilis (1887).

Galena is located roughly midway between Nome and Fairbanks.  Overview  The department is allocated a full-time sworn Chief of Police and a full-time, sworn officer. The department has an officer either on-duty or on-call 24 hours a day, every day of the year. If no officer is available, Alaska Troopers handle emergency calls until one returns. The department is also allocated one paid, seasonal reserve officer and one paid, seasonal civilian administrative assistant. The Chief is also authorized to appoint a number of non-salaried, volunteer auxiliary police officers. The agency provides police protection to all of the City of Galena and the road system in and around the City, which is located off the state's continuous road and ferry system. The city is accessible only by air year-round and by tugboat & cargo barge on the Yukon River in ice-free months (May-Sept.). The department also provides police protection to the Louden Tribal Community and to the Galena Interior Learning Academy (GILA), a public boarding high school located on the site of the former Galena Air Force Base. The City has 670 permanent residents, close to 130 GILA high school students during the school year (mid-Aug. to mid-May), along with close to 15 seasonal school employees. The GILA students who come from all over Alaska are not included in the student population of approximately 90 city school students who reside in Galena year-round and attend the Sidney C. Huntington K-12 Public School. The US Bureau of Land management also has close to 30 seasonal summer employees during the summer fire season (mid-May to early Sept.). The State of Alaska also operates a summer vocational training camp at the GILA Campus each summer; two 2-week sessions for approximately 10-15 adult students. The Galena Air Force Base was activated as an Army Air Corps Base in World War 2, where lend-lease aircraft were staged while en route to Russia. The Base became an Air Force Base in 1947 and played a prominent Cold War role defending the Alaskan frontier as the US Air Force fighter intercept base closest to Russia. The base was deactivated in 1993 and completely closed as of Oct. 1st, 2008, by the Base Realignment Committee (BRAC). Galena Police are assisted by an Alaska State Trooper post also located on the base site, which is manned by two law enforcement \\"blue shirt\\" troopers and one wildlife \\"brown shirt\\" trooper-pilot. Galena Police can also receive assisted in emergencies from the two federal law enforcement officers of the US Fish and Wildlife Service who are assigned to the Galena Office; a split-duty law enforcement officer who also manages the Galena Office and a full-time law enforcement officer-pilot, who is also dual-commissioned as a Special Alaska State Trooper and can thus enforce state laws while serving the surrounding US Wildlife Preserve lands. The former Galena Air Base air field is now the Edward Pitka Airport and is one of the more heavily used interior Alaskan \\"bush\\" airports. The police department, which has a holding cell for temporary prisoner housing, is manned by civilian jail guards when needed. The police station is located at the City Hall complex on Antoski Road in Galena and has been operational for over a decade. The department utilizes the old Air Force weapons firing range for weapons training and has a satellite office at the GILA Campus. Persons arrested by Galena Police are arraigned and tried at the Galena courthouse. Adult prisoners who are remanded are transported by either commercial air or Alaska Trooper aircraft to the Alaska Department of Correction facility, Fairbanks Correctional Center (FCC), while juveniles are transported to the Fairbanks Youth Facility (FYF), both located in Fairbanks. The department has two 4-wheel drive patrol vehicles and maintains communications by phone-link radios, both hand-held and vehicle-mounted. Officers receive dispatch support from the Alaska State Troopers \\"D\\" Detachment in Fairbanks. State Troopers also can provide tactical support if needed, with a regional SWAT Team from \\"D\\" Detachment and investigative support is available from the Trooper's investigative arm, the Alaska Bureau of Investigation (ABI). The department currently has an internal hostage negotiator and its own training officer. Galena police officers are issued Glock Model 22 .40 caliber pistols and .12 gauge shotguns. Officers are cross-trained as Alaskan Emergency Trauma Technicians (ETT) or Alaska Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) and they routinely assist the Galena volunteer Emergency Medical Service (EMS). The department has a distinctive and colorful uniform shoulder patch depicting the Yukon River, Alaskan wildlife and the midnight sun of the northern summers. The badge is also a distinctive 7-point star with a grizzly bear in the center. Galena police officers are trained at the Alaska Public Safety Academy in Sitka or at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks Police Academy. Police Chief Michael Ervin assumed the post in OCT of 2009 and resigned in the summer of 2010, after succeeding chief is John Millan, a retired North Carolina chief who succeeded Chief Lowell Carlton, a retired California law enforcement officer, who retired in 2007.

From 1665, he was ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Köthen. He was the second son of Augustus, Prince of Anhalt-Plötzkau, by his wife Sibylle, daughter of John George I, Count of Solms-Laubach. Life After the death of his father in 1653, Lebrecht inherited Plötzkau jointly with his older brother Ernest Gottlieb and his younger brother Emmanuel. With their principality, they also received the regency over Anhalt-Köthen on behalf of the infant Prince William Louis. While Lebrecht and Emmanuel held the regency, Ernest Gottlieb served as sole ruler over Plötzkau, but only for seven months until his death, unmarried and childless. Lebrecht continued as regent over Köthen until 1659, when William Louis was proclaimed of age and began to govern his principality. Lebrecht then returned to Plötzkau, where he ruled jointly with Emmanuel. The death of William Louis in 1665 without heirs changed the distribution of the existing Anhalt principalities: Lebrecht and his brother received Anhalt-Köthen, and Plötzkau was returned to Anhalt-Bernburg, from which it was originally extracted. In Plötzkau on 18 January 1655 Lebrecht married Sophie Ursula Eleonore (b. Ortenberg, 2 October 1628 - d. Köthen, 13 September 1675), daughter of Henry Volrad, Count of Stolberg-Wernigerode.

After training he was shipped to England to fly in the 91st Bomb Group at RAF Bassingbourn. During Emond's first combat mission he flew as a tail gunner in the lead group. He flew as the co-pilot of the next few missions and then as pilot (the left seat) for the rest of his tour. Emond finished his tour around the middle of 1944 and was rotated back home to a base in Florida. When the war ended he elected to stay in the service and was in the Philippines in June 1946. After his allotment of missions, Emond was later offered to become a lead air trainer in Florida. After a short stint training pilots, he decided to return to his job as a \\"runner\\" at the New York Federal Reserve. Emond completed over 34 missions while leading Man O War II. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with 3 Oak leaf clusters and logged 1306 hours at the controls. He is considered one of the youngest Lieutenants to pilot a Fortress.

The first half of his career was spent as a Bank Examiner traveling throughout New York State. His post Bank Examination positions included being the first Officer in Charge of Operations and Technology, Officer in Charge of the Discount Window, Lead Trainer for Bank Examiners and Senior Officer in Charge of Special Projects. One of the special projects included assisting in the refinancing of the troubled Lockheed Company with investment banks (1970s). Emond was influential in establishing a more formal relationship between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. He was also called upon to manage several special projects for the New York board. One of the projects included assisting in the refinancing of the troubled Lockheed Air with investment banks. Marriage, children and grandchildren Emond married the former Alice Virginia Whalen. The couple had five children together: Eugene Edward, Randall George, Elizabeth Jane, Gary Micheal and Douglas William. After his wife's death in 1972, he raised their two youngest sons on his own. Grand children of Eugene and Alice are Edward Heinrich, Stacy Heinrich Woodin, Julia Heinrich Sanders, Alice Heinrich Clapsaddle, Allyson Emond Kiss, Christopher Emond, Gregory Emond, Catherine Emond and Patrick Emond.

He previously held the Infrastructure and Communities portfolio from 2015 to 2018, and served as a member of the Edmonton City Council representing Ward 12, gaining his seat in the 2007 Edmonton municipal election after finishing 4th place in the previous election, narrowly beating out strong community advocate Chinwe Okelu following the retirement of Terry Cavanagh. Early life and background Sohi was born in 1964 in the farming community of Banbhaura, Sangrur district in the Indian state of Punjab, to a Sikh family. Sponsored by an elder brother, he emigrated to Edmonton in 1981. Initially speaking almost no English, Sohi took ESL classes and enrolled at Bonnie Doon High School in Edmonton. He joined a local Punjabi literary society and became an actor and playwright in a Punjabi theatre group. By the early 1980s, the Khalistan movement, led by Sikhs demanding a homeland for themselves within India, had become very active, attracting support from many of the Indian Sikh diaspora in Canada. The movement soon developed into the Punjab insurgency, which polarised the Sikh community in Canada between Khalistani separatists and those supporting continued union with India. The agitation of the Sikhs in general further increased following the Indian Army's 1984 assault on the Harmandar Sahib complex and Akaal Takht, the holiest Sikh Gurdwara and temporal seat of the Sikhs, which resulted in the deaths of many Sikh civilians in addition to armed militants. The assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards followed that October as an act of individual capacity. This was followed by the bombing of Air India Flight 182 over the Atlantic Ocean in 1985, which killed all on board and also thought to be in retaliation for the operation and the mass killing of Sikhs that had followed Indira's assassination. While Sohi and his family opposed the human rights abuses committed by the Indian government, they remained moderate and anti- fundamentalist like most Sikhs. Himself non-religious, Sohi refused to wear a turban and grow his hair. The theatre group Sohi was involved in opposed both fundamentalism and the repressive actions of the Indian government. \\"I became more involved, speaking out against extremism,\\" Sohi said. \\"Our goal was to oppose Sikh fundamentalism on the one hand, but also to oppose state oppression.\\" Political activist and prisoner In 1988, Sohi returned to India to study with a noted Punjabi playwright and reformer, Gursharan Singh. He soon joined an activist group advocating land reform in Bihar, one of India's poorest states and dominated by large landowners. That November, Sohi went to a village in Bihar to organise a local protest, but was arrested the night before when police raided the village. \\"When they saw me, a Sikh, there from Punjab and from Canada, they said, 'We must have a terrorist here.',\\" Sohi recalled. Immediately after his arrest, Sohi was taken to a local police station, where he was relentlessly interrogated and tortured for the next week with repeated beatings, sleep deprivation and threats against his family. When he told his story to a district magistrate who had arrived to question him, she believed him and stopped the interrogations, permitting him to present his case in court though he was denied legal counsel. As Sohi had kept his Indian citizenship, he was denied access to Canadian diplomatic officers and held under India's Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA). An anti-terrorism law passed as a result of the Punjab insurgency, it allowed suspects to be detained for up to two years without being charged. State authorities falsely accused Sohi of being a trained Khalistan fundamentalist who had arrived in Bihar to train Naxalite insurgents, claiming that his arrest established the presence of an international terrorist network and that he had been arrested in possession of a gun and ammunition supplied by Pakistan; the state director-general of police issued a statement to The Hindu to that effect. After his court appearance, Sohi was transferred to Gaya Central Prison in the city of Gaya, where he was kept in solitary confinement for the next 18 months. He was placed in a cell with a small window and no bed; he slept on a single blanket on the floor, using another to cover himself. \\"The food was horrible. A couple of chapatis in the morning. Some lentil stew in the evening with a couple of rotis. No vegetables or any meat.\\" Initially, Sohi said he felt dazed and without energy. \\"I was traumatized. I wasn't in any right frame of mind.\\" After four months, his father and brother were allowed to visit. \\"My father was a very strong man. I had never seen my father cry before in my whole life. But I saw tears in my dad's eyes. I saw the pain and the emotion in his eyes that I had never seen before. You forget the physical pain and the torture, but I will never forget that.\\" Sohi managed to maintain his reason by making friends with the prison guards, and got a message out to the local newspapers through one of them, announcing he was going on a hunger strike for better food and library privileges. After a week of fasting, Sohi's family were permitted to send him money, which he used to buy food from outside the prison; he was also allowed to use the prison library. \\"I had no hope whatsoever that I would ever be able to get out,\\" he said. \\"What kept me alive, what made a difference, was access to the library and access to the newspapers.\\" Indian and Canadian journalists and activists, including members of Amnesty International, soon picked up Sohi's story. Through Conservative MP and human rights defender David Kilgour, Sohi's brother and sister-in-law pressured the Canadian government to exercise influence. The Canadian intelligence services informed the Indian government that Sohi posed no threat. Attempting to save themselves embarrassment, the Bihar police persisted in claiming Sohi to be a terrorist, variously charging him with links to Pakistani terrorists, Naxalite insurgents and to the Tamil Tigers. Finally, the 1990 legislative elections in Bihar brought a change of government, and a new state prosecutor reviewed Sohi's case, ordering it to be dismissed as there was \\"a lack of evidence against Mr. Sohi and also his prosecution is against [the] public policy of the state.\\" After 21 months in prison, 18 of them in solitary, Sohi was released to his parents' home in Punjab on July 9, 1990. After thanking those in Bihar who had helped him, Sohi returned to Edmonton. He has lived in southeast Edmonton since then, and is married with one daughter, Seerat, a freelance NBA columnist. Prior to his election to City Council, Sohi worked for the Edmonton Transit System as a bus driver. City Council In Amarjeet Sohi's first municipal campaign 2004 Edmonton municipal election, he finished fourth behind incumbents Dave Thiele and Terry Cavanagh, along with Chinwe Okelu.http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/documents/Chapter_13_-_Results_1945_to_2013.pdf Sohi's second campaign was successful, and he won a Council seat in Ward Six in 2007. On the City Council, Sohi has served as a member of the Edmonton Police Commission, as Vice President of the Alberta Urban Municipalities Association, and as Council sponsor for Safedmonton, a citywide committee working on community solutions for crime prevention. Sohi carried this work forward as advisor to the REACH Edmonton Council for Safe Communities. Sohi has also held the Council portfolio for Multiculturalism, and has championed the Racism Free Edmonton initiative. He has also sponsored or co-sponsored Council initiatives on Seniors and on Poverty Elimination, and has recently co-launched an initiative to end gender-based violence. After completing two terms as a Councillor, it was widely acknowledged that Sohi was contemplating a mayoral run in the 2013 municipal election. Sohi ultimately announced that he would not enter the race and would instead seek re-election for his Ward 12 seat. Awards During his time on Council, Sohi has received several awards in recognition of his community leadership. He has received the Edmonton Interfaith Advocate Award and the John Humphrey Centre's Human Rights Advocate Award for promoting welcoming and inclusive communities. In 2015, Sohi received the Man of Honour, Exemplary Leadership Award from the Centre to End All Sexual Exploitation in recognition of his work to end gender discrimination and violence and the Edmonton Mennonite Centre for Newcomers Recognizing Immigrant Success in Edmonton (RISE) Lifetime Achievement award. Federal politics In February 2015, Sohi was acclaimed as the Liberal candidate for Parliament in the newly created Edmonton Mill Woods riding. Sohi officially launched his campaign in June 2015 at a large rally with Justin Trudeau in Mill Woods. Sohi's campaign emphasized the importance of federal leadership to address big-city and infrastructure challenges. Sohi was also sharply critical of the Harper government's approach to citizenship, multiculturalism, and immigration policy. The nomination contest in Edmonton- Mill Woods was the subject of a minor controversy prior to Sohi's acclamation. Varinder Bhullar was disqualified following alleged violations of Liberal Party membership rules. Bhullar claimed the party disqualified him after he refused to step aside in favor of Sohi, the party's preferred candidate. On October 19, 2015, after a longer than average 78-day federal election campaign, Sohi was declared elected as the Member of Parliament for Edmonton Mill Woods. Per the initial count, Sohi received 41.2% of the popular vote and won by a margin of 79 votes. Conservative candidate Tim Uppal successfully argued for a judicial recount of the results. The recount was held on October 29 and increased Sohi's margin of victory to 92 votes.Paige Parsons, Liberal candidate Amarjeet Sohi declared winner following Edmonton Mill Woods recount, The Edmonton Journal, October 29, 2015. Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Sohi was appointed Minister of Infrastructure and Communities in Justin Trudeau's first cabinet on November 4, 2015.  Minister of Natural Resources  Sohi took over the Natural Resources profile from Jim Carr on July 18, 2018. In the October 2019 Election, Amarjeet was defeated by Tim Uppal.

The title Brenhinoedd y Saeson is found only in the rubric to the earlier of the two surviving manuscripts of version S: the other two texts are commonly known as Brut y Tywysogion, but this title is found only in manuscripts of the late 16th century and cannot be considered authentic. The three versions of Brenhinoedd y Saeson are closely related to and are probably translations from a text or texts evidenced by those Cambro- Latin annalistic chronicles now known as Annales Cambriae. Sources P survives in a single medieval manuscript: Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS. Peniarth 20, written c.1330, probably at the Cistercian abbey of Valle Crucis (Llanegwestl). The scribe of this manuscript also wrote the earlier of the two manuscripts containing S. R survives in four medieval manuscripts: # Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS. 3035B (Mostyn 116); # Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS. Peniarth 18; # Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS. Peniarth 19; # Oxford, Jesus College, MS. 111 (Llyfr Coch Hergest, 'The Red Book of Hergest'). These all date from about 1350 to about 1400. S survives in two medieval manuscripts: # London, British Library, MS. Cotton Cleopatra B.v., written at Valle Crucis Abbey soon after 1332; # Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS. 7006D (Llyfr Du Basing, 'The Black Book of Basingwerk'), written in or soon after 1461 (where the chronicle ends). The principal scribe was the poet Gutun Owain, who died c. 1500, and whose datable manuscript output lies between 1456 and 1497. Dating P is datable 1286 – c.1330; R is datable 1307 – 1350; S is datable c. 1200 (probably 1282 or 1286) – 1300. The order of composition of the three versions remains to be determined.

His major contributions were in the areas of galaxy dynamics and plasma physics. Early life and education Kandrup was born in Manhasset, New York and spent most of his childhood in Great Neck. His parents, Jytte and Fred, were immigrants from Denmark where his father had worked as a silver smith. He graduated from the Brooks Preparatory School in Andover, Massachusetts at the age of 16, then enrolled at Cornell, transferring to Princeton the following year. He received his PhD in 1980 from the University of Chicago where his thesis advisor was James Ipser. He taught at Oakland University and Syracuse University before coming to the University of Florida in 1990. Already as a child, Kandrup was an accomplished musician, playing the organ, piano and French horn. He was also a passionate devotee of opera and ballet. Scientific contributions Kandrup's work led to greater understanding in the fields of stellar dynamics, chaos, and plasma physics. Much of Kandrup's research was directed toward developing a more refined mathematical description of dynamical relaxation in stellar systems. In a series of papers from the early 1990s, Henry developed the idea of chaotic phase mixing, the process by which an ensemble of points evolves toward a uniform coarse-grained population of phase space. Among his other contributions were a demonstration of the equivalence of Landau damping and phase mixing; a proof (with J. F. Sygnet) of the linear stability of a broad class of stellar systems; and a generalization of Jeans's theorem to non-integrable systems. At the time of his death, he was investigating the chaotic dynamics of charged particle beams, and the influence of binary supermassive black holes on the motion of stars in galaxies.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on September 28, 2008. The episode features anthropomorphic dog Brian as he meets a fellow atheist named Carolyn (Kat Foster) at a book store, and the two begin dating. Heeding advice from Stewie (also voiced by MacFarlane), Brian decides not to have sex with her. Carolyn is led to believe that Brian does not want a substantive relationship, so she begins to date Cleveland (Mike Henry). The episode was originally slated to air during season six on March 2, 2008, but was replaced with Play it Again, Brian for unknown reasons. The episode was written by Henry, and directed by Cyndi Tang. It received generally positive reviews from critics for its storyline. According to Nielsen ratings, it was watched by 9.2 million viewers in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Foster and Meredith Baxter, along with several recurring voice actors from the series. \\"Love, Blactually\\" was released on DVD along with eight other episodes from the season on June 16, 2009. Plot During a costume party, Lois suggests Brian to find a girlfriend. After going to the bookstore to buy The God Delusion, Brian meets an atheist named Carolyn, who happens to be looking for the same book. Brian becomes interested in Carolyn, and the two begin to date. When she invites him to her house, Stewie apprehends Brian and tells him that his relationships fail because he has sex with his girlfriends immediately when they meet. Brian realizes that Stewie is right and decides to listen to his advice. However, he finds out that Carolyn has begun to date Cleveland, since Brian did not want to have sex for the three weeks they have dated, and assumed he just wanted to be friends. A heartbroken Brian tries to deal with his loss, but keeps running into Cleveland and Carolyn having sex in various locations. Blaming Stewie for his advice that cost him a relationship with Carolyn, Brian is about ready to give up on love. Apologizing for his botched attempt to help him out, Stewie suggests that he can convince Cleveland's ex-wife, Loretta, to reconcile with him. The two visit Loretta in her own room and find out that she feels guilty for cheating on him with Quagmire, and believes she can never go back to Cleveland. Later, Cleveland visits Brian to clear any negative feeling he has against him and Carolyn, as they are at \\"a point of great soreness\\", but then Cleveland announces to Brian plans to elope with Carolyn in Hawaii, which makes their friendship tense. Just as Cleveland leaves, Loretta appears out of nowhere. Loretta apologizes to Cleveland for her affair with Quagmire, she then announces that she wants to get their family back together and promises she'll never betray him again. Cleveland goes to Peter and Lois for advice on what should be done. Peter and Lois think Cleveland shouldn't go back to Loretta, but Brian (seeing this as his only chance at getting back with Carolyn) says Cleveland should \\"forgive and forget\\", and points out Loretta's good qualities (which he's obviously lying, as his nose starts to grow). Peter suspects that Brian is lying and points out that she can't be trusted after what she did. Cleveland decides to talk to Loretta tomorrow to see how he feels about getting back together with her. Thinking Loretta hasn't changed and suspecting that Brian was using her to sabotage his chances to be with Carolyn, Peter recruits Quagmire to have sex with Loretta again so Cleveland can see she hasn't changed. Quagmire meets her at the hotel she's staying in, but this time, Loretta resists his advances and tells him to beat it after smashing him in the face with an iron. When Cleveland shows up to her hotel room, Cleveland forgives her, but insists that it is time for the both of them to move on while Loretta lives her life as amazing and wonderful as she can. Cleveland finally leaves as Loretta tearfully watches on. When Cleveland visits Carolyn, he finds her and Quagmire having sex, apparently the same way it happened to Brian. Since both Brian and Cleveland have been cheated on by the same woman, Cleveland apologizes to him for stealing Carolyn and they make amends, with the former revealing himself to have received a genital wart. Production Mike Henry, who voices Cleveland, wrote the episode. \\"Love, Blactually\\" is the season premiere of the seventh season of Family Guy. It was written by one of the show's main voice actors, Mike Henry, in his first episode of the season. The episode dealt a lot with the character of Cleveland Brown, which is one of the characters for which Henry provides the voice. The episode was directed by Cyndi Tang, who has been with the show since its fifth season. Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors for the episode. The episode is one of the last to concentrate on the character of Cleveland, since he would be moved to The Cleveland Show (which Henry co-created). \\"Love, Blactually\\", along with the first eight episodes of the seventh season were released on DVD by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in the United States and Canada on June 16, 2009, one month after it had completed broadcast on television. The \\"Volume 7\\" DVD release features bonus material including deleted scenes, animatics, and commentaries for every episode. In addition to the regular cast, actress Kat Foster portrayed the voice of Carolyn, and actress Meredith Baxter portrayed herself. Recurring voice actors Ralph Garman, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, and writer John Viener also made minor appearances. Then-series writer and regular voice actress Alex Borstein portrayed the voice of Loretta Brown. Cultural references Joe goes to a costume party as swimmer Mark Spitz The episode begins with a costume party, where Brian and Stewie are both dressed as Snoopy from Peanuts, Quagmire dresses up as Napoleon Dynamite, Peter as Laura Bush, Lois as Michael Dutton Douglas, Joe as Mark Spitz (although people believe he is a crippled Thomas Magnum), and Cleveland as Charlie Chaplin. Woodstock, another character from Peanuts also makes a cameo appearance. The popular conversation between Stewie and Brian which draws attention to a hard \\"h\\" consonant sound is directly sourced from dialogue within the film Hot Rod. Stewie finds a book entitled Horton Hears Domestic Violence in the Next Apartment and Doesn't Call 911!, a parody of Horton Hears a Who! Cleveland's deadpan exclamation of \\"...and boom goes the dynamite\\" is a reference to the popular catchphrase which became an Internet sensation. Cleveland and Carolyn meet at a Starbucks. Peter doesn't remember the name of Cleveland's ex-wife (Loretta) and he guesses that it's Jennifer Hudson. Reception The episode was watched by 9.2 million viewers, compared to 9.3 million that tuned in to The Simpsons and 7 million that watched King of the Hill for their season openers on Fox. The episode received positive reviews. Ahsan Haque of IGN praised \\"Love, Blactually\\", writing that it had \\"many memorable scenes, quote- worthy dialogue, politically incorrect references, and great storyline\\". He graded the episode 8.9 out of 10. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club wrote that the episode was \\"pretty funny overall\\" with \\"some great meta-commentary\\", and graded it B+. In contrast Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode a negative review, saying that Family Guy has become like the shows it mocked in its earlier seasons and he ended his review by stating that it has become \\"predictable, stale and irritating to watch\\" and he gave it a 29 out of a possible 100.

Bronco's digits Lane had his five fingers and 10 toes preserved in formaldehyde and kept them behind the regimental mess. When the National Army Museum approached him seeking items to commemorate his climb in 1976 Lane presented them with his severed digits together with an ice axe he used during his climb. Lane stated at the time that \\"I don't think it was quite what they were expecting...but I haven't got any use for them any more and I thought it would be nice to see them exhibited.\\"Everest climber gives museum the finger The toes were not in good enough condition to be exhibited but the fingers were placed on display on a wooden plinth.

Isle Royale has been an obstacle to shipping on Lake Superior since the earliest days. Upon its reefs, more than 25 major wrecks have occurred. Some were refloated, but most never left. Early wrecks Still to be found beneath the waves of Lake Superior are the wooden sidewheeler, Cumberland (1877); bulk freighter, Chester Congdon (1918); and the first Canadian wheat packet, Emperor (1947). Earlier, the Kamloops which \\"went missing\\" in 1927 was found on the northern shore of the island in 1977. The earliest recorded wrecks were the Madeline (1839) and the Siskiwit (1840) of the American Fur Company. Many smaller French \\"ships\\" were reported upon Lake Superior in the 18th century, which were gone before the English arrival in 1763. Along the north shore of the lake, the most celebrated wreck is that of the America which served as a connection between Isle Royale and the mainland and was a highway from Duluth, Minnesota, to Port Arthur, Ontario.Stonehouse, Frederick (1977). Isle Royale Shipwrecks. Marquette, Michigan: Avery Color Studios. The 3 C's of Isle Royale To the west and south of Isle Royale is the Rock of Ages Lighthouse. Built in 1908, the light has provided the ships of Lake Superior with assurances that the Rock of Ages reef would be found by the captain, before the reef found the ship. But that was too late or too little for the three residents lying atop the reef. The Passenger Steamer Cumberland had spent 21–23 July 1877 aground on a bar near Nipigon, Ontario, just prior to heading out into the clear lake from Thunder Bay. She was headed to Duluth, running in clear weather with a light breeze out of the south, when she ran hard upon the reef. A salvage crew tried to float the ship off the reef, but gave up when the weather turned sour in early August. The 'elements' of the lake have left only scattered sections of her hull, sidewheel and anchor from deep on the Rock of Ages Reef.\\"Cumberland\\" & \\"Wreck of Sidewheel Steamer Cumberland\\". Detroit Free Press. January 29, 1974. Nearby to the southwest lies the Henry Chisholm. Sunday, October 1898 she was headed east towards the Soo when her tow separated in a storm north of Copper Harbor, Michigan. On the morning of the 20th, while preparing to begin a search of the Isle Royale harbors for the tow Martin, the Chisholm ran hard atop the reef. So badly damaged was the hull that the salvage crew estimated that it would take 8–10 pumps to lower the water in the hold. With bad weather expected at any time, it was abandoned to the lake. Today, she rests amongst the remains of the Cumberland, the steam engine being the identifiable remains.\\"Chisholm on the Rocks\\". Detroit Free Press. October 22, 1898. To the east lies the George M. Cox. It was on the night of May 28, 1933, that the Cox struck the reef in a heavy fog. The Cox had been headed for Fort William and was making a good 10 statute miles per hour (16 km/h) in a calm lake when she struck. The impact was so great that the boilers ripped loose. The craft then settled onto the reef with a 90-degree tilt. Many pictures have been seen of the Cox, with its bow standing high out of the water, and the stern lapped by the waves. Again, the damage exceeded the ability of salvagers to remove her from the grave.\\"S.S. George M. Cox Wrecked\\". Houghton Mining Gazette. May 28, 1933.

Only three years later, in 1901, the America was operating on Lake Erie, when Alfred Booth of A. Booth Co. of Chicago began to negotiate for ownership of this modern and fast ship () for the North Shore route out of Duluth, Minnesota. On April 26, 1902, the America left her berth on the lower lakes for a final home on Lake Superior.Holdon, Thom. \\"Above and Below: Steamer America\\". The Nor'easter (Duluth, Minnesota). Lake Superior Marine Museum; Vol. 3, #3 & #4; May/June & July/August 1978. Capt. \\"Fog King\\" Hector became her first captain on Superior. Capt. Hector began his days on Lake Superior at 17 in 1863 operating a small fishing operation. The \\"Fog King\\" was completely familiar with the north shore. He was seldom late on his run, regardless of the weather. Most of the America's problems in those years came from its need to enter civilization. In 1902, it collided with the Duluth Ship Canal; in 1904, the anchor from a bulk freighter ripped through the upper staterooms while berthed next to a grain terminal in Duluth, and in 1910, another ship was struck by the America rendering major damage to both. It was this collision, which allowed the America to be repaired and enlarged from its original 486 tons to 937 tons. The only major incident during Capt. Hector's tenure took place off the Susie Islands. On June 10, 1907, the America had just stopped to drop off supplies at either Grand Portage or the old Parkerville dock in the Susie Islands. As the crew was putting the final packages into place, a new 2nd Porter, Harvey Holler (16 years old), stepped backwards and out the open gangway. The crewmembers never saw him again, despite their attempts to search the waters. The year 1911 saw the newly lengthened America traveling up the North Shore with a new captain. Capt. Edward C. \\"Indian\\" Smith was to be the final captain of the ship. Capt. Smith had worked the other Booth boat, Hiram R. Dixon, and the under Hector on the America. It was said that on the foggiest days, you would hear the ship's whistle and know to head to the rendezvous point. Standing in your small skiff, unable to see more than 15 or 20 feet, you would wait for the America. Then from the fog would come the bow, and the America would come to rest alongside your skiff with barely a ripple. And no sooner had it come to rest, than the engines would pound and the America would slip back into the fog, headed for the next meeting along the shore. Capt. Smith only once in the first 14 years brought the America to a problem. In 1914, she ran aground on Fisherman's Point in Two Harbors. This time, the damage was minor, compared to the rock Capt. Hector found in Burlington Harbor (Two Harbors) in 1909. The last few years found the America stuck upon a reef or bar each year. On May 28, 1925, she went aground on Scott's Point in Colville. The following year, she went aground in the Kaministiquia River at Fort William, Ontario. And on July 21, 1927, she rammed into a tug at Port Arthur. Each time, the damage was greater and the repairs more expensive. On June 6, 1928, the America steamed through the Duluth Ship Canal. Later that day, she landed in Grand Marais after making the routine stops along the coast. After clearing cargo and passengers, the America rounded the breakwall heading for Isle Royale. Apparently, the routine was to continue north along the shore and return through Isle Royale, stopping at the fish houses before returning to Duluth. But on this night, the America was carrying several passengers bound for Washington Island. At 3 a.m. on June 7, she nosed out of the Singer Hotel Dock on Washington Island. Heading for North Gap and open water, the Captain retired and let First Mate Wicks and a helmsman take the watch. Within minutes, the ship bumped over a reef, puncturing holes in the single bottom. Returning to the bridge, where the mate was signaling the alarm to the crew and passenger, Capt. Smith ordered the helmsman, Fred Nelson, to head towards a gravel beach before the ship floundered and lost headway. Thirty yards off the beach, the America hit another reef and came to an abrupt halt. Meanwhile, the crew in the engine room greased the engine to prevent rust and improve salvage and the topside crew began to move the passengers to the lifeboats. Within an hour and a half of leaving Washington Island, the crew and passengers were on their way back in lifeboats. They met a small fleet of fishing boats coming to the sound of the whistle.\\"America\\". Houghton Mining Gazette, vol. 29. June 8, 1928. The America came to rest with the bow standing out of the water and the stern and midships reaching into the depths. A. Booth and Sons elected not to salvage the America, probably due to the completion of Minnesota Trunk Route I (US 61). The new road cut the cost of transportation along the shore making it unprofitable to operate a ship. The next year in September, 1929, Capt. Cornelius Flynn of the Duluth Salvage Company bought the rights to the America. The winter of '28–29 had done minor damage to the upper cabins. But before he could get a crew to the site, winter set in and kept them at home. The following spring, the ice had sheared off the cabins at the waterline. The decrease in weight and the upward pressure of the ice floated the wreck and it settled beneath the surface. Today, it can be seen below the water. Frank Rockefeller On the night of November 3, 1905, the Frank Rockefeller ran aground in Rainbow Cove during a blizzard. The very next day, a salvage crew was on the way to float her free. She continued in service hauling many bulk products until 1969. At that time, she was retired by her owners who called her the , a whaleback designed ship now on display in Superior, Wisconsin.

From 1665, he was ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Köthen. He was the third and youngest son of Augustus, Prince of Anhalt-Plötzkau, by his wife Sibylle, daughter of John George I, Count of Solms-Laubach. Life In 1653, after the death of his father, Emmanuel inherited Plötzkau jointly with his older brothers Ernest Gottlieb and Lebrecht. They also had the responsibility of acting as regents over Anhalt- Köthen on behalf of the infant Prince William Louis. In practice, it was Emmanuel and Lebrecht who exercised the regency while Ernest Gottlieb remained as sole ruler of Plötzkau for only seven months until his own death, after which Emmanuel and Lebrecht served as co-rulers. Their regency over Köthen lasted until 1659, when William Louis was proclaimed of age and began his own government over the principality. The death of William Louis in 1665 without heirs changed the distribution of the existing Anhalt principalities: Emmanuel and Lebrecht received Köthen, and their former principality of Plötzkau was returned to Anhalt-Bernburg, from which it was originally extracted. The death of Lebrecht without heirs in 1669 left Emmanuel as sole ruler of Anhalt-Köthen until his death, almost exactly one year later.

On Emmanuel's death, his wife was three months pregnant. She was declared regent over Köthen until the birth of the child; if she had a boy, he could succeed his father, but if the child was a girl, the other principalities would divide the Köthen lands. On 20 May 1671, six months after the death of her husband, the Dowager Princess Anna Eleonore gave birth to a son, named Emmanuel Lebrecht, who immediately became the new ruler of Anhalt- Köthen under the regency of his mother.

They were mostly the remains of part of General Lavr Kornilov. Professional military men were forced to beat swords into plowshares, remove the officer's uniform jacket and put on workers to start a new life in a foreign land, where only the work in the quarry or the factory could feed his families. Among the newcomers in the towns Mertert and Wiltz was not a priest, but had faith. Faith is not only in God, Tsar and Fatherland, but also the belief in the imminent return to his former life, home.

The two-disc set includes three different recordings of the band's track \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" and a DVD featuring two versions of the song's music video. The photography for the release was handled by Jacques Descloitres from NASA, who provided satellite images of the Arctic Circle. To the Edge of the Earth was conceived in support to the environmental campaign which Thirty Seconds to Mars began with the release of their single \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" (2007). It was enclosed as a digipak made of environmentally friendly material. Lead vocalist Jared Leto filmed a music video for the song in Greenland, which has been credited for raising public awareness of global warming and green politics. Background Thirty Seconds to Mars released \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" as the fourth and final single from their second album of the same name in December 2007. Upon release, the band launched a website, called abeautifullie.org, to provide information about environmental issues and ways to participate in environmental activities. People could make donations through the site to support the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). On January 30, 2008, an accompanying music video for the song premiered on Myspace. It was filmed 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Greenland and was directed by Jared Leto under the pseudonym of Angakok Panipaq, a character from the Inuit children's book Spirits in the Snowhouse: the Inuit Angakok. The short film features an Earth conservation message with a global warming awareness theme and proceeds from its sales benefited the Natural Resources Defense Council. \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" preceded the extended play To the Edge of the Earth, released on March 25, 2008 by Virgin Records as a limited edition two-disc set. It was conceived as a follow-up to band's environmental campaign. The extended play consists of two discs. The first, which is a compact disc, includes two different studio versions of \\"A Beautiful Lie\\", as well as an acoustic live rendition of the song, which was recorded at the EMI Studios in Paris, France, by Guy Teixeira and Serge Veneruso. The second disc is a DVD, containing an extended and a short version of the music video accompanying the song. Bartholomew Cubbins, Leto's Dr. Seuss-inspired pseudonym, is credited as executive producer. Production Thirty Seconds to Mars began working on the project in early 2007. They found difficulties in recruiting a production company for the shooting of \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" since most operators passed on the project, who considered it to be risky and dangerous. After six months, Yamani Watkins and Edy Enriquez attached to produce, while Elliott Lester was set to co-direct the short film. The crew spent a month in Ilulissat, Greenland, preparing pre-production; almost 200 different kinds of insurance were required to shoot the video. Determined to offset the impact of filming on the environment, Thirty Seconds to Mars worked with the Natural Resources Defense Council on strategies that minimized fuel consumption on the shoot, using renewable energy products. Jared Leto described the whole project as \\"one of the most painstaking and difficult creative challenge we have ever undertaken as a band. It has also been one of the most inspiring – a rare opportunity to reach into our imagination and push the limits of what's possible.\\" The short film for \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" marked the first music video entirely shot on location 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Greenland. To the Edge of the Earth was printed on post-consumer waste paper using minimal volatile organic compound inks and included a package made of ecological friendly materials. The photography for the extended play was handled by Jacques Descloitres, a photographer working within the NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, with additional works produced by the band's previous collaborator Sean Mosher-Smith of the Echo Designlab. Descloitres provided satellite images of different areas of the Arctic Circle based largely on observations from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer. Reception Karl Burkart from Mother Nature Network deemed it as \\"one of the most eye-catching\\" works of art displayed at the 2009 opening of the Lofts at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles. A writer from Rock Sound commended the band's commitment in promoting environmental awareness through the medium of music. Kara DiCamillo from TreeHugger felt that the band undertook a different path than the norm and stated, \\"they were compelled and inspired to make an environmental statement because global warming is currently affecting this beautiful landscape and the people who live there. They wanted to take their experience and inspire all of us as well. And we believe they have succeeded.\\" Kristi Kates from the Northern Express stated that the short film for \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" continued the band's \\"burgeoning tradition of shooting videos in unusual locations\\", referring to their previous work on \\"From Yesterday\\" (2006). Laura Malesich from Green Daily noted that Thirty Seconds to Mars actively brought attention to environmental issues and tried to \\"encourage younger generations to participate in eco- activities and conservation.\\" A writer of MTV noticed the band's attempt to \\"raise awareness\\" about global warming. Upon release, \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" was met with widespread critical acclaim, resulting in various accolades, including the MTV Europe Music Award for Best Video.

The GNP&BR; was formed through a merger of two older companies, the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B&PCR;) and the Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN&SR;). It also incorporated part of a tube route planned by a third company, the District Railway (DR). The combined company was a subsidiary of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). The B&PCR; and the GN&SR; were established in 1896 and 1898 respectively, but construction of both railways was delayed while funding was sought. In 1902 the UERL, which already controlled the DR, took control of both companies and quickly raised the funds, mainly from foreign investors. A number of different routes were planned, but most were rejected by Parliament. When it opened in 1906, the GNP&BR;'s line served 22 stations and ran for between its western terminus at Hammersmith and its northern terminus at Finsbury Park. A short branch connected Holborn to the Strand. Most of the route was in a pair of tunnels, with at the western end constructed above ground.Length of line calculated from distances given at Within the first year of opening it became apparent to the management and investors that the estimated passenger numbers for the GNP&BR; and the other UERL lines were over-optimistic. Despite improved integration and cooperation with the other tube railways, the GNP&BR; struggled financially. In 1933 it and the rest of the UERL were taken into public ownership. Today, the GNP&BR;'s tunnels and stations form the core central section of the London Underground's Piccadilly line. Establishment Origins =Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway, 1896= B&PCR; and DR deep-level routes, 1896 In November 1896 notice was published that a private bill was to be presented to Parliament for the construction of the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B&PCR;). The line was planned to run entirely underground between Air Street near Piccadilly Circus and the south end of Exhibition Road, South Kensington. The route was to run beneath Piccadilly, Knightsbridge, Brompton Road and Thurloe Place, with intermediate stations at Dover Street, Down Street, Hyde Park Corner, Knightsbridge and Brompton Road. A short branch to the east of the South Kensington terminus was planned to a depot south of Brompton Road at the end of Yeoman Row. Electricity to operate the trains was to be provided from a generating station to be built about a mile south of the South Kensington terminus on the north bank of the River Thames at Lots Road, West Brompton.Badsey-Ellis 2005, p. 71. Following parliamentary approval, the bill received royal assent as the Brompton & Piccadilly Circus Railway Act, 1897 on 6 August 1897. =District Railway deep-level tube, 1896= Also announced in November 1896 was a bill to be presented by the District Railway (DR) for a tube railway to be constructed beneath its existing sub-surface line between Gloucester Road and Mansion House stations. The DR operated a steam railway, running in cut and cover tunnels, and planned to ease congestion along its heavily used route by constructing an express line with just a single intermediate station at Charing Cross (now Embankment). The express line was to surface west of Gloucester Road and connect to the DR's existing line at Earl's Court. Since, like the B&PCR;, the DR's deep tube line would be operated with electric trains, the DR planned to build a generating station adjacent to its Walham Green station (now Fulham Broadway).Badsey-Ellis 2005, pp. 70–71. The bill received assent on 6 August 1897 as the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1897. =Great Northern and Strand Railway, 1898= B&PCR;, GN&SR; and DR deep-level routes, 1898 In November 1898 the Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN&SR;) was announced as a tube railway, to run from Wood Green to Stanhope Street, north of the Strand. The GN&SR; was backed by the Great Northern Railway (GNR), the main line railway operating from King's Cross station. The GNR saw the new company as a means of relieving congestion on its route. The GN&SR; was to run beneath the GNR's main line from Wood Green station (now Alexandra Palace) to Finsbury Park station. It was then planned to run south- west through Holloway to King's Cross, and then south to Bloomsbury and Holborn. Intermediate stations were planned at the GNR's Hornsey, Harringay and Finsbury Park stations, and at Holloway, York Road, King's Cross, Russell Square and Holborn.Badsey-Ellis 2005, p. 77. A power station was planned next to the GNR's tracks at Gillespie Road. When the London County Council planned the construction of Kingsway and Aldwych, Stanhope Street was scheduled for demolition so the southern terminus was relocated to the junction of the two new roads. The bill was enacted on 1 August 1899 as the Great Northern and Strand Railway Act, 1899. Search for finance, 1896–1903 Although the three companies had permission to construct their railways, they still had to raise the capital for the construction works in a competitive market. Financier Charles Yerkes' consortium bought the DR, the B&PCR;, and the GN&SR; in 1901. By 1899, there were five other tube railway companies with permission to construct railways that were raising funds – the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&WR;), the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE&HR;), the Great Northern and City Railway (GN&CR;), the Central London Railway (CLR) and the City and Brixton Railway. The already operating City & South London Railway (C&SLR;) was also looking for money for extensions to its existing route and numerous other proposed, but unapproved underground railway companies were also seeking investors. Foreign investors came to the rescue of the DR, B&PCR; and GN&SR;: American financier Charles Yerkes, who had been lucratively involved in the development of Chicago's tramway system in the 1880s and 1890s, saw the opportunity to make similar investments in London. In March 1901 he and his backers purchased a majority of the shares of the DR and, in September 1901, took over the B&PCR; and the GN&SR.; With the companies under his control, Yerkes established the UERL to raise funds to build the tube railways and to electrify the DR. The UERL was capitalised at £5 million with the majority of shares sold to overseas investors. Further share issues followed, which raised a total of £18 million by 1903 (equivalent to approximately £ today) for use across all of the UERL's projects. Planning the route, 1898–1905 =B&PCR; bill, 1899= During the progress of their 1896 bills through parliament, the DR and the B&PCR; established a relationship through a successful joint campaign of opposition to a competing proposal from the City & West End Railway. This was for a tube railway running from Hammersmith to Cannon Street, which would have duplicated parts of the DR's and the B&PCR;'s approved routes.Badsey-Ellis 2005, pp. 73–74. In late 1898, this common interest led to the purchase of the B&PCR; by the DR. In November 1898 a bill for the B&PCR; was announced, which sought permission for short extensions at each end of its route: at its eastern end, from Piccadilly Circus to Cranbourn Street and, at the western end, connections between the B&PCR;'s tunnels and those of the DR's deep tube line.Badsey-Ellis 2005, p. 85. Parliament rejected the eastern extension, but permitted the connection between the two lines and approved a capital injection from the DR into the B&PCR.; The bill received royal assent on 9 August 1899 as the Brompton & Piccadilly Circus Railway (Extensions) Act, 1899. =DR and B&PCR; bills, 1900= In November 1899 the DR published a notice of a bill for the 1900 parliamentary session. The company was still unable to proceed with the construction of its proposed deep line, and the new bill included provisions for extensions of time for this line and for those of the B&PCR.; The bill included construction and operation of the power station at the Lots Road site previously chosen by the B&PCR.; The B&PCR; also published notice for a bill requesting an extension of time, but this was later withdrawn and the extension request in the DR bill was used. The time extensions were granted in the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1900, which received assent on 6 August 1900. =B&PCR; bill, 1901= B&PCR;, GN&SR; and DR deep-level routes, 1901 In November 1900 the B&PCR; published a notice of a bill for the 1901 session, in which it sought permission for two extensions. The first, eastward, took a more northerly route than the rejected 1899 extension to Cranbourn Street: it was to run via Shaftesbury Avenue, Hart Street (now Bloomsbury Way), Bloomsbury Square, Theobalds Road and Rosebery Avenue, to Angel, Islington where it terminated under Islington High Street. Where the line crossed other tube routes, stations were planned: at Cambridge Circus to interchange with the planned CCE&HR;, and at Museum Street near to the CLR's recently opened British Museum station.Badsey-Ellis 2005, p. 96. The second extension took the line south-west from South Kensington, via Fulham Road, to connect to the DR's line south of Walham Green station (now Fulham Broadway). The bill also included provisions for the B&PCR; to take over responsibility for construction of the section of the DR's deep-level line from South Kensington to Earl's Court, and for a further extension of time. The opening of the CLR on 30 July 1900 had stimulated interest in underground railways, and the B&PCR;'s bill was submitted to Parliament at the same time as a large number of other bills for tube lines in the capital. To review these bills, Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor.Badsey-Ellis 2005, p. 93. Only the part of B&PCR;'s first extension as far as Museum Street was considered by the committee. The section to The Angel was held back, pending the findings of a separate committee which was investigating problems of vibration experienced on the CLR. The extension to Fulham was not discussed. By the time the committee had produced its report, the parliamentary session was almost over so the promoters of the bills were asked to resubmit them for the following 1902 session.Badsey-Ellis 2005, p. 111. =B&PCR;, GN&SR; and DR bills, 1902= In November 1901 the B&PCR; published details of its bill for the 1902 session. The extension to The Angel was dropped, and a different route eastwards from Piccadilly Circus was planned. Once again this ran to Cranbourn Street, but it continued under Long Acre and Great Queen Street to meet and connect to the GN&SR;'s tunnels at Little Queen Street (now the northern part of Kingsway) just south of the GN&SR;'s planned Holborn station. The B&PCR; planned stations at Wardour Street, Cranbourn Street and Covent Garden. GNP&BR; and DR deep-level routes, 1902 At Wardour Street station a branch was to leave the main route and head south-east, to connect to the DR's deep-level line east of its station at Charing Cross. Wardour Street station was planned to have platforms on both branches. The south-west extension to Walham Green was retained with minor alterations. The new route was to branch from the original route east of Brompton Road station, which was to have platforms on both routes. Stations were planned along Fulham Road at its junctions with College Street (now Elystan Street), Neville Street, Drayton Gardens, Redcliffe Gardens, Stamford Bridge and Maxwell Road. The route would interchange with the DR at Walham Green before coming to the surface and running parallel with the DR as far as Parsons Green, beyond which the line was to connect to the DR. The requests for an extension of time and for the powers to build the DR deep-level line from South Kensington to Earl's Court were re-presented. As the B&PCR; and the GN&SR; were now in common ownership, the bill also sought powers to enable the companies to merge and for the B&PCR; to change its name. At the same time, the GN&SR; published details of its bill for the 1902 session. The GN&SR; sought powers for a short extension of about from its southern terminus, to Temple station on the DR's existing sub-surface line where an interchange was planned. The GN&SR; also sought permission to abandon the section of its route north of Finsbury Park, and to transfer its powers and obligations to the B&PCR; as part of the merger. The DR also announced a bill for 1902 which included provisions to transfer responsibility for part or all of its deep- level line to the B&PCR.; The B&PCR; bill was again examined by a joint committee under Lord Windsor. The GN&SR; bill was examined by a separate committee under Lord Ribblesdale. The B&PCR;'s eastward extension to Holborn to connect to the GN&SR; was permitted, but the extension to Parsons Green was rejected following objections from hospitals in the Fulham Road, which were concerned that vibrations from trains might affect their patients. The B&PCR; link from Piccadilly Circus to Charing Cross was rejected on the grounds that it involved sharp turns and steep gradients to avoid public buildings in the area. The merger with the GN&SR; and name change were permitted.Badsey-Ellis 2005, pp. 152–153. The GN&SR;'s extension to Temple was rejected following objections from the Duke of Norfolk who owned the land under which it would have run. The abandonment of the route north of Finsbury Park was permitted. The bills received royal assent as the Great Northern and Strand Railway Act, 1902 and the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1902 on 8 August 1902, and as the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway Act, 1902 on 18 November 1902. =GNP&BR; and DR bills, 1903= GNP&BR; and DR deep-level routes, 1903 In November 1902 the newly merged company announced two bills for the 1903 parliamentary session under the GNP&BR; name. The first bill requested minor powers which included the purchase of additional land for stations, and sought minor amendments to previous Acts. The second bill sought permission for extensions east and west from the approved route. The eastern extension was to diverge from the main route immediately west of Piccadilly Circus station, which was to be expanded to have east and westbound platforms on both lines. The extension was then to pass under Leicester Square to a station at Charing Cross. Continuing eastwards under Strand, the tunnels were to cross under the branch from Holborn, with an interchange at Strand station. The line was then to continue under Fleet Street to Ludgate Circus, where a station was to be constructed to interchange with the London, Chatham and Dover Railway's Ludgate Hill station (since demolished). It would then proceed south under New Bridge Street, and east under Queen Victoria Street, to connect to the DR's proposed deep-level line west of Mansion House station.Badsey-Ellis 2005, p. 215. The western extension was to diverge from the approved route at Albert Gate, east of Knightsbridge station. This station was to have additional platforms on the new branch line which would head west under Knightsbridge, Kensington Road and Kensington High Street, with stations at the Royal Albert Hall, the DR's High Street Kensington station and Addison Road. The tunnels were then to follow Hammersmith Road to the DR's Hammersmith station. There they would turn north under Hammersmith Grove and east under Goldhawk Road, to terminate on the south side of Shepherd's Bush Green near to the CLR's Shepherd's Bush terminus. The DR also publicised two further bills for the 1903 session. The first included provisions to formalise the agreement for the GNP&BR; to build the section of the deep-level line between South Kensington and West Kensington, including the deep-level platforms at Earl's Court. The second bill sought permission to extend the deep-level line from its eastern end at Mansion House by following beneath the existing sub-surface tracks to Whitechapel, where the line would connect to the existing sub-surface lines to Mile End.Badsey-Ellis 2005, pp. 216–217. Neither extension bill was debated. In February 1903, Parliament had established the Royal Commission on London Traffic to assess the manner in which transport in London should be developed. While the Commission deliberated, any review of bills for new lines and extensions was postponed. Both bills were later withdrawn by their promoters. The powers bills were approved as the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1903 on 21 July 1903 and the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (Various Powers) Act, 1903 on 11 August 1903. =GNP&BR; bills, 1905= The Royal Commission investigations continued from 1903 to early 1905, concluding with the issue of a report in June 1905.Badsey-Ellis 2005, p. 226. No bills were submitted for the 1904 parliamentary session, but in November 1904 the GNP&BR; announced two bills for the 1905 session. GNP&BR; and DR routes, 1905 The first dealt with the Strand branch: it confirmed the layout of the junction between the branch and the main route at Holborn, and sought powers to extend the branch south under the River Thames to the London and South Western Railway's (L&SWR;'s) terminus at Waterloo station. The extension included moving Strand station to the corner of Surrey Street, and constructing a single tunnel from there to the BS&WR;'s Waterloo station which would be provided with additional lifts to serve the GNP&BR;'s platforms. The branch was to be operated as a shuttle with trains passing at Strand station.Badsey-Ellis 2005, p. 238. The junction layout and short extension to re-site Strand station were permitted, but not the extension to Waterloo.Badsey-Ellis 2005, p. 242. The bill received royal assent on 4 August 1905 as the Great Northern Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (Various Powers) Act, 1905. The second bill again proposed extensions to the east and west, modifying the 1903 plans. In the east, the route was the same as the previous proposal as far as Ludgate Circus. Then, instead of heading south under New Bridge Street and east into Queen Victoria Street to connect to the DR deep level route, the 1905 proposal followed under Carter Lane and Cannon Street to a station at the junction of Queen Street and Watling Street, a short distance north-east of the DR's Mansion House station. The route then followed Queen Victoria Street to Lombard Street where an interchange was to be provided with the C&SLR; and the CLR at Bank station. The route continued under Cornhill and Leadenhall Street to end at Aldgate High Street, adjacent to the DR's Aldgate station.Badsey-Ellis 2005, pp. 241–242. To the west, the 1903 proposed extension from Knightsbridge to Hammersmith via Kensington High Street remained, but it was to continue beyond Hammersmith under King Street, the final station being at the junction of King Street, Goldhawk Road and Chiswick High Road. The tunnels were to continue beyond the final station for a further under Chiswick High Road, to end at the junction with Homefield Road. The loop north from Hammersmith to Shepherd's Bush was dropped; instead a more direct route to Shepherd's Bush was proposed as a branch from the Hammersmith extension at Addison Road. It was to run under Holland Road to Shepherd's Bush Green, with a station being constructed opposite the CLR station there. It would then continue west under Uxbridge Road to Acton Vale, where a depot was to be built on the surface between Agnes Road and Davis Road. To cover the cost of the proposed extensions, powers to raise further capital of £4.2 million were sought. The review of the bill in Parliament was delayed as the Royal Commission was still sitting during the first half of 1905; the bill was withdrawn by the GNP&BR; in July 1905, as insufficient time then remained for completion the parliamentary process before the end of the session. Construction, 1902–1906 Russell Square station, an example of the Leslie Green design used for the GNP&BR;'s stations With the funds available from the UERL, construction began in July 1902 at Knightsbridge, before the formal approval of the merger of the B&PCR; and GN&SR.;Wolmar 2004, p. 181. Messrs Walker, Price & Reeves was the main contractor appointed for the line's construction, with the exception of Messrs Walter Scott & Middleton in charge of the portal at Barons Court.Horne 2007, p.17. Work proceeded quickly, enabling the UERL to record in its annual report in October 1904 that 80 per cent of the tunnels had been completed and that track laying was about to begin. Stations were provided with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style.Wolmar 2004, p. 175. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with dark oxblood red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor.The existing DR stations at South Kensington and Gloucester Road had extensions added in the UERL style, to accommodate the lifts to the deep level platforms. The DR stations at Earl's Court, Barons Court and Hammersmith were rebuilt to designs by Harry W. Ford. The station at Finsbury Park was constructed by the GNR to its own design without a significant surface building. Except for Finsbury Park, where the platforms were close enough to the surface to be accessed by stairs, and Gillespie Road where a long ramp was used, each of the stations with platforms in tube tunnels was provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. The existing DR section between West Kensington and Hammersmith was widened in 1905 to accommodate the new tracks for the GNP&BR.; Works on the main route were largely complete by the Autumn of 1906, and after a period of test running the railway was ready to open in December 1906. As a result of the electrification and resignalling of the DR's surface and sub-surface tracks in 1905, the capacity of the existing route was sufficiently increased that the construction of deep-level tunnels east of South Kensington was unnecessary, and the powers were allowed to lapse.Badsey-Ellis 2005, p. 218. Opening alt=A map, with a title \\"London's Latest Tube\\", shows the route and stations of the new Piccadilly Tube route showing it as a thick heavy line with other Underground routes in thinner lines. The official opening of the GNP&BR; by David Lloyd George, President of the Board of Trade, took place on 15 December 1906. Progress on the Strand branch was delayed, and it opened in November 1907.Wolmar 2004, p. 183. From its opening, the GNP&BR; was generally known by the abbreviated names Piccadilly Tube or Piccadilly Railway, and the names appeared on the station buildings and on contemporary maps of the tube lines. London Transport Museum photographic archive. Retrieved 21 March 2009. The railway had stations at: *Finsbury Park *Gillespie Road (now Arsenal)Rose 1999 *Holloway Road *Caledonian Road *York Road (closed 17 September 1932) *King's Cross (now King's Cross St. Pancras) *Russell Square *Holborn *Strand (later Aldwych, opened 30 November 1907, closed 30 September 1994) *Covent Garden (opened 11 April 1907) *Leicester Square *Piccadilly Circus *Dover Street (now Green Park) *Down Street (opened 15 March 1907, closed 25 May 1932) *Hyde Park Corner *Knightsbridge *Brompton Road (closed 29 July 1934) *South Kensington (opened 8 January 1907) *Gloucester Road *Earl's Court *Barons Court *Hammersmith The service was provided by a fleet of carriages manufactured for the UERL in France and Hungary. These carriages were built to the same design used for the BS&WR; and the CCE&HR;, and operated as electric multiple unit trains without the need for separate locomotives. Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates at each end of cars; these gates were operated by Gate-men who rode on an outside platform and announced station names as trains arrived. The design became known on the Underground as the 1906 stock or Gate stock. Trains for the line were stabled at the Lillie Bridge Depot in West Kensington.Trains entered and exited the depot via a loop from the eastbound DR line to the east of West Kensington station. Co- operation and consolidation, 1906–1913 Despite the UERL's success in financing and constructing the railway in only seven years, its opening did not bring the financial success that had been expected. In the Piccadilly Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 26 million passengers, less than half of the 60 million that had been predicted during the planning of the line.Wolmar 2004, p. 191. The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be similarly over-optimistic, as did the projected figures for the newly electrified DR – in each case, numbers achieved only around fifty per cent of their targets. Pamphlet promoting the line from 1906 The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly due to competition between the tube and sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took a large number of passengers away from the trains. The problem was not limited to the UERL; all of London's seven tube lines and the sub-surface DR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to some degree. The reduced revenues generated from the lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the UERL and the other railways to pay back the capital borrowed, or to pay dividends to shareholders.Badsey-Ellis 2005, pp. 282–283. From 1907, in an effort to improve their finances, the UERL, the C&SLR;, the CLR and the GN&CR; began to introduce fare agreements. From 1908, they began to present themselves through common branding as the Underground. The W&CR; was the only tube railway that did not participate in the arrangement as it was owned by the mainline L&SWR.; The UERL's three tube railway companies were still legally separate entities, with their own management, shareholder and dividend structures. There was duplicated administration between the three companies and, to streamline the management and reduce expenditure, the UERL announced a bill in November 1909 that would merge the Piccadilly, the Hampstead and the Bakerloo Tubes into a single entity, the London Electric Railway (LER), although the lines retained their own individual branding. The merger was carried out by transferring the assets of the CCE&HR; and the BS&WR; to the GNP&BR; and renaming the GNP&BR; as the London Electric Railway. The bill received royal assent on 26 July 1910 as the London Electric Railway Amalgamation Act, 1910. This took effect on 1 July that year.. In October 1911, the Piccadilly tube platforms at Earl's Court station became the first on the Underground network to be served by escalators when a link between the District and Piccadilly platforms was created.Wolmar 2004, p. 182.The success of the Earl's Court escalators led to all later deep-tube stations being built with escalators rather than lifts. Where possible, escalators were gradually installed to replace lifts in existing stations. In November 1912, a bill was publicised under the LER name that included a plan to extend the Piccadilly tube tracks westwards from Hammersmith to connect to the L&SWR;'s Richmond branch tracks. The District line already ran trains over this route, and the Piccadilly tube service would provide additional connections. The bill received assent as the London Electric Railway Act, 1913 on 15 August 1913. The advent of World War I prevented work on the extension starting. Post-war, a shortage of funds and other priorities meant that the extension was postponed until the early 1930s. Move to public ownership, 1923–1933 Despite improvements made to other parts of the network, the Underground railways continued to struggle financially. The UERL's ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole UERL group. In an effort to protect the UERL group's income, its chairman Lord Ashfield lobbied the government for regulation of transport services in the London area. Starting in 1923, a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction, with Ashfield and Labour London County Councillor (later MP and Minister of Transport) Herbert Morrison, at the forefront of debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought. Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the LCC's tram system; Morrison preferred full public ownership.Wolmar 2004, pp. 259–262. After seven years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), a public corporation that would take control of the UERL, the Metropolitan Railway and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area. The Board was a compromise – public ownership but not full nationalisation – and came into existence on 1 July 1933. On this date, the LER and the other Underground companies were liquidated.Wolmar 2004, p. 266. Legacy :For a history of the line after 1933 see Piccadilly line The original GNP&BR; route was extended at both ends in the early 1930s. In the north, a new route was constructed to Wood Green, Southgate and Cockfosters. In the west, the extension from Hammersmith approved in 1913 was finally carried out. The extension paralleled the District line's route to Acton and Hounslow, and took over the District line's route to Uxbridge. In 1977, the Hounslow branch was extended to Heathrow Airport. The Strand branch was closed in 1994. Today, the GNP&BR;'s tunnels form the core of the Piccadilly line's route. York Road, Down Street and Brompton Road stations were closed in the early 1930s due to low usage,Connor, pp. 31, 36 and 44. but in the lead-up to World War II the underground passageways at Down Street and Brompton Road were considered useful as protected deep shelters for critical government and military operations. Down Street was fitted out for use by the Railway Executive Committee and the War Cabinet.Connor, p. 33. Brompton Road was used as a control centre for anti-aircraft operations, and after the war was used by the Territorial Army.Connor, p. 50. Between September 1940 and July 1946, the Strand branch was temporarily closed, its tunnels used to store exhibits from the British Museum as well as serving as an air-raid shelter.Connor, pp. 98–99.

Cavendish Bridge is a bridge over the River Trent, connecting the counties of Leicestershire and Derbyshire; it is also the name of a hamlet on the Leicestershire side of the river within the Castle Donington parish. This bridge once carried the main London-Manchester turnpike, though the modern A6/A50 dual carriageway has now been built to the south bypassing the crossing. Wilden Ferry and Medieval Bridges The crossing point and hamlet was originally known as Wilden Ferry and was latterly located upstream of the existing bridge. An earlier point for the ferry was also used and although the exact site is unknown, it was thought to be in the reach of the river between the bridge and Derwent Mouth. In 1310 the ferry replaced the last of a series of medieval bridges that crossed the Trent within this reach. Archaeological investigations in the Hemington Fields quarry, revealed that three wooden bridges were destroyed by floods between 1140 and 1309. During this period the unstable gravel bed of the Trent was affected by a succession of large floods which meant that the river shifted its course significantly during this time, demolishing the bridges and a Norman mill weir as well. Wilden Ferry was mentioned in many of the early Acts of Parliament regarding navigation both on the River Trent and the Trent & Mersey Canal. The Wilden crossing point was used in these Acts, as Shardlow only later grew into an inland port and village on the Derbyshire side of the river. 18th Century Cavendish Bridge { class=\\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"float: right; clear: right; margin-left: 0.5em\\" - !colspan=3 Tolls taken at the bridge by virtue of an Act of Parliament being the same that were taken at the Ferry - style=\\"font-size:9pt\\" ! !S !d - style=\\"font-size:9pt\\" !scope=rowSoldiers (favour'd) 0 0 - style=\\"font-size:9pt\\" !scope=rowFoot Passengers each 0 1 - style=\\"font-size:9pt\\" !scope=rowCows or Horned Cattle per score 0 ½ - style=\\"font-size:9pt\\" !scope=rowSheep or Lamb per score 0 4 - style=\\"font-size:9pt\\" !scope=rowHogs and Swine per score 0 6 - style=\\"font-size:9pt\\" !scope=rowHorse, Mule or Ass not drawing 0 1 - style=\\"font-size:9pt\\" !scope=rowCart, Wain etc. with 2 wheels 1 0 - style=\\"font-size:9pt\\" !scope=rowWaggon, Wain etc. with 4 wheels 1 6 - style=\\"font-size:9pt\\" !scope=rowChaise, Chair with 2 wheels 1 0 - style=\\"font-size:9pt\\" !scope=rowCoach, Chariot, Landau etc. with 4 wheels 2 6 } The delays and inconvenience of using the ferry on what had become a busy turnpike route, led to calls for changes to be made, and the first meeting to discuss the bridge was held at the nearby Old Crown Inn in 1758. The five arch masonry bridge that was subsequently built was designed by James Paine, using sandstone transported down river from the quarry at Weston- on-Trent. It was opened in 1760 and took its name from the patron of the scheme, William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire. The toll for crossing the bridge was the same as that for the ferry, and these were collected until 1888 when the turnpike trusts were wound up. The crossing remained in use until the major flood of March 1947, when one of the piers was washed away and the centre of the bridge collapsed into the river. Modern bridge Following the loss of the bridge, the Army installed a temporary Bailey bridge using the existing foundations, which continued in use until 1957, when the current concrete span was erected on a new alignment to the east of the original London Road. Presently, traffic lights only allow vehicular traffic over the bridge in one direction at one particular time. The toll house which survived the collapse of the bridge, was subsequently removed when the remains of the old crossing was demolished in 1960, although the slate plaque inscribed with the toll charges was retained and relocated on the approach to the new bridge.

The history of Nagpur, in central India, spans over 5,000 years, including the Kingdom of Nagpur in the 18th and 19th century. Human existence around present-day Nagpur city (in Maharashtra, India) can be traced back 3,000 years to the 8th century BC. Menhir burial sites at Drugdhamna (near Mhada colony) indicate megalithic culture existed around Nagpur and is still followed in present times. The first a reference to the name \\"Nagpur\\" is found in a 10th-century copper-plate inscription discovered at Devali in the neighbouring Wardha district. The inscription is a record of grant of a village situated in the visaya (district) of Nagpura-Nandivardhana during time of Rastrakuta king Krsna III in the Saka year 862 (940 CE).Nandivardhana, which was well known as an ancient capital of the Vakatakas, is now represented by the village Nandardhan, about three miles (5 km) from the temple town of Ramtek. Inscription found at Ramtek show that during the 12th century AD Nagpur and its surrounding regions formed the part of the thickly wooded country called Jhadimandala under Yadavas of Devagiri.[http://www.nagpuronline.com/history > However, tradition ascribes the founding of Nagpur to Bakht Buland Shah, a prince of the Gond kingdom of Deogarh in the Chhindwara district. In 1743, the Maratha leader Raghoji Bhonsale of Vidarbha established himself at Nagpur, after conquering the territories of Deogarh, Chanda and Chhattisgarh by 1751. After Raghoji's death in 1755, his son and successor Janoji was forced to acknowledge the effective supremacy of the Maratha Peshwa of Pune in 1769. Regardless, the Nagpur state continued to grow. Janoji's successor Mudhoji I Bhonsale (d. 1788) came to power in 1785 and bought Mandla and the upper Narmada valley from the Peshwa between 1796 and 1798, after which Raghoji II Bhonsale (d. 1816) acquired Hoshangabad, the larger part of Saugor and Damoh. Under Raghoji II, Nagpur covered what is now the east of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, and parts of Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. In 1803 Raghoji II joined the Peshwas against the British in the Second Anglo-Maratha War. The British prevailed, and Raghoji was forced to cede Cuttack, Sambalpur, and part of Berar. After Raghoji II's death in 1816, his son Parsaji was deposed and murdered by Mudhoji II Bhonsale. Despite the fact that he had entered into a treaty with the British in the same year, Mudhoji joined the Peshwa in the Third Anglo-Maratha War in 1817 against the British, but was forced to cede the rest of Berar to the Nizam of Hyderabad, and parts of Saugor and Damoh, Mandla, Betul, Seoni and the Narmada valley to the British after suffering a defeat at Sitabuldi in modern-day Nagpur city. The Sitabuldi fort was the site of a fierce battle between the British and the Bhonsale of Nagpur in 1817. The battle was a turning point as it laid the foundations of the downfall of the Bhonsales and paved the way for the British acquisition of Nagpur city. Mudhoji was deposed after a temporary restoration to the throne, after which the British placed Raghoji III Bhonsale the grandchild of Raghoji II, on the throne. During the rule of Raghoji III (which lasted till 1853), the region was administered by a British resident. In 1854 the British annexed Nagpur, after Raghoji III had died some months before without leaving an heir. Central Provinces and Berar, 1903. Princely states are shown in yellow. In 1861, the Nagpur Province (which consisted of the present Nagpur region, Chhindwara, and Chhattisgarh and existed from 1854 to 1861) became part of the Central Provinces and came under the administration of a commissioner under the British central government, with Nagpur as its capital. Tata Group started the country's first textile mill at Nagpur, formally known as Central India Spinning and Weaving Company Ltd. The company was popularly known as \\"Empress Mills\\" as it was inaugurated on 1 January 1877, the day Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India. Hislop college was the first and foremost college in Nagpur and it was established in 1846. In June 1885, the second college in Nagpur was established, the Morris College, Nagpur, and it was the first government college. All Saints Cathedral is the first Anglican Church. Bishop Cotton School is the first school which was established by Anglicans in Nagpur. References are to be found in The History Of All Saints Cathedral. Berar was added in 1903. Political activity in Nagpur during India's freedom struggle included hosting of two annual sessions of the Indian National Congress. The Non-cooperation movement was launched in the Nagpur session of 1920. In August 1923, the University of Nagpur was established by the education department of Central Province Government. In 1925, K. B. Hedgewar founded RSS, a Hindu nationalist organization in Nagpur with an idea of creating a Hindu nation. After Indian Independence in 1947, Central Provinces and Berar became a province of India, and in 1950 became the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, again with Nagpur as its capital. However, when the Indian states were reorganized along linguistic lines in 1956, the Nagpur region and Berar were transferred to Bombay state, which in 1960 was split between the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. At a formal public ceremony on 14 October 1956 in Nagpur, B. R. Ambedkar along with his supporters converted to Buddhism starting Dalit Buddhist movement which is still active.

She departed New Orleans 6 August, steamed via the Panama Canal and the Marshall Islands, and arrived Cebu, Philippines, 23 September. Assigned to Service Squadron 8, she operated in the Philippines until 19 November when she departed Tacloban, Leyte, for Australia. During the next month she loaded cargo at Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane before sailing 17 December with provisions for occupation troops in Korea. Steaming via Okinawa, she reached Jinsen 7 January 1946; then sailed for Japan 25 January. She arrived Yokosuka on 30 January, was decommissioned 16 February, and transferred to the US Army. US Army service Hennepin was operated by the US Army for the Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Japan until 1 July 1950 when she was reacquired by the Navy. After refitting at Mitsubishi Shipyard, Kobe, Japan, she was assigned to the MSTS 28 February 1951 and designated T-AK 187. Korean War support Manned by a civilian crew, she participated in the Korean supply run during the American effort to repel Communist aggression in South Korea. Operating primarily out of Moji and Sasebo, Japan, she transported vital military cargo to American-held Korean ports during the remainder of the Korean War. Post- Korean War support Following the 1953 Armistice in Korea, Hennepin continued supply runs between Japan and South Korea. In response to the scheduled transfer of North Vietnam to Communist control, she departed Yokohama 30 August 1954 to provide support for Operation Passage to Freedom. She arrived Haiphong, North Vietnam, 7 September, and for more than 3 months she transported cargo southward to St. Jacques and Saigon. After completing three runs to Saigon, she departed St. Jacques for Japan 22 December and arrived Sasebo 3 January 1955. Between 1955 and 1958 Hennepin remained in the Far East, supporting America's determination to keep the peace and contain Communism in Asia. She continued to operate primarily between Japanese and South Korean ports, but cargo runs in 1957 and 1958 again sent her to Southeast Asia. Between 13 May and 3 July 1957 she operated out of Saigon and Bangkok, Thailand, and in addition steamed to Karachi, Pakistan, and Bahrain Island in the Persian Gulf. During September 1957 and April 1958 she steamed out of Yokohama, carrying cargo to Saigon.

Published in September 2006 by John Wiley & Sohns, Inc., it is based on the regular feature of the same title prominent in MSNBC's week-nightly television program Countdown with Keith Olbermann, in which Olbermann castigates those whose words or deeds have offended him. The book contains transcripts of the show's \\"Worst Person\\" segments from its inception in July 2005 to May 31, 2006, as well as some original \\"awards\\", including an \\"Honorary Worst\\" to President George W. Bush (later given several regular \\"worsts\\" on the program) and a special \\"Worst in Show\\" to Olbermann's staple target, rival news commentator Bill O'Reilly. In the book's introduction Olbermann credits the comedy team of Bob and Ray for inspiring the segment's title. Their \\"Worst Person in the World\\" (W.P.I.T.W. for short) was an \\"ominous character\\" who spoke only in \\"crunching and slurping sound effects\\" and consumed sandwiches without removing their wax paper covering. According to Olbermann, this character was inspired by theater critic John Simon, who was unimpressed with Bob and Ray's 1970 Broadway show. When New York Times television critic Alessandra Stanley gave Olbermann's fellow MSNBC commentator Tucker Carlson's show an unfavorable review in June 2005, the Bob and Ray character came to mind and with it the idea for the Countdown segment.NBC News References 2006 non-fiction books Books about George W.

He was a member of Worthing Council in West Sussex, having been one of the first councillors when Worthing was newly incorporated as a Borough in 1890 and was Mayor of Worthing twice from 1906-08. He was also an Alderman of the Borough.The Times, 16.1.11 In 1907, during his mayoral term, he formally welcomed General William Booth of the Salvation Army to Worthing. He recalled that during the days when the Salvation Army was first campaigning there in the mid-1880s, it was deeply unpopular because of all the undesirables who were attracted to its banner for moral and physical sustenance. He told General Booth that he had himself hidden two Salvationists from the hostile crowds for two weeks.http://www1.salvationarmy.org.uk/uki%5Cwww_uki.nsf/stc-vw- sublinks/7C3B99EB1C807E318025728D0074AC0A?openDocument Parliamentary candidate Linfield stood for Parliament at the general election of December 1910 as the Liberal candidate in Horncastle in Lincolnshire but he was defeated by 524 votes by the sitting Conservative MP Lord Willoughby d’ Eresby, who had held Horncastle at each election since 1895.The Times, 26.12.10 Linfield was soon given another chance at Horncastle however when, only days after the general election, Lord Willoughby succeeded to the peerage on the death of his father, Lord Ancaster. Linfield was formally re-adopted as Liberal candidate on 5 January 1911The Times, 6.1.11 in opposition to the new Conservative candidate Captain Archibald Weigall, who had fought the nearby seat of Gainsborough at the December 1910 general election. The by-election was called for 16 February 1911 but Linfield was not expected to win, given the Unionist hold on the seat in recent times and an analysis of the past results and new voters on the roll enabled the correspondent of The Times to forecast correctly that the Unionists would hold the seat.The Times, 15.2.11 The result Member of Parliament Linfield does not seem to have stood for election at the 1918 United Kingdom general election but in 1922 he was the Liberal candidate in Mid Bedfordshire. He won the seat with a majority of 2,737 over the sitting Unionist MP Max Townley.The Times, 18.10.24 In the 1923 general election, Linfield faced a three-cornered contest with a Labour candidate also standing.The Times, 27.11.23 Linfield had his majority cut to 2,023 but he described the Labour candidate, Robert Widgell, as a Free Trader like himself and claimed that Widgell had just taken votes which would otherwise have gone to him.The Times, 28.12.23 Empire interests Linfield took a strong interest in questions relating to the British Empire and in particular to the development of the Colonial Territories. He had travelled abroad privately and had visited the British colonies in West Africa.The Times, 15.8.24 In 1924 he was appointed as a Member of the East African Parliamentary Commission. He accompanied the other members of the Commission to Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, looking into the condition of the Colonies, their government, trade, infrastructure and social arrangements. The report of the Parliamentary Commission was published in May 1925 and various proposals for development and reform were put forward. However the Commission never questioned the colonial status quo, or the role or predominance of white settlers, endorsing their ‘civilizing mission’ and approving the continuing administration of the territories, holding them in trusteeship for the natives (sic).The Times, 8.5.25 They also gave tacit approval for the continued development of the Highlands of Kenya as an increasingly white colony with, what they described as, \\"....a distinctive type of British civilisation\\".Carl Gustav Rosberg & John Cato Nottingham, The Myth of \\"Mau Mau\\": Nationalism in Kenya; published by Praeger, for the Hoover Institution, 1966: P88 Linfield also wrote a 13 page supplementary memorandum to the report in which he proposed the setting up of an Imperial Development Board.Robert René Kuczynski, Demographic Survey of the British Colonial Empire; Oxford University Press, 1948 p633 & Rudolf von Albertini, Decolonization: The Administration and Future of the Colonies, 1919-1960, Doubleday, 1971 p103 He followed this up with an article in the Contemporary Review of March 1926 on ‘Empire Development’.The Times, 1.3.26  1924 general election Linfield was away on this Parliamentary mission in Africa when the 1924 general election was called. He campaigned by telegraph appealing to his electors from Uganda that he hoped they would stand by him while he was away on Empire business. He also called on the Tories not to oppose him while he was doing his Imperial duty but the Conservatives rightly believed they had a good chance of winning Mid Bedfordshire this time and refused to stand their candidate down. The Labour party, whose government had sent Linfield to East Africa, did however agree not to stand a candidate, as they had in 1923 but despite the contest reverting to a straight fight with the Tory, Linfield lost by 961 votes.The Times, 9.5.29 Parliamentary candidate again In 1926, Linfield was adopted as Liberal candidate for the Howdenshire Division of Yorkshire for a by-election following the resignation of the sitting Conservative Lt.

Jackson had been unopposed at the general elections of 1923 and 1924. Linfield came second, nearly 4000 votes behind the victorious Tory Major William Carver, with the Labour candidate losing his deposit. Linfield seemed prepared to try to get back into Parliament.

The Forest of Halatte is still a source of oak and beech timber. The forest, a fragment separated from the ancient Silva Cotia (forêt de Cuise) cited in the 6th century CE, which became the Forest of Compiègne, bears numerous traces of its prehistoric habitation, in the form of menhirs and dolmens and late Iron Age burials.Pierre Durvin, 1963.

He leaves his home, Auror, a village in an unspecified eastern European country, after the sawmill he works at closes down. Soon after, he travels to London to find work so he can make money send to his mother, his 5-year-old daughter, Maya, and his best friend. He finds his first job at a Muslim kebab-shop, before washing dishes at a five-star restaurant named GK Ashe. Along the way, Lev meets a translator from his home country named Lydia, a divorced Irish plumber named Christy, a young chef named Sophie, and a rich old woman named Ruby. Reception The author won an Orange Broadband Prize for this novel.Times Online Liesl Schillinger, of The New York Times, reviewed the book saying, \\"A less disciplined and agile author might have been tempted to ease Lev’s transition from daydreamer to doer. Or she might have jollied Lev into a toque at London’s River Café and set Rudi up as a chauffeur on Belisha Road. But Rose Tremain is in the business of inventing not so much fantasies as alternate realities. In “The Road Home,” she lets Lev in on her secret: “Don’t think about Auror down there in the darkness. Don’t think about the past.” The present is also a work of imagination\\".The New York Times The Guardian review said, \\"Tremain clearly enjoys observing wealthy Londoners, their vapidity, their selfishness, through Lev's eyes - and also more cheerfully enjoys describing the busy workings of a kitchen in a high-end restaurant. She recounts in succulent detail several of the meals Lev produces as he begins to hone his own culinary skills. Strangely, it is not until near the end that we are given the dishes particular to Lev's country (rabbit with juniper berries, seaweed ravioli)\\".Guardian References External links *Telegraph *Courant *The Independent *The Sydney Morning Herald English novels 2008 British novels Women's Prize for Fiction-winning works Chatto & Windus books ","title":"The Road Home (novel)"},{"id":"19193466","text":"Yizhar Cohen (, born August 12, 1962), also known as Izhar Cohen, is an Israeli paralympic swimmer.

In June 2009, drummer Mitsuru temporarily left the band due to injuries. THE EIGHT used a support drummer, Jun, until drummer Mitsuru returned in August 2009, the band's fifth anniversary. On December 24, 2009, the announcement was made that the band would disband after their live show on January 17, 2010. Since then, guitarist Nachi and drummer Mitsuru have become members for Japanese punk rock band The Piass, and bassist Mukku also played as a support member for The Piass in 2010. Kyotaro briefly joined Japanese band Kanabun on guitar in 2010, and formed the band Cockroach in 2011. Nachi, Mukku and Mitsuru have also formed a new band, Haze, similar to eight.

In 1931 he went to the School of Medicine and Dentistry at the University of Rochester in New York where he pursued his interest in toxicology, which included researching fluoride and dental fluorosis. At that time, the government and medical associations were invested in fluoride removal from water supplies because of the incidence of dental fluorosis in communities with high levels of naturally occurring calcium fluoride, and the adverse health impacts from industrial air pollution involving fluoride. Dr. Hodge was chosen to head the United States Atomic Energy Commission's (AEC) Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology,with the help of Dr. K.L.Shourie (the AEC was the successor to the Manhattan Project), where he studied the effects of the inhalation of uranium and beryllium through the \\"Rochester Chamber\\".Morrow PE et al.

He attended a meeting where the experiments were planned in 1945, and an AEC memo thanks Hodge for his planning and suggestions in the experiment. The US government settled with the victims' families, paying $400,000 per family. Seven victims were injected with material smuggled into a hospital secretly through a tunnel.

Hodge is also singled out by BBC journalist Christopher Bryson in his book The Fluoride Deception as having played a key role in promoting the implementation of water fluoridation in the U.S., from which the water fluoridation controversy stems. Hodge's position on the Manhattan Project was connected with his knowledge of fluoride from his tenure at the School of Medicine and Dentistry in Rochester, New York.

Over time they have adapted from improvised, wool uniforms to mass-produced team brands made from polyester. The official supplier for Major League Baseball uniforms is Nike, who has held the contract since 2020.  Uniforms   Early days  The Cincinnati Red Stockings (here pictured in 1882) popularized the adoption of sock color as the explicit identity of the club The official rules of Major League Baseball require that all players on a team wear matching uniforms, although this rule was not enforced in the early days. Originally, teams were primarily distinguished by the colors of their stockings and the success of the Cincinnati Red Stockings popularized the adoption of sock color as the explicit identity of the club. The 1876 Chicago White Stockings actually wore caps of different colors. In 1882, the National League assigned stocking colors to the member clubs: red for Boston, white for Chicago, grey for Buffalo, blue for Worcester, gold for Detroit, green for Troy, and so on. That year, the league also assigned jersey and cap colors, but by player position rather than by club.  Changes  Traditionally, when playing at home, teams wore uniforms that were mostly white with trim in team colors and when playing away, they wore uniforms that were mostly gray with trim in team colors. Aside from the obvious need to distinguish one team from the other, conventional wisdom held that it was more difficult to properly launder uniforms while on a road trip, thus the \\"road grays\\" helped to hide accumulated soil. This convention continued well after its original premise was nullified by the issuance of multiple uniforms and the growth of the laundromat industry. All-time uniforms displayed at the Atlanta Braves Museum in 2009 Starting in the 1970s, with the advent of synthetic fabrics, teams began using more color in their uniforms, notably the Kansas City Athletics in 1963, the San Diego Padres' brown-and-yellow scheme beginning in 1969, and the Houston Astros' rainbow stripes in the mid-1970s. In the late 1970s, the Pittsburgh Pirates began a trend of multiple combinations of differently colored jerseys and trousers and caps (with the options of black, yellow, and white with pin stripes). At one point in the 1970s, the Cleveland Indians had an all-red uniform. From 1976 to 1981, the Chicago White Sox at times had an all-blue uniform, part of a radical style which included a jersey with a large collar, worn untucked – and, for two games in 1976, shorts. In his comedy routine \\"Baseball & Football\\", George Carlin observes that in baseball, as compared to football, the manager is required to wear the same uniform the players do. However, this was actually not true in the early years of the game. Player-managers were common, but non-playing managers whose realm was strictly the dugout often wore business suits, a common occurrence at the time. Retired players who became managers were more likely to continue to wear a baseball uniform (John McGraw, for example), especially if they were also active on the coaching lines; managers often doubled as third-base coach. By the late 1940s, nearly all managers were wearing baseball uniforms. Connie Mack was the last major league manager to wear a suit in the dugout until his retirement in the early 1950s; however, in contrast to the uniform-wearing managers, Mack rarely if ever stepped onto the field during a game; instead he sent uniformed coaches onto the field when a managerial presence outside the dugout was required.  Modern era  Starting in the 1990s, MLB clubs began heavily marketing licensed goods, such as caps and uniform jerseys to the public and this has resulted in a wide array of uniforms for each team. Now, some teams have not only a basic home uniform and away uniform, but also special \\"Sunday game\\" uniforms and uniforms worn only during batting practice and uniforms worn on singular events. From time to time, individual MLB teams have held \\"Turn Back the Clock Day\\", regularly scheduled games in which teams donned uniforms in styles their predecessors wore generations earlier (sometimes called \\"throwback\\" uniforms), or other antique-style uniforms such as those of Negro League clubs. The Los Angeles Dodgers occasionally use the livery of their original identity as the Brooklyn Dodgers, on special anniversaries or occasions, for example such as in honor of the retirement of Jackie Robinson's uniform number 42 throughout professional baseball (on April 15 – the anniversary of Robinson's MLB debut – entire teams often wear 42). In addition, in 1999, MLB staged \\"Turn Ahead the Clock Day\\", in which teams wore uniforms that were built around a \\"futuristic\\" theme, including science fiction references, such as the New York Mets being referred to as the \\"Mercury Mets.\\" Blake Snell (left) and Wilson Ramos of the Tampa Bay Rays wearing \\"Mothers' Day\\" kits in 2018 The result is that it is now often difficult to say which uniform is a team's \\"official\\" one. For example, from 1999 to 2006 the Cincinnati Reds wore a variety of caps: all red, red crown and black bill, black crown and red bill, and all black, but since 2007, only the all-red (home) and red crown/black bill (away) are used. In contrast from the pre-1970s era, in which there usually was just one home uniform and one road uniform (with certain exceptions, such as Oakland and Pittsburgh's complex combinations), today choices of what combination of uniform elements are worn are now sometimes left up to players. In some cases, aspects of the uniform that are considered official are rarely worn, such as the New York Mets' blue home cap, with the orange button, which was rarely seen on the field in the years 1998–2012 in favor of an \\"alternate\\" black-and-blue cap. The Mets added the orange button on their blue caps in 1995. Through 2014, the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers wear uniforms which have changed little since the 1930s – while the Detroit Tigers have worn essentially the same home uniform during that span (only the Tigers, Yankees, Chicago White Sox, and Washington Nationals retain the once-common practice of placing the cap insignia on their home whites, though many teams, including the Nationals and White Sox, do so on alternate jerseys), their road grays have changed more often. The Dodgers (a blue jersey once in 1999) and Tigers (a navy jersey twice in 1995) had worn alternate uniforms in the past, but as of 2010 did not have one (the St. Louis Cardinals didn't wear an alternate jersey until 2013, but since 1998 used an alternate cap, with the distinctive \\"birds-on-bat\\" logo rather than the traditional interlocking StL, for some home games, and also in 2013, with the adoption of their home red cap as their full-time standard, the navy blue road cap was designated as an alternate, worn exclusively against red-capped home teams).  Teams and cities displaying  Typically, home uniforms feature the team's nickname, while away uniforms feature the name of the team's geographic designation. Currently, the Tampa Bay Rays, Los Angeles Angels, Philadelphia Phillies and St. Louis Cardinals are the only exceptions to this rule, although the Cardinals' aforementioned 2013 alternate placed \\"St. Louis\\" on their jerseys for the first time since 1932. These teams feature the club nickname on both the home and away uniforms (since 1900, in 169 seasons – including the Athletics' presence in the city from 1901 to 1954 – the full word \\"Philadelphia\\" has never appeared on a Major League jersey). The Milwaukee Brewers did not display their city name on their road gray jerseys from 2000-2019, and from 2000–09, had an alternate blue jersey with \\"Brewers\\" on the front. They introduced a navy blue jersey with \\"Milwaukee\\" on the front in 2010, but kept the navy alternate with \\"Brewers\\" on the front; both navy jerseys were worn interchangeably at home and on the road for the next 10 seasons.. The Brewers redesigned their uniforms for 2020, with \\"Milwaukee\\" on the front of the road grays for the first time since 1999. From 1973 to 2008, the Baltimore Orioles were part of this group – the omission of the city's name being part of a largely successful effort to attract fans from the Washington, D.C. area – before returning \\"Baltimore\\" to the road jerseys in 2009, by which time the current Nationals franchise had begun playing Washington, D.C. In 2014, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs partially joined this group, carrying one road jersey with the city name and another with the team name, and wearing both interchangeably; in only the third game of the season, one player accidentally played the first inning in the \\"Chicago\\" jersey while the team wore \\"Cubs\\"; the Cubs dropped the alternate road jersey in 2016, leaving the \\"Chicago\\" version as the lone style. As of 2020, only one team wears their city/state name on their home uniforms, the Miami Marlins. From 2009-2019, the Texas Rangers wore their state name on all of their jerseys, but introduced a new uniform set for 2020 to coincide with the move to Globe Life Field which displays \\"Rangers\\" on the white jersey. A number of teams do not display their team nickname on their home uniforms. Instead, they place the team logo or insignia in front. The most famous example is the New York Yankees' classic pinstripe home uniforms featuring the interlocking \\"NY\\" logo. Other examples include the Detroit Tigers' Old English \\"D\\", and the \\"Curly W\\" of the Washington Nationals (the logo was originally used by the Washington Senators). MLB jerseys worn on the field have been made out of double-knit polyester since the early 1970s. The Pittsburgh Pirates were the first to switch when they opened Three Rivers Stadium following the 1970 All-Star Game. The Cardinals followed suit to open 1971, and the Orioles made a gradual change until adopting them full-time for that season's ALCS. Sixteen teams debuted double-knits to open 1972; the Red Sox adopted them after the All-Star Game, and the Giants debuted them at home only at mid- season as well. The final flannel holdouts, the Expos, Royals and Yankees, converted to open 1973. Jerseys have featured an MLB logo on the back collar since 2000, whereas MLB on-field caps have featured an MLB logo on the back since 1992. Until 2007, MLB caps were made out of wool, with a gray underbrim having become common by the late 1980s. (The New York Yankees were among the last MLB teams to wear caps with the previously common kelly green underbrim, only switching their caps to the gray underbrim in 1994.) In 2007, all standard MLB caps were made of polyester, with a black underbrim to reduce glare.  Jersey numbers  Jersey numbers were first used in Major League Baseball by the Cleveland Indians June 26, 1916. The Indians were inspired by football and hockey teams using numbers. The team donned the numbers on their sleeve and only did so for a few weeks as an experiment. Jersey numbers would not return again to the Major Leagues until 1923 when St. Louis Cardinals' manager Branch Ricky decided to add numbers to the sleeves on a recommendation by sportswriter John Sheridan. The team was subject to criticism for wearing numbers on their uniforms by opposing teams and fans. Ricky was quoted as saying, \\"The effect upon the team was bad and ‘busted up’ the team morale or spirit completely. They really didn’t want to show themselves on the field. Because of the continuing embarrassment to the players, the numbers were removed.\\" Jersey numbers fell out of use again until 1929. In 1929, the Cleveland Indians and the New York Yankees both introduced jerseys with numbers on the back. On April 16, 1929 the Yankees opening game was cancelled due to rain while the Indians played, becoming the first team to wear numbers on the back. By the mid-1930s every team in Major League Baseball team were wearing numbers on the back of jerseys except the Philadelphia Athletics. The Athletics later added numbers to their jerseys in 1939. The first jersey number retired by a team was #4 by the New York Yankees to honor Lou Gehrig. In 1997, MLB retired Jackie Robinson's #42 league wide, the first and only number that no player is allowed to wear anymore. As of April 15, 1997 #42 was retired except for players wearing the number prior to it being retired. Mariano Rivera was the last player to wear #42 when he retired in 2013. Every April 15 since 2009 every player, manager, and umpire wears #42 to commemorate Jackie Robinson. April 15 is now known as Jackie Robinson day. Official rules The official rules state that: The Yankees uniforms do not display player names on their uniform backs, as can be seen on Mariano Rivera's jersey during a game in 2013 * All players on a team must wear identical uniforms during a single game. * Numbers: All players must wear their uniform numbers on the back of the uniform. * Undershirt: If the undershirt is exposed then all the players on the team must wear matching ones. Numbers or other devices may be worn on the sleeve of the undershirt (for example, if it is worn with a sleeveless jersey), except that pitchers may not have such devices on their undershirt sleeves. * The league office might require that each team have a single uniform for all games or requires that each team have a single, white home uniform and a single, non-white away uniform. With the elimination of the separate American League and National League administrations, this rule is most often seen in use in the minor leagues. * Sleeve length: The rules allow for minor variation in sleeve length, but they must be \\"approximately the same length\\" and the sleeves may not be \\"ragged, frayed or slit.\\" * No attachments: Tape or other attachments of non-matching color may not be used on uniforms. Pants may not be attached to the bottom of the shoe in any manner. * No images of baseballs: No \\"pattern that imitates or suggests the shape of a baseball\\" may be used on uniforms. Notably, in apparent violation of this rule, several teams have used cap or jersey logos that have incorporated a baseball in their design, such as the Toronto Blue Jays, Philadelphia Phillies, Florida Marlins, Minnesota Twins, Milwaukee Brewers, New York Mets, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Colorado Rockies, San Francisco Giants, and the New York Yankees. However, in each of these cases, the baseball element of each logo is either obscured by another logo element, or rendered so small as not to be confused with an actual baseball. The purpose of this rule is to prevent one team from deceiving the other. (The National Football League has a similar rule, which states that no pattern that imitates or suggests the shape of a football.) * No glass buttons or polished metal. * No commercial advertisements on uniforms. This rule is at variance with many other professional sports. In North America, corporate sponsors' logos are ubiquitous on vehicles and uniforms in motorsports (such as NASCAR, IndyCar, and the NHRA). Outside of motorsports, sponsor logos are increasingly common in leagues such as the Arena Football League, WNBA, and soccer leagues such as MLS and NWSL. Corporate logos on uniforms are even more widespread outside North America, most notably in soccer. The commemorative patches worn by the New York Mets during their inaugural season at the Citigroup sponsored Citi Field did not feature the name of the ballpark in adherence to this rule. However, when the New York Yankees and Tampa Bay Devil Rays opened the season in Japan in 2004, an ad for Ricoh was clearly visible on the batters' helmets. When the Oakland Athletics and Boston Red Sox opened the 2008 season in Tokyo, not only did both teams wear batting helmets featuring the Ricoh ad; but also, the Red Sox featured a commercial advertisement for a New England-based business on their jerseys and the A's jerseys featured an advertisement for Pepsi. Exceptions are made for the manufacturers of the pieces of uniform or equipment upon which they are placed (i.e. the hat manufacturer's emblem may be on the hat). * Names: \\"A league may provide that the uniforms of its member teams include the names of its players on their backs. Any name other than the last name of the player must be approved by the League President. If adopted, all uniforms for a team must have the names of its players.\\" Again, with the elimination of separate administrations for the American and National leagues, this rule is more often invoked by the minor leagues. (Ichiro Suzuki, formerly of the Seattle Mariners, is the last player to have his given name rather than his family name displayed on the back of his uniform, having applied for this permission in order to continue being identified as he had been in the Japanese leagues. Vida Blue also used his first name on the back of his uniform when he played for the San Francisco Giants in the mid-1980s). As of 2010, the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox and San Francisco Giants do not display their players' names on their home uniforms (the Giants did adopt the names in the 1970s, but removed them from the home uniform in 2000); the Yankees also do not display them on their road uniforms. The New York Mets used alternate home uniforms without last names for the 1999 season. The names were returned the next season. The Chicago Cubs did not have names on their home or alternate jerseys for the 2005 and 2006 seasons. The names are now back on both jerseys. The Los Angeles Dodgers did not have names on the back of their home and road jerseys for the 2005 and 2006 seasons. Names returned on both jerseys in 2007. The Minnesota Twins did not feature names on the back of three different \\"throwback\\" alternate uniforms, used in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2018. Another apparent violation of the concept of a \\"uniform\\" is that some players on a team will wear the traditional knee-breeches or \\"knickers\\" while other teammates are wearing the more-recent ankle-length, closely cut trousers. Many clubs do this at both major and minor league level, with no apparent objections. On game days that do not require a special uniform (either by team or MLB request) it is generally (but not always) the starting pitcher for a team that chooses the uniform to be worn for that day's game.

Life Born in Bois de Vincennes, Isabella was the youngest daughter of King John II of France by his first wife, Bonne of Bohemia. Her maternal uncle Count Amadeus VI of Savoy arranged her marriage with Gian Galeazzo Visconti. As her dowry, Isabella received the county of Sommières, exchanged later for the county of Vertus. On 8 October 1360, Isabella and Gian Galeazzo were married in Milan, and six months later, in April 1361, she was declared sovereign Countess of Vertus.

Tradition makes him a Christian missionary of the 1st century, during the Apostolic Age. He evangelized the town of Iliberri or Iliberis (Elvira/Granada), and became its first bishop. He is thus considered the founder of the archdiocese of Granada, established around 64 AD. Elvira’s first bishop, according to the Glosas Emilianenses, was Caecilius. Tradition states that he wrote some didactic treatises and that he was burned to death during the reign of Nero.http://www.elalmanaque.com/santoral/febrero/1-2-cecilio.htm He is one of the group of Seven Apostolic Men (siete varones apostólicos), seven Christian clerics ordained in Rome by Saints Peter and Paul and sent to evangelize Spain. Besides Caecilius, this group includes Sts. Hesychius, Ctesiphon, Torquatus, Euphrasius, Indaletius, and Secundius (Isicio, Cecilio, Tesifonte, Torcuato, Eufrasio, Hesiquio y Segundo). Veneration Sacromonte, a neighbourhood of Granada, celebrates on the first February each year the Fiesta de San Cecilio, when large crowds gather to celebrate the city's first bishop and Granada's patron saint. The fiesta and abbey act as key instruments for the preservation, propagation and dissemination of Caecilius' legend, by which the city of Granada in the 17th century sought to redefine its historic identity, replacing its recent Moorish past with accounts of earlier Christian origins. The legend states that the catacombs of Sacromonte are the site of Saint Cecil's martyrdom, and the abbey preserves the supposed relics of Cecil and eleven other saints' bones, ashes and the oven in which they were believed to have been burned. It also possesses the inscribed lead plaques and books, the Lead Books of Sacromonte, that were found with the supposed relics, but which were subsequently dismissed by the Holy Office as forgeries.

Jean-Marc Ferry (born 5 May 1946) is a French philosopher who is best known for his book Les puissances de l'expérience (1991), described by Paul Ricoeur as \\"one of the most important works recently published in the field of social and political philosophy\\".French Il est grand temps de dire que le livre de Jean-Marc Ferry, Les Puissances de l’expérience, est l’une des œuvres les plus importantes récemment publiées dans le champ de la philosophie sociale et politique... Libération, 12 March 1992 He has also translated the work of Jürgen Habermas, by whom he was influenced, into French. Narration, Interpretation, Argumentation, Reconstruction According to Ferry, the forms of discourse through which identity is constructed are narration, interpretation, argumentation, and reconstruction. P. Smith summarizes Ferry as follows, > Historical and discursive progress from narration toward reconstruction is > associated with increasing reflexivity about identity and the grounds upon > which it is established. Narration, in Ferry’s view, consists of ossified > traditional myths which define identities in a more or less prescriptive, > taken-forgranted way. Interpretation, on the other hand, involves the > assimilation of identity to universal categories like law and justice and is > exemplified in early Christian and ancient Greek thought. Argumentation > opens up claims of identity to rational dialogue as embodied, for example, > in the Enlightenment. Reconstruction, the final step toward reflexivity, > involves hermeneutic attempts to understand the historical grounds behind > the \\"good reasons\\" offered by others in argumentation. This is in part a > logical and ethical consequence of the shift from it to you (acknowledging > subjectivity) which emerges with argumentation itself.Philip Smith > (University of Queensland) Les puissances de l'expérience in, Contemporary > Sociology, American Sociological Assoc., May 1994, vol. 23, number 3. Postnational Identity and Europe Ferry also discusses what he considers to be the building of postnational identity in Europe, a way to think of the European Union as a medium to separate national identity and political identity. The former and the latter are unified in the classical Nation-State, but separated by the process of the building of a new Europe, whose ultimate political identity is not the Nation-State but a Political Community which, according to Ferry, is not a Federal State nor a State in general but an absolutely other form of political construction. This new construction derives from the experience of World Wars I & II, which, Ferry believes, forced the European people to organize their inter-relationship beyond classical models of sovereignty and warfare. The Spinelli Group On 15 September 2010, Ferry supported the new initiative Spinelli Group in the European Parliament, which was founded to reinvigorate the strive for federalisation of the European Union (EU). Other prominent supporters of the initiative are Jacques Delors, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Guy Verhofstadt, Andrew Duff, and Elmar Brok.

The network had stations in Arica, Iquique, Antofagasta and La Serena. History 1966-1995 Telenorte emerged in April 1982, when the Radio and Television Network of then University of the North was privatised, although its original name was Educational Network of the University of the North (Red Educativa de la Universidad del Norte), with a single frequency (Channel 3 in Antofagasta) which started in definitive form on 14 February 1973, although experimental transmissions began on November 11, 1966. In that premiere broadcast, attended by the then rector of the University of the North, Carlos Aldunate, writers Andrés Sabella, Marta Blanco and María Elena Gertner, and sports commentator Julio Martínez, the latter through a program recorded on Santiago's Canal 13. On March 18, 1967, after its experimental tests, at 20:55 Channel 3 began regular broadcasts with an act that was attended by Economy Minister of the Eduardo Frei Montalva administration, Domingo Santa María Santa Cruz. These broadcasts were suspended in April 1969 -due to an agreement with the emerging Televisión Nacional de Chile that would arrive to the city in July of that year- and were resumed on February 14, 1973, as part of the celebrations of the anniversary of the Chilean landing on Antofagasta (part of the Pacific War). In the city of Iquique the broadcasts began on May 21, 1976 and in the city of Arica on June 6 of that same year. The regional network was established in May 1977 and its first milestone was to join the transmission of the first Telethon, which aired in full color. Iquique's Channel 12 conducted experimental transmissions in color between 1976 and 1977, which were captured by some of the few receivers in color and had had a different standard to which Chile later adopted. On 14 April 1978, Channel 3 of Antofagasta and Channel 8 of Calama and Chuquicamata began broadcasting their first 4 programs in color: Nocaut (boxing), Toqui (education), El Fantástico Mundo del Deporte and Show Musical. When the network was created, it began an era of transmissions in deferred with Canal 13 of Santiago, via microwave, broadcasting live, the highest rated programs like Sábado gigante, Martes 13 or sports broadcasts like World Cups and Olympic Games, which previously they were only tape-delayed. Telenorte quickly became the alternative of information and entertainment, with emphasis on regional issues, since through its stations, offered programs and local newscasts. Even with the acquisition, at the mid-eighties, of a truck with microwave transmission system, they could make local transmissions from exteriors, like artistic events and football matches. The last broadcasting agreement between Telenorte and Santiago's Canal 13 was for the 1988 plebiscite, since the following year ended the affiliation contract with the Santiago network because the latter had contemplated reach northern cities by its own satellite signal, which was completed in 1989. For example, in Antofagasta the arrival of Canal 13 took place on July 8, 1989. Alternatively, Telenorte signed a contract with Channel 11 of the then Television Corporation of the University of Chile (today Chilevisión), also from Santiago, which expired soon. In March 1990, with the signing of the new statutes of the Catholic University of North (Universidad Católica del Norte, UCN), Telenorte became a corporation and its first president was Iván Simunovic. Telenorte production centers (red) and transmitters (blue) prior to the mid-1990s. On March 6, 1991 the National Television Council of Chile authorized to start broadcasts of Telenorte in La Serena and Coquimbo, which began on 15 November 1992. In 1991 Telenorte broadcast live matches of the Copa América held in Chile. Later at the beginning of 1993, Telenorte made an agreement with La Red to broadcast most of their programs, putting and end to the agreement with Channel 11 since the latter announced its expansion nationwide in mid-1993, a product of the new owners at the time. All this lasted until 1994 when their original signals coming from Santiago arrived in the northern cities. Finally in the same year, Telenorte signed another contract with UCV Televisión and transmitted few programs of this channel and programs of local production, complemented with certain cultural programs produced by European broadcasters. In 1995, the result of a financial crisis, UCN stopped being the majority owner of Telenorte, transgressing his administration to Radio Chilena SA Company, which became the new owner of this channel. The new company has developed plans for technical intermediation and also boosting local production through its stations. Following this, his studies and transmissions would be closed, starting in Iquique, Antofagasta and then finally in La Serena, leaving only his studies in Arica from 1998 to 2001, the year closed the channel. Arica signal (VHF Frequency 10) was only for this city, while the Iquique (VHF Frequency 12) it was also for Pozo Almonte, Pica and Camiña (4 VHF frequency). The Antofagasta signal was relayed in Tocopilla -city in which began broadcasting on September 9, 1983- María Elena, Pedro de Valdivia (VHF frequency 5), Calama, Chuquicamata (VHF frequency 8), San Pedro de Atacama, Ollagüe (frequency 12 VHF) -which arrived in May 1984-, and Copiapó (VHF frequency 5). The sign of La Serena and Coquimbo (VHF frequency 5) was only for these two cities. Along with the television station, a radio chain was inaugurated on FM stations, called Radio Sol FM. After 1995 In 1995, Universidad Católica del Norte ceased to be owner and when ownership passed into the hands of Compañía Radio Chilena S.A. The network entered into bankruptcy, closing studios in Iquique in 1996, La Serena in 1997, Antofagasta in 1998. The Arica station closed in 2001, ending the network. On December 31, 2001 UCV TV took over Telenorte, giving the Valparaíso station coverage in northern Chile. However, the signal was shut down in 2005. That same year, the Telenorte signal was acquired by the company Alfa Tres, owner of Telecanal. Logos File:TVUN Red del Norte.png1977-1982. File:Telenorte 1982.png1982-1995.

The character debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 26 January 1993. Vasquez's screen-test for the role was one of her career highlights. Sarah is characterised as a \\"real good goody\\" female who is \\"very intelligent\\" and she arrives to study in Summer Bay. Sarah's main romance storyline is with Tug O'Neale (Tristan Bancks). Subsequently Vasquez and Bancks became fixtures in the media, as interest increased about the nature of the actor's off-screen relationship. Mary Fletcher from Woman's Own wrote that Home and Away producers were infuriated by the reports because they felt it discredited the show's image. But the actors later denied any romance occurring off-screen. During her tenure, Sarah also dates Nathan Roberts (David Dixon) and he attempts to get Sarah to lose her virginity to him. Vasquez has stated that her favourite storyline for Sarah was an asthma attack because it portrayed the seriousness of the condition. Vasquez later left the series and Sarah departed during October 1994, but the actress returned for guest appearances in 1995 and 2005. Lisa Anthony from BIG! said that Sarah was a \\"quiet\\" character and Justine Cullen writing for Inside Soap said that she was unlucky in love. Two episodes of the serial centric to Sarah's storyline were also nominated for an Australian Film Institute award. Casting Vasquez has said that her \\"biggest breakthrough\\" career wise was her final screen test for the role of Sarah. Actress Ada Nicodemou also auditioned for the role in 1992. She was later cast as Leah Patterson. In 1994, Vasquez left Home and Away to pursue a career in music. But a writer from TV Week claimed that Vasquez discovered that Sarah was being written out after they published the story in their magazine. Character development Characterisation A writer from Home and Away - The Official Magazine said that Sarah is a \\"real good goody and very intelligent too\\". They added that when Sarah arrives to study at Summer Bay High but her father Matthew (Jeff Truman) does not want her to stay. Sarah ultimately ends up staying and living with Ailsa Stewart (Judy Nunn). Sarah suffers from asthma and in one scene she suffers a serious asthma attack. Vasquez told Look-in's writer that it was her favourite scene from Sarah's entire duration. It was a \\"great\\" opportunity for her as an actress because she highlighted that having an asthma attack \\"can be really frightening\\". In 1994, Lisa Anthony from BIG! reported that Angel Brooks (Melissa George) would give Sarah a make-over transforming her from \\"square to sex goddess\\". Sarah's new attire included little shorts, Vasquez told Anthony that her character's style was still \\"daggy\\" because she is a \\"country girl\\" and \\"just so conservative compared to Angel\\". Relationship with Tug O'Neale Sarah's first relationship storyline is with Tug O'Neale (Tristan Bancks). Bancks told a writer from Look-in that Sarah is \\"sweet and innocent\\" type of character. While Vasquez noted that from the beginning Sarah thought Tug was \\"pretty cute\\" and she likes the way he treats her. Tug is characterised as the serial's \\"troublemaker\\" but Sarah sees \\"the softer side of him\\". In the Home and Away – Official Collector’s Edition a writer said that Tug was \\"absolutely furious\\" when he learned that his \\"archenemy\\" Shane Parrish (Dieter Brummer), planned to kiss Sarah. But it was later revealed that Sarah did love Tug and \\"that kiss was only a ploy to make Tug jealous\\".Black 2009, p.28.Black 2009, p.29.Tristan Bancks (pictured) played Sarah's love interest Tug O'Neale.

While Vasquez and Bancks had formed a friendship due to their characters' romance, journalists became convinced that the actors were in a relationship. Bancks told Ally Oliver from Inside Soap that the media often \\"pestered\\" them about the nature of their off-screen relationship. A magazine printed a story that they had admitted they were in a relationship and pictures of Vasquez with her arms around Bancks. Home and Away producers were \\"furious\\" with Vasquez and Bancks because they felt it ruined the show's image. But the pair denied the magazines claims. Bancks told Mary Fletcher from Woman's Own that as they were \\"spending eight hours a day as teenage sweethearts\\" made them contemplate a relationship, but they decided against it. The two characters were involved in many \\"snogging scenes\\" and Vasquez said that she was single at the time which made the scenes easier to deal with. Sarah and Tug's first kiss was filmed during the school holidays. Vasquez said that filming the kiss was \\"quite nerve-racking\\" because there was a \\"circle of school kids\\" surrounding them. The actors were already nervous about the scenes, but having school children watching them made the situation worse. Bancks told Anthony that it was a \\"nightmare situation\\" and found the experience of kissing Vasquez in front of \\"seven hundred thousand people\\" really \\"strange\\". The fans even began to hassle Bancks as they had predicted that his character would be required to kiss Sarah. Vasquez said that working alongside Bancks on the Sarah and Tug romance for six months had resulted in them becoming \\"best friends\\". Vasquez later revealed that it was her first on- screen kiss and the \\"biggest thrill\\" to kiss Bancks. But Bancks said that it was \\"awkward\\" because they kept bumping their heads together. The two characters become engaged, but Sarah later decides to hand the ring back to Tug. Vasquez explained that Sarah changes her mind because \\"Tug's problem is that he's unsure of himself because he hasn't had a good upbringing.\\" But the actress believed that there was still hope for their relationship because Sarah is always there to give him the attention he needs. Sarah offers Tug \\"understanding and makes him a better person\\". Vasquez added that Sarah and Tug are \\"really two different people\\" but their commonality is that they \\"get on pretty well together\\". Sarah also begins a relationship with Nathan Roberts (David Dixon). He attempts to convince Sarah to lose her virginity to him. The scenes formed the serial's annual cliffhanger storyline in 1993.Mercado 2004, p.258. Dixon told Richard Galpin from BIG! that Nathan gets her \\"in the back of my Charger, then I put the hard word on her and go for it\\". The actor did not entirely enjoy filming the scenes because he was too busy concentrating on his following lines. Like with Bancks, Vasquez took Dixon's first on-screen kiss. Storylines Sarah arrives at Summer Bay High to enroll in Year 11 as the school near her father Matthew's farm has closed down. She talks to Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn) and Luke Cunningham (John Adam) but Matthew forces her to return home. After Luke argues the case for Sarah attending school, She begins staying with Donald's daughter, Bobby Marshall (Nicolle Dickson) and her husband Greg (Ross Newton). Sarah makes friends with Damian Roberts (Matt Doran) and shows some interest in him but he does not make a move. Tug O'Neale, however attracts Sarah's attentions and they become a couple. Sarah then meets Angel and they become the best of friends. Sarah's relationship with Tug is met with several dramas. The first of which occurs when Sarah suffers a severe Asthma attack while in the bush and Tug runs for help. Sarah is then robbed while in the city and almost abducted. She is later fostered by Ailsa and her husband Alf (Ray Meagher) and befriends Roxanne Miller (Lisa Lackey) one of her teachers, who becomes a big sister figure to her. Sarah wins the female lead in the school musical arranged by Luke and Roxy but Tug is enraged when he finds out Sarah is starring opposite his nemesis Shane, who has taken the part as revenge for framing him for burglary. On opening night, Shane overdoes a kissing scene with Sarah, resulting in Tug punching him and ruining the show. Sarah is distraught and refuses to speak to either Tug or Shane again. Sarah, now single receives attention from her classmates but they cancel their dates. Angel suspects Tug is threatening them and sets Shane up as a decoy and convinces Tug that Shane and Sarah are seeing each other. Sarah quickly finds out and warns Shane but Tug attacks him. She then confronts Tug, forcing him to see the relationship is over and they agree to be friends. Damian's older brother, Nathan is released from prison and Sarah falls for him. Damian and Tug try to warn Sarah but she will not listen and is convinced Nathan has changed and begins seeing him in secret when Alf and Ailsa disapprove. They are furious when they discover the relationship and ask her to leave. Sarah learns Nathan is behind a robbery at the school and admits she had been wrong about him, managing to patch things up with the Stewarts. Her friendship with Angel takes a dive when she discovers Angel wrote a story which is published in a magazine and finds it is clearly based on her experiences with Nathan. Sarah is angry for a while as she told Angel everything in confidence but eventually forgives her. Following the Year 12 formal, Matthew suffers a heart attack and Sarah persuades the Stewarts to let him stay with them while he recovers. Matthew is keen to get Tug and Sarah back together so they can run the farm but Sarah dashes his hopes and later leaves Summer Bay to attend University after she lets Duncan (Lewis Devaney) wander out into the road while watching him. She returns in April 1995 to serve as Angel's bridesmaid at her wedding to Shane. In 2002, Alf mentions to a newly paroled Nathan (now played by Craig Ball) that Tug and Sarah have since married and are expecting their second child. Sarah returns three years later for Alf's 60th birthday, confirming she and Tug are still together. Reception Anthony writing for BIG! said that \\"quiet\\" Sarah and \\"tough\\" Tug were not an obvious match. Justine Cullen from Inside Soap said that Sarah did not have a \\"lorra luck in love\\". The episodes featuring the climax of Tug and Shane's feud where Sarah is caught in the middle at the school musical were nominated for \\"Best Television Episode in a Serial Drama\\" at the Australian Film Institute awards in 1993.

Early life Bevan was born in St Kilda, Victoria, Australia, the son of Elizabeth (née Fly) and James Bevan. His parents were from Grosmont, Monmouthshire, Wales, and came to Victoria during the gold rush of the early 1850s. He was a childhood friend of Alfred Deakin, the second Prime Minister of Australia; their fathers were partners in a coaching business. On 11 January 1866, Bevan's parents died when the SS London sank in a gale in the Bay of Biscay. He was sent back to Wales after being orphaned to live with paternal relatives. He attended Hereford Cathedral School.Smith (1980), pg 24. Rugby career Bevan played for Abergavenny before attending university at St John's College, Cambridge. Bevan played for Cambridge University R.U.F.C., and while with Cambridge was selected to captain the first Welsh international, against England. The Rugby Football Union insisted that the England vs Wales match be played on 19 February 1881. This was the same day that Swansea were playing Llanelli at Neath in a semi-final cup-tie thus depriving Wales of several players. This was Wales's first international, organised before the Welsh Rugby Union was set up. The players had never played together before, though one player, Major Richard Summers, was selected for Wales on his performances a couple of years earlier for his school, Cheltenham College, in matches against Cardiff and Newport. No formal invitations to play were sent out to the Welsh XV. Two of those expected to appear did not turn up, so bystanders, university undergraduates with tenuous Welsh links who had travelled to London to see the match, were called in to play for Wales. It was a humiliating defeat for the Welsh team and Bevan never played for Wales again (under modern scoring values Wales lost 82-0). A month after the match the WRFU was founded at the Castle Hotel, Neath on 12 March 1881. Bevan later became an Anglican clergyman.

History The Lead Books were discovered in the caves of Sacromonte, a hillside outside the old city of Granada, Spain, between 1595 and 1606. They originally comprised 22 volumes of inscribed circular lead leaves, laced together with lead wire and bound within folded lead covers; although three volumes no longer survive. The books were found together with burned human remains, identified by lead plaques as being those of Caecilius of Elvira and eleven followers, supposedly martyred under the Emperor Nero. References in the books claim that they were inscribed by Arabic-speaking Christians during the Roman period, and deposited with the martyrs' remains. The Lead Books appeared to be written in a combination of Arabic and Latin, using characters that 16th century Morisco scholars claimed to recognise as \\"Solomonic\\" and which they identified as pre- Islamic Arabic. Many letter forms were uncertain, and the texts themselves were cryptic and obscure, so the Catholic authorities found themselves entirely reliant on Morisco translators; chief amongst whom were Miguel de Luna and Alonso del Castillo, who by fortunate chance lived in the nearby Albaicin, and who had indeed been instrumental in the rediscovery of some of the books. One complete book, the so-called \\"Libro Mudo\\", or \\"Mute Book\\", has remained undeciphered and untranslated to this day. As reported by the Christian Morisco translators, the books recorded the prophetic and liturgical teachings of the Blessed Virgin Mary, chiefly addressed through Saint Peter, in which she gave instructions for Saint James the Great and Saint Caecilius to be dispatched on a mission to evangelise Spain, stating her love for the Arabic peoples and language of that land, and promising her particular guardianship over the city of Granada. Taken together, the books may be regarded as a supplement to the canonical Acts of the Apostles (and taken together, are indeed of similar length), but recording an alternative mission history in which Saint Paul does not appear. The Virgin's words had apparently been delivered in Latin, but were claimed to have been translated and interpreted into Arabic by Caecilius. The texts include an explicit reference, in Latin, to the Counter-Reformation formulation of the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception (Mariam non comprehendit peccatum originale), but also employ terminology otherwise closer to Islamic formulae: \\"God is One. There is no God but God, and Jesus is the Spirit of God.\\" A consistent theme is to emphasise Arabic as an ancient language of Spain, Arabs in Granada as the first Christians in Spain, and Christianity as the true religion of the Arabs. The form of Christianity presented is such as to be highly acceptable to Catholics in Granada, emphasising the veneration of relics, the cult of the Virgin, and the priority of Granada as a Christian bishopric, but also downplaying some aspects of Christianity that were most repugnant to Muslims, including the cult of icons, the doctrine of the Trinity, the worship of Jesus as the incarnate Son of God and the use of wine in the Eucharist. The discovery of the books, and the associated relics, proved to be the occasion of numerous miracles that confirmed their authenticity in the sight of the local population and of the church authorities in Granada, and attracted royal support from both Philip II and Philip III. Analysis Early 17th century Protestant scholars in the Netherlands also took a keen interest, but their characterisation of the Lead Books as a blatant fabrication only served to discredit dissenting opinions within Catholic Spain by association with heresy. The Vatican remained highly sceptical of the texts, however, and in 1642 succeeded in having the Lead Books sent to Rome, together with an associated \\"ancient\\" parchment which had been discovered in 1588 in a lead box in the tower of a former mosque in the city of Granada itself. A prolonged investigation by the Holy Office in Rome concluded in 1682 that both the parchment and the Lead Books were heretical forgeries. While the Vatican's condemnation did not implicate any specific individuals, scholarly consensus since the sixteenth century is that the forgers were probably Luna and Castillo, the same two Moriscos who had translated many of the texts. While further discussion of the books by Catholics was officially forbidden, some Spanish scholars continued to maintain the authenticity of the texts through till the 19th century. The Lead Books were kept in the Vatican, but eventually returned to the Abbey of the Sacromonte in the year 2000. The Church authorities in Granada continue to forbid scholarly access however, on the grounds that the official prohibition remains in force. Current studies depend on the various (often partial and highly contradictory) transcripts and translations made at the time of the books' discovery, and on some independent decipherments produced by Vatican Arabists. Almost all scholars now concur with the official verdict and believe that the books are a forgery intended to promote toleration of the language, dress and customs of Christian Moriscos in the face of increasing hostility from the Spanish Inquisition and the Castilian state. If so, this exercise was unsuccessful in its general objective, as it did not avoid the order of expulsion of the Moriscos which was carried out between 1604 and 1609. Both Castillo and Luna escaped the expulsion, as the archbishop of Granada, Pedro de Vaca de Castro y Quiñones, grateful for the immense increase in the prestige of his see arising from the discovery of the relics of St Caecilius, extended his personal protection to them and their families. Many of the deported Moriscos remained convinced of the books' authenticity however, and transcripts continued to circulate within Tunisia, until this practice was forcibly suppressed by Islamic religious authorities there. The authenticity of the bones and ashes of the 12 martyrs was never officially challenged, and they continue to be venerated in the Abbey that Archbishop Castro built on the spot. Hence the legend has acquired a moral function directly contrary to the intention of its presumed original propagators; far from validating the authentically Spanish identity of Granada's Morisco traditions, the legend has served to sanction and celebrate the supersession of those traditions.

The execution was a response to the deaths of two German NCOs. 120 people were arrested and 114 shot, of whom 7 survived. It is considered to be one of the first large scale massacres of Polish civilians by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland.  Background  Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Poland in September 1939. From the start, the war against Poland was intended to be the fulfilment of a plan described by Adolf Hitler in his book Mein Kampf. The main gist of the plan was for all of Eastern Europe to become part of a Greater Germany, the German Lebensraum (\\"living space\\"). On the evening of 26 December, two known Polish criminals, Marian Prasuła and Stanisław Dąbek, killed two German non- commissioned officers from Baubataillon 538. Zbrodnia w Wawrze After learning of it, the acting commander of the Ordnungspolizei in Warsaw, colonel Max Daumesee :pl:Max Daume ordered an immediate reprisal, consisting of a series of arrests of random Polish males, aged 16 to 70, found in the region where the killings occurred (in Wawer and the neighboring Anin villages).  Massacre  After a kangaroo court presided over by Major General Friedrich Wilhelm Wenzl, 114 of the 120 people arrested - who had no knowledge of the recent killings, many of whom were roused from their beds - were sentenced to death. They were not given the opportunity to plead their case. Of the 114, one managed to escape, 7 were shot but not killed and managed to escape later, and 107 were shot dead. The dead included one professional military officer, one journalist, two Polish-American citizens and a 12-year-old boy.Martin Gilbert, The Second World War: A Complete History, Macmillan, 2004, , Google Print, p.36 Some of the executed were not locals, but merely visiting their families for Christmas.  Aftermath  It was one of the earliest massacres (probably the second, after the Bochnia massacre of 52 civilians on December 18) to occur in occupied Poland. It was also one of the first instances of the large scale implementation by Germany of the doctrine of collective responsibility in the General Government in Poland since the end of the invasion in September.Jerzy Jan Lerski, Piotr Wróbel, Richard J.

Soon after the massacre, a Polish youth resistance organization, \\"Wawer\\", was created. It was part of the Szare Szeregi (the underground Polish Scouting Association), and its first act was to create a series of graffiti in Warsaw around the Christmas of 1940, commemorating the massacre. Members of the AK Wawer \\"Small Sabotage\\" unit painted \\"Pomścimy Wawer\\" (\\"We'll avenge Wawer\\") on Warsaw walls. At first they painted the whole text, then to save time they shortened it to two letters, P and W. Later they invented Kotwica -\\"Anchor\\" - the symbol, a combination of these 2 letters, was easy and fast to paint. Next kotwica gained more meanings - Polska Walcząca (\\"Fighting Poland\\") . It also stands for Wojsko Polskie (\\"Polish Army\\") and Powstanie Warszawskie (\\"Warsaw Uprising\\"). Finally \\"Kotwica\\" became a patriotic symbol of defiance against the occupiers and was painted on building walls everywhere. On 3 March 1947, the Polish Supreme National Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals (Najwyższy Trybunał Narodowy) sentenced Max Daume to death. Wilhelm Wenzel was extradited to Poland by the Soviets in 1950 and executed in November 1951. There is now a monument in Wawer commemorating the massacre.

Biography Born on his family's estate, Friedersdorf, near Seelow, district of Küstrin; †he entered the cavalry regiment Gensdarmes at the age of 17 and was promoted to commander over the years. In the Battle of Zorndorf he led his regiment with distinction and was promoted to major. He was even awarded the highest decoration of Prussia, the Pour le Mérite. In the battle of Hochkirch he fought and led his troops with success. Near the end of the Seven Years' War Prussian troops conquered the elector of Saxonys hunting lodge, Hubertusburg, near Leipzig. The castle was given to Marwitz by the Prussian king Friedrich II., together with the order to sack it thoroughly. This was intended to be King Frederick's revenge for the sacking of Charlottenburg Palace by Russian, Austrian, and Saxon troops in 1760, depriving him of his highly beloved collection of antiques. Given the order to sack the castle, von der Marwitz replied to his king, \\"This is unbefitting to an officer of His Majesty\\" (\\"es würde sich allenfalls für den Offizier eines Freibataillons schicken, nicht aber für einen Kommandeur Seiner Majestät Gensdarmes\\") and resigned his commission. Frederick then gave the castle to his adjutant Quintus Icilius, who finally sacked and sold it. Several years later, von der Marwitz won most of the famous Hubertusburg books collection playing cards against Quintus Icilius. Many years fallen from grace with Frederick the Great, Marwitz eventually became employed during the War of the Bavarian Succession as a Major Kriegskommissar with the king's brother Prince Henry of Prussia. Near the end of his life he was promoted to Major General. On the distribution of his parents' heritage he was assigned his family's stately home, Friedersdorf.

He died, as his brother writes, \\"completely insolvent\\", but as an \\"extremely honest and widely tributed soldier, an honourable and very well-educated man of the world, a great friend of literature and arts\\". His tombstone bears the following inscription, engraved by his nephew Friedrich August Ludwig von der Marwitz: \\"Chose disfavour where obedience did not bring honour\\" (\\"Wählte Ungnade, wo Gehorsam nicht Ehre brachte.\\") Johann Friedrich Adolf von der Marwitz died unmarried in Berlin in 1781.

In November 2009, the winners of Android Developers Challenge II were selected after two rounds of scoring by thousands of Android users as well as an official panel of judges. The overall winners of ADC II were SweetDreams, What the Doodle!? and WaveSecure.  History  Android is a software stack for mobile devices that includes an operating system, middleware and key applications. The Android SDK provides the tools and APIs necessary to begin developing applications that run on Android-powered devices. Android Developer Challenge was a competition for the most innovative applications for Android. Google offered US$10 million in prizes, distributed between ADC I and ADC II. All entries were judged by a panel of experts in the fields of mobile devices, cellular telecommunications, software development or technology innovation. Google selected the judges from the member organizations of the Open Handset Alliance, Google and mobile experts.  Android Developer Challenge I  The Android Developer Challenge was first announced in January, with submissions being accepted from 2 January to 14 April 2008. With participants from over 70 countries and a total of 1,788 entries, the ADC was an immediate success, and the Android Developers' blog reported a submission rate of 170+ submissions per hour on 14 April. Developers from the United States accounted for one- third of the total applications while the rest came from countries such as Germany, Japan, China, India, Canada, France, UK, and many others. The entries represented a diverse range of application areas, including games, social- networking applications, utilities and productivity and developer tools. A panel of over 100 judges received judging packets and laptops that were preloaded with all the submissions, for a consistent, fair environment to judge the submissions. After three weeks of rigorous analysis, the judges released a list of 50 first round winners, who were then eligible to participate in the final round. These 50 most promising entries, announced on 5 May 2008, each received a $25,000 award to fund further development. The finalists were then given a deadline of 30 June 2008 to submit their applications for the final round. The competition concluded with the announcement of ten teams that received $275,000 each, and ten teams that received $100,000 each. The entire list of $275,000 Award Recipients, $100,000 Award Recipients, Finalists and Judges can be viewed here.  Android Developers Challenge II  ADC II was announced on 27 May 2009., calling developers to submit their apps to one of ten specially-designated ADC II categories in August. The categories were: *Education/Reference *Games: Casual/Puzzle *Games: Arcade/Action *Social Networking *Lifestyle *Productivity/Tools *Media *Entertainment *Travel *Misc Applicants were allowed to submit their applications to a single category only. The winners were selected after two rounds of scoring by thousands of Android users as well as an official panel of judges.  Eligibility  The ADC II contest was open only to applications that had not been made publicly available through the Android Market prior to August 1, 2009. Additionally, applications that were entered in the ADC I contest were ineligible for the ADC II contest, regardless whether they were winning apps. Similarly, updated versions of applications entered in the ADC 1 contest were ineligible for ADC II.  First Round, ADC II  In September 2009, users of Android-powered handsets that could access the Android Market were able to obtain a special ADC II judging application from the Android Market. With this app, they could download, test, and rank applications submitted to the challenge. Users choosing to participate in the review process downloaded submitted apps randomly and rated them along a number of criteria, resulting in a final score for each app. The results from this first round generated the top 20 applications in each of the 10 categories (200 apps total), which went into the second round. The first round of the ADC II closed on 6 October 2009. The first-round winners were announced on 5 November 2009.  Second Round, ADC II  Voting for the second round opened on the same day and ended on November 25. Android users were able to download the final top 20 applications in each category and evaluate them in the same manner as during the First Round using the ADC 2 judging app. At the end of the voting period, applications in each category were ranked, with the community vote constituting 40% of the final judging score. Along with the public ranking, a team of Google-selected judges evaluated the applications. Their scores constituted 60% of the final score. Google announced the top winners of ADC II on November 30, with SweetDreams, What the Doodle!? and WaveSecure being nominated the overall winners of the challenge. Furthermore, 1st, 2nd and 3rd prizes were awarded in each of the 10 categories.

The company was founded in 2006 in Florida by scooter enthusiasts Leon Li and Daniel Pak, and ceased operations in 2010. During the operating life of the company, Flyscooters' basic business model was to import low-cost scooters from abroad (mostly the Chinese firm Zhongneng Industry Group (Znen)) and distribute them under the Fly brand name to a network of retail scooter dealerships across the United State, providing dealers with warranty and spare parts support. Flyscooters' main marketing focus was the Internet, although the company attended industry events and trade shows and promoted their brand through other PR initiatives .

La Vie is assembled in China and only available from brick and mortar dealers; it cannot be purchased online or drop shipped.http://www.flyscooters.com The strict maintenance and care from dealers mandated by Flyscooters is argued as restricting because alterations to the La Vie may void warranty. La Vie comes in Sea Mist Green, Montego Red, Royal Purple and Cinnamon Brown. It is no longer available in Peruvian Gold. La Vie has locking under seat storage, pop-out passenger foot pegs, both a side and center stand, and a locking forward compartment. It is made from scratch and dig resistant ABS material rather than fiberglass or metal.San Francisco Chronicle, October 2008 Deploying the side stand does not kill the engine which is the norm, and starting the motor cannot be accomplished until applying one of the brakes. The demographic breakdown of La Vie riders is roughly half riders trying to go green and be eco-friendly while the other half is made up of senior citizens. La Vie riders are active on forums, ScootDawg Scooter Forum participate in community rallies, and form clubs dedicated to Flyscooters, like Scooter Squadron. Flyscooters is known for strong dealer support, dedication to customer service and encourages good will and philanthropy that range from teaming with Avon, Massachusetts fire fighters to raise money for a relief fund, to donations to Marlborough School where the La Vie was photographed with actress Jamie Lee Curtis.

He was the organist at Saint-Séverin from 1919–1922 and president of the Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique from 1935-1953. For many years he was a professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatoire and artistic director of the Pathé opera company. From 1941-1944 he was director of the Opéra National de Paris. As a composer Samuel-Rousseau was highly influenced by the works of Franck and Fauré. He tended to be more conservative in style than many of contemporaries but he was a master at chromatic harmony and had a strong sense for the dramatic. His compositions include operas, ballets, orchestral and piano music and songs. His best works are his operas, which tend towards the exotic and are ambitious in scale. Two of his operas, Le Hulla (1920) and Kerkeb (1931), are based in the Orient; with the latter's title role a Barber dancer in a harem. His opera Tarass Boulba (1919), is based on the legend of a Cossack warrior. He also wrote one opera based on the Arthurian legend Le roi Arthur (1903).

It dates from the 13th century with modifications in the 14th and 19th centuries. Opposite the church in the centre of the village lies the Crown Inn public house. The tin at the Cricket Ground is where items such as Cricket ball , Stump (cricket) , Roller (agricultural tool) and Beers can be found, this is a valuable part of the cricketing society of Peopleton In December 2010 the long-established village shop and post office became a community shop, with a legal structure based on the Plunkett Foundation rules. In February 2011 it was featured on an edition of the BBC Countryfile programme focusing on Worcestershire . A tea room was opened during celebrations of the first anniversary of the community shop in December 2011. The village hall and playing fields are on the northern edge of the village. The village hall is home to the Peopleton Scout Group.http://www.peopletonscouts.com/ The village school was closed after the Second World War, and the building is now used as a private residence. The only school in the village is now Bowbrook House School, an independent day school, situated in a mansion at the south end of the village. This house was previously occupied by parish benefactor Caroline Baroness Norton, and later by the mother of Barbara Cartland; in the Second World War it was used by Morgan Crucible to accommodate European Voluntary Workers. To the north of Peopleton the track to White Ladies Aston fords Bow Brook at Barrels Bridge. After the extensive floods in 2007 when a quarter of the houses in Peopleton were flooded, Peopleton Parish Council raised money for a drainage system to reduce the effects of any future flooding. Public transport A bus service operated by N.N. Cresswell links Peopleton to Upton Snodsbury, Pershore, and Drakes Broughton. Pershore railway station is the closest passenger railway station. History The place-name 'Peopleton' is first attested in a Saxon charter of 972, where it appears as Piplincgtun. It appears as Piplintune in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name means 'the town or settlement of Pyppel's people'.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.363. The Worcestershire map in John Speed's Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine refers to Peopleton as \\"Pippleton\\". In the early 20th century the cricket club was founded and has progressed nicely over the last century. Tom Smith now captains the some what ‘undercooked’ Sunday side. Tom is a product of the Kings School, Worcester where he achieved excellence in all his school work. Unfortunately he can’t seem to get this excellence to rub off on the field. Tom also lives in the shadows of his father a prolific batsmen, who has played for multiple clubs and shown his array of cricket talent where ever he has played, something that Tom has failed to replicate. Tom is well settled at Peopleton now as he claim’s ‘he loves to be the big fish in a small pond’ something that other key members of the side my feel is in correct. Hopefully Tom’s Kings school education will pay off and take the cricket club to the next level In 2018 the village was named Cricket Village of the Year by the Ex - England ODI Cricket Captain James Tredwell The Cricket Club has a very famous connection with the French City of Dijon and its mustard , where the notorious club motto Blozzer, Dijon, Wedge comes from. The motto has huge significance for all player members, that much so a Blozzer, Dijon, Wedge Tour was created Notable residents * John Days, Worcestershire cricketer in the 1900s, was born in Peopleton. * Jeremy Paxman, television presenter, was brought up in Yorkshire and Peopleton. * John Snow, professional cricketer in the 1960s and 1970s, was born in Peopleton. * Giles Turberville (died March 1689), a prosperous local farmer, left \\"to the poor of Peopleton 6 shillings and 8 pence\\" in his Will.

It was built by the proprietors of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company who had in 1831 converted from a canal company. The long railway was originally to have built upon most of the line of the canal, but it was eventually built alongside the Salford and Bolton arms of the canal. The Act of ParliamentAn Act to enable the Company of Proprietors of the Canal Navigation from Manchester to Bolton and to Bury to make a Railway from Manchester to Bolton and to Bury, in the County Palatine of Lancaster, upon or near the Line of that Canal Navigation, and to make a collateral Branch to communicate therewith, afterwards known and cited in Acts of Parliament by the short title of 'The Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal and Railway Act, 1831' also allowed the construction of a connection to Bury, but technical constraints meant that it was never built. The railway required significant earthworks, including a tunnel. The railway termini were at Salford railway station and Trinity Street station in Bolton. The railway was opened in 1838 to passenger and freight services. In 1841 it was extended to Preston, and in 1844 to Victoria railway station in Manchester. It amalgamated with the Manchester and Leeds Railway in 1846. The railway is in use today as part of the Manchester to Preston Line, although some of the original stations are no longer in use. History Background In the 1820s a number of proposals for a railway between Manchester and Bolton were made, some well advanced enough to be submitted to Parliament. One, in 1825, was for a line from New Bailey in Salford, to Park Field in Bolton, and included a branch line to the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. The plan included the use of an inclined plane at Clifton to allow the railway to access the higher ground from thereon. Another scheme was to connect with the planned Liverpool and Manchester Railway near Eccles, and would reach Bolton via Moorside and Farnworth. Neither of these schemes progressed beyond the early stages of planning. In 1830 two more proposals to connect the towns were made. The Manchester to Preston Railway was unsuccessful, leaving open the way for the second scheme, which would become known as the Manchester and Bolton Railway. Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal Company London and Birmingham Railway Centenary, 1938 souvenir illustrating the 2-2-0 locomotive of Edward Bury. In 1830 the Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal Company, led by chairman John Tobin, began to promote the construction of a railway along the line of their canal, from Salford to Bolton and Bury. Alexander Nimmo was employed to assess the proposal, and reported that it was possible \\"so far as he expressed himself capable of judging from his present cursory view of the canal\\". The shareholders then sought a bill for a railway from Bolton to Manchester and on 23 August 1831 obtained an Act of Parliament to become the \\"Company of Proprietors of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company\\". The act authorised the abandonment of the canal between the Irwell basin and Prestolee, and empowered the company to build a line from Manchester to Bolton and Bury, \\"upon or near the line of ... the Canal\\". Two branch lines were also authorised, one from Clifton Aqueduct through to Great Lever, and the other from Giants Seat through to Radcliffe and Bury. Due mainly to the objections of local mine owners who would have lost access to the canal and therefore their supply route, and who also would not have had branch railways built for them, the company agreed to an amending bill which would keep the canal and allow the new railway to be constructed alongside it. In 1832 the company obtained an Act that allowed it to build the railway along the new alignment. The Act also allowed for an extension of the railway to New Bailey Street in Salford, and from Church Wharf (the terminus of the canal at Bolton) to Bridge Street. Smaller branches in Bolton and Salford were also allowed. The two differently-sized tunnels at Farnworth. Construction of the railway started in 1833, from Salford. The company attempted to alter the route of the Bury branch, and also to extend it to Rawtenstall, but they did not receive Parliamentary approval for this. In July 1834 the committee of management applied to Parliament for \\"an act to amend the line of the railway between Manchester and Bolton\\". The amendment would take the railway along much the same course as that proposed by the Manchester to Preston Railway and was authorised by Parliament in 1835. Work proceeded so slowly that further clauses were added to the proposed act, including a continuation of the railway from Bolton, to Liverpool. Although this continuation was never built, the Liverpool and Bury Railway built such a connection in 1848. A line from Clifton to Bolton, authorised in 1835, did not materialise. The connection to Bury was never built, due mainly to the objections of the company's engineer, Jesse Hartley. The Bury branch would have required a tunnel on a gradient of 1 in 100, at the time a difficult and expensive proposition. Initially there were to have been three tracks, one for goods and another two for passengers, but only two were built. Work proceeded at a slow pace, in a piecemeal fashion, with contracts awarded for portions of the work as occasion demanded. Advertisements in the Bolton Chronicle appealed to Quarrymen for quantities of stone blocks to support the rails, and for excavators to construct parts of a proposed addition to the embankment from Agecroft towards Clifton Hall. Another advertisement in November that year advertised for tenders for contracts for the construction of bridges, viaducts, culverts and other structures to finish the line from Irwell Street in Salford, to Bolton. A difficult section of the railway was at Farnworth, where a tunnel was required to cut through the hillside. A double-bore tunnel long was built between 1835 and 1838, driven from both sides, with a large vertical shaft in the centre. This was later joined by a narrower single-bore tunnel, through which the down line was routed. Traffic along the upline was routed through the original tunnel. Four acts of parliament were required to raise the necessary funds, and the line opened on 28 May 1838. From a report of the Directors on 9 January 1839, the railway had carried 228,799 passengers since its inception. In 1841 the company had 10 locomotive engines. In 1845 William Hurst took over as Railway Superintendent for the company.http://www.steamindex.com/people/earlynbr.htm A branch line was also \\"to join and communicate with the ... Bolton and Leigh Railway\\", at a junction near the Daubhill Stationary Engine, this line was however, not built. The company later shared their railway, including their station at Salford, with the Manchester, Bury and Rossendale Railway Company (MB&RRC;) and both worked together to construct a junction at Clifton Junction railway station. In 1846 the company was taken over by the Manchester and Leeds Railway,By an Act of Parliament which itself became the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway the following year. In 1922 it amalgamated into the London and North Western Railway, and in 1923 this company amalgamated into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. This company was nationalised in 1948 under the Transport Act 1947, and became part of British Railways. Route A map of the railway and the later Manchester Bury and Rossendale line, including the canal The original terminus was at Salford railway station on New Bailey Street in Salford. Passing through Pendleton, Clifton Junction, Dixon Fold, Stoneclough and Farnworth the line ended at Bolton railway station. In 1841 the line was extended to Preston by the Bolton and Preston Railway. The route northwards to Blackburn followed four years later, whilst the Liverpool and Bury Railway's arrival in 1848 gave Bolton links eastward to Bury and Rochdale and westwards to Wigan and Liverpool. From Salford, the line was extended via several bridges and across Chapel Street, to Victoria Station in 1844. These lines had all become part of the expanding Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway system by 1858. Design The rails were of broad-based parallel form and weighed per . Gauge was . These rails were later replaced with 68 pound per yard (34 kg/m) rails when the former were discovered to be insufficient to carry the weight of the trains using them. Significant earthworks were required along the route, and the tunnel at Farnworth was constructed in favour of a cutting. The tunnels were built through clay, and lined entirely with brick or masonry. Turntables were placed at each terminus. Thirty three bridges were constructed, along with stone drainage facilities to keep water from the cuttings. The railway company was forced to change the design of some of these bridges, as insufficient room was given for the locomotives and carriages on the track to pass between the bridge supports, which were only wide. With only of space between some vehicles and the bridge supports, a report by the Inspector of Railways on 11 December 1846 concluded that they were dangerous. On 19 November 1842 a guard named William Parker was killed on the railway, his skull found fractured, and on 26 July 1844 a guard named James Cook was killed as he leant out and was struck by a support. It was also reported that the distance between rails at these bridges was only , whereas the normal distance was . Locomotive types and coaches The company purchased four Bury Type locomotives from Bury, Curtis and Kennedy,named Victoria, Fairfield, Manchester and Bolton two from George Forrester and Company,named Forrester, and Buck and two from William Fairbairn & Sons. Two further Bury 2-2-0s were acquired by the railway in 1844-45. Coaches were first and second class; each first class carriage held 18 passengers, and each second class carriage held 32 passengers. Third class carriages were introduced on 11 June 1838 but discontinued on 1 December 1838 after the company found that many passengers were vacating first and second class, for the cheaper third class. The company had 15 first class carriages, and 22 second class carriages. Fares and services Initially, first class passenger fares were two shillings and six pence (2s 6d - \\"half-a-crown\\") for the entire ten mile journey, or 3d per mile. This is the equivalent of at least £10 in 2011 values. Second class was 2s, or 2.40d per mile. On 11 June 1838, a new pricing structure was introduced, with first class costing 2s, second class 1s 6d, and third class 1s. Passenger tickets were taken in transit. Freight was charged at a maximum rate of 4.02d, and a minimum of 3d per ton per mile. The first train to use the new line was pulled by the Victoria. It left Manchester at 8:00 am, and arrived in Bolton 26 minutes 30 seconds later. The second train was pulled by the Fairfield. The trains originally ran on the right hand set of rails, an unusual practice in England, however the railway later changed to left-hand running with the connection of the MB&RRC; at Clifton. Ten trains ran in each direction per weekday, and two on Sundays. The journey from Salford to Bolton took about 35 minutes.

It was originally built as a district ranger station for the Fort Rock Ranger District. It was later converted to a summer guard station. The guard station is now closed, but the adjacent campground is open. While still very remote, it is a popular location for bird watching and nature photography. The Cabin Lake Guard Station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  In the 1920s and 1930s, forest road networks were not well developed. To facilitate work in National Forests, the Forest Service built district ranger stations at strategic locations within the forest to house full-time employees and provide logistics support to fire patrols and project crews working at remote forest sites. After World War II, the Forest Service greatly expanded its road network, allowing employees to get to most forest areas within a few hours. As a result, many of the more isolated ranger stations were closed or converted to summer guard station.Jacoby, Jayson, \\"Rustic Forest Service cabins available for rent\\" , Baker City Herald, Baker City, Oregon, 27 April 2006.\\"A bit of History\\", Recreation Rentals of the Pacific Northwest, Pacific Northwest Region, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Portland, Oregon, 12 August 2008. The Cabin Lake Guard Station is located in the Deschutes National Forest forty miles southeast of Bend, Oregon. It was originally built as a district ranger station, and served as the headquarters for the Fort Rock Ranger District from 1921 until 1945. Throughout most of that time, there were five full-time rangers living and working at the site.\\"Cabin Lake Guard Station - OR\\", Waymarking.com, Groundspeak Inc, Seattle, Washington, 2008\\"Archaeologists, Volunteers Preserve Historic Ranger Station\\", Press Release, Ochoco and Deschutes National Forests and Prineville District, Bureau of Land Management Office of Communications, Bend Oregon, 5 June 2006 From 1934 to 1938, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was located adjacent to the ranger station. The existing guard station buildings were constructed by Civilian Conservation Corps work crews during that time. The Civilian Conservation Corps built a total of seven buildings for the ranger station compound including ranger residences, a warehouse, maintenance shop, and a gas station. Six of the seven structures remain today. The seventh building was moved to another guard station after the ranger station was closed. In 1945, the district headquarters was moved to Bend, and the ranger station was converted to a guard station. It was used as a bunkhouse and supply station for Forest Service fire crews that patrolled the surrounding forest during summer fire season. The Forest Service closed the guard station in 2002. Today, the guard station site is unoccupied. However, Forest Service archaeologists are working with volunteers to renovate the guard station facilities. Once the buildings are restored, the Forest Service may open two of the ranger residences for use as recreation rental cabins. Because of the rustic architecture of the remaining six buildings and the site's unique historic value as an early Forest Service ranger station, the Cabin Lake Guard Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\\"Cabin Lake Guard Station\\", National Register of Historic Places, www.nationalregisterofhistoricalplaces.com, 26 August 2008.  Structures  The Cabin Lake Guard Station is located in a very remote area of the Deschutes National Forest near the forest's boundary with high desert public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management's Lakeview District. The guard station is made up of six main buildings and several minor structures surrounded by relatively open forest land. The elevation at the site is 4,510 feet. The forest around the guard station is Ponderosa pine and western juniper with sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass as the primary ground cover (picture).\\"Cabin Lake Campground\\" , Basin and Range Birding Trail, Lakeview District, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Lakeview, Oregon, 2008.\\"Cabin Lake Viewing Blind\\", Bend/Fort Rock Ranger District, Deschutes National Forest, United States Department of Agriculture, Bend, Oregon, 22 November 2004. The guard station buildings are wood-frame structures with concrete foundations. The exteriors are covered with weatherboard. Wooden shingles are used for roofing. All the buildings except one are painted light green with dark brown trim (picture) so they blend into the surrounding forest landscape. One residence is painted a cream color with brown trim (picture). The interior rooms of the ranger residences have pine paneling with a brick fireplace in the living room. Several of the residences still have simple furnishings, including wooden chairs and tables (picture). In addition to the ranger residences, there is a warehouse (picture), maintenance shop (picture), gas station, and several other minor structures that make up the guard station compound.\\"Cabin Lake Guard Station\\" , Archiplanet, www.archiplanet.org, 5 December 2006. There is a Forest Service campground next to the historic guard station. The campground has 14 primitive camp sites. However, there is no water or toilet facilities available at the site. The dirt road leading the guard station can be rough. Two-wheel-drive vehicles can usually make the trip from April through November. A four-wheel-drive vehicle is recommended the rest of the year.\\"Cabin Lake Campground, Oregon\\", Public Land Information Center, Public Lands Interpretive Association, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 14 June 2008.  Bird watching  Bird blind near Cabin Lake Guard StationThere are two permanent bird blinds located within easy walking distance of the guard station. The blinds are located approximately 300 feet apart. They are 8 feet by 12 feet covered shelters with veiled window openings allowing observers to view and photograph birds from a distance of 15–20 feet. To attract birds, each blind has a small concrete basin called a guzzler that fills with water from a nearby storage tank that is fed by water collection aprons. Because Cabin Lake Guard Station is located on the border between the eastern Cascade pine forests and the high desert eco-systems, the guzzler's water attracts an unusually wide range of birds typical of both environments.\\"Fort Rock ‘High Desert’ Terrain...The ‘Guzzler’ at Cabin Lake\\" , Nature Pic's, www.naturespicsonline.com, Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, 8 August 2008.

Retrieved 5 September 2008 The anti-prostitution pledge language in both acts was authored by Representative Chris Smith, Republican from New Jersey. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 amended the AIDS Authorization to exempt the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Health Organization, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and any United Nations agency from having to sign the anti-prostitution pledge. While the language of the legislation does not distinguish between foreign and U.S.-based organizations, the pledge was initially only enforced for the former, as the Justice Department had expressed First Amendment concerns.U.S. Backs Off Stipulation on AIDS Funds, The Washington Post, 18 May 2005Letter from Justice Department to Judiciary Committee , 24 September 2003 In September 2004, a letter from Assistant Attorney General Daniel Levin reversed this opinion, and the U.S. Agency for International Development issued a directive in June 2005 that expanded the pledge requirement to all NGOs.Implementation of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 – Eligibility Limitation on the Use of Funds and Opposition to Prostitution and Sex Trafficking. , (9 June 2005). Retrieved 5 September 2008 A document issued by the CDC in May 2005 sought to extend the pledge requirement to the large group of organizations that receive funding through the multilateral Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (to which the U.S. contributes). This was quickly overturned by US Director of Foreign Assistance Randall L. Tobias. Rationale and reactions In a February 2002 National Security Presidential Directive, President George W. Bush wrote: \\"The United States opposes prostitution and any related activities, including pimping, pandering, and/or maintaining brothels as contributing to the phenomenon of trafficking in persons. These activities are inherently harmful and dehumanizing. The United States Government's position is that these activities should not be regulated as a legitimate form of work for any human being.\\"NSPD-22, 25 February 2002. Quoted in An Administration Priority , U.S. Dept. of Justice In February 2005, a group of non-profit organizations including CARE, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the International Center for Research on Women protested the anti-prostitution pledge policy in a letter to US Director of Foreign Assistance Randall L. Tobias. This was followed by a May 2005 protest letter to President Bush, signed by hundreds of organizations worldwide, stating that the pledge \\"makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to establish the trust necessary to provide services to these hard-to-reach groups\\" and it will \\"exacerbate stigma and discrimination against already marginalized groups.\\"Letter to President Bush, 18 May 2005 This was countered in August 2005 by a letter to the President supporting the policy, signed by over 100 groups, including the Christian Medical Association, Concerned Women for America, Family Research Council, Focus on the Family, National Association of Evangelicals, Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, Sex Industry Survivors, The Medical Institute, The Salvation Army, World Hope International and World Relief. Supporters of the pledge requirement argued that prostitution is inherently harmful and needs to be abolished, rejected harm reduction approaches, and held that legalized prostitution increases demand for sex trafficking. In May 2005, the Brazilian government turned down $40 million in anti-HIV/AIDS funding from the U.S. government because of the anti-prostitution pledge. Brazil's AIDS commissioner Pedro Chequer was quoted as saying \\"Sex workers are part of implementing our AIDS policy and deciding how to promote it. They are our partners. How could we ask prostitutes to take a position against themselves?\\" The anti-prostitution pledge has been criticized as counterproductive, because projects that work with and support prostitutes are often seen as instrumental in fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS. The Brazilian anti-AIDS program, which employs prostitutes to hand out information and free condoms, is considered by the United Nations to be the most successful in the developing world. The Sonagachi Project is a prostitutes' cooperative in Calcutta, India, that supports sex workers' rights and works to stop the spread of HIV; it has received strong positive evaluations from both UNAIDS and the World Bank, and has been cited by UNAIDS as a \\"best-practice\\" model of working with prostitutes.Implications of U.S. Policy Restrictions for Programs Aimed at Commercial Sex Workers and Victims of Trafficking Worldwide, Center for Health and Gender Equity, November 2005 Ronald Weitzer has described the anti- prostitution pledge as a symptom of what he calls the \\"moral crusade\\" against sex trafficking, resulting in a broad attack against all forms of commercial sex acts. The language of the policy juxtaposes the words \\"prostitution\\" and \\"sex trafficking\\"; it has been pointed out that it is important to clearly distinguish between these two concepts, and that all relevant organizations already strongly oppose sex trafficking. Randall L. Tobias, the U.S. administration's foreign aid chief who was responsible for implementation of the anti-prostitution pledge, resigned in April 2007 over allegations that he had used an escort service. Some sex worker organizations and commentators called the situation \\"ironic\\" and Tobias \\"hypocritical\\".The Anti-Prostitution Pledge , Salon.com, 2 May 2007Ex-AIDS chief in escort flap called hypocritical, The Boston Globe, 29 April 2007 The 2012 final report of UNDP's Global Commission on HIV and the Law denounced the anti-prostitution pledge and included the recommendation Lawsuits In response to the 2005 decision to apply the policy also to U.S.-based organizations, two lawsuits were filed, alleging that the policy compels or prohibits speech in violation of the First Amendment, and also prohibits actions that are exclusively privately funded. In the first case (DKT v. USAID), the non-profit DKT International prevailed in District Court but lost on appeal, at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit. The February 2007 appeals court ruling was based on the assumption that the government would allow speech regarding prostitution as long as it is done through an affiliate that doesn't receive federal funding.U.S. Court of Appeals (2007 February 27) District of Columbia Circuit Decision in DKT v. USAID No. 05-CV-01604 . Retrieved 5 September 2008 The second case (AOSI v. USAID) involved the plaintiffs Alliance for Open Society International, its affiliate the Open Society Institute, and Pathfinder International. In May 2006, a District Court in New York issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the government from requiring these organizations to sign the anti-prostitution pledge. The government appealed this injunction to the Second Circuit Court. During the oral arguments in the case, the government stated that it would allow legally and physically separate affiliates to engage in the prohibited speech. The government issued guidelines to this effect in July 2007. In November 2007, the Appeals Court rebuffed the government and let the preliminary injunction stand, returning the case to the District Court. Global Health Council and InterAction joined the case, and the District Court extended the injunction to all U.S.-based members of these organizations in August 2008. The Appeals Court, in a 2-1 decision in July 2011, affirmed the injunction and held that the anti- prostitution policy requirement \\"likely violates the First Amendment.\\" AOSI v. USAID resources, Brennan Center for JusticeAlliance for Open Society International v. U.S. Agency for International Development, Appeals Court decision, 6 July 2011 In September 2012, the Brennan Center for Justice obtained a ruling forcing the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel to hand over the original February 2004 memorandum which had argued that the pledge, as applied to U.S.-based organizations, was unconstitutional. In a 6-2 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that the anti-prostitution pledge violated the First Amendment: the government may not leverage funding to regulate grant recipient's speech outside of the funded program.

English champion and challenger In September 2008 Gethin fought touted prospect John Fewkes for the vacant English lightweight title and forced the referee to wave it off in the 4th round. Fewkes came into the contest with a 17-0 record and with wins over Scott Haywood and Craig Watson on his record but had only fought once in the year and was also having problems making the weight.Fewkes fails to make weight As it transpired he failed to make the weight for the contest meaning that even if he won he would not have lifted the title.

D. Trout (born 1959) is an American philosopher of science, cognitive scientist, lecturer and nonfiction author who holds the Calamos Endowed Chair in Philosophy at Illinois Institute of Technology.humansciences.iit.edu His research centers on the nature of scientific progress, and its influence on human understanding and well-being.  Education and career  Trout was born in Cleveland to a mother of Sicilian and Irish heritage, a member of the WAVES in the U.S. Navy. He attended public schools in the Cleveland and the greater Philadelphia area, where he learned to box, drove a Class 2 vehicle, and flirted with a career in opera. Trout received his bachelor's degree in philosophy and history at Bucknell University in 1982 and his doctorate in philosophy at Cornell University in 1988 under the supervision of Richard Boyd. He taught at Loyola University, Chicago for most of his career until moving to IIT in 2018.Since 1992 he has worked as a professor of philosophy at Loyola University Chicago, where he holds appointments in the philosophy department and the Parmly Sensory Sciences Institute. Trout was a National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellow and a Sage Graduate Fellow at Cornell University. In 1988-89, Trout was a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at Bryn Mawr College, and a Choice Award winner for his 1998 book Measuring the Intentional World. He was a visiting professor at the University of Innsbruck in 1999. In 2005, he was a visiting professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago and a Visiting Scholar at the Graduate School of Business.  Philosophical work  Trout authored a number of experimental and theoretical articles on speech perception, after having begun a parallel career in spoken language processing in his twenties. His work on philosophical and psychological topics often combine linguistics, biology, economics, history and public policy. Measuring the Intentional World: Realism, Naturalism, and Quantitative Methods in the Behavioral Sciences contends that perceptual psychology and cognitive psychology, so often marginalized as unworthy of the name “science,” are emerging as mature fields, and deserve the kind of intellectual weight accorded physics and chemistry. This elevated status was then recruited to support a new version of scientific realism, called measured realism. In 2005 Trout, together with Michael Bishop, published Epistemology and the Psychology of Human Judgment. The book argues that the theory of knowledge, as practiced in the English-speaking world, has become a parochial and scholastic exercise, and should be replaced with ameliorative psychology – an area of psychology devoted to evaluating and improving decision-making. The Empathy Gap: Building Bridges from the Good Life to the Good Society, recruits scientific research on empathy, free will, and decision-making to explain how decent people can ignore indecent degrees of inequality and suffering, and constructs a concrete and realistic vision of policies that improve human well-being. His most recent book, The Empathy Gap, makes the case that a fair and humane democracy in modern times must turn to psychological science to forge policies that correct for people’s natural imperfections.

It is an irregularly-shaped area of between US 9 and downtown Poughkeepsie, located on the slope up from the Hudson River. There are roughly 139 historic buildings, and very few new ones. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Like the Union Street Historic District to its south, the neighborhood remained virtually unchanged from the 19th century when it first began to grow and develop. It includes as contributing properties some listed on the Register in their own right, like the Vassar Institute, Vassar Home for Aged Men (both now home to a local arts center) and Church of the Holy Comforter, designed by Richard Upjohn. At that time, Poughkeepsie was clearing and demolishing many old neighborhoods as part of its urban renewal programs. The historic districts were established to preserve what would not be demolished. Two areas of historic buildings adjacent to the district, on Main and North Bridge streets, were not included because they were meant to be razed as well. But those plans were canceled, and in 1987 the district's boundaries were increased by a few acres to include the still-extant blocks. Geography In its current form the district is somewhat horseshoe-shaped, touching Main Street in two small areas on the south and connecting its two larger neighborhoods via Mill Street in the north. These boundaries were mostly established on the initial listing in 1972. The underlying land slopes up gently from Route 9 to where the land levels off at the western edge of downtown Poughkeepsie. On the west, it takes in Church of the Holy Comforter and the houses on Davies Place just across from it and Wheaton Park to the north. All the property on North Clover, the next street to the west, is included except the west corner of the Main Street intersection on the south. The homes at 105-115 Main to the east were one of the 1987 additions. In the north it narrows for a short distance to include just the property on the south side of Mill, then expands again to both sides of the street after the North Perry Street intersection, even including some of the Charles Street buildings to their north. Two blocks of North Bridge Street to the north are within the district, as well as some short adjacent sections of Charles and Mansion streets. South of the intersection is the other area added to the district later. The eastern portion is bordered on the north by the south side of Mansion Street, turning south along the rear property lines of the west side of Washington Street to Mill Street again, then including that side of the street all the way to the rear lines of the north side of Main Street. The district boundary is at Main Street to include the Vassar Home for Aged Men building, where it crosses the street and follows the rear lines on the other side to the North Bridge Street properties. Almost all of Vassar Street, and all of Lafayette Street, are within the district. Most of the district is residential, with a few churches and other institutional buildings. Many are of brick, often in the Second Empire style not commonly used with that material. There are some Federal and Greek Revival buildings, most notably the Second Baptist Church, Poughkeepsie's only remaining church in the latter style, scattered throughout. The only commercial areas are along Main and the Mill–North Clover intersection. Wheaton Park is the district's major open space. Past demolitions have also left some lots vacant. History In 1702, a Dutch settler, Baltus Van Kleeck, built the first house in what would later become Poughkeepsie. It was located on the path that would become Mill Street, near the intersection with the future Vassar Street. Mill Street was one of the first paths between the settlement of Poughkeepsie on the plateau and the river. As it developed into a more permanent street, the area grew. The coming of the Hudson River Railroad, which passed close to the neighborhood on the west, in the 1850s added to its prosperity. By mid-century it had become Poughkeepsie's downtown. All of its historic buildings were erected between 1840 and 1875. One of its great benefactors was Matthew Vassar and his descendants. The family's property and residences gave their name to Vassar Street, where their main landholding was. In 1835 they tore down Van Kleeck's original house. Their ownership of the land on which the Second Baptist Church was located led to it being called the \\"Vassar Temple\\" due to its colonnaded facade and use as a synagogue after the Civil War. His nephews built the eclectic brick Vassar Institute and Vassar Home for Aged Men on family land, now at Vassar and Main, to carry on the family's educational and charitable traditions, in the early 1880s. The neighborhood remained mostly unchanged well into the 20th century, when it was spared from urban renewal by the work of local preservationists. The cancellation of many urban renewal plans led to the boundary increase in 1987. Significant contributing properties Church of the Holy Comforter Vassar Institute Five buildings within the district were separately listed on the National Register just prior to the district itself. They include two churches, two institutional buildings and one house now used as an organization's headquarters. *Church of the Holy Comforter. 1860 Gothic Revival church on Davies Place, originally Episcopal but now Anglican Catholic, designed by Richard Upjohn.

The \\"Eyes of Christmas\\" is a television program in which the blind and visually impaired people can \\"watch\\" holiday shows by hearing descriptive narrations of the shows. The program is aired on a variety of cable networks and independent television stations, and features celebrities presenting holiday music, memories, and films, over the 12 days leading up to Christmas. TheatreVision TheatreVision is an RPI program that makes films accessible to the visually impaired. It incorporates a special soundtrack in films that runs concurrently with the dialogue of the picture. The track provides a \\"descriptive narration\\" of what is being shown on the screen. Forrest Gump was the first film to be completed in this format, making its TheatreVision debut before a visually challenged audience.

These stars have often been little-studied, and once more is learnt about them, they are reclassified into other categories such as semiregular variables. Nomenclature Irregular variable stars were first given acronyms based on the letter \\"I\\": Ia, Ib. and Ic. These were later refined so that the I codes were used \\"nebular\\" or \\"rapidly irregular\\" variable stars such as T Tauri and Orion variables. The remaining irregular stars, cool slowly varying giants and supergiants of type Ib or Ic were reassigned to Lb and Lc. When the General Catalogue of Variable Stars standardised its acronyms to be all uppercase, the codes LB and LC were used. Type Lb Slow irregular variables of late spectral types (K, M, C, S); as a rule, they are giants The GCVS also claims to give this type to slow irregular red variables where the luminosity or spectral type is not known, although it also uses the type L for slow irregular red stars where the spectral type or luminosity is unclear. The K5 star CO Cygni is given as a representative example. Type Lc Irregular variable supergiants of late spectral types having amplitudes of about 1 mag in V The M2 supergiant TZ Cassiopeiae is given as a representative example.

The site also has a residence and two motel units. History In 1929, Albina and Vincenzo Cerolla built a one-room, frame gas station with a single pump to serve motorists on Route 66. The station also sold motor oil and other automobile accessories and necessities. The station operated under a lease as part of the Johnson Oil Refining Company of Chicago. In 1936, they expanded with a new brick gas station, a café, four motel rooms with individual automobile garages, and a small house for the owners. The restaurant was known as Cerolla's Café. Edith, the daughter of the Cerollas, and her husband Lester \\"Curly\\" Kranich continued the business after the death of Edith's parents. The Kraniches demolished the original house on the property in the 1950s and built a new one with a garage. They also expanded the motel at this time, adding two identical wings. The Kraniches also had to reorient the entrances when a new four-lane bypass opened on the other side of the property in the 1940s. The construction of Interstate 55 in the 1970s would mark the end of the once-thriving family business by diverting highway traffic westward. The café closed in 1971. The Kraniches retired in 1975, closing the facility. The café, motel, and gas station buildings were kept in relatively good condition but were used primarily for storage. The property sits largely vacant; the buildings are for sale. The current owner occasionally rents a room in one of the wings.

He was among the last living members of the third generation of America's modern dance artists.The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. \\"Modern Dance - Later Dancers\\", Retrieved 28 February 2016. He founded the Paul Taylor Dance Company in 1954 in New York City. Early life and education Taylor was born in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, to Paul Belville Taylor Sr., a physicist, and to the former Elizabeth Rust Pendleton. He grew up in and around Washington, DC. By his teens, he had grown to more than six feet in height. He was a swimmer and student of painting at Syracuse University in the late 1940s. Upon discovering dance through books at the school library, he transferred to Juilliard, where he earned a B.S. degree in dance in 1953 under director Martha Hill. Career Alex Katz, Ada on Blue, 1959 In 1954 Taylor assembled a small company of dancers and began making his own works. A commanding performer despite his late start, he joined the Martha Graham Dance Company in 1955 for the first of seven seasons as soloist where he created the role of the evil Aegisthus in Graham's Clytemnestra. All the while he was continuing to choreograph on his own small troupe. He also worked with the choreographers Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman, José Limón and Jerome Robbins. In 1959 he was invited by George Balanchine to be a guest artist with New York City Ballet, performing his Episodes. Taylor's early choreographic projects have been noted as distinctly different from the modern, physical works he would come to be known for later, and have even invited comparison to the conceptual performances of the Judson Dance Theatre in the 1960s. For Duet (1957), Taylor and dancer Toby Glanternik remained completely motionless as the pianist played a \\"non score\\" by the composer John Cage. On the same program was a work called Epic, in which Taylor moved slowly across the stage in a business suit while a recorded time announcement played in the background. The Dance Observer critic Louis Horst published a blank page as a review in November 1957 as a response; it was part of Seven New Dances in which Martha Graham called him a \\"naughty boy.\\" Paul Taylor (1960) With his landmark work Aureole (1962), he departed from such an avante garde aesthetic. The performance was still intended to provoke dance critics, as he cheekily set his modern movements not to contemporary music but to a baroque score. A choreographer as concerned with subject matter as he was with form, many of Taylor's pieces and movements are pointedly about something. Some movements relate to his fascination with insects and the way they move. Other movements are influenced by his love of swimming. While he may propel his dancers through space for the sheer beauty of it, he has frequently used them to illuminate such profound issues as war, piety, spirituality, sexuality, morality and mortality. He is perhaps best known for his 1975 dance, Esplanade. In Esplanade Taylor was fascinated with the everyday movement that people enacted on a daily basis—from running to sliding, to walking, jumping and falling. The work is set in five movements to Bach's Violin Concerto No.2 in E-flat Major. Another well-known work of his is Private Domain (1969). Taylor was intrigued by the idea of perspective and the relationship of reality and appearance. In Private Domain, Taylor commissioned a set by renowned visual artist Alex Katz, whose rectangular panels obstructed the audience from seeing a portion of the stage depending on their vantage points. The seen and unseen relationship that the audience experienced was well received. In another work, Lost, Found, Lost (1969) Taylor again showed his interest in everyday movement by having dancers move one-by-one into the wing as they wait to use a public telephone. Taylor choreographed his own version of The Rite of Spring in 1980 that he named The Rehearsal. Accompanied by a two-piano version of the original Stravinsky score, The Rehearsal is a detective story complete with gangsters and kidnappings, but Taylor balanced his version with an ode to the original. In one scene a grieving mother echoes the Chosen Maiden from Nijinsky's version. This balance of old and new was widely praised, in addition to the challenging technical demands of the movement. Other well-known and highly regarded or controversial Taylor works include Big Bertha (1970), Airs (1978), Arden Court (1981), Sunset (1983), Last Look (1985), Speaking in Tongues (1988), Brandenburgs (1988), Company B (1991), Piazzolla Caldera (1996), Black Tuesday (2001), Promethean Fire (2002), and Beloved Renegade (2008). Some of these dances, performed by the Paul Taylor Dance Company, are also licensed by such companies as the Royal Danish Ballet, Miami City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Taylor collaborated with artists such as Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly, Alex Katz, Tharon Musser, Thomas Skelton, Gene Moore, John Rawlings, William Ivey Long, Jennifer Tipton, Santo Loquasto, James F. Ingalls, Donald York and Matthew Diamond. His career and creative process has been much discussed, as he is the subject of the Oscar- nominated documentary, Dancemaker, and author of the autobiography Private Domain and a Wall Street Journal essay, \\"Why I Make Dances.\\" Recognition Taylor was a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 1992 and received an Emmy Award for Speaking in Tongues, produced by WNET/New York the previous year. In 1993 he was awarded the National Medal of Arts by United States President Bill Clinton. He received the Algur H. Meadows Award for Excellence in the Arts in 1995 and was named one of 50 prominent Americans honored in recognition of their outstanding achievement by the Library of Congress's Office of Scholarly Programs. He is the recipient of three Guggenheim Fellowships and honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degrees from California Institute of the Arts, Connecticut College, Duke University, The Juilliard School, Skidmore College, the State University of New York at Purchase, Syracuse University and Adelphi University. Taylor's Awards for lifetime achievement include a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship – often called the \\"genius award\\" – and the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award. Other awards include the New York State Governor's Arts Award and the New York City Mayor's Award of Honor for Art and Culture. In 1989 Taylor was elected one of ten honorary American members of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. Having been elected to knighthood by the French government as Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1969 and elevated to Officier in 1984 and Commandeur in 1990, Taylor was awarded France's highest honor, the Légion d'Honneur, for exceptional contributions to French culture, in 2000. Private Domain, originally published by Alfred A. Knopf and re-released by North Point Press and later by the University of Pittsburgh Press, was nominated by the National Book Critics Circle as the most distinguished biography of 1987. Dancemaker, Matthew Diamond's award-winning feature-length film about Taylor, was hailed by Time as \\"perhaps the best dance documentary ever.\\"Dance Maker. Matthew Diamond. Docu Rama, 1999. Video Taylor's Facts and Fancies: Essays Written Mostly for Fun, was published by Delphinium in 2013. The 2019 American Dance Festival's season, its 86th, was dedicated to Paul Taylor. Paul Taylor Dance Company The choreographer's works, totaling 147, are performed by the 16-member Paul Taylor Dance Company, the chamber-sized Taylor 2, and dance companies throughout the world. Of his works, 50 are documented in Labanotation. In each completed score there is a section \\"Introductory Material,\\" which includes topics such as: Casts, Stylistic Notes, as well as other Production information. A 2015 documentary titled Paul Taylor: Creative Domain showcased his creative process. It was described as \\"a fly-on-the-wall depiction of the 2010 creation of Three Dubious Memories, his 133rd modern- dance piece for the eponymous company that he founded over 60 years ago.\\"  Paul Taylor American Modern Dance  In 2015, Taylor began a new program, called Paul Taylor American Modern Dance, in which works of modern dance by choreographers other than Taylor—performed by dancers practiced in those styles—are included in the company’s annual season at the Koch Theater at Lincoln Center. In addition, contemporary choreographers receive commissions to create new works on the Taylor company. Thus far, dances by Doris Humphrey, Shen Wei, Merce Cunningham, Martha Graham, Donald McKayle, and Trisha Brown have been presented. New commissions by Doug Elkins, Larry Keigwin, Lila York, Bryan Arias, Doug Varone, Margie Gillis, Pam Tanowitz, and Kyle Abraham have been set on and danced by Paul Taylor Dance Company. Since 2015, live music has been performed on every program by the Orchestra of St. Luke’s. Death Taylor died of renal failure on August 29, 2018, at a Manhattan hospital at the age of 88.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles, Detroit Tigers and Cincinnati Reds. From 2001 through part of 2004 he pitched under the name Carlos Cabrera. Professional career Minor leagues =Philadelphia Phillies= Simón was signed on July 9, 1999, by the Philadelphia Phillies. He originally signed under the name Carlos Cabrera, and he pretended to be 21 months younger than he really was. He made his professional debut in 2000 for the La Vega Phillies in the Dominican Summer League. In 2004, the Phillies found out his real name and age. =San Francisco Giants= Shortly after that, he was traded with Ricky Ledée to the San Francisco Giants for Felix Rodríguez. Simón was assigned to the A Advanced San Jose Giants. He got off to a bad start, posting a 5.68 ERA in 6 starts while going 1–2. His next season, he was promoted to the AA Norwich Navigators. He started for only part of the year, and closed for most of the season, posting a 5.03 ERA in 43 games (9 starts). In 2006, he started the season at San Jose but was promoted to the AAA Fresno Grizzlies. Following the season he filed for free agency. =Texas Rangers= On November 3, 2006, Simón signed with the Texas Rangers. In December, the Baltimore Orioles drafted him in the Rule 5 draft. On the same day, the Orioles traded him back to the Philadelphia Phillies for Adam Donachie and cash. On March 17, 2007, the Phillies returned Simón to the Rangers. Simón pitched as a starter for the AAA Oklahoma RedHawks. He had a bad year, going 5–10 with a 6.43 ERA in 22 starts. Following the season, he filed for free agency. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On January 10, 2008, he signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was released on March 30, before the season started. =Mexican League= Simón pitching for the Baltimore Orioles After being released, Simón signed with the independent Sultanes de Monterrey of the Mexican League. He pitched very well with them, going 7–2 with a 2.67 ERA in 15 games (11 starts). During the season, he was signed by the Baltimore Orioles. Major leagues =Baltimore Orioles= The Orioles originally assigned Simón to the AAA Norfolk Tides, but they quickly called him up. On September 6 he made his MLB debut. He finished 2008 with a 6.23 ERA in four games (one start) and no decisions. In 2009, after a strong spring training, he was named to the Orioles' starting rotation. However, he was injured in only his second start and missed the rest of the year after undergoing Tommy John surgery. Simón failed to make the Orioles out of spring training in 2010, but on April 27, the Orioles promoted Simón from AAA Norfolk. The same day, he became the Orioles' closer (due to bad pitching and a subsequent injury to Mike Gonzalez), and he notched his first save against the New York Yankees. He pitched an inning and gave up no earned runs (and two unearned). Coincidentally, the Yankees were the same team Simón earned his first decision against. Simón converted his first five save opportunities before blowing one against the Cleveland Indians on May 15. Through the 2010 season, Simón converted 17 of 21 save opportunities. After blowing a save on August 9, he did not receive another save opportunity as Koji Uehara was used most often in the role. On May 21, 2011, Simón was activated from the restricted list. Jason Berken was sent down to make room. =Cincinnati Reds= On April 3, 2012, the Cincinnati Reds claimed Simón off waivers from the Orioles. He served in the bullpen for the season, posting a 3–2 record and a 2.66 ERA in 36 games. He spent most of the 2013 season as a part of the Reds bullpen. He went 6–4 and posted a 2.87 ERA in 63 appearances. He began the 2014 season in the Reds' starting rotation after an injury to Mat Latos. He immediately excelled in the role, and at the All-Star break he led the National League with 12 wins (against only three losses) to go with a 2.70 ERA. On July 13, 2014, Simón was named to the 2014 Major League Baseball All- Star Game, replacing fellow Red Johnny Cueto, who was unavailable to pitch due to starting a game the previous Sunday. Simon was mobbed by his teammates in the dugout when the announcement was made during the game. In the All-Star game, Simón pitched a scoreless third inning, allowing one hit and striking out one batter. He would win only three more games after the All-Star break, finishing at 15–10 with a 3.44 ERA, while throwing a career-high innings. =Detroit Tigers= On December 11, 2014, the Reds traded Simón to the Detroit Tigers for Jonathon Crawford and Eugenio Suárez. On January 16, 2015, Simón and the Tigers avoided arbitration when the two parties agreed on a one- year contract worth $5.5 million. On August 20, 2015, Simón recorded his first career complete game shutout in the Tigers 4–0 win over the Texas Rangers. He allowed only one hit in the contest, a double to Rougned Odor in the fifth inning, while walking two and striking out five. Despite finishing the season with a 5.05 ERA, Simón led the Tigers in wins (13) and innings pitched (187). =Second stint with Cincinnati= On March 17, 2016, Simón signed a one- year deal to return to the Reds. Long Island Ducks On June 6, 2017, Simon signed with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. http://alpb.bbstats.pointstreak.com/transactions.html?leagueid=174 He became a free agent after the 2017 season. Tigres de Quintana Roo On July 3, 2018, Simon signed with the Tigres de Quintana Roo of the Mexican Baseball League. He was released on August 16, 2018. Pitch selection Simón is primarily a fastball pitcher, throwing several varieties of the pitch. He throws four-seam and two-seam fastballs in the 92–94 MPH range (topping out at 97 MPH), plus a split-finger fastball in the 83–85 MPH range (topping out at 89 MPH). The split-finger is his favorite pitch with two strikes on the hitter. He also throws a standard curveball that averages about 77–79 MPH, plus an extremely slow curveball that averages about 66–69 MPH. The slow curve has been clocked as low as 49 MPH, leading some analysts to call it an eephus pitch. Incidents Involuntary manslaughter allegations In January 2011, Simón allegedly shot and killed Michel Castillo Almonte and wounded his 17-year-old brother during a New Year's Eve celebration in Luperón, Dominican Republic. Simón denied the allegations.http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-01-02/sports/bal-alfredo- simon-shooting-0102_1_fatal-shooting-orioles-reliever-alfredo-simon-closer- role/ Orioles' reliever Alfredo Simon is main suspect in fatal shooting The Baltimore Sun, January 2, 2011 Police then announced their intention to file involuntary manslaughter charges.http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5984195 Alfredo Simon surrenders self, gun In March 2011, Simón posted bail.

Early stages of the competition were run on a regional basis, with the National League teams receiving a bye until the later stages of the competition. In all, 99 teams took part in the competition. Different sources give different numberings for the rounds of the competition: some start round one with the beginning of the regional qualifications; others start numbering from the first national knock-out stage. The former numbering scheme is used in this article. The final saw the end of a Chatham Cup era, being the last final to be held at the Basin Reserve until 1980. The Basin Reserve had been the host of every final since 1928. The 1972 final The 1972 final was a marathon effort, unprecedented and unequalled in Chatham Cup history. In the days before penalty shoot-outs replays were played if scores were level after extra time. The 1972 final required not one, but two replays, with the first of these being held in Christchurch (the first time that city had been host to a final match). The total aggregate of 13 goals across the three matches was a record for a final - indeed the eight goals in the first match equalled the previous record. In the first match, Christchurch United's Graham Dacombe became the first player to score four goals in one final since John Donovan in 1958. All three matches were refereed by R.W. Harries. The first match was played in typical windy conditions at Wellington. United played with the wind in the first spell and should have had the lead early on when Mount keeper Kevin Curtin appeared to step back across his goal-line when holding onto a Vic Pollard cross. The referee turned down their appeal and the goal was not given. United were soon to gain the lead, however, with the first of Dacombe's four strikes. Two goals from penalties for the Mount, both taken by Ron Armstrong, followed before Dacombe restored the balance. In the second half Brian Turner put Mount Wellington into the lead for a second time, only for Dacombe to again level before the final whistle. In extra time it was United who took the lead for a second occasion, and it required a late Earle Thomas equaliser to send the tie to a second game. The second match was played on Christchurch United's territory at English Park, the first time a final had ever been played outsider the North Island. Compared with the first match it was a dour game, with only one goal a piece and nowhere near the first tie's excitement. Dennis Tindall opened the scoring for Mount Wellington, and the only other goal of the game was the equaliser from Ian Park. The third bout took place at Mount Wellington's Newmarket Park ground, and finally it produced a result. Alan Park opened the scoring for United before the interval, followed in the second spell by Alan Marley. Armstrong pulled one back — again from the penalty spot — but that was the last of the scoring. There were vociferous protest from the Mount when substitute Dave Taylor had a late effort disallowed, but in the minds of many this was poetic justice for Pollard's denied effort in the first match. p. 76 Results Third Round * Won on penalties by Queens Park (4-3) and Rangers (6-5) Fourth Round Fifth Round Quarter-finals Semi-finals Final =Replays= References *Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation New Zealand 1972 page *UltimateNZSoccer website 1972 Chatham Cup page Chatham Cup Chatham Cup Chatham Cup September 1972 sports events in Oceania ","title":"1972 Chatham Cup"},{"id":"19195098","text":"Dipleura is a genus of trilobites in the order Phacopida.

It is well-known for its appearance in the 1836 painting The Oxbow by Thomas Cole. History Historically, the Oxbow was connected directly to the Connecticut river as a large U-shaped bend.History at Chronos istorical.org In 1840, flood waters cut through the narrow section, separating the Oxbow from the main river and the current. In the early 1900s, the Oxbow was used extensively for logging operations, as a holding area for logs sent down river. The northern end was later cut off to build Interstate 91, which runs between the Oxbow and the Connecticut River. The Connecticut River is still accessible by a channel made under the Interstate 91 and U.S. Route 5 bridges.Maps of OFBA Facilities at Department of Fish and Game (Mass.org) Depictions The Oxbow captured the imagination and attention of a broad set of artists over time. Thomas Cole described the scene as \\"well known\\" in 1836Roque, Oswaldo Rodriguez (1982). \\"The Oxbow\\" by Thomas Cole: Iconography of an American Landscape Painting. Metropolitan Museum Journal. pp. 63–7. as he began his large painting of The Oxbow. A depiction of what was called \\"Hockanum Bend\\" had appeared in 1826 in \\"The northern traveller; containing the routes to Niagara, Quebec, and the Springs,\\" by Theodore Dwight. In 1835 an illustration was created by W. H. Bartlett and published in the book \\"American Scenery\\" by George Virtue in 1837. By the second half of the 19th century the Oxbow was photographed for stereo-views and by the turn of the late 19th and early 20th century was featured in postcards and other memorabilia. Wildlife The Oxbow is habitat for many migratory and resident bird species. The Arcadia Wildlife Sanctuary (a project of Mass Audubon) protects a total of Nature Connection at Massaudubon.org of land which forms the outer shore of the Oxbow. Among these species include bald eagle, snowy egret, cormorant, great blue heron, osprey, kingfisher, swifts, gulls, Canada geese, and ducks.Birds and Birding at Massaudubon.org Current use The Oxbow is used today primarily for pleasure boating, and is home to one of the largest marinas on the Connecticut River in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation operates a state boat ramp facility accessible from Route 5 in Easthampton, Massachusetts. Because it is partially separated from the main river body, boats are protected from strong current and floating debris. Other uses include flat water paddling and fishing. The Oxbow facilitates the Oxbow Water Ski Show Team, and used to be the home of Northampton Youth and Community Rowing, one of the larger scholastic and masters rowing clubs in western Massachusetts.

Biography He was probably the John Holwell, son of Thomas and Catherine Holwell, who was baptised at St. James's, Clerkenwell, on 28 Nov, 1649.Harl. Soc. Registers, ix. 173 According to a biography,‘Asiatic Annual Register,’ vol. 1. he was descended from the Holwells of Holwell House, near Tavistock, Devon, and his father and grandfather were engaged in Penruddock's plot in 1655, fell in the royalist cause, and as a consequence forfeited the family estates. It is known that a John Holwell of Sampford was actually sequestered in 1655,Royalist Composition Papers, 1st ser. vol. lxxx. f. 159 but in 1652 a Captain John Holwell, probably the same person, appears as giving information against the papists to the officers of the Commonwealth,Royalist Composition Papers, 1st ser. vol. lv. ff. 361, 383 and there is no proof of his connection with Penruddock's plot. The same account states that after the Restoration, Holwell was made royal astronomer and surveyor of the crown lands, while his wife obtained a place at court, which is possible, and that he was preceptor to the Duke of Monmouth, which his age makes unlikely. He is further alleged to have written anonymously in support of the Exclusion Bill, and to have given such offence by his ‘Catastrophe Mundi’ that he was brought before the privy council, but to have defended himself so skilfully that no charge could be established against him. He usually described himself on the title-pages of his book as ‘philomath,’ and once as ‘teacher of the mathematicks and astrology’. In his advertisements (e.g. Catastrophe Mundi, p. 40) he announces that ‘Arts and Sciences are mathematically professed and taught by the author … at his house on the east side of Spittle Fields , over against Dorset Street … He also measureth building and surveyeth land for any later.for any man, having the mos experience in surveying of any man in England.’ His writings show that he was a firm Protestant. The biography already referred to gives an unauthenticated story that in 1685 the government, fearing his pen, sent him to America to survey the town of New York, giving orders that he was not to be allowed to return. After completing, his work he died suddenly, it was suspected of poison. Holwell left a widow, by whom he had a son and a daughter. His son Zephaniah (d. 1729) was a timber merchant in London, father of John Zephaniah Holwell. Works * A sure Guide to the Practical Svyveyor, in two parts.

The story follows Anita Palmer, a teenager from two different parallel universes, and her struggle to maintain both lives. Plot On the eve of her sixteenth birthday, Anita has an accident and ends up in hospital with her boyfriend Evan. To brighten her mood, at midnight her parents give her one of her presents, one sent to her by mail with no return address: it is a beautiful book, but the pages are blank. Anita explores the book, which suddenly has a story written inside. It tells about a lost princess, the seventh of seven daughters, who has become trapped in the Mortal World on her sixteenth birthday, the night before she was to marry Lord Gabriel Drake. Suddenly Anita grows wings and she flies out of the window, above London. Suddenly, her wings wither away and she falls. Found in the hospital bathroom by a nurse, she is returned to her bed, still worried about Evan not waking. The nurse brings Anita a gift addressed to her, from Evan's belongings. The gift is a necklace that she quickly puts around her neck. She fell asleep, and when she woke up, Evan is gone. A ghostly image appears to Anita, the image of Gabriel Drake, calling her to follow him. Anita followed Lord Drake out onto a balcony where he urges her to focus strongly on him so that she can reach him. Anita tries her hardest to focus on him and suddenly their hands meet in the air. Lord Drake pulls Anita from the Mortal realm presents her to her father: as it turns out, Anita is also Tania, the seventh child of Oberon and Titania, king and queen of fairyland.

History In 1933, Hans von Ohain wrote his PhD thesis at the University of Göttingen on the topic of an optical microphone that could be used to record sound directly to film. Siemens bought the patent for RM 3,500, a large sum. Ohain used the money to invest in his real interest, the gas turbine. In 1934 von Ohain contracted his mechanic, Max Hahn, to build a prototype of his concept. Later referred to as the \\"garage engine\\", it quickly burned out due to the use of low-temperature metals. Nevertheless, it was successful and piqued the interest of his professor, Robert Pohl. In February 1936, Pohl wrote to Ernst Heinkel on behalf of von Ohain, telling him of the design and its possibilities. Heinkel arranged a meeting where his engineers were able to grill von Ohain for hours, during which he flatly stated that the current \\"garage engine\\" would never work but there was nothing wrong with the concept as a whole. The engineers were convinced, and in April, von Ohain and Hahn were set up at Heinkel's works at the Marienehe airfield outside Rostock, Germany in Warnemünde. Once moved, a study was made of the airflow in the engine, and several improvements made over a two-month period. Much happier with the results, they decided to produce a completely new engine incorporating all of these changes, running on hydrogen gas. The resulting Heinkel-Strahltriebwerk 1 (HeS 1), German for Heinkel Jet Engine 1, was built by hand-picking some of the best machinists in the company, much to the chagrin of the shop-floor supervisors. Hahn, meanwhile, worked on the combustion problem, an area he had some experience in. The engine was extremely simple, made largely of sheet metal. Construction started late in the summer of 1936, and completed in March 1937. First run occurred on September 1937. Although the engine was never intended to be a flight-quality design, it proved beyond a doubt that the basic concept was workable. While work on the HeS 1 continued, the team had already moved on to the design of a flight-quality design, the HeS 3.

It was first published in the first Indian edition of Plain Tales from the Hills (1888), and in subsequent editions of that collection. The story is illuminating about Kipling's attitudes to race, which are less cut-and-dried than is often thought. Kipling is interesting, if not very detailed, on people of mixed race and the snobberies involved. (For some detail, see the Kipling Society notes.) The epigraph includes the line \\"'Love hath made this thing a Man'\\", which adumbrates one of Kipling's themes in this story, as in others. The 'love' in 'His Chance in Life' is that between Michele d'Cruze, who \\"looked down on natives as only a man with seven-eighths native blood in his veins can\\" and Miss Vezzis, similarly \\"from across the Borderline\\" \\"where the last drop of White blood ends and the full tide of black sets in\\". D'Cruze works as a telegrapher, and Miss Vezzis' Mamma won't let them marry till he earns at least 50 rupees per month: he has 35 rupees a month at the start of the story. The story concerns his new posting to the telegraph station at Tibasu, a remote sub-station whose real function is only to relay messages. One day in the Muslim period of Mohurrum, the locals start a riot, with Hindus and Muslims joining in: \\"It was a nasty little riot, but not worth putting in the papers.\\" An angry crowd approaches Michele's office with the intention of wrecking it. (\\"Never forget that unless the outward and visible signs of Our Authority are always before a native he is as incapable as a child of understanding what authority means, or where is the danger of disobeying it\\" - a second theme of Kipling's is that of the difference between the British and the Indian, in terms of 'fitness to rule'.) The Native Police Inspector panics, but obeys \\"the old race-instinct which recognises a drop of White blood as far as it can be diluted\\", asks \\"the Sahib\\" for orders. \\"The Sahib decided Michele.\\" He leads the native police and fires on the crowd, killing a man, whereupon the others flee \\"curs to a man\\". A deputation of the locals claim he has acted unconstitutionality, citing the (presumably native) Sub- Judge. Michele replies that he is the effective Government, and the deputation \\"bowed their heads\\". The next day, Michele greets the Sub-Collector. \\"[I]n the presence of this young Englishman\\", Michele loses the effect of whiteness and weeps, to his shame. \\"But the Englishman understood\\", reports Michele's conduct favourably, through the Proper Channels, and he is transferred back 'up-country' on a salary of 66 rupees per month. So he marries Miss Vezzis. \\"Which proves that, when a man does good work out of all proportion to his pay, in seven cases out of nine there is a woman at the back of the virtue.\\" All quotations in this article have been taken from the Uniform Edition of Plain Tales from the Hills published by Macmillan & Co., Limited in London in 1899.

Education and career Born in Paraná, Argentina, de Bold obtained a BSc in clinical biochemistry at the Faculty of Chemical Sciences of the National University of Córdoba before moving to Canada in 1968. His MSc (1972) and PhD (1973) are from the Department of Pathology at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, under the direction of Sergio Bencosme.Lumley E. Canadian Who's Who 2003 (University of Toronto Press; 2003) ()University of Ottawa Heart Institute: Adolfo de Bold OC, PhD, FRSC (accessed 4 December 2008) He worked at Queen's University from 1974, rising to professor in 1985. In 1986, he became director of research at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, a position he held until 1993. As of 2008, de Bold is the director of the Cardiovascular Endocrinology Laboratory at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, and also an assistant professor of pathology and cellular and molecular medicine at the University of Ottawa. Research De Bold's research has focused on the study of storage granules in heart cells. In 1980, this work led to his discovery and isolation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a polypeptide hormone secreted by heart muscle cells. This was the first demonstration that the heart has an endocrine function. De Bold's team went on to show that the heart modulates blood pressure, blood volume and cardiovascular growth via ANP. The discovery of ANP opened up a new field of research which has resulted in multiple therapeutic and diagnostic applications in heart failure. Awards and honours De Bold has received many awards for his work on ANP, including the Gairdner Foundation International Award (1986),The Gairdner Foundation: International Awardees: 1987–1978 (accessed 4 December 2008) Manning Innovation Awards Principal Award (1986),Manning Innovation Awards: Award Winners: Dr. Adolfo de Bold (accessed 4 December 2008) Royal Society of Canada McLaughlin Medal in Medical Research (1988),RSC: The Academies of Arts, Humanities and Sciences of Canada: McLaughlin Medal (accessed 4 December 2008) International Society of Hypertension Research Award (1990), CIBA Award of the American Heart Association (1994), the American Society of Hypertension Research Award. and the Gran Prix Scientifique Lefoulon-Delalande, Institute de France, 2014.Institute de France The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario included the discovery of ANP among its top ten research discoveries of the past fifty years.

The hospital serves as the hub for the operations of Samaritan Health Services. It is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.  History  Started as Corvallis General Hospital, the original facility was located on Northwest Harrison Boulevard. After World War II the hospital was on the brink of bankruptcy, unable to pay off its bonds. In an effort to retire the debt the hospital under the auspices of the Episcopal Diocese of Oregon. In 1948, Corvallis General was reconstituted as a nonprofit organization and renamed Good Samaritan Hospital. In 1975, the hospital moved to its current location north of the city overlooking Oregon Route 99W. The hospital has maintained its affiliation with the Episcopal Diocese of Oregon and has continued to thrive. Now known as Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center, today it is the flagship institution of Samaritan Health Services. The original hospital building on Harrison was demolished in 2011. In 2020, the hospital treated patients for COVID-19 infection, as the global pandemic developed. Operations The medical center has 188 licensed beds, but only has 165 available, and is the only hospital in Benton County.
