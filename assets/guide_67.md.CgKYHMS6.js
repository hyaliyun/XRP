Biography Ackland was born in Mitcham, a suburb of Adelaide, South Australia, to John Barnes Ackland, a warehouse manager, and Edith Ackland (née Randell). In 1896, the family moved to Western Australia, and he was educated at state schools in East Perth, Claremont and Northam before attending Scotch College. He obtained work as a jackaroo for Thomas Wilding at Mokine in 1906–1908, and from then on farmed at family properties. In 1910, he selected land at Lake Ninan near Wongan Hills, which became productive. During this time he became a member of the town's Board of Health, and on 21 December 1914, he married Elsie Stokes with whom he was to have two sons. With the onset of the First World War, Ackland was enlisted into the Australian Imperial Force on 16 August 1916, and served in France as a private with the 28th Battalion, although acted as a Corporal and Lance Corporal at various times. He was wounded in battle on 5 June 1918, and was on secondment to the Agent-General for Western Australia's office in London prior to discharge on 25 November 1919. After his war service, Ackland returned to Lake Ninan, and became a Justice of the Peace in 1922 and was elected to the Melbourne Road Board the following year. In 1927, he became its chairman, a position he would hold until 1940. He was also a member of the Royal Agricultural Show Council, was vice-president of the Wheat Section of the Primary Producers Association (associated with the Country Party) and was an early director of Co-operative Bulk Handling. From 1940 to 1945, he served as a captain in the Volunteer Defence Corps. Shortly after his return to civilian life, Ackland contested the seat of Irwin-Moore in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly for the Country Party at the 1947 election, and won against the incumbent Independent member Horace Berry. He retained the seat three years later when it was renamed Moore. He served on several Select Committees, including one into the agricultural practices of Eric Fairleigh in 1951, and the uniformity of liquid fuel prices in 1956; he also became a member of the Joint House Committee in 1956. He represented the Western Australian branch at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association at its general conference in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, in 1982. Ackland died suddenly after giving a speech at Wongan Hills Junior High School on 29 July 1958, and was cremated at Karrakatta Cemetery. He has a memorial inscription at Wongan Hills cemetery.

The first game was released in 1982.Press advertisement from Sinclair User, May 1982 It was then ported to most home computers during the 1980s and spawned several sequels: Football Manager 2Football Manager 2 at ysrnry.co.uk (1988) and Football Manager World Cup EditionFootball Manager World Cup Edition at HOL Amiga Database (1990), both designed by Kevin Toms, and finally Football Manager 3Football Manager 3 at worldofspectrum.org (1992), without Toms' involvement. Football Manager 3 sold poorly, and as a result the series came to an end. The series was claimed to have sold over a million copies by 1992.Football Manager 3 advertisement reproduced at World of Spectrun The game was to start a whole new genre of computer game, the football management simulation. Football Manager Development and release Toms developed the first game on a Video Genie, a clone of the Tandy TRS-80. This was a text only game. It was converted to the Sinclair ZX80 and ZX81 and Toms created the software label Addictive Games to launch the game in 1982. It was then ported to the ZX Spectrum with added animated graphics showing match highlights. The game was a huge success and was ported to a wide range of systems between 1984 and 1987.Press advertisement from Micro Adventurer, July 1984Football Manager at mobygames.com While the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, MSX and PC versions, kept or improved all features such as the match highlights graphics, all others (including the Acorn Electron, Atari 8-bit Converted to Atari Basic by Colin Lennox. Commodore 16 and Plus/4 were, like the original, text only. Gameplay Text based screen on the ZX SpectrumGraphical highlight section on the ZX Spectrum. A goal has just been scoredThe game was written entirely in BASICInterview with Kevin Toms for the blog The Ball is Round\\"The Spectrum Collection\\", Tony Hetherington, Computer Gamer, August 1985 and, apart from the match highlights on some versions, used only text displays and keyboard entry. The player chooses a team and then must try to earn promotion from the fourth to the first division (although the player can then keep playing for as many seasons as they wish). The player also competes in the FA Cup. While the team and player names are real, they are not accurately represented so whichever team is selected, the player always starts in the fourth division and their team is randomly populated with players. Each player has a skill rating and an energy rating. Players must be rested to renew their energy rating or they become injured. The players' skill and energy ratings also change at the end of the season. The team has ratings of defence, midfield and attack (the total skills of all defenders, midfielders or attackers selected), energy (an average of all selected players) and morale (which increases when the team wins and decreases when they lose). The player can select their team to balance the skills based on the opposing team's ratings (e.g. to increase the defence rating if the opposition has a high attack rating). As the match is played, the screen is updated if a goal is scored. For versions with animated graphics highlights, attempts on goal are shown in isometric 3D at either end of the pitch with a scoreboard showing the current score. The player can not affect the game while it is in progress. The player must also balance finances. Weekly income and expenditure is calculated and bank loans can be taken out. There is also a basic player transfer system. Random players become available to buy which the player can bid for. If the squad reaches the maximum of 16, no players will be available to buy. The player can also list their own players for sale and then accept or reject bids. Game progress can be saved at any time. A customiser utility was included with the game so players could rename the teams and players.Football Manager Original instructions reproduced at Acorn Electron World Reception Football Manager was a commercial hit, selling 500,000 copies in its first six years available. The game was well received by the gaming press although Sinclair User did comment on the lack of realism of the teams and individual player ratings.\\"Getting as Sick as a Parrot\\", Sinclair User, February 1983 The excitement of watching the game in progress was often seen as the highlight of the game. Electron User claimed the game was \\"one of the best strategy games available for home computers\\" with reviewer Dave Carlos stating \\"I doubt that this game will ever be bettered\\".Football Manager review, Dave Carlos, Electron User, April 1986 The game was nominated in the 1983 Golden Joystick Awards for best strategy game, eventually coming second to the Melbourne House adventure game The Hobbit.\\"The Golden Joystick Award\\", C&VG;, Issue 29 In 1985, Tony Hetherington of Computer Gamer magazine included the game in \\"The Spectrum Collection\\" - \\"15 classic games that all Spectrum owners should have\\". By 1991, when reviewing the £2.99 budget release, Amiga Power awarded a score of only 19% as the game had been \\"out-featured by practically every other game in the genre\\" but was \\"still massively addictive\\" and referred to as a \\"classic\\" and \\"one of the legends of computer gaming\\".Football Manager review, Amiga Power, July 1991 The ZX Spectrum version was voted the 26th best game of all time in a special issue of Your Sinclair magazine in 2004. Football Manager 2 Development and release Following the sale of Addictive Games to Prism Leisure Corporation in 1987, Kevin Toms concentrated on creating a second Football Manager game.\\"Interview: Kevin Toms\\", Simon Brew, Den of Geek, June 2008 Unlike the original BASIC only game, the sequel required machine code which meant working with a number of developers for various systems. For the ZX Spectrum version, this was Bedrock Software.Football Manager 2 at Bedrock Software Unlike the first game that was stagger-released over a period of 5 years, Football Manager 2 was launched on all formats at the same time in June 1988, although it was available on a much smaller range of systems - Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Atari ST and PC.Football Manager 2 press advertisement reproduced at Lemon Amiga Unlike the first game, there was no customiser utility with the original release but in 1989, Football Manager 2 Expansion Kit was released, both as a stand alone releaseFootball Manager 2 Expansion Kit at World of Spectrum and packed in with Football Manager 2.Football Manager 2 + FM2 Expansion Kit at World of Spectrum As well as being able to rename teams and players, this offered the chance to start in division one or play in other leagues such as the 'Euro Super League' or as a national team in a 'World Championship'. Gameplay The team selection screen on the C64. The player is placing attackers to balance the opponent's defendersGameplay is very similar to the first game, with mostly text based screens (although they are more colourful than the original and usually contain at least basic graphical elements). Input is mostly by moving a cursor (using either joystick or mouse depending on system), rather than entering numbers. The game again starts the player, whichever team is chosen, in division four with a random allocation of players and the player must attempt to gain promotion to division one but now, as well as the FA Cup, the player can also compete in the League Cup so eventually attempt to win the treble. Added features include team sponsorship, a training screen which allows the choice of long or short passing tactics and the ability to place your players in positions on the pitch. This is done by moving boxes representing your players on a graphical screen while comparing individual opponent players' skills (although, like the first game, the opposing players are not named). This means opposing strikers can be man marked. Another main difference to the first game is the graphical highlights, now on all versions, that now feature the full length of the pitch over three screens rather than just the goal attempts. Also, at half time, substitutions and formation changes can be made. Reception Critical reception was generally positive although there were mixed reviews. In a highly positive review, based mainly on the ST version, Julian Rignall in C&VG; said the game was \\"simply a football fan's dream come true. It's a beautifully structured and presented game and is engrossing, challenging and very, very addictive\\" awarding a score of 9/10.Football Manager II review, Julian Rignall, C&VG;, Issue 81, July 1988 Sinclair User were similarly impressed, giving a score of 94% concluding that it is \\"an improvement on a legendary game. It still looks tatty but plays brilliantly\\".Football Manager 2 review, Graham Taylor, Sinclair User, Issue 76, July 1988 In contrast, Tony Dillon in a review for Commodore User gave the game only 2/10, labelling the game \\"a very big letdown\\" with \\"little or no improvement over the original\\".Football Manager 2 review, Tony Dillon, Commodore User, August 1988 Additionally he said the mouse control on the Amiga version was \\"apallingly bad\\" (a criticism also levelled in the positive C&VG; review). Football Manager World Cup Edition Development and release Football Manager World Cup Edition was again designed by Kevin Toms with various programmers for different systems (including Bedrock Software for all 8-bit versions). A main figure in the management of the game was lost and not replaced and with the deadline of the World Cup dictating the release date, Toms felt the game was rushed and unfinished. This was the last involvement Toms had with either the series or Addictive Games. The game was released in Summer 1990, to tie in with Italia '90, on all platforms Football Manager 2 had been as well as the MSX. The game was released in a 'big box' with World Cup wallchart and competitions including a chance to feature on the cover of the upcoming Football Manager 3 along with Kevin Toms (although this was never honoured as Toms had no involvement with that game). Gameplay The team talk screen on the Atari ST. The player can choose one of the three possible responsesGameplay was radically changed from the previous two games. The player chooses a national team and must qualify for and then compete in the World Cup (although choosing champions Argentina or hosts Italy skips qualification). Player names can be entered at the start of the game ensuring they are correct. Although there is no financial element or any transfers, the basic team management elements of the previous games are still retained. There is more detail in the team set up such as each player being given tactics. The highlights are again shown over 3 screens (although played from top to bottom rather than left to right) but there is also the option of watching from an overhead view of the whole pitch. The main addition to the game is the ability to talk to your players in the dressing room and to the press. A graphical screen is shown and the player can choose from a set list of phrases to answer reporters' questions before a game and motivate the team in the dressing room at half time. This affects the team's morale which in turn affects their performance. Reception The game was not widely reviewed but Your Sinclair gave a broadly positive review, particularly praising the new team talk and reporters' questions but questioning if it could win over new fans. It gave a score of 82% concluding \\"it's slick, well-programmed and it's got more depth than Marianas Trench [sic], but if you don't like management games you'll probably end up using the pictures of Kevin Toms to throw darts at.\\"Football Manager World Cup Edition review, Jon, Your Sinclair, September 1990 Spanish magazine MicroHobby gave the game a score of 60%.Football Manager World Cup Edition review, MicroHobby, Issue 202 The Spectrum version of the game went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind Italy 1990.http://ysrnry.co.uk/ys57.htm Football Manager 3 Development and release Football Manager 3, while already planned when Kevin Toms was still working with Prism Leisure on the World Cup Edition, was created without any involvement from the series' creator. Toms cited 'artistic differences' for the breakdown in the relationship between himself and Prism. The game was instead developed by Brian Rogers of Bedrock Software, who had actually been involved in programming the series since Football Manager 2. Release of the game was delayed. While a playable demo of the ZX Spectrum version was included on the cover tape of the September 1991 issue of Your Sinclair, with an expected release date 'a couple of months' later,Football Manager 3 playable demo, Your Sinclair, September 1991 the game was finally released at the end of 1992. Also, though versions were planned and advertised for all of the platforms Football Manager 2 had been released on, the ST and Amiga versions were never released.Football Manager 3 (unreleased) at Hall of Light The screenshots in the advertisements are not of any version that was released suggesting an ST or Amiga version had been developed. As the 8-bit systems were declining in popularity by 1992 and there were more complex competitors available for PC (and the other 16-bit systems that the game was never released for) such as Championship Manager and Premier Manager, the game sold poorly. Gameplay The manager's office screen on the PC. The picture of the team is highlighted so the player will go to the training screenThe game is completely redesigned and bears little resemblance to the previous installments. The game centres around a graphical screen of the manager's office with different parts of the game accessed by clicking on various items (e.g. the computer screen for results and fixtures, the picture of the team for training etc.). The game features a full 92 team league system (including the Charity Shield for the first time) and the teams begin the first season in the correct divisions (the 91/92 season for most versions, the 92/93 season including the newly formed Premier League in the C64 version)Football Manager 3 Original instructions reproduced at Stadium64 but the player's team, as in previous games, will always begin in the bottom division. The players, however, do not resemble real footballers and have random names (always shown with middle initials). The game always begins with a team of aging players with low skill ratings. There is much more detail for individual player attributes with three endurance and five skill values that can be altered through training. Each player also has a face which is shown when picking the team. Player contracts have to be negotiated and out of contract players will leave the club. The transfer market is much improved with each team in the league having named players for the first time with histories that can be studied when deciding to buy a new player. The matches are shown side-on with the whole pitch on screen. They are also meant to represent the whole game rather than edited highlights. Text commentary is shown at the bottom of the screen as the match is played. Unlike the previous two games, there is no chance to change tactics or substitute at half time. The team talk and reporter elements are also removed in this version. Reception The game was not as well received as previous versions. Philip Lindey in Sinclair User suggested it was \\"difficult to get excited about Football Manager 3\\" and that it was overpriced, giving an overall score of 73%.Football Manager 3 review, Philip Lindey, Sinclair User, January 1993 Stuart Campbell in Your Sinclair thought the game was \\"not quite up to the standard of Football Manager 2, to be honest, with vastly inferior presentation and graphics, and lots of hanging around while the computer thinks and doesn't seem to be working properly\\", giving a score of 70%.Football Manager 3 review, Stuart Campbell, Your Sinclair, January 1993 Amstrad Action awarded the game only 38%,Football Manager 3 review, Amstrad Action, Issue 87, December 1992 again claiming it did not live up to Football Manager 2. Legacy In 2001 Paul Robson developed an accurate remake of the original game by reverse engineering in C.Paul Robson's SDL Games \\"Football Manager - A remake of the (in)famous Sinclair Spectrum Football Manager game, complete with stick-man graphics. This is reverse engineered, so it should play identically.

They had one hit single with their cover version of \\"Poison Ivy\\", which reached #35 on the UK Singles Chart in 1964, but are primarily known as the forerunner to Procol Harum. Career The origin of the Paramounts is unclear. They were either formed as \\"The Raiders\\" in 1959 when the members were at secondary school, or were one of the first \\"manufactured\\" bands, the organisers of a band competition at the Palace Hotel in Southend forming a group out of the best musicians in the contest. The Raiders had Robin Trower and Chris Copping (guitars), Mick Trower (lead vocals; older brother of Robin Trower) and Gary Nicholls (drums; born 1945 died April 2007). The initial line-up of the Paramounts from September 1960, was Gary Brooker (piano, ex- Johnny Short and the Coasters), Mick Brownlee (drums; born October 1943, Chiswick, West London died June 2017, ex-Mickey Law and the Outlaws), Chris Copping (bass), Bob Scott (vocals, ex-Bob Scott and the Clansmen) and Robin Trower (guitar). Scott soon left, and Brooker became the vocalist, but as he was only 14, this made playing in licensed premises difficult, so they started performing in Trower's father's cafe, which became The Shades Club. Copping left in December 1962 and Brownlee left in September 1963, and were replaced by Diz Derrick (bass; born Grahame Derrick, 11 December 1944, Upminster, Essex) and B J Wilson (drums). Their musical style evolved from their initial R&B; towards soul and by 1963 they were regularly playing in London, and were signed by Parlophone. In late 1964 and early 1965 they had Phil Wainman on drums (born Philip Neil Wainman, 7 June 1946, Hampton Court), briefly replaced Wilson who went to Jimmy Powell and the Five Dimensions. Their first single, \\"Poison Ivy\\", produced by Ron Richards, was a cover of the Leiber and Stoller song, which had been a hit for The Coasters in 1959. It became a minor hit for the Paramounts, reaching #35 on the UK Singles Chart, which led to them appearing on TV shows such as Ready Steady Go!. Their second and third singles \\"Bad Blood\\" and \\"I'm the One who Loves You\\" both failed to chart, but the B side of the third single \\"It Won't Be Long\\" was the first song written by Brooker and Trower to be released. In search of another hit, subsequent singles were in different styles, but none of them charted. They became backing musicians on European tours by Sandie Shaw and Chris Andrews and the Paramounts eventually disbanded in 1966. Brooker concentrated on writing music, collaborating with Keith Reid, and Matthew Fisher (organ), and they recorded \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\". Needing a band to tour and promote the record, Brooker convinced Trower and Wilson to rejoin them, and augmented this with David Knights (bass). By 1969 Knights and Fisher had left and Chris Copping rejoined. Liquorice John Death A friend of the musicians, Dave Mundy, disliked the name \\"Paramounts\\", which had been given to them by their manager, and wanted them to be called \\"Liquorice John Death\\". Mundy committed suicide in 1972, but left his possessions to Trower, including a painting of an album cover for an imaginary album by 'Liquorice John Death', which Mundy had called Ain't Nothin' to Get Excited About. In 1969, after Fisher and Knights had left Procol Harum, and Copping had joined, the line-up had evolved into the Paramounts' final line-up, minus Diz Derrick. At a practice/rehearsal in January 1970 the new line-up recorded 38 songs at Abbey Road Studios. Largely R&B; covers that they had originally played as the \\"Paramounts\\", or songs in a similar vein, 13 of the tracks were mixed by Chris Thomas but the recordings were shelved. An album containing all the Paramounts' singles, called Whiter Shades of R&B;, was issued in 1983. In 1998 all the known original Paramounts recordings were remastered, as were six of the 38 tracks recorded by Procol Harum, in the Paramounts' style, in 1970. These remastered tracks were issued on a CD using Mundy's band and album names, and his cover art. The CD was re-released in 2005 by Friday Music, without Mundy's cover.

They are single-celled organisms with no true nuclear membrane (prokaryotic organisms). The taxon Monera was first proposed as a phylum by Ernst Haeckel in 1866. Subsequently, the phylum was elevated to the rank of kingdom in 1925 by Édouard Chatton. The last commonly accepted mega-classification with the taxon Monera was the five-kingdom classification system established by Robert Whittaker in 1969. Under the three-domain system of taxonomy, introduced by Carl Woese in 1977, which reflects the evolutionary history of life, the organisms found in kingdom Monera have been divided into two domains, Archaea and Bacteria (with Eukarya as the third domain). Furthermore, the taxon Monera is paraphyletic (does not include all descendants of their most-recent common ancestor), as Archaea and Eukarya are currently believed to be more closely related than either is to Bacteria. The term \\"moneran\\" is the informal name of members of this group and is still sometimes used (as is the term \\"prokaryote\\") to denote a member of either domain. Most bacteria were classified under Monera; however, some Cyanobacteria (often called the blue-green algae) were initially classified under Plantae due to their ability to photosynthesize. History Haeckel's classification Tree of Life in Generelle Morphologie der Organismen (1866) Traditionally the natural world was classified as animal, vegetable, or mineral as in Systema Naturae. After the development of the microscope, attempts were made to fit microscopic organisms into either the plant or animal kingdoms. In 1675, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria and called them \\"animalcules\\", assigning them to the class Vermes of the Animalia. Due to the limited tools — the sole references for this group were shape, behaviour, and habitat — the description of genera and their classification was extremely limited, which was accentuated by the perceived lack of importance of the group. Ten years after The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, in 1866 Ernst Haeckel, a supporter of evolutionary theory, proposed a three-kingdom system that added the Protista as a new kingdom that contained most microscopic organisms. One of his eight major divisions of Protista was composed of the monerans (called Moneres by Haeckel), which he defined as completely structure-less and homogeneous organisms, consisting only of a piece of plasma. Haeckel's Monera included not only bacterial groups of early discovery but also several small eukaryotic organisms; in fact the genus Vibrio is the only bacterial genus explicitly assigned to the phylum, while others are mentioned indirectly, which led Copeland to speculate that Haeckel considered all bacteria to belong to the genus Vibrio, ignoring other bacterial genera. One notable exception were the members of the modern phylum Cyanobacteria, such as Nostoc, which were placed in the phylum Archephyta of Algae (vide infra: Blue-green algae). The Neolatin noun Monera and the German noun Moneren/Moneres are derived from the ancient Greek noun moneres, which Haeckel stated meant \\"simple\\"; however, it actually means \\"single, solitary\\".. Haeckel also describes the protist genus Monas in the two pages about Monera in his 1866 book. The informal name of a member of the Monera was initially moneron, but later moneran was used. Due to its lack of features, the phylum was not fully subdivided, but the genera therein were divided into two groups: * die Gymnomoneren (no envelope [sic.]): Gymnomonera ** Protogenes — such as Protogenes primordialis, an unidentified amoeba (eukaryote) and not a bacterium ** Protamaeba— an incorrectly described/fabricated species ** Vibrio — a genus of comma-shaped bacteria first described in 1854PACINI (F.): Osservazione microscopiche e deduzioni patologiche sul cholera asiatico. Gazette Medicale de Italiana Toscano Firenze, 1854, 6, 405-412. ** Bacterium — a genus of rod-shaped bacteria first described in 1828. Haeckel does not explicitly assign this genus to the Monera. ** Bacillus — a genus of spore- forming rod-shaped bacteria first described in 1835EHRENBERG (C.G.): Dritter Beitrag zur Erkenntniss grosser Organisation in der Richtung des kleinsten Raumes. Physikalische Abhandlungen der Koeniglichen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin aus den Jahren 1833-1835, 1835, pp. 143-336. Haeckel does not explicitly assign this genus to the Monera kingdom. ** Spirochaeta — thin spiral-shaped bacteria first described in 1835 EHRENBERG (C.G.): Dritter Beitrag zur Erkenntniss grosser Organisation in der Richtung des kleinsten Raumes. Abhandlungen der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (Berlin) aus den Jahre 1833-1835, pp. 143-336. Haeckel does not explicitly assign this genus to the Monera. ** Spirillum — spiral-shaped bacteria first described in 1832EHRENBERG (C.G.): Beiträge zur Kenntnis der Organization der Infusorien und ihrer geographischen Verbreitung besonders in Sibirien. Abhandlungen der Koniglichen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, 1832, 1830, 1-88. Haeckel does not explicitly assign this genus to the Monera. ** etc.: Haeckel does provide a comprehensive list. * die Lepomoneren (with envelope): Lepomonera ** Protomonas — identified to a synonym of Monas, a flagellated protozoan, and not a bacterium. The name was reused in 1984 for an unrelated genus of bacteria. ** Vampyrella — now classed as a eukaryote and not a bacterium. Subsequent classifications Like Protista, the Monera classification was not fully followed at first and several different ranks were used and located with animals, plants, protists or fungi. Furthermore, Haeckel's classification lacked specificity and was not exhaustive — it in fact covers only a few pages—, consequently a lot of confusion arose even to the point that the Monera did not contain bacterial genera and others according to Huxley. They were first recognized as a kingdom by Enderlein in 1925 (Bakterien-Cyclogenie. de Gruyter, Berlin). The most popular scheme was created in 1859 by C. Von Nägeli who classified non-phototrophic Bacteria as the class Schizomycetes. The class Schizomycetes was then emended by Walter Migula (along with the coinage of the genus Pseudomonas in 1894) and others. This term was in dominant use even in 1916 as reported by Robert Earle Buchanan, as it had priority over other terms such as Monera. However, starting with Ferdinand Cohn in 1872 the term bacteria (or in German ') became prominently used to informally describe this group of species without a nucleus: Bacterium was in fact a genus created in 1828 by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg Additionally, Cohn divided the bacteria according to shape namely: * Spherobacteria for the cocci * Microbacteria for the short, non-filamentous rods * Desmobacteria for the longer, filamentous rods and Spirobacteria for the spiral forms. Successively, Cohn created the Schizophyta of Plants, which contained the non- photrophic bacteria in the family Schizomycetes and the phototrophic bacteria (blue green algae/Cyanobacteria) in the Schizophyceae This union of blue green algae and Bacteria was much later followed by Haeckel, who classified the two families in a revised phylum Monera in the Protista.Ernst Haeckel. The Wonders of Life. Translated by Joseph McCabe. New York and London. I904. Stanier and van Neil (1941, The main outlines of bacterial classification. J Bacteriol 42: 437- 466) recognized the Kingdom Monera with two phyla, Myxophyta and Schizomycetae, the latter comprising classes Eubacteriae (3 orders), Myxobacteriae (1 order), and Spirochetae (1 order); Bisset (1962, Bacteria, 2nd ed., Livingston, London) distinguished 1 class and 4 orders: Eubacteriales, Actinomycetales, Streptomycetales, and Flexibacteriales; Orla- Jensen (1909, Die Hauptlinien des naturalischen Bakteriensystems nebst einer Ubersicht der Garungsphenomene. Zentr. Bakt. Parasitenk., II, 22: 305-346) and Bergey et al (1925, Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, Baltimore : Williams & Wilkins Co.) with many subsequent editions) also presented classifications. Rise to prominence The term Monera became well established in the 20s and 30s when to rightfully increase the importance of the difference between species with a nucleus and without. In 1925, Édouard Chatton divided all living organisms into two empires Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes: the Kingdom Monera being the sole member of the Prokaryotes empire. The anthropic importance of the crown group of animals, plants and fungi was hard to depose; consequently, several other megaclassification schemes ignored on the empire rank but maintained the kingdom Monera consisting of bacteria, such Copeland in 1938 and Whittaker in 1969. The latter classification system was widely followed, in which Robert Whittaker proposed a five kingdom system for classification of living organisms. Whittaker's system placed most single celled organisms into either the prokaryotic Monera or the eukaryotic Protista. The other three kingdoms in his system were the eukaryotic Fungi, Animalia, and Plantae. Whittaker, however, did not believe that all his kingdoms were monophyletic. Whittaker subdivided the kingdom into two branches containing several phyla: * Myxomonera branch ** Cyanophyta, now called Cyanobacteria ** Myxobacteria * Mastigomonera branch ** Eubacteriae ** Actinomycota ** Spirochaetae Alternative commonly followed subdivision systems were based on Gram stains. This culminated in the Gibbons and Murray classification of 1978:GIBBONS (N.E.) and MURRAY (R.G.E.): Proposals concerning the higher taxa of bacteria. International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, 1978, 28, 1-6. * Gracilicutes (gram negative) ** Photobacteria (photosynthetic): class Oxyphotobacteriae (water as electron acceptor, includes the order Cyanobacteriales = blue green algae, now phylum Cyanobacteria) and class Anoxyphotobacteriae (anaerobic phototrophs, orders: Rhodospirillales and Chlorobiales ** Scotobacteria (non-photosynthetic, now the Proteobacteria and other gram negative nonphotosynthetic phyla) eg. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, E.coli. * Firmacutes [sic] (gram positive, subsequently corrected to FirmicutesMURRAY (R.G.E.): The higher taxa, or, a place for everything...? In: N.R. KRIEG and J.G. HOLT (ed.) Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, vol. 1, The Williams & Wilkins Co., Baltimore, 1984, p. 31-34) **several orders such as Bacillales and Actinomycetales (now in the phylum Actinobacteria) eg. Bacillus cerus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus. * Mollicutes (gram variable, e.g. Mycoplasma) * Mendocutes (uneven gram stain, \\"methanogenic bacteria\\" now known as the Archaea) Three-domain system In 1977, a PNAS paper by Carl Woese and George Fox demonstrated that the archaea (initially called archaebacteria) are not significantly closer in relationship to the bacteria than they are to eukaryotes. The paper received front-page coverage in The New York Times, and great controversy initially. The conclusions have since become accepted, leading to replacement of the kingdom Monera with the two domains Bacteria and Archaea. A minority of scientists, including Thomas Cavalier-Smith, continue to reject the widely accepted division between these two groups. Cavalier- Smith has published classifications in which the archaebacteria are part of a subkingdom of the Kingdom Bacteria. Blue-green algae Although it was generally accepted that one could distinguish prokaryotes from eukaryotes on the basis of the presence of a nucleus, mitosis versus binary fission as a way of reproducing, size, and other traits, the monophyly of the kingdom Monera (or for that matter, whether classification should be according to phylogeny) was controversial for many decades. Although distinguishing between prokaryotes from eukaryotes as a fundamental distinction is often credited to a 1937 paper by Édouard Chatton (little noted until 1962), he did not emphasize this distinction more than other biologists of his era. Roger Stanier and C. B. van Niel believed that the bacteria (a term which at the time did not include blue-green algae) and the blue-green algae had a single origin, a conviction that culminated in Stanier writing in a letter in 1970, \\"I think it is now quite evident that the blue-green algae are not distinguishable from bacteria by any fundamental feature of their cellular organization\\".Roger Stanier to Peter Raven, 5 November 1970, National Archives of Canada, MG 31, accession J35, vol. 6, as quoted in Sapp, 2005 Other researchers, such as E. G. Pringsheim writing in 1949, suspected separate origins for bacteria and blue-green algae. In 1974, the influential Bergey's Manual published a new edition coining the term cyanobacteria to refer to what had been called blue-green algae, marking the acceptance of this group within the Monera.  Summary Monerans are a group of organisms having prokaryotic structure. Archaea differ from Bacteria in having a different 16Ssrna. They also have a different cell wall structure.

He was a member of the prestigious Académie des Arcades de Rome. Life He débuted at the Comédie-Française on 16 February 1761, in the rôle of Zamore in Voltaire's Alzire. The Mercure de France for March wrote \\"This new débutant is an agreeable figure, and of an advantageous size. The organ of his voice is naturally beautiful. He shows much fire.\\" Reading this, he left the Théâtre-Français shortly afterwards to enter the company of Mademoiselle Montansier, holder of the theatre concession for Britanny and Normandy. Bursay thus spent 8 years as a theatre director, playing with the company in Amiens, Rouen and Nantes. In 1768, he reached Vienna and there met and became friends with Noverre. On Bruyas's return to Paris the following year, he débuted for a second time at the Comédie-Française on 15 January 1769, in La Métromanie by Alexis Piron and in L'Époux par supercherie by Louis de Boissy. After another stay in Vienna in 1772, he acted at La Rochelle before being taken on by Brussels's Théâtre de la Monnaie for the 1773-1774 season. He then went to Marseille, where he acted from 1775 to 1780 (with the exception of the 1778-1779 season, which he spent in Brussels), and there had printed several of his translations from Kotzebue. On 1 October 1776 he married Marie-Anne Moylin, daughter of two actors, in Marseille. Taken on again in Brussels in 1781, he stayed there until 1793, making more translations of Kotzebue than his own plays, in which he played the lead rôles. His daughter-in-law, Aurore Domergue, a singer at the Opéra de Paris under the stage-name Mlle Aurore, had several of his plays and translations put on in Hamburg, Saint Petersburg and Moscow under the name Mme Bursay.

In mathematical study of the differential geometry of curves, the total curvature of an immersed plane curve is the integral of curvature along a curve taken with respect to arc length: :\\\\int_a^b k(s)\\\\,ds. The total curvature of a closed curve is always an integer multiple of 2, called the index of the curve, or turning number – it is the winding number of the unit tangent vector about the origin, or equivalently the degree of the map to the unit circle assigning to each point of the curve, the unit velocity vector at that point. This map is similar to the Gauss map for surfaces. Comparison to surfaces This relationship between a local geometric invariant, the curvature, and a global topological invariant, the index, is characteristic of results in higher-dimensional Riemannian geometry such as the Gauss–Bonnet theorem.  Invariance  According to the Whitney–Graustein theorem, the total curvature is invariant under a regular homotopy of a curve: it is the degree of the Gauss map. However, it is not invariant under homotopy: passing through a kink (cusp) changes the turning number by 1. By contrast, winding number about a point is invariant under homotopies that do not pass through the point, and changes by 1 if one passes through the point.  Generalizations  A closed polygonal chain, with total curvature 2\\\\. A finite generalization is that the exterior angles of a triangle, or more generally any simple polygon, add up to 360° = 2 radians, corresponding to a turning number of 1. More generally, polygonal chains that do not go back on themselves (no 180° angles) have well-defined total curvature, interpreting the curvature as point masses at the angles. The total absolute curvature of a curve is defined in almost the same way as the total curvature, but using the absolute value of the curvature instead of the signed curvature. It is 2 for convex curves in the plane, and larger for non-convex curves.. See in particular section 21.1, \\"Rotation index and total curvature of a curve\\", pp. 359–360. It can also be generalized to curves in higher dimensional spaces by flattening out the tangent developable to into a plane, and computing the total curvature of the resulting curve. That is, the total curvature of a curve in -dimensional space is :\\\\int_a^b \\\\left\\\\gamma(s)\\\\right\\\\sgn \\\\kappa_{n-1}(s)\\\\,ds where is last Frenet curvature (the torsion of the curve) and is the signum function. The minimum total absolute curvature of any three-dimensional curve representing a given knot is an invariant of the knot. This invariant has the value 2 for the unknot, but by the Fary–Milnor theorem it is at least 4 for any other knot.

These criticisms are analyzed below. Introduction The evaluation of nonstandard analysis in the literature has varied greatly. Paul Halmos described it as a technical special development in mathematical logic. Terence Tao summed up the advantage of the hyperreal framework by noting that it The nature of the criticisms is not directly related to the logical status of the results proved using nonstandard analysis. In terms of conventional mathematical foundations in classical logic, such results are quite acceptable. Abraham Robinson's nonstandard analysis does not need any axioms beyond Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC) (as shown explicitly by Wilhelmus Luxemburg's ultrapower construction of the hyperreals), while its variant by Edward Nelson, known as internal set theory, is similarly a conservative extension of ZFC.This is shown in Edward Nelson's AMS 1977 paper in an appendix written by William Powell. It provides an assurance that the newness of nonstandard analysis is entirely as a strategy of proof, not in range of results. Further, model theoretic nonstandard analysis, for example based on superstructures, which is now a commonly used approach, does not need any new set-theoretic axioms beyond those of ZFC. Controversy has existed on issues of mathematical pedagogy. Also nonstandard analysis as developed is not the only candidate to fulfill the aims of a theory of infinitesimals (see Smooth infinitesimal analysis). Philip J. Davis wrote, in a book review of Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms by Diane Ravitch: : > There was the nonstandard analysis movement for teaching elementary > calculus. Its stock rose a bit before the movement collapsed from inner > complexity and scant necessity. Nonstandard calculus in the classroom has been analysed in the study by K. Sullivan of schools in the Chicago area, as reflected in secondary literature at Influence of nonstandard analysis. Sullivan showed that students following the nonstandard analysis course were better able to interpret the sense of the mathematical formalism of calculus than a control group following a standard syllabus. This was also noted by Artigue (1994), page 172; Chihara (2007); and Dauben (1988). Bishop's criticism In the view of Errett Bishop, classical mathematics, which includes Robinson's approach to nonstandard analysis, was nonconstructive and therefore deficient in numerical meaning . Bishop was particularly concerned about the use of nonstandard analysis in teaching as he discussed in his essay \\"Crisis in mathematics\\" . Specifically, after discussing Hilbert's formalist program he wrote: :A more recent attempt at mathematics by formal finesse is non-standard analysis. I gather that it has met with some degree of success, whether at the expense of giving significantly less meaningful proofs I do not know. My interest in non- standard analysis is that attempts are being made to introduce it into calculus courses. It is difficult to believe that debasement of meaning could be carried so far. Katz & Katz (2010) note that a number of criticisms were voiced by the participating mathematicians and historians following Bishop's \\"Crisis\\" talk, at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences workshop in 1974. However, not a word was said by the participants about Bishop's debasement of Robinson's theory. Katz & Katz point out that it recently came to light that Bishop in fact said not a word about Robinson's theory at the workshop, and only added his debasement remark at the galley proof stage of publication. This helps explain the absence of critical reactions at the workshop. Katz & Katz conclude that this raises issues of integrity on the part of Bishop whose published text does not report the fact that the \\"debasement\\" comment was added at galley stage and therefore was not heard by the workshop participants, creating a spurious impression that they did not disagree with the comments. The fact that Bishop viewed the introduction of nonstandard analysis in the classroom as a \\"debasement of meaning\\" was noted by J. Dauben.in Donald Gillies, Revolutions in Mathematics (1992), p. 76. The term was clarified by Bishop (1985, p. 1) in his text Schizophrenia in contemporary mathematics (first distributed in 1973), as follows: :Brouwer's criticisms of classical mathematics were concerned with what I shall refer to as \\"the debasement of meaning\\". Thus, Bishop first applied the term \\"debasement of meaning\\" to classical mathematics as a whole, and later applied it to Robinson's infinitesimals in the classroom. In his Foundations of Constructive Analysis (1967, page ix), Bishop wrote: :Our program is simple: To give numerical meaning to as much as possible of classical abstract analysis. Our motivation is the well-known scandal, exposed by Brouwer (and others) in great detail, that classical mathematics is deficient in numerical meaning. Bishop's remarks are supported by the discussion following his lecture: * George Mackey (Harvard): \\"I don't want to think about these questions. I have faith that what I am doing will have some kind of meaning....\\" * Garrett Birkhoff (Harvard): \\"...I think this is what Bishop is urging. We should keep track of our assumptions and keep an open mind.\\" * Shreeram Abhyankar: (Purdue): \\"My paper is in complete sympathy with Bishop's position.\\" * J.P. Kahane (U. de Paris): \\"...I have to respect Bishop's work but I find it boring....\\" * Bishop (UCSD): \\"Most mathematicians feel that mathematics has meaning but it bores them to try to find out what it is....\\" * Kahane: \\"I feel that Bishop's appreciation has more significance than my lack of appreciation.\\" Bishop's review Bishop reviewed the book Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach by Howard Jerome Keisler, which presented elementary calculus using the methods of nonstandard analysis. Bishop was chosen by his advisor Paul Halmos to review the book. The review appeared in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society in 1977. This article is referred to by David O. Tall while discussing the use of nonstandard analysis in education. Tall wrote: :the use of the axiom of choice in the non-standard approach however, draws extreme criticism from those such as Bishop (1977) who insisted on explicit construction of concepts in the intuitionist tradition. Bishop's review supplied several quotations from Keisler's book, such as: :In 1960, Robinson solved a three-hundred-year-old problem by giving a precise treatment of infinitesimals. Robinson's achievement will probably rank as one of the major mathematical advances of the twentieth century. and :In discussing the real line we remarked that we have no way of knowing what a line in physical space is really like. It might be like the hyperreal line, the real line, or neither. However, in applications of the calculus, it is helpful to imagine a line in physical space as a hyperreal line. The review criticized Keisler's text for not providing evidence to support these statements, and for adopting an axiomatic approach when it was not clear to the students there was any system that satisfied the axioms . The review ended as follows: > The technical complications introduced by Keisler's approach are of minor > importance. The real damage lies in [Keisler's] obfuscation and > devitalization of those wonderful ideas [of standard calculus]. No > invocation of Newton and Leibniz is going to justify developing calculus > using axioms V* and VI*-on the grounds that the usual definition of a limit > is too complicated! and > Although it seems to be futile, I always tell my calculus students that > mathematics is not esoteric: It is common sense. (Even the notorious (ε, > δ)-definition of limit is common sense, and moreover it is central to the > important practical problems of approximation and estimation.) They do not > believe me. In fact the idea makes them uncomfortable because it contradicts > their previous experience. Now we have a calculus text that can be used to > confirm their experience of mathematics as an esoteric and meaningless > exercise in technique. Responses In his response in The Notices, Keisler (1977, p. 269) asked: :why did Paul Halmos, the Bulletin book review editor, choose a constructivist as the reviewer? Comparing the use of the law of excluded middle (rejected by constructivists) to wine, Keisler likened Halmos' choice with \\"choosing a teetotaller to sample wine\\". Bishop's book review was subsequently criticized in the same journal by Martin Davis, who wrote on p. 1008 of : :Keisler's book is an attempt to bring back the intuitively suggestive Leibnizian methods that dominated the teaching of calculus until comparatively recently, and which have never been discarded in parts of applied mathematics. A reader of Errett Bishop's review of Keisler's book would hardly imagine that this is what Keisler was trying to do, since the review discusses neither Keisler's objectives nor the extent to which his book realizes them. Davis added (p. 1008) that Bishop stated his objections :without informing his readers of the constructivist context in which this objection is presumably to be understood. Physicist Vadim Komkov (1977, p. 270) wrote: :Bishop is one of the foremost researchers favoring the constructive approach to mathematical analysis. It is hard for a constructivist to be sympathetic to theories replacing the real numbers by hyperreals. Whether or not nonstandard analysis can be done constructively, Komkov perceived a foundational concern on Bishop's part. Philosopher of Mathematics Geoffrey Hellman (1993, p. 222) wrote: :Some of Bishop's remarks (1967) suggest that his position belongs in [the radical constructivist] category ... Historian of Mathematics Joseph Dauben analyzed Bishop's criticism in (1988, p. 192). After evoking the \\"success\\" of nonstandard analysis :at the most elementary level at which it could be introduced—namely, at which calculus is taught for the first time, Dauben stated: :there is also a deeper level of meaning at which nonstandard analysis operates. Dauben mentioned \\"impressive\\" applications in :physics, especially quantum theory and thermodynamics, and in economics, where study of exchange economies has been particularly amenable to nonstandard interpretation. At this \\"deeper\\" level of meaning, Dauben concluded, :Bishop's views can be questioned and shown to be as unfounded as his objections to nonstandard analysis pedagogically. A number of authors have commented on the tone of Bishop's book review. Artigue (1992) described it as virulent; Dauben (1996), as vitriolic; Davis and Hauser (1978), as hostile; Tall (2001), as extreme. Ian Stewart (1986) compared Halmos' asking Bishop to review Keisler's book, to inviting Margaret Thatcher to review Das Kapital. Katz & Katz (2010) point out that :Bishop is criticizing apples for not being oranges: the critic (Bishop) and the criticized (Robinson's non-standard analysis) do not share a common foundational framework. They further note that :Bishop's preoccupation with the extirpation of the law of excluded middle led him to criticize classical mathematics as a whole in as vitriolic a manner as his criticism of non- standard analysis. G. Stolzenberg responded to Keisler's Notices criticisms of Bishop's review in a letter, also published in The Notices. Stolzenberg argues that the criticism of Bishop's review of Keisler's calculus book is based on the false assumption that they were made in a constructivist mindset whereas Stolzenberg believes that Bishop read it as it was meant to be read: in a classical mindset. Connes' criticism In \\"Brisure de symétrie spontanée et géométrie du point de vue spectral\\", Journal of Geometry and Physics 23 (1997), 206–234, Alain Connes wrote: :\\"The answer given by non-standard analysis, namely a nonstandard real, is equally disappointing: every non- standard real canonically determines a (Lebesgue) non-measurable subset of the interval [0, 1], so that it is impossible (Stern, 1985) to exhibit a single [nonstandard real number]. The formalism that we propose will give a substantial and computable answer to this question.\\" In his 1995 article \\"Noncommutative geometry and reality\\" Connes develops a calculus of infinitesimals based on operators in Hilbert space. He proceeds to \\"explain why the formalism of nonstandard analysis is inadequate\\" for his purposes. Connes points out the following three aspects of Robinson's hyperreals: (1) a nonstandard hyperreal \\"cannot be exhibited\\" (the reason given being its relation to nonmeasurable sets); (2) \\"the practical use of such a notion is limited to computations in which the final result is independent of the exact value of the above infinitesimal. This is the way nonstandard analysis and ultraproducts are used [...]\\". (3) the hyperreals are commutative. Katz & Katz analyze Connes' criticisms of nonstandard analysis, and challenge the specific claims (1) and (2).See Katz & Katz (2011) With regard to (1), Connes' own infinitesimals similarly rely on non-constructive foundational material, such as the existence of a Dixmier trace. With regard to (2), Connes presents the independence of the choice of infinitesimal as a feature of his own theory. Kanovei et al. (2012) analyze Connes' contention that nonstandard numbers are \\"chimerical\\". They note that the content of his criticism is that ultrafilters are \\"chimerical\\", and point out that Connes exploited ultrafilters in an essential manner in his earlier work in functional analysis. They analyze Connes' claim that the hyperreal theory is merely \\"virtual\\". Connes' references to the work of Robert Solovay suggest that Connes means to criticize the hyperreals for allegedly not being definable. If so, Connes' claim concerning the hyperreals is demonstrably incorrect, given the existence of a definable model of the hyperreals constructed by Vladimir Kanovei and Saharon Shelah (2004). Kanovei et al. (2012) also provide a chronological table of increasingly vitriolic epithets employed by Connes to denigrate nonstandard analysis over the period between 1995 and 2007, starting with \\"inadequate\\" and \\"disappointing\\" and culminating with \\"the end of the road for being 'explicit'\\". Katz & Leichtnam (2013) note that \\"two-thirds of Connes' critique of Robinson's infinitesimal approach can be said to be incoherent, in the specific sense of not being coherent with what Connes writes (approvingly) about his own infinitesimal approach.\\" Halmos' remarks Paul Halmos writes in \\"Invariant subspaces\\", American Mathematical Monthly 85 (1978) 182-183 as follows: :\\"the extension to polynomially compact operators was obtained by Bernstein and Robinson (1966). They presented their result in the metamathematical language called non-standard analysis, but, as it was realized very soon, that was a matter of personal preference, not necessity.\\" Halmos writes in (Halmos 1985) as follows (p. 204): :The Bernstein–Robinson proof [of the invariant subspace conjecture of Halmos] uses non-standard models of higher order predicate languages, and when [Robinson] sent me his reprint I really had to sweat to pinpoint and translate its mathematical insight. While commenting on the \\"role of non-standard analysis in mathematics\\", Halmos writes (p. 204): :For some other[... mathematicians], who are against it (for instance Errett Bishop), it's an equally emotional issue... Halmos concludes his discussion of nonstandard analysis as follows (p. 204): :it's a special tool, too special, and other tools can do everything it does. It's all a matter of taste. Katz & Katz (2010) note that :Halmos's anxiousness to evaluate Robinson's theory may have involved a conflict of interests [...] Halmos invested considerable emotional energy (and sweat, as he memorably puts it in his autobiography) into his translation of the Bernstein–Robinson result [...] [H]is blunt unflattering comments appear to retroactively justify his translationist attempt to deflect the impact of one of the first spectacular applications of Robinson's theory. Comments by Bos and Medvedev Leibniz historian Henk Bos (1974) acknowledged that Robinson's hyperreals provide :[a] preliminary explanation of why the calculus could develop on the insecure foundation of the acceptance of infinitely small and infinitely large quantities. F. Medvedev (1998) further points out that :[n]onstandard analysis makes it possible to answer a delicate question bound up with earlier approaches to the history of classical analysis. If infinitely small and infinitely large magnitudes are regarded as inconsistent notions, how could they [have] serve[d] as a basis for the construction of so [magnificent] an edifice of one of the most important mathematical disciplines?

Among the cultural achievements of the native people's belief systems, and culture in general, that are notable in many ethnic societies, range from agriculture, societal and environmental concepts, spiritual beliefs, up to advances in technology, science, and the arts. Summary of achievements The following are the notable achievements of the natives of the pre-colonial archipelago between the 16th century to the 9th century, and most likely even farther. Many of the achievements have been lost or retrofitted due to more than three centuries of colonial rule beginning in the middle of the 16th century and ending in the middle of the 20th century. *Development and expertise in indigenous martial arts and warfare *High respect for the natural world, including the spiritual realms and its beings, which are all seen as part of all the affairs of every life on earth, thus envisioned as an interconnected web, where one action affects the other, whether directly or indirectly *Development of an organized system of communities, with laws enacted to promote social welfare and to protect nature, the spirits, and the people *Expansion of indigenous educational systems and writing systems through focusing on belief systems, epics, and other mediums that exhibit good values of an egalitarian societyFrancia, Luis (2010).

For example, in pre-colonial Visayas, the staple crops such as rice, millet, bananas and root crops were grown in swiddens (kaingin). While rice was highly valued and was the preferred food, the most common food all year round were actually root crops, and in some areas the only available crop for most of the year were root crops such as taro and yam. The historian William Henry Scott also noted that pre-colonial Visayan farmers neither knew the plow nor the carabao before the arrival of the Spaniards while the anthropologist Robert B. Fox described the Mangyans of Mindoro as sedentary agriculturalists who farm without the plow and the carabao. In fact, it is well known among historians that the plow technology and the harnessing of the domesticated carabao for plowing were introduced and disseminated by the Spanish friars to finance the colonial enterprise, a fact which is often elided in most Philippine nationalist histories. Similarly, the building of the rice terraces of the Cordilleras started around 1650 and coincided with the arrival of the Spaniards in northern Luzon; this notion is supported by archeological evidence collected from five major sites (Old Kiangan Village, Hapao, Nagacadan, Batad, and Banaue) by the Ifugao Archeological Project, thus falsifying the previously accepted notion that the rice terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras have a 2000-year-old origin. The anthropologist Stephen Acabado noted that the adoption of wet-rice agriculture in the Cordillera highlands and the subsequent landscape modification for terraced wet-rice cultivation were part of the strategy of resistance of the highlanders from the Spanish conquest, as the modified landscape served as zones of refuge. William Henry Scott also noted that the swiddening techniques employed by the pre-colonial Visayans were not destructive, as evidenced by the fact that most of the Visayan settlements around that time were permanent. The people did not see the need to resort to cutting into virgin woodland each time but due to the balance between the population and the available land available to them, reuse of previously abandoned swidden areas which underwent forest regeneration was possible. Martial arts and weaponry 250px 18th-century engraving of a Philippine 250px The most intimate weapon wielded by pre- colonial inhabitants of the Philippines was the balaraw, a dagger with a double-edged leaf-shaped blade and a cross-shaped hilt which at times was used as a protection against wrist cuts. They are typically 20-25 centimeters long, although there were smaller versions given to youngsters since even a boy felt naked without one. Pre-colonial Filipinos use two kinds of swords for combat, the kris and the kampilan. The kris (also called in Visayan as kalis) is a double-edged blade, which can be either completely straight (called sundang) or completely wavy (called kiwo-kiwo). The kris blades were forged from layers of different grades of steel, which gave them a damascened appearance. The Visayan kris was considered inferior compared to those from Mindanao and Sulu, and these in turn were less esteemed compared to the imports from Makassar and Borneo. The blade of the kampilan on the other hand is long and straight with a single edge which widens to a dual point. Like the kris, it was coated with poison before combat and the propagated fiction that an arcane alchemy was used to render the kampilan blade poisonous certainly increased its market value. The kampilan was never manufactured by the Visayan smiths but imported from Mindanao. Those with access to foreign imports also possessed Japanese swords (or katana) as weapon of war. For protection, they wielded padded armor and carabao-hide breastplates, and long narrow shields called kalasag, or round bucklers called palisay. People who had access to foreign imports may also possess the Chinese peaked helmet, also called or in Tagalog. The Bornean arquebus called astinggal (etymologically derived from Malay istinggar, ultimately from Portuguese espingarda) was also known by the pre-colonial Filipinos, however the Spaniards never faced any in their encounters in Luzon as they did in Mindanao. While historical and archeological evidences suggest that the pre-colonial inhabitants of the Philippines were a metal-using people, they did not possess the metallurgical knowledge of locally forging war cannons. The archeological researcher Eusebio Dizon noted that the pre- colonial Filipinos were capable of forging the small cannons, called lantakas, although they are not used for warfare but as ornaments for interior decoration. As far as current archeological data is concerned, pre-colonial Filipinos were not capable of founding the heavy European-style cannons used in sixteenth-century warfare. Despite this, lantakas did find a place in Philippine warfare, as witnessed for example by the soldiers of Juan de Salcedo during the conquest of Luzon. Education and writing Laguna Copperplate Inscription (c. 900), a thin copperplate document measuring less than 8×12 inches in size, shows heavy Hindu-Malayan cultural influences present in the Philippines during the 10th century Early chroniclers, who came during the first Spanish expeditions to the islands noted the proficiency of some of the natives, especially the chieftain and local kings, in Sanskrit, Old Javanese, Old Malay, and several other languages.Bergreen, Laurence.Over The Edge of The World: Magellan’s Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe.

A Jesuit priest wrote in 1604 that \\"So accustomed are all these islanders to writing and reading that there is scarcely a man, and much less a woman, who cannot read and write in the letters proper to [Luzon]\\".

Some of them used compasses similar to those used among maritime communities of Borneo and traders of China, although most had no need for such devices. In modern times, some fishermen and traders in the Visayas, Mindanao, Sulu and Palawan are still able to navigate long distances over open water without the use of modern navigational instruments. Ancient Philippine Civilization. Accessed January 7, 2013.(archived from the original on December 1, 2007 Philippine ships, such as the karakao or korkoa were of excellent quality and some of them were used by the Spaniards in expeditions against rebellious tribes and Dutch and British forces. Some of the larger rowed vessels held up to a hundred rowers on each side besides a contingent of armed troops. Generally, the larger vessels held at least one lantaka at the front of the vessel or another one placed at the stern. Philippine sailing ships called praos had double sails that seemed to rise well over a hundred feet from the surface of the water. Despite their large size, these ships had double outriggers. Some of the larger sailing ships, however, did not have outriggers. Communities of the ancient Philippines were active in international trade, and they used the ocean as natural highways.From the mountains to the seas . Mallari, Perry Gil S. The Manila Times. January 18, 2009. Ancient peoples were engaged in long-range trading with their Asian neighbors as far as west as Maldives and as far as north as Japan. Some historians proposed that they also had regular contacts with the people of Western Micronesia due to it being the only area in the Oceania that had rice crops, tuba (fermented coconut sap), and a tradition of betel nut chewing when the first Europeans arrived there. The uncanny resemblance of complex body tattoos among the Visayans and those of Borneo also suggest some connection between Borneo and ancient Philippines. Magellan's chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta, mentioned that merchants and ambassadors from all surrounding areas came to pay tribute to the king of Sugbu (Cebu) for the purpose of trade. While Magellan's crew were with the king, a representative from Siam was paying tribute to the king. Miguel López de Legazpi also wrote how merchants from Luzon and Mindoro had come to Cebu for trade, and he also mentioned how Chinese merchants regularly came to Luzon for the same purpose. People from the region enjoyed extensive trade contacts and immigration with other cultures, such as Indians, Arabs, Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Thais, Malaysians, and Indonesians.The Cultural Influences of India, China, Arabia, and Japan – Philippine Almanac Cebu, a Port City in Prehistoric and in Present Times. Accessed September 5, 2008. Aside from trade relations, indigenous Filipinos were also involved in aquaculture and fishing. The natives made use of the salambao, which is a type of raft that utilizes a large fishing net which is lowered into the water via a type of lever made of two criss-crossed poles. Night fishing was accomplished with the help of candles made from a particular type of resin similar to the copal of Mexico. Use of safe pens for incubation and protection of small fry from predators was also observed, a method that interested the Spaniards at that time. Mining and Adornment Piloncitos was the currency in pre-colonial times.

Acta Medica Philippina, the National Health Science Journal. A couple from the nobility class in pre-colonial Philippines draped in gold. Mining in the Philippines began around 1000 BC. Early Filipinos worked in various mines containing gold, silver, copper and iron. Jewels, gold ingots, chains, bangles, calombigas and earrings were handed down from their ancestors and passed from generation to generation. Gold dagger handles, gold dishes, tooth plating, and huge gold ornaments were also used. Death masks made of gold dating back to precolonial times have also been discovered in the Philippines. In Laszlo Legeza's \\"Tantric elements in pre-Hispanic Philippines Gold Art\\", it is mentioned that gold jewelry of Filipino origin was found in Ancient Egypt. According to Antonio Pigafetta, the people of Mindoro were skilled in mixing gold with other metals, giving it a natural appearance that often deceived even skilled silversmiths. Indigenous Filipinos were also known for the jewelry made of other precious stones such as carnelian, agate and pearl. Some notable examples of Filipino jewelry include necklaces, bangles, belts, armlets and rings placed around the waist. The natives of the Philippines, especially the nobility class, were gold-draped, as depicted in the Boxer Codex (c. 1590), where nobilities in the Visayas and Luzon have been portrayed accurately. Among the many former kingdoms and states in pre-colonial Philippines, the Rajahnate of Butuan in Mindanao has produced the largest bulk and the most sophisticated gold crafts in the archipelago. Pottery Detail of jar cover of one of the Maitum anthropomorphic pottery (5BC-370AD) from west Sarangani. The ancient people of the Philippines had a rich tradition of pottery as verified by the finds at Ayub Cave in South Cotabato and other parts of the islands. Japanese texts mentioned trading expeditions to the island of Rusun (Luzon) for the highly prized Rusun and Namban jars of the area. Japanese texts were very specific about these jars being made in Luzon. The Tokiko, for example, referred to the Rusun and Namban jars as Ru-sun tsukuru or Lu-sung ch'i (in Chinese), which mean simply \\"made in Luzon.\\" These Rusun jars, which had rokuru (wheel mark), were said to be more precious than gold because of their ability to act as tea canisters and enhance the fermentation process. Pottery in the Philippines have different usage, depending on its cultural inclinations.

Societal norms In pre-colonial Philippines, both men and women enjoyed the same rights and privileges. Women, like men, can ascend the headship of families, villages, and cities.The History of Filipino Women's Writings by Riitta Vartti, An article from Firefly – Filipino Short Stories, Helsinki 2001 Women can also ascend the throne of a nation. In some cases, some queens have ascended as sole ruler, superior to her consort.Ibn Battuta, p. 888. Additionally, children and elders were given the same respect, as children were also noted as capable of things that an elder can do if given the proper training. Unwed mothers or fathers were not shamed, as many of their gods and goddesses were the same. Divorce was also practiced, and was highly accepted. Both women and men can initiate a divorce.\\"Philippine Gay Culture: Binabae to Bakla, Silahis to MSM (Queer Asia)\\", J. Neil Garcia, Virginity was considered by pre-colonial Filipinos as an impediment to marriage. The blood shed during the deflowering of a young woman was considered to be an impurity, so when a girl reaches her nubile years, a specialist in charge of deflowering was hired. According to Potet (2017) the man in charge of the operation may have also worn protective amulets to protect his penis from blood impurity. The term was used to refer to the pre-colonial ceremonies marking the nubility of the woman and was also used as a term to refer to the deflowering process itself. The practice of abortion and infanticide was widespread in pre-colonial Visayas, as it was considered a disgrace to raise a large family, presumably because having many children usually result to poverty. Abortions were carried out for unmarried women in pre-colonial Visayan society. In pre-colonial Tagalog society, infanticide was also routinely practiced for children born to unmarried women, however it does not appear to have been as widespread as in the Visayas. Infanticide through burying the child alive was also a practice in Pangasinan during the pre-colonial and early Spanish colonial period and it was carried out when a family didn't want or couldn't support the child. Unlike Visayans, the ancient Tagalogs prefer to raise large families, as evidenced by the numerous superstitions that encouraged fertility and the survival of infants. After marriage, women did not lose their name. In fact, if a woman was especially distinguished, either from her own merit or her family's merit, her husband usually took her name as she was seen as far superior to her husband. During this time, women and feminized men were also given high distinction as many of which took on the role of shamans (such as Philippine shamans), who also took on the role as interim head of the domain every time a datu, a male or female ruler,The History of Filipino Women's Writings by Riitta Vartti, An article from Firefly – Filipino Short Stories, Helsinki 2001 is absent or goes into a journey.

Ramón Otero Pedrayo (alternative spelling Outeiro Pedraio) (Ourense, Galicia, 1888 - Ourense, 1976) was a Galician geographer, writer and intellectual. He was a key member of the Galician cultural and political movement Xeración Nós. Biography Otero Pedrayo taught Geography and History in Burgos and Santander (Spain), before he went back to his natal city of Ourense. In 1918 he becomes a member of the Galicianist organisation Irmandades da Fala. He was a member of the Spanish parliament during the time of the Spanish Second Republic representing the Partido Galeguista (Galicianist Party) and the Republican Nationalist Party of Ourense. He was the first professor of Geography at the University of Santiago de Compostela. Apart from being considered the person who first introduced modern Geography in Galicia, he also was an accomplished writer as he demonstrates in his numerous essays, novels, plays and poems. He was also renowned as a great orator with a charismatic voice . In 1933, he addressed a speech at a rally during the Basque Fatherland Day organized by the Basque Nationalist Party at San Sebastián, Gipuzkoa (picture above). Some of his famous novels are Os camiños da vida and O mesón dos Ermos, where he provides a meticulous description of Galician rural life. In fact, his non-scientific works are often taken as historical sources, since they are quite accurate and rigorous in terms of localization, description and context. It must also be mentioned Arredor de si, a novel often considered to be a veiled autobiography. Among his vast scientific production the encyclopaedia Historia de Galiza (first published in 1962) stands out as a colossal project. Yet, in his many works he depicts with precision the history, geography, folklore and anthropology of Galicia. He is the first geographer to define Galicia as an Atlantic country, that is, of Atlantic and not Mediterranean culture. And together with archaeologist Florentino López Cuevillas he is one of the first researchers embarking in a systematic scientific study of Galicia's Celtic past.

Each sphere is in contact with 6 neighboring spheres. The Boerdijk–Coxeter helix, named after H. S. M. Coxeter and A. H. Boerdijk, is a linear stacking of regular tetrahedra, arranged so that the edges of the complex that belong to only one tetrahedron form three intertwined helices. There are two chiral forms, with either clockwise or counterclockwise windings. Unlike any other stacking of Platonic solids, the Boerdijk–Coxeter helix is not rotationally repetitive in 3-dimensional space. Even in an infinite string of stacked tetrahedra, no two tetrahedra will have the same orientation, because the helical pitch per cell is not a rational fraction of the circle. However, modified forms of this helix have been found which are rotationally repetitive, and in 4-dimensional space this helix repeats in rings of exactly 30 tetrahedral cells that tessellate the 3-sphere surface of the 600-cell, one of the six regular convex polychora. Buckminster Fuller named it a tetrahelix and considered them with regular and irregular tetrahedral elements.  Geometry  The coordinates of vertices of Boerdijk–Coxeter helix composed of tetrahedrons with unit edge length can be written in the form : (r\\\\cos n\\\\theta,r\\\\sin n\\\\theta,n h) where r=3\\\\sqrt{3}/10, \\\\theta=\\\\pm\\\\cos^{-1}(-2/3), h=1/\\\\sqrt{10} and n is an arbitrary integer. The two different values of \\\\theta correspond to two chiral forms. All vertices are located on the cylinder with radius r along z-axis. There is another inscribed cylinder with radius 3\\\\sqrt{2}/20 inside the helix. Architecture The Art Tower Mito is based on a Boerdijk–Coxeter helix.  Higher-dimensional geometry  30 tetrahedral ring from 600-cell projection The 600-cell partitions into 20 rings of 30 tetrahedra, each a Boerdijk–Coxeter helix. When superimposed onto the 3-sphere curvature it becomes periodic, with a period of ten vertices, encompassing all 30 cells. The collective of such helices in the 600-cell represent a discrete Hopf fibration. While in 3 dimensions the edges are helices, in the imposed 3-sphere topology they are geodesics and have no torsion. They spiral around each other naturally due to the Hopf fibration. The collective of edges forms another discrete Hopf fibration of 12 rings with 10 vertices each. These correspond to rings of 10 dodecahedrons in the dual 120-cell. In addition, the 16-cell partitions into two 8-tetrahedron rings, four edges long, and the 5-cell partitions into a single degenerate 5-tetrahedron ring. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - ! 4-polytope Rings Tetrahedra/ringCycle lengths NetProjection - align=center ! 600-cell 20  30  30, 103, 152200px 150px - align=center ! 16-cell  2 8 8, 8, 42colspan=2350px - align=center ! 5-cell  1 5 (5, 5), 5colspan=2350px }  Related polyhedral helixes  Equilateral square pyramids can also be chained together as a helix, with two vertex configurations, 3.4.3.4 and 3.3.4.3.3.4.

It is considered an important social custom and tradition in Greece. History People's markets were founded by Greek political leader Eleutherios Venizelos. Part of the motivation was to help local agricultural producers sell their fresh produce to the local population in nearby towns without the need of middlepersons, thus cutting down prices, and from this perspective the introduction of people's markets in Greece can be considered as an application of the commercial practice of disintermediation (or \\"cutting out the middleperson\\"). Sellers There are two kind of sellers in Greek people's markets: the \\"producers\\" (paragogoi, παραγωγοί) and the \\"professionals\\" (epaggelmaties, επαγγελματίες). The \\"producers\\" are farmers or beekeepers from nearby towns or villages who maintain their own agricultural farms or beehives and produce their own foodstuffs, such as fruits, vegetables, and honey. The \\"professionals\\" purchase foodstuffs from various sources and sell it in the people's markets, but they are not necessarily the original producers of the foodstuffs they sell. All sellers in people's markets have to display a card with their name in a place where consumers can see it easily, and on the same card they have to include what kind of seller they are: the producers can be identified by the words \\"παραγωγός\\" (paragogos, producer) or \\"αγρότης\\" (agrotis, farmer) alongside their name, while the \\"professionals\\" can be identified by the word \\"επαγγελματίας\\" (epaggelmatias) near their name on their cards. Sellers who sell foodstuffs and gardening equipment can be either \\"producers\\" or \\"professionals\\", while those who sell household equipment or various children toys and \\"do it yourself\\" tools are usually \\"professionals\\". Permits All sellers must receive a special permit by the government in order to be able to sell produce in a people's market. There are also strict professional and social requirements. There are two kind of permits: the \\"producer's permit\\" for the \\"producers\\", and the \\"professional's permit\\" for the \\"professionals\\". Permits, by law, are not given to \\"producers\\" over 65 years old or \\"professionals\\" over 55 years old. \\"Producers\\" must prove that they are the owners and farmers of a \\"family farm\\" (defined as a farm held by a farmer and the other people working on the farm are their husband or wive, children, or close relatives). Both \\"producers\\" and \\"professionals\\" need to have completed their obligatory military service, and before a permit is granted the military's office must equip the prospective seller's with a document proving (known as \\"type A\\" in Greece) that they have served the military or legally granted an exemption. Before a permit is granted, the prospective seller's application is examined by a committee of experts who decide whether the applicant can be allowed to sell products in ' in accordance with the local laws. \\"Professionals\\" are barred from undertaking any other profession, trade, or commercial activity after they are granted a permit to sell products in a people's market. They have to accept selling in the market as their sole income-generating trade, or vioporistikon epaggelma (life-earning profession) as it is known in the country. Products All ingredients of the world-famous Greek salad can be bought in laikes agores: tomato, cucumber, green peppers, olives, olive oil, and feta cheese. The oil and cheese may not be found in smaller people's markets, but those in major cities typically carry all ingredients. The Products sold in people's markets are typically those comprising a Mediterranean diet, known for its healthy qualities, and are key ingredients in the cuisine of Greece. They are mainly local food, known as ntopia (ντόπια) in Greek, such as fresh fruits (including, depending on the season, oranges, apples, watermelons, melons, strawberries, and others), vegetables (like cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, potatoes, broccoli, carrots, and others), leaf vegetables (e.g. lettuce or antrakla), chicken eggs from suburban farms, and fish (for example sardines, European seabass, red mullets) recently caught from nearby seas (often caught the same day sold). Usually local food sold in people's markets is produced by family farms within the same geographical region as the market, and the \\"producers\\" who sell the local foodstuffs in the people's markets are usually the farmers themselves who travel from market to market in nearby towns to sell their produce directly to consumers. Some fish sold in ' is imported from overseas, such as Norwegian salmon. All foods, including fish, usually state their place of origin on a card that is displayed together with the product. The \\"professionals\\" sell both local food and food imported from overseas, including avocados, mangos, yellow watermelons, cherry tomatoes, and other exotic fruits often bought from the tropics. Gardening products, including flowers, ornamental plants, nutrient-rich soil, and fertiliser are also sold in '. A few people's markets, usually in high-population neighbourhoods, also sell refrigerated seafood, cheese, salamis, and other produce which is preserved in refrigerators set up in the streets and supplied with electricity by diesel generators. Some ' also attract kantines, which also use electricity produced by diesel generators, and prepare and sell souvlakia, sausages-on-a- stick (souvlaki loukaniko), long-burgers-on-a-stick (souvlaki bifteki), bifteki (Greek stuffed hamburgers), soft drinks, et cetera.http://en.recidemia.com/wiki/Bifteki Bifteki recipe on Recidemia Most people's markets also sell traditional home-made/farmer-made olive oil, white wine, red wine, and other products, typically sold in 1.5 litre containers. In addition to the food market, there is often a market for clothing and kitchenware, with very low prices. In Chania, Crete for instance, this is as large as the agricultural market and as popular. Many of the vendors are Gypsies. See pix in link below. This is an important resource for many Greeks, whose salaries (e.g. 500 Euros for a police sergeant, married with 2 kids) make it impossible for them to shop in the stores. Prevalence People's markets exist in all regions of Greece, as each settlement with at least 500 people can have their own laiki agora. There are 44 separate markets in downtown Athens alone. People's markets can be founded in any city neighbourhood, town, suburb, or village with a population of at least 500 people. The markets are popular all over Greece, including the capital city, Athens, where there are 44 ' only in downtown, as well as other major cities such as Chania or Patras. They are organised once a week, the same weekday for each particular neighbourhood. Conveniences The sellers in the people's markets spend considerable amounts of time selling their produce to consumers, and as a result, at least in the area of Athens, the organisation responsible for organising the markets sets up mobile toilets (usually chemical toilets) for their convenience whenever a laiki agora is organised in a neighbourhood (typically once a week). Marketing aspects Personal marketing is important for the success of a seller in a people's market. Often, consumers buy from the sellers they know best, thus basing their purchase decisions on a trust basis. Chatting and frequent social interaction between sellers and consumers is very common, and is cited as one of the reasons many consumers prefer to buy from people's markets instead of supermarkets where the purchasing experience is often less personal. Consumers are able to choose each individual fruit, fish, or other product from the seller's pagos (a wooden installation where the products are put), putting their chosen produce in a paper bag or thin bag (plastic) which is then given to the seller for weight measurement. The local social custom is to choose the fruits or other fresh produce quickly without touching too hard, especially for sensitive vegetables such as tomatoes. Payment is almost universally done with cash in Euro, but a very small number of \\"professionals\\", usually those selling household equipment in high-income neighbourhoods of Athens, accept credit card payments (Visa or MasterCard) with terminals communicating with the bank through GPRS. Pricing Pricing is often by the kilogram, but per-item pricing is also common. Many sellers use the same price by the kilo for all their produce or across many different kinds of products within the same category (e.g. all apples having the same price, no matter whether they are red, green, yellow, or pink apples, although usually these varieties carry different prices in the general market) because in this way the consumer can place various products in the same paper bag and weighting is simplified a lot, thus achieving higher sales. This is common in apples and pears. Prices are always listed on a paper card displayed along with the produce. =Dynamic pricing= Sellers change their prices frequently within the same day, especially for sensitive products such as fish. The price is usually high early in the morning (8-9h00) and is lowered as the time passes, especially if the product does not sell well that particular day. The new price is advertised on paper cards and orally. The lowest possible prices can be found after the midday (particularly by 13-14h00), often less than half the original starting price. After 13h30 or on 14h00 the sellers can make significant discounts where large quantities of fresh fruit or unsold fish can be sold en-masse for extremely low prices. Sometimes parts of the produce can be given for free if the buyer has cultivated a personal relation with a particular farmer or other seller. Consumer demographics The demographics of the consumers visiting the people's markets are varied. According to the Municipality of Athens people of all ages and incomes visit the ', at least in the area of the municipality which includes the downtown of Athens (Kentro in Greek). Social aspects ' serve other needs of the lives of the Greeks apart from their consuming needs: they serve the need to communicate with fellow citizens. People's market are usually organised within a small area, typically a straight street, and the density of people buying foodstuffs can be quite high as the market is organised within a limited and strict timeframe (8h00-14h00). This, together with the varied demographics of the buyers as typically the whole town's or neighbourhood's inhabitants leave their homes concurrently to visit the same market, cause friends and acquittances to spot each other while they make their purchases. As friends find their fellow friends on the market they often stop to exchange news, tell jokes, or to participate in general socialisation. This social contact is particularly useful in cities, as it helps urban dwellers to stay in contact and maintain long friendships with their neighbours. In this sense, the ' can be thought as being a modern version of the agora of Ancient Greece. Buyers also engage in social contact with the sellers, which often results in friendship and stable, loyal, multi-year buyer-seller relationships. Organisational and legal aspects ' are supported by the government's tax income and their management is undertaken by various organisations that have a strict geographical scope. The Division of people's markets by Attica Region (Diefthinsi laikon agoron, Διεύθυνση λαϊκών αγορών) is responsible for the people's markets in the Region of Attica.

The church was built in 1661 by Paul Pálffy's (1589–1655) widow Countess Frances, née Khuen (died 1672).http://www.divine-name.info/worldwide/slovakia/bratislava2.htm It is an early baroque building built on the place of original Gothic church below the Bratislava Castle. The church is consecrated to St. Nicholas, the patron of sailors. His statue is situated in the stone niche above the main entrance to the church. The church is a protected cultural monument.  History  Statue of John of Nepomuk inside the church Archeological research from the 1990s identified the remnants of an 11th-century rotunda at the place of the current church building.http://www.bratislavskerozky.sk/sk/Cerstve- rozky/Historia/Kostol-sv-Mikulasa-v-Podhradi.html It was partially destroyed in 1270s then rebuilt divided into two floors, the lower underground floor serving as an ossuary. The surroundings of the church contained a graveyard that was active until the end of the 18th century. Probably in the half of 14th century the one-nave church of St. Nicholas was constructed in the original gothic footprints, the direct predecessor of the current church building. The church was torn down in 1526 together with many other sacral buildings outside of the Bratislava city walls in preparation of a Turkish siege. In 1661 the church was rebuilt by Countess Frances, née Khuen. Interior of the church was renovated in 1744. During the reign of Maria Theresa, in accordance with new rules about handling of the deceased a crypt was constructed underneath the church. It is a rather large room with burial chambers built into three of its walls. The crypt is accessible by a narrow staircase from a small extension building built against the southern wall of the church and it was later vandalized. In 1755 the church contained the altar of Saint Nicholas, altar of Saint Fabian, Saint Sebastian and the Holy Trinity. The altar of Piety was added prior to 1761, in 1779 the altars of the Saint Cross and altar of Saint Rosalia were added. At the end of the 18th century a new pulpit by Peter Brandenthal was installed. In the 18th century, the church was administered by the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin. In the half of 18th century the church become part of the Second Bratislava Calvary, which was constructed in Podhradie. After Podhradie was assimilated into Bratislava, the church was administrated by the Catholic funeral society of St. Nicholas (Slovak: Katolícky pohrebný spolok sv. Mikuláša) and it belonged to the St. Martin's Roman Catholic parish. As it was no longer used in 1936 it was given to the newly established Greek Catholic Church of Bratislava. At the end of World War II in 1945 the church roof caught fire and the building was reconstructed by the Greek Catholic Church (during the years 1945-1950).http://www.grkat.nfo.sk/Bratislava/historia.html (Slovak) The reconstruction was led by Father Jozef Haľko.Ján Babjak - Jozef Haľko: Otec Jozef Haľko a Emília Haľková (Slovak) In 1950 began the violent persecution of the Greek Catholic Church in Slovakia and the St. Nicholas church was given to the Orthodox Church. After the buildings surrounding the church were demolished in the 1960s and 1970s during the demolishion of a large part of the historical Podhradie, the static of the church was compromised. Visible problems were compounded by a lightning strike in June 1966 and by repeated vandalism by the local youth. The communist government approved the reconstruction of the church but it was carried out only partially.  Description  The simple one-nave church building is built in an east–west orientation. It contains a small wooden bell tower.

He is considered to be an important Italian abstract artist. Life and work Mario Radice, together with Manlio Rho, Aldo Galli, Carla Badiali and others, belonged to the art group named \\"astrattisti comaschi\\", a reference to early European experiences of abstract art. He was fascinated by rationalist architecture and was one of the first Italian artists to break from figurative art to join the abstract movement flourishing across Europe at the time. Radice worked closely with the most important Italian rationalist architects (Terragni, Lingeri, Sartoris and Cattaneo), reaching international popularity with abstract frescoes done between 1933 and 1936 for the famous Casa del Fascio of Como, a masterpiece municipal building by Giuseppe Terragni for the National Fascist Party. Eventually the frescoes were destroyed at the end of World War II but photographic documentation still exists. His works were shown in nine Venice Biennale from 1940 to 1979, in which he was exhibited in a personal room on three occasions. Recently (2007) some of his works were included in two big exhibits held in Milan's Royal Palace: Camera con vista and Kandinskji and Italian abstract art. Like the works of the other founder of the Italian abstractist school, Manlio Rho, Radice's art is recognizable for pure and harmonic geometric shapes in warm colors. Radice's works can be found in the permanent collections of many modern art museums, including those of Milan, Trento, Rovereto, Turin and Rome.

The California Desert Protection Act of 1994 created the Sylvania Mountains Wilderness and was added to the National Wilderness Preservation System. The wilderness is bordered by Nevada stateline on the east, Piper Mountain Wilderness on the west and Death Valley National Park to the south. Geography The Sylvania Mountains are a subrange of the Last Chance Mountains and straddle the California-Nevada border. There is no distinct crest, only rounded summits and ridges with many canyons, drainages and bahadas (fans of alluvial soil that have combined at the base of canyons). Elevations range from . Flora and fauna There are limited water sources, but the springs that do exist support mule deer, desert bighorn sheep, chukar, coyote, as well as ground squirrels and lizards. The wilderness flora is a mixture of Mojave Desert and Great Basin plant life. Joshua trees are numerous, as well as desert tea, hop sage, cheesebush, deerhorn cholla and in the highest elevations, single-leaf pinyon, big sagebrush and Utah juniper. Rare plants in the area include fernleaf fleabane (Erigeron compactus), a native perennial wildflower, and Mormon needlegrass (Achnatherum aridum), a native perennial that grows in Joshua Tree and Pinyon-juniper woodland communities. Recreation The hiking trails are closed four-wheel-drive roads and rise gradually from the bahada to pinyon woodlands in the higher elevations. The most rugged area is the White Cliff Canyon in the eastern portion with cliffs rising above the canyon floor. The wilderness is very seldom visited due to a lack of water and extreme temperatures in the summer months. Wildflower season is from March through May. Relics of mining activity are still present both within the wilderness and along the mountain range into Nevada.

Operation Eagle's Summit (Oqab Tsuka in Pashto) was a military operation conducted by ISAF and Afghan National Army troops, with the objective of transporting a 220-tonne turbine to the Kajaki Dam in Helmand Province through territory controlled by Taliban insurgents. Ending in success for the coalition, it involved many British troops, and was said to have been one of the largest logistical operations carried out by the British Army since World War II. The operation took its name from the eagle pictured on the insignia of the 16th Air Assault Brigade. Restoring Kajaki Dam The Kajaki hydroelectric dam was completed in 1953 with the aid of a loan from the Export-Import Bank of the United States,Damming Afghanistan: Modernization in a Buffer State, Nick Cullather, Journal of American History, Volume 89, Issue 2, Pp. 512-537. in order to provide electricity and irrigation to the population of Helmand and Kandahar provinces under the Helmand Valley Authority. It was supposed to house three turbines, but only two were ever installed, and after years of civil war, only one was still in service by 2001 In 2004, the United States started work on restoring the dam's capacity and bringing its output to 53 megawatts. One turbine was repaired in 2005, but the restoration was hampered by the difficulty of delivering new turbines to Kajaki through Taliban-controlled territory, that required a large-scale military operation. Alternate route TF Helmand (as lead planner) worked in conjunction with HQ RC(S) and TF Kandahar for four months in preparing the operation. They planned to avoid taking the most direct route, Route 611, which crossed several Taliban strongholds, and that was littered with IEDs placed by the insurgents and land mines left over from the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. Instead they planned to take the convoy carrying the turbine through the desert, following an itinerary codenamed \\"route Harriet\\", that was mapped by the Pathfinder Platoon weeks before the operation. The British tried to negotiate safe passage for the convoy, in some cases distributing cash sums to local elders, but these deals didn't work out. The Chinese-made turbine was delivered to Kandahar airport on the night of August 27, and was taken through the first part of the journey by Canadian troops, till it reached a meeting point in the desert, where it was taken over by British forces for the last stretch of the route through Helmand. It was broken down into seven separate loads, each weighing some 30 tonnes, and carried on HET trucks. After the transfer to British troops, the main convoy, composed of 100 vehicles stretching over four kilometres, included 50 Viking APCs, and Jackal and Mastiff vehicles. The whole Combat Logistic Patrol, as the convoys are called in military terminology, was made up of three elements. The Engineer Group (9 Parachute Squadron RE), the Command Group (CO 13 Air Assault Support Regiment RLC) and the Turbine Element (15 Air Assault Close Support Squadron RLC). Amongst the convoy were eight critical vehicles: * Four Transformers * Two Stators * One Upper Bracket Assembly * 80 Ton Crane Attack helicopters provided overwatch, while air support came in the shape of US, French and Dutch aircraft. Combat engineers provided support, by building and shoring up the road the convoy was due to travel on. Heliborne troops from the Parachute Regiment provided security for the convoy, by leapfrogging along its path. At the same time, a dummy convoy composed of 30 to 40 Danish vehicles advanced along Highway 611, escorted by the 1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, in order to deceive the Taliban into ignoring \\"Harriet\\". During the last stretch of the route, the main convoy was obliged to rejoin Highway 611, and travel through 4.5 miles of territory where some 200 insurgents were known to be active. The task of clearing the area was given to a force composed of 388 ANA soldiers and their 42 mentors from a Royal Irish Regiment Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team. After three days of intensive bombardment from NATO artillery, including MLRS rockets, and from coalition aircraft, the road was cleared of insurgents, allowing the convoy to reach its destination on September 3 at 2.30am. It took five days to travel 180 km, during which the convoy had endured very few attacks, and suffered no casualties through Taliban action. During this time British artillery fired 800 105mm shells and 54 rockets. The British claimed to have killed some 200 insurgents, but this could not be independently verified. Casualties One British soldier was injured in a Road Traffic Accident at Kajaki, and one Canadian soldier died and a further seven injured, when their vehicle struck an Improvised Explosive Device when returning to base. Outcome The operation was hailed by NATO as a significant victory, that would contribute to winning the \\"hearts and minds\\" of the Afghan people. Brigadier Carleton-Smith, commander of Task Force Helmand, described it as \\"the end of the beginning\\" of the fighting in Helmand. However, The United States Army Corps of Engineers estimated in February 2015 that the yet unfinished dam wouldn't be operational until March 2016. This is due to the demand for around 900 tonnes of concrete in addition to the 220 tonnes of equipment delivered by the convoy.

Totyu was born in the hamlet of Gartsite, today part of the village of Voneshta Voda, near Kilifarevo, Veliko Tarnovo Province, to the family of a cattle dealer. He studied in Tarnovo in 1840 and engaged in trade after 1842. Around 1850, he had a conflict with the Ottoman authorities which forced him to flee into the Balkan Mountains with a group of friends and become a hajduk. His band's area of operation were the regions of Tarnovo, Elena and later also Nova Zagora. Although he was captured and interned in the Tarnovo and Sliven prisons several times, he managed to escape and return to his hajduk activities, leading to the Ottomans announcing a big reward for his head. After escaping the Sliven prison in 1863, Totyu moved to Wallachia, where he actually adopted that name to cover his tracks. Actions of the rebel detachments of Panayot Hitov and Filip Totyu in 1867. In Wallachia, he got to know Georgi Rakovski and came to realize the need for an organized struggle against the Ottoman rule. On 17 May 1867 he crossed the Danube at Svishtov with a band of 35, with the intention reach the Balkan Mountains and join forces with Panayot Hitov's band which had moved into Bulgaria on 29 April. In Svishtov, the band was joined by several other volunteers and proceeded to move southward. In a forest at Varbovka, near Sevlievo, however, Totyu's detachment was surrounded by Ottoman military units and bashi-bazouks, with one volunteer reportedly facing 60 Turks. During the night, the survivors fled into the mountains, where, near what is today Botev Peak, Totyu and four of his men managed to meet Hitov's remaining forces and head to Serbia, where they participated in the Second Bulgarian Legion. Afterwards Totyu lived in Romania, constantly persecuted and arrested and forced to move to Russia, where he lived for longer and received a state pension. In 1875, at the time of the Herzegovinian rebellion, Hristo Botev was sent to Southern Russia by the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee to collect funds and recruit Bulgarian emigres and Filip Totyu in particular. He agreed to participate in a Bulgarian uprising and left for Romania, but the suppression of the Stara Zagora Uprising meant his idea to aid the revolutionaries with a band was thwarted. In 1876 he aided the Serbs in the Serbo-Turkish conflict and invaded northwestern Bulgaria with his detachment, but he was repulsed and returned to Russia, only to participate in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, which led to the Liberation of Bulgaria. After the Liberation, Totyu lived in the village of Dve Mogili, Rousse Province, where he engaged in agriculture and received a small military pension. He died on 23 March 1907.

Poetry Johnson's literature, especially his Lives of the Poets series, is marked by various opinions on what would make a poetic work excellent. He believed that the best poetry relied on contemporary language, and he disliked the use of decorative or purposefully archaic language. In particular, he was suspicious of John Milton's language, whose blank verse would mislead later poets, and could not stand the poetic language of Thomas Gray. On Gray, Johnson wrote, \\"Gray thought his language more poetical as it was more remote from common use\\".Life of Gray Johnson would sometimes write parodies of poetry that he felt was poorly done; one such example is his translation of Euripides's play, Medea in a parody of one poet's style alongside of his version of how the play should be translated. His greatest complaint was the overuse of obscure allusion found in works like Milton's Lycidas, and he preferred poetry that could be easily read. In addition to his views on language, Johnson believed that a good poem would incorporate new and unique imagery. In his shorter works, Johnson preferred shorter lines and to fill his work with a feeling of empathy, which possibly influenced Alfred Edward Housman's poetry. In London, his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the form to express his political opinion. It is a poem of his youth and deals with the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. As Donald Greene claims, \\"its charm comes from youthful exuberance and violence with which the witty invective comes tumbling out\\" in lines like: > Here malice, rapine, accident conspire, And now a rabble rages, now a fire; > Their ambush here relentless ruffians lay, And here the fell attorney prowls > for prey; Here falling houses thunder on your head, And here a female > atheist talks you dead. However, his second imitation, The Vanity of Human Wishes, is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe Christian ethics. These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but are part of Johnson's works as a whole. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and that happiness can be attained through virtuous action. Biography In terms of biography, Johnson did not agree with Plutarch's model of using biographies to teach morals and complement the subjects. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the subjects accurately, including any negative aspects of an individual's life. Although revolutionary and more accurate as a biographer, Johnson had to struggle with his beliefs against a society that was unwilling to hear of details that may be viewed as tarnishing a reputation. In Rambler 60, Johnson put forth why he thought society could not be comfortable with hearing the negative truth of individuals that they admire: > All joy or sorrow for the happiness or calamities of others is produced by > an act of imagination that realizes the event, however fictitious, or > approximates it, however remote, by placing us, for a time, in the condition > of him whose fortune we contemplate, so that we feel, while the deception > lasts, whatever motions would be excited by the same good or evil happening > to ourselves... Our passions are therefore more strongly moved, in > proportion as we can more readily adopt the pains or pleasure proposed to > our minds, by recognizing them as once our own. Also, Johnson did not feel that biography should be limited to the most important people, but felt that the lives of lesser individuals could be deemed the most significant. In his Lives of the Poets, he chose great and lesser poets, and throughout all of his biographies, he always insisted on including what others may consider as trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. When it came to autobiography, and diaries including his own, Johnson considered that genre of work as one having the most significance; he explains this in Idler 84, when he described how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort their own life. Lexicography Johnson's thoughts on biography and on poetry found their union in his understanding of what would make a good critic. His works were dominated with his intent to use them for literary criticism, including his Dictionary to which he wrote: \\"I lately published a Dictionary like those compiled by the academies of Italy and France, for the use of such as aspire to exactness of criticism, or elegance of style\\". Although the smaller dictionary was written for the masses and become the common household dictionary, Johnson's original dictionary was an academic tool that examined how words were used, especially those uses that were found in literary works. To achieve this purpose, Johnson included quotations from Bacon, Hooker, Milton, Shakespeare, Spenser, and many others from the literary fields that Johnson thought were most important: natural science, philosophy, poetry, and theology. These quotes and usages were all compared and carefully studied, so that others could understand what words meant in literature. Plays of William Shakespeare (1773 expanded edition) title page Johnson felt that words, in and of themselves, were meaningless, but that meaning comes from context. The only way to understand the word is to examine its usage, and a critic must understand lexicography before they can understand what people are saying. Later critics would attempt to create theories to analyse the aesthetics of literature, but Johnson was not a theorist and he used his ideas only for the practical purpose to better read the works. When it came to Shakespeare's plays, Johnson emphasised the role of a reader in understanding language when he wrote, \\"If Shakespeare has difficulties above other writers, it is to be imputed to the nature of his work, which required the use of common colloquial language, and consequently admitted many phrases allusive, elliptical, and proverbial, such as we speak and hear every hour without observing them\\". Shakespeare His works on Shakespeare were not devoted just to Shakespeare, but to critical theory as a whole, and, in his Preface to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous belief of the classical unities and establishes a more natural theory on what makes drama work: drama should be faithful to life. In particular, Johnson claimed that \\"Among [Shakespeare's] other excellences it ought to be remarked, because it has hitherto been unnoticed, that his heroes are men, that the love and hatred, the hopes and fears, of his chief personages are such as common to other human beings... Shakespeare's excellence is not the fiction of a tale, but the representation of life: and his reputation is therefore safe, till human nature shall be changed.\\" Besides defending Shakespeare, Johnson was willing to discuss Shakespeare's faults, especially his lacking of morality, his vulgarity, and carelessness in crafting plots. Besides direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. In his Preface, Johnson analysed the various versions of Shakespeare's plays and argued how an editor should work on them. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions that each contained errors from the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors deeming difficult words as incorrect and changing them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way, and, when creating his own edition of Shakespeare's plays, he relied on the thousands of quotations and notes that he used in crafting his Dictionary to restore, to the best of his knowledge, the original text.

In Europe it is known as the red-belted clearwing and in North America as the apple clearwing moth. The larvae create galleries under the bark of fruit trees, especially old trees with damaged trunks. During this process, the larvae cause significant damage to host trees. Particular attention has been paid to the damage they cause to apple trees. Their status as a pest of apple orchards has led to many research projects aimed at controlling populations of the moth. This moth is native to Europe, the Near East and North Africa. Recently, the moth was introduced into North America, being first detected in Canada in 2005. There are several organisms that threaten the larvae, including parasitoids, nematodes, and bacteria. Subspecies * Synanthedon myopaeformis cruentata (Mann, 1859) * Synanthedon myopaeformis graeca (Staudinger, 1871) * Synanthedon myopaeformis luctuosa (Lederer, 1853) * Synanthedon myopaeformis myopaeformis * Synanthedon myopaeformis typhiaeformis (Borkhausen, 1789)  Geographic range  Synanthedon myopaeformis is native to north Africa, western Asia, and Europe, where it is known as the red-belted clearwing moth. In 2005, it was discovered in southwestern Canada and has since been found in the United States. Throughout North America, S. myopaeformis is known as the apple clearwing moth because of its status as a pest of apple trees. Morphology Synanthedon myopaeformis Adults are blue-black in color with a dark orange-red stripe across their segmented abdomen. The moths have short, bushy tails. Their wings are clear in the middle with dark edges framed by short fringe. Wingspan varies between 1.8 and 2.8 cm at the forewings, with forewings narrower and longer than hindwings. Caterpillars are 2.5 cm long, with off-white bodies and a reddish-brown head. Pupae are around 1.5 cm long, and are golden brown with two tubercles, short projections, protruding from their heads. They can be seen sticking out of the bark of apple trees. Habitat Because the life cycle of the moth is dependent on host trees, S. myopaeformis is found predominately near apple orchards. They are also found in gardens, woodlands and hedgerows. The larvae feed under the bark of apple trees, crab apples, pears, quinces, plums, cherries, apricots, hawthorn and mountain ash, favoring old cankerous trees. In Canada, it has been found that both male and female moths are attracted to the flowers of showy milkweed (Asclepias speciosa) and that it is the phenylacetaldehyde produced by the flowers that attracts them. This substance can be used in monitoring populations of the moth or in mass- trapping them. Life cycle  Egg  Each female can lay up to 250 eggs. Eggs are laid singly on the bark of host trees, typically in cracks or damaged areas of the trunk and branches.  Caterpillar  After hatching, larvae bore into the bark of the host trees, digging into the phloem of the tree. As they bore through the tree, they leave trails of waste that are visible from the outside of the tree. Larvae mature on the host tree for two years. During warm weather, the caterpillars move along the bark of the tree feeding on young plant tissues, including the buds of apple trees. At the beginning of winter, the caterpillars once again bore into the tree to spend the cold season under the bark. They emerge in early spring to feed. Larvae repeat this feeding – wintering cycle once more before emerging and boring a final hole in the bark in which to pupate.  Pupa  After burrowing into the bark, larvae compose golden brown cocoons which stick out from the tree. Compared to the larval stage, the pupal stage is much shorter at two weeks.  Adults  Adults emerge from their cocoons in early summer.  Physiology   Flight activity  After emergence in early summer, adults are active in flight from May through August. Because Synanthedon myopaeformis thrives in warm weather, flight activity is temperature dependent. The adults are significantly less active on cold days compared to warm days. Flight activity ceases at the end of summer when average temperature drops to 15-16°C.  Color vision  In 2014, Judd and Eby found that S. myopaeformis does not discriminate between yellow, green and white or between purple, blue, red, and black. The moths also display different behaviors toward traps reflecting green (500-550 nm) and ultraviolet (300-400 nm) light. A second study by Eby in 2012 showed that the moths are sensitive to the same wavelengths of light shown in the previously mentioned study, suggesting that the S. myopaeformis could have dichromatic vision.  Enemies  Beauveria bassiana, a threat to the S. myopaeformis, seen growing on an Ithominae larva Bacillus thuringiensis, a threat to larvae The parasitoid Liotryphan crassiseta is a significant cause of mortality in S. myopaeformis.Nematodes, Steinernema sp., are a threat to larvae, and larva mortality following exposure to the fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium brunneum is common. Bacteria are another threat to larvae. In 1999, Shehata, Nasr, and Tadros found that significantly fewer adults emerged from cocoons after larvae were exposed to the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis.  Mating   Pheremones  Males of the species respond to sex pheromones released by the glands of females. A 2010 study from Judd, Gries, Aurelian, and Gries found that 3,13-octadecadienyl acetate is the primary sex hormone used by S. myopaeformis females. This chemical alone is enough to attract males, although the females do also produce secondary sex hormones in addition to 3,13-octadecadienyl acetate, these appear to play a minor role. Interactions with humans  Pest status  On a bud Native to Europe, Asia, and northern Africa, but recently released in Canada and the United States, S. myopaeformis has been recognized as a significant threat to apple trees in these regions. Because the larvae bore holes and tunnels under and through the bark of their host trees, the presence of the species is harmful to the health and production of these trees. Previously, damage caused by S. myopaeformis was associated primarily with old, damaged, or otherwise sick apple trees because the lack of integrity of their bark allows the larvae easier access to the inner layers of the trunk and branches. However, their potential to harm even previously healthy apple trees is now recognized. Because of this, many methods have been tested for controlling the proliferation of the moth.  Attempted control methods  = Pheromone disruption = One method of reproduction control involves the release of the S. myopaeformissex sex pheromone into orchards infested by the species. The technique, mating disruption, leads to a dampened male response to female sex hormones, disrupting the mating process. As a result of the overabundance of pheromones, the percentage of mated females decreases relative to unmated females. = Pheromone traps = Many research studies have used pheromone traps to monitor the population of S. myopaformis. The traps enable monitoring of infestations even when the population is low, and so are an effective reference to determine the best time to apply pest-controlling measures or plant growth regulators. = Other chemical lures = Other methods of control focus on luring and trapping adults. A Hungarian study found that both male and female red-belted clearwings are attracted to a combination of pear ester and acetic acid. Because many pheromone-based traps attract more males than females, this method is suggested as female-targeted trapping. = Other species = Each of the species mentioned above in the “Enemies” section have been used to control populations. These include nematodes, fungi, and bacteria. = Trunk coatings = Diverse materials have been used to coat the bark of apple trees in an attempt to kill S. myopaeformis eggs and larvae. In 2010, the effectiveness of cotton seed oil, lime, and motor oil were tested in decreasing the number of adults and pupae. All three materials reduced the number of adult moths during the second year, but the oils showed the greatest effect.

Gameplay The player is given a quest by an old man at the local tavern to rescue his daughter from the clutches of the local Count (a vampire), who resides in the nearby castle. Throughout the game, the player gathers items, which can then be manipulated to solve various puzzles. The text based interface, coupled with a visual display of the player's location, is similar in style to the Commodore 64 version of The Hobbit. Reception The game received notoriety amongst gamers as being impossible to fully complete, namely due to there being no known way to kill the count or achieve a full score of 290 out of 290. Grahame Willis, author of the game, has since revealed that it is not possible to kill the count and that messages suggesting so were placed in the game intentionally to frustrate players.http://solutionarchive.com/grahame_willis/ At the time of its release, it received mixed reviews. Your Commodore praised the game, describing its graphics as \\"very good\\" and its playability as \\"user friendly\\". Your Computer criticized the game, marking it as \\"fuzzy\\" to play.

The band consists of Rhiannon \\"Ritzy\\" Bryan (lead vocals, guitar), Rhydian Dafydd (bass, vocals) and Matthew James Thomas (drums, percussion). History Ritzy Bryan performing at Glastonbury Festival in 2010. 2007–2009: Beginnings and A Balloon Called Moaning Childhood friends and then couple Ritzy Bryan and bassist Rhydian Dafydd originally played together as part of Manchester band Tricky Nixon, which later reformed into Sidecar Kisses. After Sidecar Kisses split up in 2007, they regrouped, returning to their Welsh home town of Mold, and formed the Joy Formidable with Justin Stahley on drums. In July 2008, they released their first official single, \\"Austere\\". It was followed by a Christmas single, \\"My Beerdrunk Soul Is Sadder than a Hundred Dead Christmas Trees\\", issued as a 2008 digital download, and the \\"Cradle\\" double 7\\" in 2009. The band's debut EP, A Balloon Called Moaning was released exclusively in Japan on 17 December 2008, followed by a UK release in March 2009. In 2009, Stahley was replaced with Matthew James Thomas. That April, they teamed with a new label started by Passion Pit's Ayad Al Adhamy, Black Bell Records, to release A Balloon Called Moaning in the U.S, earning favourable reviews from NME, The Guardian, The Times, Spin and Pitchfork. 2010–2011: The Big Roar In 2010, the band signed to Canvasback Records, a subsidiary of Atlantic, and began work on their debut album, The Big Roar which was recorded in London.The Joy Formidable - Full Biography. MTV. Retrieved 15 December 2011. Dafydd said that \\"(it) covers a lot of emotional range. It's captured the battle between the eternal optimist and the manic depressive\\". The album was produced by the Joy Formidable with help from engineer Neak Menter. The band traveled to Los Angeles to mix it with producer Rich Costey, who had worked with bands such as Mew, Muse, Foo Fighters and Glasvegas. The Big Roar was released on 24 January 2011 and included early singles \\"Austere\\", \\"Cradle\\" and \\"Whirring\\" as well as two further singles, \\"I Don't Want to See You Like This\\" and \\"A Heavy Abacus\\" (\\"Whirring\\" was later sampled by the Lonely Island on \\"YOLO\\"). In November 2011, their song \\"Endtapes\\" was featured on The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn film soundtrack. 2012–2014: Wolf's Law and Aruthrol On 23 August 2012, the song \\"Wolf's Law\\", was released as a free download from their then-upcoming second studio album of the same title. Two official singles, \\"This Ladder Is Ours\\" and \\"Cholla\\", were released in late 2012, the former peaking at no. 24 on the US Alternative Songs chart.[ This Ladder Is Ours - The Joy Formidable]. Billboard. Retrieved 30 December 2012. The band's second studio album, Wolf's Law, was officially released on 21 January 2013 in the UK, and the following day in the U.S. Most of the writing for Wolf's Law was done on the road during the 12-month tour in support of their previous record, The Big Roar. Commenting on the writing process for the album, Bryan explained that the songs for the album were approached with vocals and one accompaniment (either guitar or piano) before being built upon, stating, \\"It's all about the lyrics, the voice and the melody\\". The vocals and guitars were recorded in January 2012 in Maine, while drums and additional orchestral and choir pieces for the record were scored and recorded by the band in February 2012 in London. Mixing duties for the record were handled by Andy Wallace while the records production was completed by the band. The album title referred to Wolff's law, a scientific theory by Julius Wolff which posits that bones may become stronger in response to stress as a form of adaptation. According to Bryan, this related to one of the major themes of the album, which is \\"relationships on the mend and feeling reinvigorated\\"; she continued that the album felt like the band reconnecting with themselves emotionally and spiritually. For Record Store Day on 20 April 2013, the Joy Formidable released a limited-edition 12\\" single of \\"A Minute's Silence\\", an outtake from Wolf's Law, backed by a live cover of Bruce Springsteen's \\"Badlands\\". \\"Silent Treatment\\" was later released as the album's third and final single in July 2013. In July 2014, the band began a monthly vinyl singles, titled Aruthrol, consisting of songs sung in their native Welsh language released as a double A-side with a contribution by another artist. Three singles, \\"Yn Rhydiau'r Afon\\", \\"Tynnu Sylw\\" and \\"Y Garreg Ateb\\", were released exclusively on 7\\" vinyl in collaboration with Colorama, White Noise Sound and Bloom & Heavy Petting Zoo. 2015–2017: Hitch On 27 January 2016, the band announced on their Facebook page that their third studio album, Hitch, was due for release on 25 March 2016. The band also uploaded a new song titled \\"The Last Thing on My Mind\\", accompanied by a self-produced montage music video consisting of clips of scantily clad or nude men, which Bryan explained to be in response to the over-sexualisation of women in modern media, stating \\"We don't condone objectification in general, the point here is, when the media representation is imbalanced, if we're mostly seeing women sexualised or objectified, from a male perspective or otherwise, it's limited, it's damaging and frankly; it's boring too\\". 2018–present: AAARTH On 26 June 2018, the band announced that their fourth studio album, AAARTH, was due for release on 28 September 2018. The band also joined Foo Fighters for a short tour.

Maria of the Palatinate (24 July 1561 – 29 July 1589) was a Swedish princess and Duchess of Södermanland by marriage, the first spouse of the future King Charles IX of Sweden. She died before he became king.  Biography  Maria was born in Heidelberg, to Louis VI, Elector Palatine and Elisabeth of Hesse. In April 1578, the Swedish Prince Charles, Duke of Södermanland, visited her home town Heidelberg and proposed. Maria was brought up to be an ardent Lutheran, and her religion and upbringing according to the principles of the Augsburg Confession was one reason why she was chosen by the sternly Protestant Charles.Karin Tegenborg Falkdalen (2010). Vasadöttrarna (utgåva 2). Falun: Historiska Media. She also spoke Latin. Her father accepted the marriage proposal on the condition that she be secured the right to practice her faith in Sweden which was then ruled by Charles' brother John III, who was known for his Catholic sympathies.Karin Tegenborg Falkdalen (2010). Vasadöttrarna (utgåva 2). Falun: Historiska Media. The wedding took place in Heidelberg 11 May 1579. Afterwards, she followed him to Sweden, where they resided in his Duchy in Södermanland. They left Germany in July, and in September 1579, Maria received the oath of loyalty from the subjects in her dower lands Gripsholm, Tynnelsö and Rävsnäs estates, Strängnäs city with the parishes Åkers, Selebo and Daga as well as Överenhörna and Ytterenhörna.

She accompanied him around the Duchy as long as her pregnancies allowed for that possibility. Maria remained a committed Lutheran: in letters to her father, she expressed her discontent with the spread of Calvinism in Simmern, and in 1585 asked him to send her a Lutheran preacher.Karin Tegenborg Falkdalen (2010). Vasadöttrarna (utgåva 2). Falun: Historiska Media.

History John Forrest, later Premier of Western Australia, recorded the name Clackline in 1879 but the origin of the word is unknown. A settlement was established in the 1880s, being at the junction of the Perth-Newcastle Road and the township was gazetted in 1896. It has also been known as Clackline Junction for the road and the rail junction.Clackline Junction Notes.(Correspondent calls for the establishment of a post office - publican Mr. McIver can no longer cope with the area's postal needs).

The railway service through Clackline was closed in 1966 at the time the Avon Valley route of the Eastern Railway was opened.Clackline - Toodyay, opened 1 January 1888 - closed 13 February 1966 - page 67 - Geography Clackline is in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, about east-north- east of Perth, and south-west of Northam. Clackline Brook is an waterway that runs from near Clackline towards Mokine before turning north and ending near Mokine Hill. Clackline Nature Reserve is on Refractory Road. Demographics In the , Clackline had an estimated population of 331 people. Economy The Clackline area produces some of the highest grade export hay (oaten) in Australia, and is home to wine growing ventures and an olive grove producing extra virgin olive oils. Attractions There are several historic sites, including heritage listed sites, located in and around the Clackline townsite. Avro Anson Memorial The Avro Anson Memorial commemorates four Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) airmen killed when their Avro Anson aircraft crashed near Clackline on 9 October 1942. The memorial site is located on the low side of Avro Anson Road, in a small park approximately south-east of Clackline. The memorial, assembled by members of the local community in the months following the crash, features a cairn of granite and boulders supporting a jarrah cross. The names and details of the deceased airmen − Flying Officer Lynton Birt, Sergeant Geoffrey Debenham, Sergeant Noel Nixon, and Sergeant Kenneth Hugo − are carved into the cross. Over the years, the memorial was forgotten and lost, overgrown by shrubs and trees. Upon its discovery in the early 1980s, the memorial's history and significance were researched, and it was restored in 1984 by volunteers from the Perth branch of the Royal Australian Air Force Association. Since then, the association has held annual memorial services at the site. Clackline Bridge Clackline Bridge is a historic road bridge in Clackline that carried the Great Eastern Highway until 2008. It is the only bridge in Western Australia to have spanned both a waterway and railway, the Clackline Brook and the former Eastern Railway alignment. The mainly timber bridge has a unique curved and sloped design, due to the difficult topography and the route of the former railway. The bridge was designed in 1934 to replace two dangerous rail crossings and a rudimentary water crossing. Construction began in January 1935, and was completed relatively quickly, with the opening ceremony held in August 1935. The bridge has undergone various improvement and maintenance works since then, including widening by in 1959–60, but remained a safety hazard, with increasing severity and numbers of accidents through the 1970s and 1980s. Planning for a highway bypass of Clackline and the Clackline Bridge began in the 1990s, and it was constructed between January 2007 and February 2008. The local community had been concerned that the historic bridge would be lost, but it remains in use as part of the local road network, and has been listed on both the Northam Municipal Heritage Inventory and the Heritage Council of Western Australia's Register of Heritage Places. Clackline Refractory The Clackline Refractory is a heritage listed brickworks site in Clackline, located on Refractory Road in a valley near Great Eastern Highway. An abundant supply of fine quality clay was discovered in Clackline in 1898, which led to the establishment of a quarry and refractory. By 1901, the industry was important to Western Australia, with the brick products from Clackline used by multiple government departments, the Fremantle Gas and Coke Company, and many goldmines. Other users of the bricks included the Railway Department, the Perth Gas Company, the Fremantle smelter, and the Great Boulder Perseverance Company. The Clackline Refractory also supplied bricks for the nearby pumping stations for the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme. , the site is in poor condition and mostly deserted, apart from stacks of various ceramic products. As well as kilns suitable for modern day production, the site has older kilns constructed from bricks, with corrugated iron roofs supported by metal poles. Alongside these structures is a large brick chimney. Lion monument The Clackline School lion monument In 1929, Clackline School's students and headteacher, E.W.Membery commemorated the 100th anniversary of British colonisation by building a monument. The monument features a sculpture of a lion, with a plaque reading: The sculptor of the lion was Archie H Paton, who has since been recognised with a nearby plaque. It is a stopping point on the Kep Track, adjacent to a picnic area and toilets. Rail heritage sites A restored rail carriage, serving as a museum, was installed by the now-defunct Clackline Railway Committee. The railway carriage has been used as a venue for community events, such as farmers markets and weddings, and now serves as the community post office. It is located south of Great Eastern Highway, opposite the old general store site, but a walking trail passing under the highway connects to the remains of the Clackline railway station. After the general store and local post office closed, the Clackline Progress Association decided the community needed a local post office. In 2018 they canvassed community support, which was strong, so volunteers cleaned up and opened a community post office. Government Clackline is located within the Shire of Northam. It is within the state electorate of Central Wheatbelt, and federal Division of Pearce. Infrastructure Clackline is reliant on the road network as the only available means of transportation. It is situated alongside Great Eastern Highway, which has bypassed the townsite since February 2008. The highway connects traffic south-west to Perth, and north-east to Northam and beyond. Other important roads in the area are Clackline–Toodyay Road, leading north to Toodyay, and Spencers Brook Road, heading south-east to Spencers Brook and then on to York. Education Clackline historically had its own primary school, until the late 1970s. Clackline School, later known as Clackline Primary School, opened in 1896, and was extended and renovated several times before relocating in 1954 to a new site on the same road. The school was closed down in 1976, but in 1980 became the temporary location of the Avon Valley Church's school. Since then, the closest primary schools to Clackline are in Northam, Bakers Hill and Wundowie. The nearest high schools as well as further education campuses are located in Northam: Northam Senior High School, St Joseph's High School, C. Y. O'Connor College of TAFE, and the Muresk Institute. Media In addition to the statewide newspapers The West Australian and The Sunday Times, Clackline is served by the Northam-based Avon Valley Advocate.

If constructed, Melford International Terminal would be the closest deep-water marine-rail container terminal in mainland North America to Europe and the Suez Canal. Location Located approximately south of the town of Mulgrave, the facility would be located on the western shore of the Strait of Canso partly on public and private property. Components The Melford International Terminal proposal includes the following components: * a 3-berth marine container terminal capable of hosting post/new-Panamax and Malaccamax container vessels * an intermodal rail facility * a logistics park * a rail spur from the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway mainline in the community of Linwood Timeline The project was conceived in 2005 when west coast North American container terminals were struggling to clear a massive backlog of freight shipments, largely imports from Asia. The announced conversion of the Fairview Terminal at the Prince Rupert Port Authority is believed to have been the impetus for creating a similar facility in northeastern Nova Scotia. A search for suitable geography within proximity of existing rail lines highlighted a property known as the \\"Melford Industrial Reserve.\\" This property is Crown land located in the community of Middle Melford owned by the Government of Nova Scotia which was set aside by its Crown corporation Industrial Estates Limited for industrial development in the 1960s after the Canso Causeway was constructed. In determining the feasibility of extending rail service to the location, it was noted that an abandoned rail corridor connected the nearby town of Mulgrave, which would lessen construction and right of way purchasing costs. During the facility's design phase, it was noted that a critical part of the area immediately onshore where infilling and pier construction would take place, was privately owned. This resulted in the Municipality of the District of Guysborough forcing the expropriation of private home owners who had lived in the community for generations. The project received environmental impact assessment approval by the Government of Nova Scotia as well as the Government of Canada in October 2008, at the height of the U.S. financial system's liquidity crisis. Project partners had originally included a major U.S. terminal operator SSA Marine, as well as various shipping lines and financing companies. Following the onset of the global recession and dramatic drop in international shipping, SSA Marine and many other international partners gave up their stake in Melford International Terminal and the project was dormant for much of 2008–2010. On July 7, 2010, Maher Terminals announced that they had taken an unspecified stake in the Melford Terminal project. Maher Terminals is the designated operator of the Prince Rupert Container Terminal in Prince Rupert, British Columbia on behalf of the Prince Rupert Port Authority. Maher is also the designated operator of the Elizabeth ExpressRail facility in Port Elizabeth, New Jersey on behalf of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Various timelines for the project have been released by the proponents over the past decade, however, construction has yet to begin. In 2018 contracts for design work and clearing the land were awarded. ;Proponents Proponents of the Melford facility note the economic development that would benefit economically depressed Guysborough County and the town of Mulgrave. ;Opponents Following the 2005 announcement of the Melford International Terminal, a group of marine infrastructure owners in Sydney, Nova Scotia have developed a competing proposal to dredge Sydney Harbour at an estimated cost of $40 million to accommodate deep draft container ships and build a 2–3 berth container terminal at the Sydport Industrial Park, the former navy base in Point Edward at a cost of $150 million. This proposal would not require construction of a rail line as the location is already served by the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway. Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited Sydney in December 2010 where he announced the Government of Canada would contribute $20 million to the Sydney project, on top of a $15 million contribution from the Government of Nova Scotia and $2 million from the municipality and Nova Scotia Power. A contract was signed in April 2011 with Netherlands engineering firm Boskalis for the dredging work in Sydney Harbour to take place in fall 2011. Shipping industry observers also note that the publicly owned Port of Halifax is a long-established deepwater port with two container terminals located southwest of the proposed Melford Terminal and Halifax already has existing CN rail connections to the rest of North America while operating at below 50% capacity. Furthermore, the Port of Halifax has been expanding the piers at both the South End Halifax Container Terminal and the Fairview Cove Container Terminal to accommodate larger ships. Other opponents include private property owners whose land was expropriated as well as environmentalists.

P.40&A-1935; Jane Small (c. 1518–1602) was a daughter of Christopher Pemberton, a Northamptonshire gentleman. She is well known as the subject of a portrait miniature by the famous 16th-century German artist Hans Holbein the Younger, painted about 1540. Holbein was known as a painter of the English court where his paintings included those of King Henry VIII and several of his wives Life Jane Pemberton married Nicholas Small, a London cloth merchant, probably in about 1540.Foister, p. 49. It is around this time that the Holbein portrait was commissioned. Nicholas Small died in the winter of 1565/66, and Jane remarried within the year, to Nicholas Parkinson. Her new husband went on to be Master of the Clothworkers' Company in 1578/79. Parkinson died in the winter of 1581/82. At this time Jane was living in Paddington, in the rectory, a house big enough to have been let to Sir John Popham, the attorney general, in the 1580s. Jane also held a lease on 'The Hand', a property on Thames Street, alongside the River Thames in London. In later life she lived with her daughters, and preferred to be addressed as Jane Small. She died in May 1602 whilst staying with her granddaughter in Warwickshire, but her burial place is unknown. Family Jane Small had six children by Nicholas Small. After her second husband died intestate, her eldest son, Matthew Small, inherited, but only after a court hearing before the Star Chamber. A younger daughter, Elizabeth, married Jasper More of Shropshire. Jane's granddaughter, Katherine More, was at the centre of a bizarre incident that occurred between her and her husband Samuel More from about 1616 to 1620. During this time her husband accused Katherine of having engaged in adultery with a longtime lover and giving birth to four children by him. Numerous court cases culminated in 1620 with Samuel More placing the four children with Pilgrims on the Mayflower just prior to its sailing for America. Soon after the Mayflower's arrival in America, three of the four children died. Only Katherine's son Richard More survived.Donald F. Harris, PhD.

The More Archive - Shropshire Council Holbein portrait Jane Small's historical significance derives from a fine portrait miniature by Hans Holbein the Younger. She has been identified as the subject from the coat of arms painted on a separate piece of vellum at the back of the miniature, that of Robert Pemberton of Lancashire and of Rushden, Northamptonshire, who died in 1594. The arms are dated 1566 but were painted in the 17th century. Scholars at first supposed that the sitter was Margaret Throckmorton (d. 1576), Robert Pemberton's wife, who had connections with the royal court.Strong, p. 47Rowlands, pp. 150–51. More recently, Jane Small has been established as the sitter. The simplicity of the sitter's dress reflects her relatively modest status; most of the Englishwomen Holbein painted were attached to the court. The inscription records the sitter as in her 23rd year, but the date of the painting is not known for certain. It has been suggested that the portrait may have been commissioned to mark her engagement.Foister, p. 49. She is shown wearing a carnation, which may symbolise her betrothal, and holding a leaf or sprig. Holbein's portrait, with its rich blue background, crisp outlines, and absence of shading, follows the conventions of the genre. Such miniatures were worn like a jewel. In his last years, Holbein raised the art of the portrait miniature to its first peak of brilliance. His large pictures had always contained a miniature-like precision. He applied this skill to the smaller form, somehow retaining his monumentality of effect.Rowlands, pp. 88–90. His miniature portrait of Jane Small is considered a masterpiece of the genre. In the view of art historian Graham Reynolds: > [Holbein] portrays a young woman whose plainness is scarcely relieved by her > simple costume of black-and-white materials, and yet there can be no doubt > that this is one of the great portraits of the world. With remarkable > objectivity Holbein has not added anything of himself or subtracted from his > sitter's image; he has seen her as she appeared in a solemn mood in the cold > light of his painting-room.Reynolds, p. 7.

Mabhida was leader of the South African Communist Party from 1978 until his death in 1986.Statement on the reburial of Moses Mabhida Government of South Africa, 30 November 2006 Biography Mabhida was born in Thornville, Natal to Stimela and a Phakathi woman as the fourth of five children in peasant family which was later forced off the land. Mabhida was drawn to trade unionism by the late Harry Gwala, then an ardent unionist and member of the South African Communist Party. Mabhida, too, joined the Communist Party in 1942. After many unionists were banned in 1952–1953, his colleagues in the newly revived underground party urged Mabhida to undertake full-time union work. In the next decade, he organised scores of workers in Natal. He worked for the South African Railways and Harbours Union and was paid £25 a month - collected from political sympathisers, as the union had little money. He was a central participant in the development of the South African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU) and was elected a vice-president at its first congress in 1955. He also served as secretary of the ANC's Pietermaritzburg branch in the mid-1950s, and had a close working relationship with Chief Albert Luthuli. Mabhida became a member of the ANC's National Executive Committee around 1956, and in 1958-1959 was acting chair of the Natal ANC. A week after the declaration of the 1960 state of emergency, Mabhida was sent abroad by SACTU to represent the organisation internationally. For the next three years he organised international solidarity activities in Prague with the World Federation of Trade Unions, and with the developing African trade union federations. In 1963, following his re-election to the NEC at the ANC's Lobatse conference in October 1962, he was asked by Oliver Tambo to devote himself to the development of the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK). Mabhida then underwent military training; as MK commissar he became the chief political instructor of new military recruits, and later served as the commander of MK. Mabhida's repeated re-election to the NEC, his appointment to the Revolutionary Council on its creation in 1969, and later to the Politico-Military Council which replaced it, reflected his popularity among ANC members. After Morogoro in 1969, he was instrumental in setting up the ANC's Department of National Intelligence and Security. He was elected General Secretary of the Communist Party in November 1979, replacing Moses Kotane who had died the previous year. In the 1980s, Mabhida continued his work with political and logistical planning for MK, based at various times in Lesotho, Mozambique and Swaziland. In 1985, while on a mission to Havana, Mabhida suffered a stroke, and after a year of illness, died of a heart attack in Maputo and was buried there in March 1986.

Its municipal seat is located in the town of Teabo. The Municipality of Teabo shares a boundary on the north with Mayapán-humayel, on the south with Tekax, on the east with Cantamayec-Tixméhuac and the west with Maní-Akil. It is home to indigenous Mayan people who continue to follow cultural traditions kept for hundreds of years. Vestiges of an important Mayan cemetery can be found in Teabo. Also, Teabo had two sacred buildings: The Parish and Ex-convent of San Pedro y San Pablo built in the 17th century and the Indian's Chapel that shows the date of 1617.  Communities  The municipality is made up of 20 communities the most important are: *Teabo (Municipal Seat) *San Higinio *Kulche Nearby cities The distances from the municipal seat to nearby cities are as follows: * Oxkutzcab, Yucatán southwest 21,508 people. * Ticul,Yucatán west 30,282people. * Merida, Yucatán north- northwest 717,175 people. History Regarding the foundation of Teabo and the municipality of the same name, the exact dates are not known. During pre- Hispanic times it belonged to the chieftainship of Tutul Xiú. After its conquest it remained under the control of various Spaniards, first recorded in 1753. The evolution of the population begins in 1821, when Yucatán declared its independence of the Spanish crown. In 1876, Teabo acquired the title of \\"Villa,\\" or village. By means of published Decree #144, Teabo changed status from village to town.

Bourne House, is a historic house located at 104 Summer Street in Kennebunk, Maine. The home was built in 1825 by shipbuilder George W. Bourne (1801–1856), who later built a frame barn which he connected to the main house with a carriage house. In 1852, the barn caught fire and the carriage house was demolished to keep the fire from spreading to the house. Bourne, who during a European tour had been impressed by the Gothic beauty of the cathedral at Milan, rebuilt the carriage house and barn in what later came to be known as Carpenter Gothic style. Using hand tools, he crafted five buttresses with pinnacles on top of each. Then in order to tie the new structures in with the existing house, he added six buttresses with pinnacles to the house and then joined them together with intricate woodwork. His only help in doing this was Thomas Durrell, an apprentice ship's carpenter. Bourne spent the rest of his life adding to these embellishments.Roger Shepherd: Design solutions: Wedding Cake House, Kennebunk, Maine It has been said of Bourne: \\"The highly skilled carpenter knew no limits to his skill.\\"Reiss, Marcia, Architectural Details, San Diego: Thunder Bay Press, 2004, p. 296 Name The \\"Wedding Cake\\" name was applied to the house due to its wedding cake-like appearance.

The tropical disturbance which eventually spawned Hurricane Gustav gathered on August 16, southwest of the Cape Verde islands, but was slow to develop as it trekked west across the Atlantic. Upon reaching the warm waters of Caribbean Sea it began to organize and became a tropical depression on August 25. It quickly strengthened to a tropical storm, and then a hurricane, before making landfall on Haiti's southwest peninsula. Gustav was severely disrupted by Hispaniola's mountains and stalled, disorganized, in the Gulf of Gonâve between August 26 and 27. Deep convection reformed the storm's center southwest of Haiti, near Jamaica's east coast. Under the influence of a mid-level ridge that extended from the Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean, Gustav picked up a westward motion. It was briefly disrupted by Jamaica as it passed over the mountainous island but rapidly strengthened when it moved over open water once again. Reaching Category 4 strength about 24 hours after having been upgraded to a hurricane, Gustav brushed the Isle of Youth and made landfall on Cuba's western's peninsula. Disrupted by mountains once again, Gustav never regained its former strength. Briefly traveling over a warm eddy of the Gulf Stream's loop current it encountered moderate wind shear and cooling sea surface temperatures. Fluctuations in its internal structure and visible appearance did not counter the storm's general weakening trend, and Hurricane Gustav made its final landfall as a Category 2 hurricane near Cocodrie, Louisiana on September 1. Moving inland, the storm quickly weakened but persisted as a significant tropical depression until it was adsorbed by a frontal boundary on September 5. Formation Gustav shortly after being named on August 25 On August 18, 2008, a tropical wave which had left the coast of Africa five days previously, developed into a significant low pressure area about west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. This wave moved westward across the Atlantic in conditions that were not favorable for development. As it began to approach the Windward Islands conditions improved and it showed some signs of organization, but no circulation. Upon reaching the windward islands on August 23, bringing showers, thunderstorms, and generally squally weather, wind shear over the system decreased and atmospheric conditions improved. Over the eastern Caribbean Sea, about south of Santo Domingo, a low level circulation began to form. Hours later well-defined curved bands and an improving circulation at the surface warranted that the system be designated a tropical depression. The depression formed a small inner wind core in diameter which allowed it to rapidly organize, and on the afternoon of August 25 it was upgraded to a tropical storm and first given the name Gustav. A renewed period of disorganization proved to be very short lived, and that night a well-defined eye formed. This eye was accompanied by strengthening as the storm continued to move northwest towards Haiti. Before reaching the island, Gustav's strengthening pattern raised it to hurricane strength. Its prominent and organizing central dense overcast belied persistent strengthening which continued until Hurricane Gustav made landfall on Haiti's southwest peninsula about west of Jacmel, at around 1800 UTC on August 26, with winds of and a minimum central pressure of 992 mbar (29.29 inHg). Interaction with Haiti and Jamaica Hurricane Gustav making landfall in Haiti on August 26 After making landfall near Jacmel, Hurricane Gustav began traversing northwestward across the mountainous terrain of southwestern Haiti, dumping heavy rains as it passed. With favorable atmospheric conditions the storm maintained its hurricane intensity for several hours after landfall, but the high mountains over which it was traveling disrupted its lower level circulation. The eye because ragged and clouded over as Gustav weakened to a tropical storm. A large mid- to upper-level anticyclone over the Florida Straight slowed Gustav's movement, holding it over the northern coast of Haiti's southern peninsula. Rainfall from the storm, which had been heavy since its landfall, began to accumulate as the storm's movement stalled. Although the storm's upper levels began experiencing moderate shear, and although parts of its circulation were still interacting with the mountains of southwestern Haiti, enough of Gustav's convection was over the Gulf of Gonâve that on the morning of August 27 its organization started to improve. That afternoon, as a broad ridge extended from the Gulf of Mexico into the western Atlantic Ocean, Gustav began to slowly pull to the west, away from the island of Hispaniola. Increased shear weakened the storm as the building ridge to the north of Gustav imparted a southerly component to the storm's motion. Northeasterly shear inhibited convection in the northeast quadrant, breaking up the storm's existing center. The storm's center reformed to the south, east of Jamaica, around a flare of deep convection. This new center was a little stronger than its previous one, and Gustav began moving southwest toward Jamaica. With its southerly reformation Gustav had moved itself away from the mountains of Haiti and over the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea. Finding itself in a much more advantageous environment, Gustav restrengthened to . Continuing west under influence of the same mid-level ridge that had dominated its steering thus far, Gustav approached Jamaica and its outer bands delivered heavy rains. Unwavering in its westward motion, Gustav made landfall on Jamaica's eastern tip on August 28 at 1800 UTC at just below hurricane strength. It then moved across Jamaica, with its center on the southern coast, and its convection dragging across the island's mountainous center. Fifteen hours after making landfall, Gustav's center moved off the island's west coast and back over the Caribbean Sea. Unlike its Haitian landfall, Gustav's interaction with Jamaica did not disturb its structure. As it left the island on the morning of August 29, the storm's diameter increased substantially and prominent banding features developed. Its low-level center reorganized over the open water and with little wind shear a strengthening pattern emerged which quickly returned Gustav to hurricane status that afternoon. Western Caribbean Sea Gustav regaining hurricane strength on August 29, after crossing the island of Jamaica Having cleared the disruptive landmass of Jamaica, Hurricane Gustav entered a period of sustained intensification. Within hours of leaving the island the storm regained hurricane status and the first signs of an eye appeared. Convective bands and upper-level outflow became well defined in all quadrants, wind shear decreased, and deep warm waters of the Caribbean Sean provided the perfect conditions for strengthening. The subtropical ridge over the eastern Gulf of Mexico developed a weakness, and as Gustav approached the Cayman Islands it was into this weakness that Gustav was drawn. As Hurricane Gustav tore through the low-lying Cayman Islands its wide eye became very well pronounced. In the early morning hours of August 30, and Gustav continued to pass through the Cayman Islands, the storm's winds increased to , raising Hurricane Gustav to Category 2 strength. Hurricane Gustav near peak intensity on August 30, shortly before landfall on western Cuba Through the morning Hurricane Gustav continued to rapidly strengthen. Deep convection around the eye flared intensely and the hurricane's minimum central pressure dropped precipitously—24 mbar (0.71 inHg) in 24 hours. By 1000 UTC it had reached Category 3 strength and continued to strengthen. Another drop in pressure–down 11 mbar (0.32 inHg) in 6 hours to 954 mbar (28.17 inHg)–was quickly followed by an increase in wind speed to , making Hurricane Gustav a Category 4 hurricane when it had been a mere tropical storm only 24 hours earlier. That afternoon, as Hurricane Gustav continued moving northwest towards Cuba, its western eyewall passed directly over the Isle of Youth. Passing along the eastern coast of the Isle of Youth, Gustav wobbled slightly, possibly the result of an eyewall replacement cycle, and strengthened even further. Here, even as it brushed the island, Hurricane Gustav continued to strengthen, making a brief landfall with a central pressure of 943 mbar (27.85 inHg) and winds of . Its long-term motion continued to be dominated by a mid-level ridge over the western Atlantic, and that evening, with a central pressure of 941 mbar (27.79 inHg), the hurricane made landfall in western mainland Cuba near los Palacios at just under Category 5 intensity, bringing its winds onshore. At a height of , a gust was recorded, which the World Meteorological Organization confirmed to be strongest ever measured during a hurricane. Gulf of Mexico Hurricane Gustav approaching Louisiana on August 31, displaying a partial eye and generally ragged structure after crossing Cuba The low mountains of western Cuba disrupted Hurricane Gustav's low-level circulation. Although it crosses the island in only a few hours, the brief interaction caused the storm's eye to partially cloud-over and its wind speeds fell to as it entered that southeastern Gulf of Mexico that night. Through that night and into the morning of August 31 it continued moving northwestward across the Gulf, its winds weakening to as the damage from its interaction with Cuba continued to take its toll. That morning the eye, which was expanding as the storm weakened, completely clouded over. Some mid- to upper- level dry air was drawn into the cyclone and a trough to the south added a slight vertical shear, but these interferences were short lived. Under the continued influence of the ridge over the western Atlantic and southeastern United States Hurricane Gustav accelerated into the central gulf. Here the storm tracked over a warm eddy in the loop current, but the high oceanic heat content failed to induce strengthening. Deep convection continued to be asymmetric and the eyewall opened to the southeast as wind speed continued to fall into Category 2 status. However by the afternoon of August 31 the hurricane's ragged appearance began to improve. The eye returned properly and its minimum central pressure fell even as its outer bands came ashore on the northern Gulf Coast. Its asymmetric appearance improved and its wind radius expanded, but by that night Gustav had moved off the eddy of the loop current and over slightly cooler water. It could not restrengthen here, despite its more impressive presentation. In the pre-dawn hours of September 1, while from the Gulf Coast, the hurricane's wind field expanded and tropical storm force winds extended from its center. Dry air intrusion from the south broke up the hurricane's eye, completely dissolving the eyewall as heavy rain bands came ashore in the state of Louisiana. As the eye approached the Louisiana coast, the storm weakened to 105 mph. Making landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana at 1430 UTC the eye briefly reformed but was not associated with any strengthening.

The mid-level ridge over the southeastern United States which had dominated Gustav's steering for the last few days drifted northward, pulling the hurricane with it. Moving further inland Hurricane Gustav continued to weaken while delivering torrential rains to the central gulf coast of the United States.

That night, 12 hours after landfall, Gustav weakened to a tropical storm with winds of . Radar image of the remnants of Gustav reaching southern Wisconsin on September 5 Slipping below tropical storm strength the following morning, Gustav's previously firm steering currents began to erode and its forward motion slowed. As the storm crept through northwest Louisiana on September 2, its heavy rainfall began to accumulate in the region. As the storm continued northwestward though the intersection of Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma and into Arkansas proper, its forward motion slowed considerably and it dumped isolated rainfall accumulations in excess of . Through the morning of September 3, Tropical Depression Gustav briefly drifted north-northeastward under very weak steering currents, but stalled completely over southwestern Arkansas that afternoon and spread heavy rain into the mid- Mississippi Valley. By the evening, steering currents returned and Gustav picked up speed to the northeast at . Moving even more rapidly Gustav left the Mississippi Valley and headed towards the Ohio Valley. The next morning, as it passed through Missouri, Gustav began to gain extratropical characteristics as it merged with a frontal boundary. The extratropical transition was completed on the afternoon of September 4 as Gustav's remnant low was moving over St. Louis, Missouri. Although no longer a tropical system, the remnants of Gustav continued to bring wind and rain to the northern United States. That evening, still traveling northeastward, the remnants dropped of rain on Illinois and its widespread remnant low produced trace rainfall stretching from Iowa to Indiana. By nightfall on September 4 the remnants had reached southwest Michigan, where they dumped rain until the next morning, with accumulations as high as . The storm's circulation remained intact through Wisconsin where it dropped almost of rainfall. Some of Gustav's more northerly remnants even drifted into Minnesota where they dropped small amounts of rain. On September 5, the storm's extratropical remnants were absorbed by a larger extratropical low moving through the Great Lakes.

In 1644 he became preceptor to Louis XIV,\\"As soon as he awoke, he recited the service of the Holy Spirit and his rosary.

After being Abbot of Saint- Michel-en-l'Herm, he was appointed Bishop of Rodez in 1649 and he was elected member of the Académie française in 1654. In 1662, Louis XIV appointed him Archbishop of Paris, headmaster of Sorbonne, and commander of the Order of the Holy Spirit. Engaged in the fight against Jansenism, Monseigneur de Beaumont de Perefixe published in 1664 an order \\"for the signature of the form of faith, drawn up in execution of the Constitutions of our Holy Fathers Popes Innocent X and Alexander VII\\" which aimed to compel the nuns of Port-Royal des Champs to sign a form condemning the Jansenist theses. He travelled several times to Port-Royal, deprived the recalcitrant of the sacraments, then ordered their captivity. The affair ended in 1669 with a new ordinance \\"in favor of the nuns of Port-Royal des Champs\\" which forced them to submit. Henry de Montherlant brilliantly staged all the protagonists of this struggle in his play, Port-Royal.

In the 1960s the BUFC was allocated core funding from government as a grant-in-aid body of the British Film Institute (BFI). In 1982 the Council left the BFI with the remit to engage with UK higher education, changed its title to British Universities Film & Video Council and obtained recurrent core grant direct from the Department for Education and Science. In the early 1990s, with the re-organisation of UK higher education funding, the BUFVC's PES line was moved to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and was paid over via The Open University. On 12 February 2007 the BUFVC became a 'related body' of HEFCE receiving core grant under Section 65 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 with oversight from the Jisc.

After the coup d'état in 2014, Anupong became an advisor to the junta which calls itself \\"National Council for Peace and Order\\" (NCPO), and in August 2014 minister of interior in General Prayut Chan-o-cha's post-coup government. Education Anupong completed his primary education at Bangkok's Phanthasuksa Pitthaya School in 1965 and Thai-British curriculum at Amnuay Silpa School the following year. He gained a military education from the Thailand's Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School in 1967 (Class 10, a classmate of prime minister-to-be Thaksin Shinawatra) and from Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy in 1972 (Class 21). He holds degrees in political science from Ramkhamhaeng University (1993), and a master's degree from the National Defence College of Thailand's Class 26 of Thailand's National Institute of Development Administration (2004). Career 150px Anupong has been appointed to many military offices, including inter alia, commandant of the 21st Infantry Regiment (Queen's Guard), commandant of the 1st Army Division, deputy commander and commander of the 1st Army Region. Anupong was selected by the Council of Ministers of Thailand to hold the position of the commander in chief of the Royal Thai Army on 19 September 2007, and promoted to the position by Bhumibol Adulyadej on 1 October 2007. He succeeded coup leader General Sonthi Boonyaratglin. Like his direct successor General Prayut and former defence minister Prawit Wongsuwan, Anupong is a member of the \\"Eastern Tigers\\" clique within the army. Most of them—like Anupong—started their career in the 2nd Infantry Division (headquartered in eastern Thailand), especially in the 21st Infantry Regiment (Queen's Guards). On 2 October 2008, Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej, following a civil insurgency of the People's Alliance for Democracy (\\"Yellow Shirts\\") demanding his resignation or impeachment, imposed a state of emergency throughout Bangkok and appointed Anupong as the leader of the officers in charge. After the Constitutional Court verdict dissolving the People's Power Party and two of its coalition parties, Anupong reportedly led closed-door meetings, convincing Newin Chidchob's Bhumjaithai Party to desert the government coalition, and organising a new parliamentary majority led by the Democrat Party and Abhisit Vejjajiva. On 14 January 2010, Anupong ordered the suspension of Major General Khattiya Sawasdipol, the controversial \\"Seh Daeng\\", after an inquiry committee found that Khattiya had publicly proclaimed his loyalty to the United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship (\\"Red Shirts\\"), a political group supporting Thaksin Shinawatra, breaching military discipline. The following day, Anupong's office in the Royal Thai Army headquarters was attacked by unknown parties using an M79 grenade launcher. The unoccupied office was slightly damaged.Thai Rath; 2010, 21 January. During the 2010 \\"Red Shirts\\" uprising, the government of Abhisit Vejjajiva appointed General Anupong chief officer of the Centre for the Resolution of the Emergency Situation (CRES), in charge of restoring law and order. Thus he was responsible for the bloody military crackdown on the protest movement in mid-May 2010. Anupong retired on 30 September 2010. He was succeeded by General Prayut Chan-o-cha. After the 22 May 2014 coup d'état, the junta—led by Prayut—appointed Anupong a member of its \\"advisory board\\" overseeing security issues. Three months later, on 30 August, he was appointed minister of interior in General Prayut's military- dominated government. Personal life Anupong is married to Kunlaya Paochinda (). They have two children, Yutthaphong Paochinda () and Wimalin Paochinda ().  Notes   References  * Post Today. (2008, 3 September). Anupong say 'Stop this civil war.' Extra page 2. * Thai Rath.

He attended the University of Sheffield in 1955,\\"Dathorne, Oscar Ronald\\", in Michael Hughes, A Companion to West Indian Literature, Collins, 1979, o. 38. obtaining his BA English degree in 1958 and subsequently completing his MA in 1960 and his PhD, English, in 1966. However, having completed his studies he found that few English universities were willing to offer him anything other than junior positions. He therefore sought job opportunities abroad and successfully applied for a teaching post at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. He remained in West Africa for six years, completing his stay while holding a full professorship at the University of Sierra Leone as head of the English department. With his use of African literature as a basis for many English classes and the increased recognition that African literature be defined as written by Africans rather than about Africans, in 1969 he was invited to the United States as a guest lecturer at Yale University. With the continuing changes in the black American psyche, African culture and heritage were viewed as a past in which to take great pride. As a result, universities throughout the US were becoming interested in forming African and African-American study departments. Having specialist knowledge within this area, Dathorne became professor of African studies at Howard University in Washington, D.C. He was a pioneer of Black Studies in the United States, teaching African-American studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and then spent 15 years working at Ohio State and the University of Miami, establishing and directing African, Caribbean, and African-American study programs.

Background Kenneth Cockrel, Jr. is the son of Kenneth Vern Cockrel (November 5, 1938 – April 25, 1989), a former Detroit city council member and attorney. He was a self-proclaimed Marxist-Leninist who died from a heart attack. Ken's mother was Carol Cockrel, a schoolteacher. He is a graduate of the St. Florian Church (Hamtramck, Michigan) High School. He graduated , cum laude from Wayne State University and wrote for the Detroit Free Press. He entered politics and was elected as a Wayne County commissioner.

He became council president pro tempore in 2001, and was elevated to council president in 2005, receiving more votes than any other city council candidate in that year's election. He was viewed by the city's business community as a moderate consensus-builder. In his first term as a city councillor, he secured passage of an ordinance requiring the city to pay vendors and contractors for goods and services within 45 days.\\"The next in line: Cockrel not eager, but ready to be mayor if Kilpatrick leaves post\\", Crain's Detroit Business, February 11, 2008.

Former councilwoman Sheila Cockrel is his stepmother.Members: Charter restricts impact, Detroit News, 2001. Mayoralty As Council President, Cockrel was first in the order of succession to assume the Mayor's Office if a vacancy occurred. Due to the fallout from the text-messaging scandal, on September 4, 2008, Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and agreed to resign effective September 18, 2008, at midnight. Under the City Charter, Cockrel became interim mayor and a special election was ordered. Daniel Cherrin served as the Communications Director for the City of Detroit and Press Secretary to Mayor Cockrel from 2008-2009 and helped Mayor Cockrel and the city of Detroit through the transition. As he became mayor, Cockrel stated that he planned to review the city budget, due to uncertainty around whether Kilpatrick was honest with the city council about the state of the city's finances, and perhaps to renegotiate a pending deal with the city of Windsor, Ontario related to the cities' management of the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel. Under the existing deal, Windsor would have taken over full management of the tunnel in exchange for a $75 million loan to Detroit. Cockrel suggested that he would prefer to work out a new deal in which the two cities maintained joint management of the tunnel. Windsor mayor Eddie Francis stated that he was confident that he could maintain a strong working relationship with Cockrel. Cockrel was defeated by Dave Bing, former Detroit Pistons star and Detroit businessman, in a special election on May 5, 2009 to finish the remainder of Kilpatrick's term, set to expire January 1, 2010, at midnight. Following certification of the vote and Bing taking office on May 11, 2009, Cockrel returned to his position as City Council President. Post-political career After leaving the Detroit City Council, Cockrel served as the executive director of a non-profit organization called Detroit Future City from January 2014 to June 2015.

The premiere took place Wednesday, 22 January 1976 at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, with lighting by Ronald Bates; Robert Irving conducted. Chaconne was danced in practice clothes at its premiere; Karinska's costumes were added in the spring season. The finale to Orfeo ed Euridice is a chaconne, a dance form built on a short bass phrase and often used by 17th and 18th century opera composers to achieve a festive mood at the end. The choreography was first performed at the Hamburgische Staatsoper in their 1963 production of Orpheus und Eurydike and somewhat altered in Chaconne, especially that for the principal dancers. Balanchine added the pas de deux for Suzanne Farrell and Peter Martins to the 1976 ballet and the opening ensemble (to the 1774 Dance of the Blessed Spirits) for the Spring season. Balanchine's first Orpheus and Eurydice was made on the Metropolitan Opera in 1936; his approach, the singers remaining in the pit while the action was danced on stage, was not well received; the production had only two performances. He choreographed Orphée et Eurydice for the Théâtre National de l'Opéra, Paris in 1973 and Orfeo ed Euridice for the Chicago Lyric Opera in 1975 as well. In 1773 Gluck wrote, \\"Always as simple and natural as I can make it, my music strives toward the utmost expressiveness and seeks to reinforce the meaning of the underlying poetry.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 19, 2009. In the episode, Bart sets up Milhouse to take the fall for a prank the two of them pulled, and the duo's friendship becomes strained when Bart falls for a charitable girl named Jenny. He starts making her think he is actually good and not bad. Meanwhile, Lisa becomes depressed when she finds articles on the Internet predicting that Springfield will suffer from catastrophic events in fifty years. The episode was written by Marc Wilmore and directed by Rob Oliver. It features actress Anne Hathaway as Jenny. \\"The Good, the Sad and the Drugly\\" received generally mixed reviews from critics for its similarities with other episodes. According to the Nielsen ratings, the episode was watched by 6.50 million households in its original airing. Plot Milhouse and Bart loosen every bolt and screw in Springfield Elementary, leading to mass chaos when the building and its contents fall apart. Milhouse is apprehended by Principal Skinner, and suspended from school for a week to be subsequently grounded. Bart, whose involvement with the prank was not discovered, promises to visit Milhouse every day. Homer drops Bart off at Springfield Retirement Castle to visit Grampa. There, Bart is immediately smitten with a kind and charitable girl named Jenny. Bart makes a concerted effort to appear \\"good\\" to Jenny, demonstrating his newfound good nature by defending ducklings and eventually inviting Jenny over for dinner. However, Milhouse shows up on the Simpsons' doorstep and threatens to reveal Bart's true, dark nature because Bart forgot to visit him during his suspension. Milhouse begins appearing on Bart and Jenny's outings, each time hinting at Bart's misdeeds. Eventually, Bart confesses to Jenny that he was actually bad before he met her and only pretended to be good to start a relationship. He continues to say that he is changed completely because of being with her. Shocked by this revelation, Jenny, though momentarily pleased by Bart's honesty, cannot bring it upon herself to forgive or trust Bart, and angrily dumps him. At home, Bart cries, and Homer consoles and reassure him that girls come and go, but he still has his family, only for him to shed tears too. Meanwhile, Lisa is assigned to write a report on what Springfield will look like in the year 2059. When she discovers online reports about soap for drinks instead of water, a world war over a tiny drop of oil, a parking lot yet to be filled forever and the last polar bear committing suicide, she is filled with anxiety and depression and terrifies her classmates with her dark visions of the oceans rising from global warming, turning humanity and the lowlands into a desert and darkness falling upon Nineveh. Homer and Marge take her to a psychiatrist, who prescribes Lisa \\"happy pills\\". Lisa is initially skeptical, but after taking her first pill she loses touch with her problems and sees pollution (as well as everything else) as smiley faces. In her love-induced stupor, she nearly kisses a running fan held by Maggie, until Marge finally intervenes by deciding that she wants Lisa back to normal, and should not take the pills anymore. She tosses them in the wastebasket, where they are promptly eaten by Santa's Little Helper. When Maggie holds the fan up to him, he licks the fan himself. Heartbroken, Bart is at the Kwik-E-Mart, drowning his sorrows on a couple of Shrek Squishees. Soon, a back to normal Lisa tells Bart that they cannot be in despair about certain issues and should just move on. Bart decides to take Lisa's advice, and leaves after buying a bouquet of roses, and apologizes to Jenny off-screen for lying to her about his true character and Milhouse for his neglect to visit him. In the end, Bart gives the roses to Milhouse, and Jenny is never seen again. The two friends reconcile and play a prank together, repeatedly driving an ice resurfacer over the floor of the school until it is as slippery as ice. They then wait for the bell and watch as the school kids slide around while fake snow falls simulating an out-door ice rink. Production Anne Hathaway, a childhood fan of The Simpsons, guest starred as Bart's girlfriend Jenny \\"The Good, the Sad and the Drugly\\" was written by Marc Wilmore and directed by Rob Oliver. In September 2008, it was announced that Anne Hathaway would guest star as Bart's girlfriend in a future episode. Hathaway, who has been a Simpsons fan since the shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show, said that she grew up watching The Simpsons with her brothers, and said that \\"it stuck with me...high school, college, post, everything. I always stop whenever it's on.\\"Hathaway, 0:00 - 0:15 She said that she \\"flipped out\\" when she was offered a guest role and that it \\"might be the most [...] exciting thing\\" that has ever happened to her.Hathaway, 0:16 - 0:25 The episode marked the first time she did a voice-over to an animation that was not animated beforehand.Hathaway, 1:33 - 1:37 Hathaway described her character Jenny as a \\"good girl\\" but \\"not necessarily bland\\" and \\"a little complicated, [and] a little judgemental\\".Hathaway, 0:34 - 0:41 The episode was also notable for featuring the first grounding to be used since \\"Fraudcast News\\" back in Season 15. This would lead to three additional episodes utilizing the grounding, \\"Waverly Hills 9-0-2-1-D'oh\\", which had Homer threaten to ground Bart at the end of the episode, \\"The Devil Wears Nada\\", in which Rod and Todd are grounded, and \\"Postcards from the Wedge\\", which marked the culmination of the grounding, since at the end of that episode, after 21 seasons of being sent to his room, or being punished in other ways, Bart is finally grounded for the first time ever, and remains grounded for the rest of the episode. In all, Seasons 20 and 21 feature more groundings than the previous 19 seasons put together. Prior to Season 20, the only groundings that were ever mentioned were in \\"Lisa's Rival\\", \\"Marge Be Not Proud\\", and \\"Fraudcast News\\". Reception According to the Nielsen ratings, \\"The Good, the Sad and the Drugly\\" was watched by 6.50 million households in its original in the United States on April 19, 2009. It received a 3.0 rating in the 18–49 demographic, and was the second most-watched series in the Animation Domination block. Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict said that it \\"isn't a bad episode [...] It's just not very original\\", as he thought it \\"borrows heavily\\" from past episodes, stating: \\"I'll gladly defend the show against those who say it's no longer funny, but episodes like this make it hard to defend against those who say that 20 seasons on it's just more of the same.\\" Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode 7.5/10, and said that \\"a lot of the basic ideas found in ‘The Good, the Sad and the Drugly’ have been mined before in episodes of The Simpsons, but said that the episode \\"was using the classic episodes as an inspiration and not simply ripping them off.\\" Canning said that Hathaway \\"did a fine job\\", but said that \\"there was nothing extreme in the part that she was called upon to perform, so in essence Jenny could have been performed by anybody.\\" Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club face the episode a B+, stating that the episode \\"’Good, Sad and Drugly’ benefited from a pretty straightforward A story—no weird digressions or preludes that go nowhere—and a minimum of Homer- centric buffoonery. Keeping the action focused on Bart kept things simple and damn near heartwarming at times, particularly the nice capper where he goes to apologize to Milhouse instead of trying to win back Jenny. It was a nice reminder of the humanity that used to pulse beneath The Simpsons, before it transitioned to the more manic, sometimes cynical show we see today.\\" References General * Specific External links The Simpsons (season 20) episodes 2009 American television episodes ","title":"The Good, the Sad and the Drugly"},{"id":"19174271","text":"Lecozotan is an investigational drug by Wyeth tested for improvement of cognitive functions of Alzheimer's disease patients. , the first Phase III clinical trial has been completed.ClinicalTrials  Method of action  Lecozotan is a competitive, selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist which enhances the potassium-stimulated release of acetylcholine and glutamate.

It is eponymous with a 1994 album on Work Music on which it constitutes approximately half the material. The album is also known as Music for Two Pianos, which is given as the album's name on the back cover and insert back, while Taking a Line for a Second Walk appears on the front cover, spine, and physical disc. The performers are identified on the front cover, and all of the booklet, as The Zoo II, and on the back cover as \\"The Zoo Duet\\". As one of the tracks on the album is \\"Lady in the Red Hat\\" from A Zed & Two Noughts, also known as Zoo, this is often seen as a reference to that film. A photograph of the duo is inside the booklet, two young women in black on a black background, leaving only their wedding banded-hands (which form the front cover design) and faces visible, with \\"The Zoo II\\" as the only caption. The pianists are identified as Helen Hodkinson and Brenda Russell in the Michael Nyman discography on the 1995 promotional compilation Michael Nyman. The album was reissued with a new cover and the Music for Two Pianos title by Signum Records on April 5, 2004 (May 25, 2004 in the U.S.). The artist is listed as \\"The Zoo Duet,\\" but neither Hodkinson nor Russell are identified by name. This led some reviewers to assume that the piano was played by Nyman himself, using overdubs to play both parts.The Scotsman.

Then again, the playing sounds as if it may be Nyman himself, double-tracked. Behind this wall of confusion is music Nyman fans are familiar with - hard-edged minimalism in Taking a line for a second walk, which started life as an orchestral score for Houston Ballet, and the sultry oscillating harmonies of Water Dances, originally from the soundtrack to Peter Greenaway's film, Making a Splash.\\" The title work, which is partially influenced by 1950s rock and roll, takes up the first three tracks of the album (the second and third are identified as \\"(untitled)\\" in the reissue cover, and simply left blank in the original). The album also contains an expansion of the Water Dances for Peter Greenaway's film about synchronized swimming, Making a Splash, which originally appeared on the album The Kiss and Other Movements.

The film is based on the life of a young boy and his pet donkey. It is a fable-like journey of the eponymous eight-year-old boy, whose life revolves around the pursuit to find real purpose in his little world. The film stars Purav Bhandare as the young boy. Anupam Kher, Sarika, Rahul Bose, Rahul Khanna and Victor Banerjee form the rest of the cast. It was filmed on location in Jammu and Kashmir.  Plot  After salvaging money using various means, Tahaan reaches the moneylender to reclaim Birbal. He is told that old Subhan Dar (Anupam Kher) bought the donkey and went across the mountains in which Tahaan's father went missing. Gathering courage, Tahaan goes in search of the old man. He finds him and he follows Subhan and his assistant Zafar (Rahul Bose) and their mule train, leading Birbal despite their protests. Although Subhan promises to return Birbal to Tahaan if he can win a race against the incompetent Zafar when he wins Subhan refuses to give him Birbal. Instead, Subhan gives the donkey to his eight-year-old nephew. Zafar tries to give Tahaan his sunglasses as a replacement for the donkey, but Tahaan will not accept the gift. On his way back home, Tahaan encounters Idrees, a teenager who discourages him, saying that his efforts will not be sufficient to get Birbal back. Instead, he suggests to do him a favour. Tahaan is asked to take a package across the mountains in his onward journey. Upon seeing his eagerness, Idrees hands him over a grenade and says that when the time is right, he will be told what needs to be done. At a checkpoint, the package and grenade are not discovered due to the fact that the soldiers know and trust Subhan Darr. Tahaan is about to commit a terrorist act with the grenade and has already removed the pin when he changes his mind and throws it safely in a river. He then sees his father emerge from the building he almost blew up. Subhan's nephew learns that Tahaan is fond of Birbal, and at his request, Subhan gives the donkey back to Tahaan.

He formed a fable-like story from the report. Since Kashmir is a strife-torn area, films are rarely picturised there. However, in the case of this film, Sivan thought that audiences can relate it to the film well. It was only after 18 years that a film was filmed in Kashmir. While filming in Pahalgam, Sivan realised to his surprise that children were comfortable with guns. It seemed to him that it was a part of everyday life for them. The film makes eloquent use of Quranic verses or azaan, for which the director took help from research scholars in Kashmir. > When shooting there we only wanted to show the real life. I had heard some > Quranic verses there at some Dargah. I thought I could use them to send a > message of hope. I wanted to use the azaan for a nice purpose, a beautiful > thing, not for any wrong deed... At the end I wanted to show the positive > power of a dream.  Soundtrack  Critical reception The film opened to generally positive reviews. Ziya Us Salam of The Hindu hailed the film as a 'visual poem' and \\"Responsible cinema, brilliant cinema.\\" Raja Sen of Rediff gave it 4 out of 5 stars, calling it a \\"must-watch\\".

It is part of the \\"Royal Pavilion & Museums, Brighton and Hove\\". It is free for local residents but charges £6 per non-resident. History The building which houses the collection is part of the Royal Pavilion Estate and was originally built for the Prince of Wales, later George IV and completed in 1805. It was initially intended as a tennis court but had never been finished, and later served as cavalry barracks.Catalogue of Paintings in Oil Before 1837 (Brighton Museum and Art Gallery, 1964) After the death of George IV in 1830, his successor King William IV also stayed in the Pavilion on his visits to Brighton. However, after Queen Victoria's last visit to Brighton in 1845, the Government planned to sell the building and grounds. The Brighton Commissioners and the Brighton Vestry successfully petitioned the government to sell the Pavilion to the town for £53,000 in 1850 under the Brighton Improvement (Purchase of the Royal Pavilion and Grounds) Act 1850.Dale, Antony (1977). Brighton Town and Brighton People. Chichester: Phillimore, p.221. . In September 1851 it was announced that part of the Pavilion was to be appropriated for annual art exhibitions and two months later the first of these was held. The local talent to which it was confined included Frederick Nash and Copley Fielding. The room devoted to the exhibition was the original South Gallery, now the First Conference Room, but later the exhibitions even spread to the Great Kitchen. The stable building of the Pavilion estate, adjacent to the current museum premises, was used as a museum as early as 1856. It is now the site of the Brighton Dome – a performing arts venue. The museum and art gallery occupied its current situation in the building in 1902. A major refurbishment of the museum and art gallery costing £10 million occurred in 2002. As a result, the traditional entrance to the museum and art gallery became the entrance of the Dome, the latter taking the museum's former entrance.

George IV preferred to wear breeches and banned trousers from court until 1815.Brighton Museum & Art Gallery label * A Kinemacolour camera made by Moy & Bastie around 1910. Kinemacolour was developed by George Albert Smith (one of the early pioneers in British film-making in Brighton & Hove) and was the first commercially viable colour film technique. The camera is part of the film and media collection. * A hand-enamelled wall plaque made in 1934–1939 depicting life in Imperial India. It was designed by Clarice Cliff using a scene taken from the British Empire Panels designed by Frank Brangwyn.

It was made by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as author, photographer and mathematician Lewis Carroll. * A portrait painted in coloured beeswax found fixed over the face of a mummified body in the Roman cemetery at Hawara in Egypt from the 2nd Century. His white robes are a deliberate display of status, distinguishing him as a member of the elite class of Romans who had settled in Egypt. * Vietnamese water puppets from the mid-20th Century, hand painted and carved out of wood.

Booth’s large collection of British Birds was developed into a museum in 1874. At this point it was known as Booth Museum of British Birds and was not open to the public, which occurred gradually with charitable fundraising events. By then he had formulated his ambition to exhibit one example of every species British bird and set about the task building up his collection and travelled around the country to collect his specimens. * A drinking beaker from the local history collection made from horn, dating from the early 19th century. Around this time Brighton had one inn for every thirty houses. The beaker has the faint inscription: ‘Greyhound Inn Brighton, 1821'.

In 2009 a high level suspension bridge (Salbitbrücke) was installed on its southern flank, making it possible to pass from the Salbithütte to the Voralphütte without the use of climbing gear.

Founded in 1989 as an independent private publisher formed primarily to publish a new launch (the Shooting Gazette) but with the long-term objective of adding other titles. BPG was started in offices in Bourne, Lincolnshire with three full-time staff members and a part-time secretary. It relocated to Stamford at the end of 1998 and there are now more than 35 employees and numerous freelancers. Titles Other titles were added, including the CPSA's PULL! magazine in 1990 and BASC's Shooting & Conservation in 1992. Your Cat Your Cat and Your Dog magazines were added under licence from EMAP in 1999. The magazines were showing a slide in sales and ad revenues since successful launches, and EMAP felt that they were not of a size (or indeed subject matter) that fitted in with their strategies. Your Cat was launched in 1994. Other titles operating in the market are Cat World, a monthly publication, and Our Cats, a weekly title aimed at the showing side of cat ownership. 2004 marked the tenth anniversary of the Your Cat magazine. Your Dog Your Dog was launched in 1995. Competitors in the market are Dogs Today, a monthly magazine and Our Dogs and Dogs World, two weekly papers aimed at the show circuit. In March 2008, Dogs Monthly was acquired by a new publisher and re-launched very much as a look alike to Your Dog. The title has continued to post circulation increases in the last three ABC (Audit Bureau of Circulations UK) audit periods. In 2003, BPG purchased the titles from EMAP. Horse & Pony Horse & Pony was re-launched in 2005 under a licence agreement with EMAP after an absence of four years following their closure of the title when their focus was turned exclusively to Your Horse. As a youth equestrian magazine, Horse & Pony sponsors the Pony Club. Fieldsports Fieldsports is the most recent publication to be launched by BPG, initially as a quarterly bookazine retailed exclusively through WH Smith before widening out through the rest of the news trade estate. It is aimed at the top end of the game shooting market and also includes game fishing for the average shot who swops gun for rod out of season. The Scottish Sporting Gazette The Scottish Sporting Gazette & International Traveller was acquired by BPG from John Ormiston in 1998. This is a ‘coffee table’ annual which concentrates itself on all things Scottish. Websites BPG has remained a small specialist publisher, whose emphasis revolves around creating niche titles with a small workforce. , the company has invested heavily in online sites for its titles.

It has included a number of bombing attacks in North Africa and supporting parties in civil wars in Eritrea and Somalia. From 1991 to 1996, Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were based in Sudan. Algeria An insurgency is being waged by the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (which is called today as the al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb) against the Algerian government. It is a spin-off to the Algerian Civil War that ended in 2002, and has been linked to bombings in Algiers, Batna and Dellys in 2007. The group has declared its intention to attack Algerian, French, American and Spanish targets. It has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. Department of State, and similarly classed as a terrorist organization by the European Union. Eritrea As soon as the allied Somali and Ethiopian forces drove the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) out of Somalia in January 2007, U.S. accused Eritrea of providing safe haven for some of their leadership.U.S. accuses Eritrea on supporting islamists America also condemned Eritrea since it continued to \\"fund, arm, train and advise the insurgents\\" attacking the Somalia government.U.S. condemns Eritrean assistance of islamists US blames Eritrea over Somalian insurgency According to a regional Somali government, some Eritrean soldiers were also sighted working with Arab and al-Qaeda fighters against the Somali government, and the foreign alliance attacked government positions.allied ICU, Al-Qaeda and Eritrean fighters attack government positions In 2007 there were reports that the Eritrean government is sheltering the leadership of the insurgency in Somalia. The United Nations continued to report of Eritrean assistance to Somalis with alleged links to al-Qaeda. Accordingly, the UN Security Council said that Eritrea has secretly supplied \\"huge quantities of arms\\" to a Somali insurgent group with alleged ties to al Qaeda, in violation of an international arms embargo and despite the deployment of African peacekeepers\\" adding that it has been \\"provided to the al-Shabaab (an extremist group which emerged within the ICU’s armed forces and is led by a kinsman and protégé of the ICU council leader Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, Aden Hashi Farah \\"Eyrow\\", who trained in Afghanistan with al- Qaeda before returning to Somalia after 9/11) by and through Eritrea\\" since December 2006. Sheikh Aweys himself and other members of the Islamic Courts Union who are wanted by the U.S. over suspected links to al-Qaeda (the UN has Sheikh Aweys on a list of individuals \\"belonging to or associated with\\" al Qaeda, which he denies) organized a congress in Eritrea to strengthen their militant opposition to the Somalia transitional government. Kenya In 2002 another successful terrorist attack in Kenya after the U.S. embassy bombing, a car bomb attack on a Mombasa resort hotel popular among Israeli tourists claimed the lives of 15 people. The hotel bombing occurred 20 minutes after a failed attack on an airplane, when a terrorist fired an SA-7 man-portable air- defense system against an Israeli airliner carrying 261 passengers, which was taking off from the airport; the missile seemingly failed to track its target, nor did it detonate, and landed in an empty field. Libya On 3 November 2007, al-Zawahiri claimed in a 28-minute recording posted on an Islamic website that \\"... members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group announce that they are joining the al-Qaeda group ...\\" According to Al Jazeera, Abu al-Laith appeared to be the leader of the new Libyan wing. Fighting Islamic Group first announced its presence in 1995, vowing to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan leader. In 2001, the group was added to a UN list of individuals and institutions \\"belonging to, or associated with, al-Qaeda\\".Zawahri: Libya group joins al-Qaeda accessed November 3, 2007 Abdelhakim Belhadj, a prominent rebel commander during the 2011 Libyan civil war, in an interview with the Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore admit that many of his recruits had al-Qaeda links. One of the major factions within the Libyan National Liberation Army was the Libyan Islamic Movement. The group, formerly known as the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, is well known to have had links to Maghreb faction of al- Qaeda. On 1 November 2011, less than a month after the death of Muammar Gaddafi, the al-Qaeda flag was seen flying off the roof of a courthouse in Benghazi's city center. The extent of al-Qaeda's involvement is not yet known. Concerns have been voiced about what role MI6 played in collaborating with the Libyan Islamic Movement. The White House Deputy National Security Adviser John Brennan said \\"I'm concerned about what is going on inside of Libya because there's been a fair amount of disorder and upheaval in the country\\", \\"The weapons stock piles - whether we're talking about missile systems or we're talking about automatic weapons - these are things that we and our European allies are working very closely with the TNC [Transitional National Council] and Libyan authorities to get some control over. It's a big country, there were a lot of weapons depots that were scattered throughout the country and we're working again with the TNC and Europeans as well as the regional states. [...] (we are) very concerned about making sure that we do everything possible to prevent al-Qaeda from acquiring these weapons and threatening them.\\". Somalia In February 2012, al-Shabaab officially pledged loyalty to Al- Qaeda. In an audio message to Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, the al- Shabaab leader said: \\"On behalf of the soldiers and the commanders in al- Shabaab, we pledge allegiance to you. So lead us to the path of jihad and martyrdom that was drawn by our imam, the martyr Osama.\\" Activities of al- Qaeda in Somalia are alleged to have begun as early as 1992. The organization's role during the course of the 1992–1994 UN missions was limited to a handful of trainers. Ali Mohamed and other al-Qaeda members purportedly trained forces loyal to fraction leader Mohammed Farah Aidid. Osama bin Laden himself claimed in an interview with ABC's John Miller to have sent al-Qaeda operatives to Somalia. One of the al-Qaeda fighters present during the interview claimed to have personally slit the throats of three American soldiers in Somalia. Mark Bowden, author of Black Hawk Down, states the terrorist organization did train some of Aidid's men, but they were not personally part of the fight with US forces in the 1993 battle of Mogadishu. Al-Qaeda was also linked to militant Islamic Courts Union (ICU) front in Somalia. It is believed several terrorist attacks were orchestrated from Ras Kamboni, in the extreme southern tip of Somalia adjacent to Kenya, including the 1998 United States embassy bombings and the 2002 Mombasa hotel bombing.Abdi Abdi, \\"The Talibanisation of Somalia\\", Ethiopian News Agency, 12 July 2006 On June 22, 2006, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer announced the U.S. was seeking the assistance of the ICU in the apprehension of suspects who carried out attacks against its East African embassies and a hotel in Kenya. She listed the following persons as suspected of being in Somalia (name and nationality): Fazul Abdullah Mohamed (Comoros), Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan (Kenya), and Abu Taha al-Sudan (Sudan). When the ICU did not cooperate, the U.S. first financed the rival factions, and then followed with limited air strikes as the ICU rule in Mogadishu fell in the face of Ethiopian Army assault. The Pentagon said a high level al-Qaeda member from the ICU was captured in Somalia and transferred to the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay.U.S. detains Al-Qaeda member After the dissolution of the ICU, Al-Qaeda reportedly established strong ties with the Al-Shabaab splinter group. In September 2009, it is thought that the Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan was killed during a military raid in Somalia. He was a top Al-Qaeda suspect and was thought to be responsible for attacks on a hotel in Kenya and on an Israeli airliner in 2002.BBC news – Al-Qaeda Somalia suspect 'killed'JPost – Kenya terrorist killed in Somalia raid Sudan In 1991, Sudan's National Islamic Front, an Islamist group that had recently gained power, invited al-Qaeda to move operations to Sudan. For several years, al- Qaeda operated several businesses (including import/export, farm, and construction firms) in what might be considered a period of financial consolidation. The group built a major 1200-km (845-mi) highway connecting the capital Khartoum with Port Sudan. However, they also ran a number of camps where they trained operatives in the use of firearms and explosives. In 1996, Osama bin Laden was asked to leave Sudan after the United States put the regime under extreme pressure to expel him, citing possible connections to the 1994 attempted assassination of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak while his motorcade was in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Controversy exists regarding whether Sudan offered to turn bin Laden over to the U.S. prior to the expulsion. There is an audio tape (Audio) (Transcript) recording of former President Bill Clinton talking about the offer from the Sudanese government. There are conflicting reports on whether the Sudanese government indeed made such an offer, but they were in fact prepared to turn him over to Saudi Arabia, who declined to take him.\\"Newsmax\\" http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/9/10/181819.shtml?s=ic Osama bin Laden finally left Sudan in a well-executed operation, arriving at Jalalabad, Afghanistan by air in late 1996 with over 200 of his supporters and their families.

Four people escape from the attack in a riverboat: Private Richard Baker, a soldier in the British army; Murchison, an inexperienced subaltern in the army; Asua, the daughter of the local Emir; and Asua's British governess, Margret Woodville. Over the course of the journey, the group find themselves in perilous dangers on the Nile and its banks. Facing off against nature, Arab slavers and a beleaguered Negro tribe the slavers prey on, they are saved by King Gondoko's missionary-raised brother Kimrasi, who then joins them.

He was called Panpan by his friends. Life Devaux trained as a lawyer and worked briefly for a lawyer cousin in Nancy. He soon quit to live with his parents in Lunéville, resisting their efforts to make him marry and earn a living. His dream was to become a writer, an ambition encouraged by his friend Françoise de Graffigny, who became his sponsor in the court society of Lorraine. They collaborated on several literary projects and confided in each other about their problems, both financial and emotional. In the 1730s Devaux wrote a one-act prose play, called Les Portraits, which was accepted by the Comédie-Française; but the troupe stalled on performing the play, and for about fifteen years Devaux struggled to get it staged. In 1737, the duke of Lorraine, François Étienne, signed away his duchy to France, in exchange for French support for his marriage to Maria Theresa of Austria. The court of Lorraine, which had been presided over by Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans, widow of Leopold I of Lorraine, was dispersed, and Stanislas Leszczynski, former king of Poland and father-in-law of Louis XV of France, was made duke of Lorraine. As a result, Françoise de Graffigny left Lorraine for Paris, and her intermittent correspondence with Devaux became an almost daily record of both their lives, until her death in 1758. She used her influence for his benefit, getting him a post as a revenue collector in 1741, helping secure his election to the Académie de Nancy in 1752, obtaining for him a sinecure as reader to King Stanislas, and thanks to her success as a playwright, persuading the actors to produce his play, which had been retitled Les Engagements indiscrets. It had its premiere on 26 October 1752. The performance was intended to coincide with the ceremony of Devaux's reception into the Académie de Nancy (now called the Académie de Stanislas), when he delivered his Discours sur l’esprit philosophique, but the indisposition of one of the actors delayed it. Françoise de Graffigny also supervised the publication of the play in 1753.Showalter, Françoise de Graffigny, p. 291-300 Relations between the two friends became strained in the 1750s, although they continued to correspond. Devaux made several trips to Paris in the entourage of a new patron, Marie Françoise Catherine de Beauvau-Craon, marquise de Boufflers, who was the mistress of King-Duke Stanislas and had many other lovers, although Devaux was not one of them. He inherited Françoise de Graffigny's papers at her death, but never undertook the project of editing them—another dream they had shared was that their correspondence would rival that of Madame de Sévigné. He preserved the collection, however, and Françoise de Graffigny's letters are now being edited by a team headed by J. A. Dainard. They do in fact rival those of Madame de Sévigné. Devaux's letters from 1738 until the summer of 1751 form part of the manuscript collection, and are quoted extensively in the notes. From 1758 until his own death in 1796, Devaux lived an idle life in Lunéville, frequenting the houses of noble families of Lorraine, attending sessions of the Académie de Nancy, and writing occasional verse.Boyé, \\"Dernier Fidèle\\". He survived to be the senior member of the Académie de Nancy, but published nothing more in his lifetime. The manuscripts of many of his poems are now in the Bibliothèque municipale de Nancy, and a generous selection of them, along with his play and his discourse, were edited and published by Angela Consiglio in 1977. It has long been assumed that because eighteenth-century France was a notoriously libertine era, and because Devaux was befriended by several attractive women, he must have been having affairs with them. The truth is more interesting. He was bi-sexual; the greatest passion he talked to Françoise de Graffigny about was his infatuation with another man, Nicolas-François Liébault.Showalter, Françoise de Graffigny, p. 28-29. He was eventually coaxed into a sexual relationship by his neighbor, Barbe Lemire, and he occasionally slept with an actress friend, Clairon Lebrun.Showalter, Françoise de Graffigny, p. 178-79. With great ladies like the marquise de Boufflers, however, he was terrified; he thought he was ugly, and performance anxiety caused erectile dysfunction, as one would say now. He wrote all this to Françoise de Graffigny. As for their own relations, she said: \\"Je n'avais jamais pensé que tu fusses un homme et tu n'avais jamais pensé que je fusse une femme.\\" (I had never thought you were a man and you had never thought I was a woman.)Correspondance, V, 253, letter 691 (8 May 1744)  References   Works  *Les Engagements indiscrets, first performed in Paris 26 October 1752 at the Théâtre-Français; published Paris: Duchesne, 1753. *Discours sur l’esprit philosophique, read at the Académie de Nancy on 20 October 1752, published in the Mémoires de l'Académie de Nancy, 1755.

In August 2009 it was reported that during a raid the Russian police had killed an Algerian-born militant in Dagestan who according to the Federal Security Service, was \\"the Al-Qaeda co- ordinator in Dagestan\\". The militant was an Algerian national known as \\"Doctor Mohammed\\" and was thought to be a member of the 'Jamaat Shariat of Dagestan' In 2010, Russian police shot and killed a militant in the Russian republic of Dagestan.

Before the attacks, he sent an email threat to TT referring to Sweden's involvement in the War in Afghanistan and Swedish artist Lars Vilks' drawings of Muhammad as a roundabout dog. United Kingdom In 2003 Tony Blair sent armoured vehicles and hundreds of troops to London Heathrow Airport because the UK security services claimed there was a planned Al-Qaeda attack. MI5 said they received detailed intelligence in February 2003 about a plot to hijack planes flying from Eastern Europe and to fly them into Heathrow, to punish the United Kingdom for supporting the Iraq War. The men behind the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot reportedly had links to al-Qaeda. In September 2009, Tanvir Hussain, Assad Sarwar and Ahmed Abdullah Ali were convicted of conspiring to activate bombs disguised as drinks on aircraft leaving from London and going to North America. British and US security officials said the plan – unlike many recent homegrown European terrorist plots – was directly linked to al-Qaeda and guided by senior Islamist militants in Pakistan.

Nicknamed \\"l'idole\\" by Madame du Deffand, she was a lady in waiting to the Duchesse de Chartres and a mistress of Chartres' brother, the Prince de Conti. Life Marie-Charlotte Hippolyte de Campet de Saujon was born in Rouen, the daughter of Charles-François de Saujon, Baron de la Rivère, and Louis-Angélique de Barberin de Reignac. She married Comte Édouard de Boufflers-Rouverel, cavalry captain in the régiment de Bellefonds, on 15 February 1746. They had one child, Louis-Édouard de Boufflers-Rouverel (1746-1795). Shortly after her marriage, she became lady in waiting to the Duchesse de Chartres. At the Palais-Royal, she got to know the duchess' brother, the Prince de Conti, and soon became his mistress. After an argument with the powerful Orléans family, she installed herself at a small hôtel particulier in enclos du Temple, next to the palace of the Grand Prior. Until 1789, she held a salon there, the main focus of Paris' then Anglomania. She received Encyclopédistes like Denis Diderot, David Hume, Grimm, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the abbé Prévost, the abbé Morellet, and Beaumarchais. Surrounded and fêted by learned society, Madame du Deffand nicknamed her \\"l'idole\\". Under the influence of the Encyclopédistes, the countess became author of some works of literature and light poetry. In 1763, she went to London during the peace negotiations to accompany the wife of the French ambassador, Madame d'Usson. There she was fêted once again and met Samuel Johnson and Horace Walpole, who she received in Paris and at the Château de Stors, granted to her by the Prince de Conti after the death of Mme Panneau d'Arty in 1765. She ignored Versailles, first going there in 1750 on the death of her father-in-law, and was only officially presented there in 1770, by her then lover the Maréchale de Luxembourg (Marshal of Luxembourg). On her husband's death in October 1764, she hoped to marry her lover Louis François, 6th Prince de Conti but in the end had to give up this dream due to his lack of interest. In 1773, the Comtesse de Boufflers bought a country house at Auteuil to which she retired on the death of the Prince de Conti in 1776. The old Temple circle met until 1789. She acted as an agent for King Gustav III of Sweden. According to tradition she arranged the 1786 marriage between Germaine Necker and the Swedish ambassador Erik Magnus Staël von Holstein (Baron de Staël). Among her houses was the Château de La Rivière à Fronsac (she sold it in 1794). Arrested during the Reign of Terror, she was acquitted by the Revolutionary Tribunal. She wrote several poems and works of literature. Her son Louis-Édouard de Boufflers-Rouverel (1746-1795) married Amelie Constance des Alleurs.

The US claimed that al-Qaeda was in contact with the Kurdish Islamist group Ansar al- Islam from its inception in 1999; however, Ansar al-Islam's founder, Mullah Krekar, has staunchly denied any such link. Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, elements at first loosely associated with al-Qaeda, commanded by Abu Musab al- Zarqawi, have supported local resistance to the occupying coalition forces and the emerging government, particularly targeting Iraq's Shia majority. They have been implicated in the bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Iraq, as well as hundreds of other small and large scale attacks on the military and civilian targets. Eventually, al-Zarqawi claimed allegiance to bin Laden in October 2004. Al-Zarqawi was killed by U.S. air strikes on a safe house near Baqubah on 7 June 2006. Before his death, he was allegedly trying to use Iraq as a launching pad for international terrorism, most notably dispatching suicide bombers to attack hotels and government targets in Jordan.

The parish also includes the hamlet of Halse. In 2011 the settlement had a population of 708. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 890. History The parish includes the deserted medieval village of Stuchbury, about northeast of Greatworth village. Halse, about southeast of Greatworth village, is also the site of a deserted medieval village as well as a modern hamlet. Greatworth Manor House burned down in 1793, and only its ornate gatepiers remain. Parish church The Church of England parish church of Saint Peter was built in the 13th century. The chancel retains Early English features including a priests' door and two lancet windows in the south wall and a trio of stepped lancets in the east wall. The west tower was added in about 1300. The nave has 17th-century features including two north windows, two south windows and the south door, and the polygonal pulpit. The chancel arch was rebuilt in 1882 under the direction of the architect H. R. Gough. It is a Grade II* listed building. The west tower has a ring of six bells. A member of the Newcombe family, who were associated with bell-foundries in Bedford, Buckingham and Leicester, cast the tenor bell in about 1599. The fifth bell was also cast in about 1599 but the identity of the founder is unknown. Robert Taylor, who had foundries at Loughborough and Oxford, cast the fourth bell in 1825. The Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble, second and third bells in 2004. St Peter's churchyard has a notable array of historic headstones. 20 of them in are Grade II listed, and two late 17th-century English Baroque headstones are Grade II* listed. St Peter's parish is a member of the Chenderit Benefice, which includes the parishes of Chacombe, Marston St. Lawrence, Middleton Cheney, Thenford and Warkworth. Railways In 1847 Parliament passed a bill for the Buckinghamshire Railway to build a branch through Buckingham to Banbury. It was built through the south of Greatworth parish and opened in 1851. The nearest station was , which was not at Farthinghoe but southwest of Greatworth on the main road between Brackley and Middleton Cheney. The Northampton & Banbury Junction Railway was incorporated in 1863 and built through the parish, joining the Buckinghamshire Railway at Cockley Brake Junction south of the village. It opened in 1872 and became part of the Stratford on Avon and Midland Junction Railway in 1910. In 1951 British Railways closed the Northampton line to all traffic and the Banbury line to passenger traffic. BR closed the Banbury line to freight traffic in 1963. RAF Greatworth In 1949It has been established by Bletchley Park, that RAF Greatworth was in service from 1939 and operated throughout the Second World War as transmitters for Bletchley Park. Details are required for the land acquisition over this period of discrepancy 1939–49. Does this mean it was leased for ten years and then purchased? the Air Ministry bought land from Balliol College, Oxford to create RAF Greatworth, which was an RAF radio communications station from early in the 1950s until 1988. In 1973 the station had a selection of high frequency (HF) radio transmitters, including the Marconi HS31 (6 kW), HS51 (30 kW), HS71 (12 kW) and the Marconi MST (Marconi Self Tuner) 1200 (30 kW). There was also a selection of Racal Speedrace transmitters, one of which offered remote control of frequency and aerial parameters from Systems Control. The aerial farm had steerable log periodic antennae, dipoles, rhombics and bicones – all types of HF antenna. A 24-hour watch system, each consisting of an RAF sergeant, a junior technician (JT), a senior aircraftman (SAC) and a civilian radio technician was maintained which carried out preventive and corrective maintenance and also re-tuned the transmitters and their drive units as directed by Systems Control at RAF Stanbridge in Bedfordshire. After closure the site was leased to the USAF until it was handed back to the Ministry of Defence in February 1992. The site is now Greatworth Park trading estate, for which the original RAF buildings have been retained and extended.

Salzburg Hauptbahnhof, ..Graz Hauptbahnhof, Leoben Hauptbahnhof, ...Carinthia / East Tyrol: Klagenfurt Hauptbahnhof, Villach Hauptbahnhof, Tyrol: Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof, .. \\" Opened in 1853, it is one of the country's busiest railway stations with around 25,000 passenger movements daily. The station is owned and operated by the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB). It forms the junction of the Arlberg Railway to Bregenz, Brenner Railway to Italy, Mittenwald Railway to Germany's region of Ällgau, Stubai Valley Railway and the main east-west artery Lower Inn Valley Railway. Location Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof is located at Südtiroler Platz. It is at the southeastern side of the city centre and a 10-minute walk away. History The planning of a railway line in the region of Tyrol began in 1850 under the Austrian Empire. Three years later, Emperor Franz Joseph I approved the route from Innsbruck to Wörgl across the Inn Valley. In 1854, the line is extended to the border city, Kufstein, close to the Kingdom of Bavaria. Franz Czwerwenka, head of the civil construction department, designed the railway station as one of the most beautiful station buildings within the Austrian Empire. Innsbruck station opened along with the line to Kufstein. In 1867, the station then assumed greater importance upon the commissioning of the Brenner Railway (then part of the Südbahn (Southern Railway) crossing the Alps at 1,371 metres above sea into South Tyrol) and, in 1883, the Arlberg Railway (reaching the westernmost of modern-day Austria). Innsbruck West railway station was created for the Arlberg Railway. By the 1880s, due to the heavy train traffic over the Brenner Pass, the original station had become too small to accommodate passengers and freight; therefore, the station building and train shed were rebuilt on the same site.  Transfer to ÖBB  On 1 January 1924, the ÖBB took over all railway lines of the Südbahngesellschaft (Southern Railway Company). In 1927, the station was once again rebuilt to enhance its capacity. The departure hall was frescoed by Rudolf Stolz; the platforms were connected with a subway underneath and the train shed was replaced by platform roofs. At the same time, the Operations Directorate moved into the \\"Clock Tower Building\\" (so called due to a small clock tower at the top) in the station's north wing. Stubai Valley tram, Südtiroler Platz, and post-war station building in the 1970s. By the end of the Second World War, the station was completely destroyed by Allied bombings. An ÖBB architect later combined various designs of other well-known architects to create a plain, functional replacement station building in the style of the 1950s. In 1954, the Austrian artist Max Weiler was awarded the contract for the design of a large departure hall. His design, however, has attracted controversy, as he chose a pair of murals on display to represent Innsbruck's heritage. In 1997, the ÖBB launched Bahnhofsoffensive, a scheme to reconstruct existing railway stations within Austria. Innsbruck Hauptbhanhof received a new design by the architects of Riegler Riewe. The groundbreaking ceremony took place in 2001 and the new station was officially open on 19 May 2004. ÖBB renovated the 1920s clock tower in the north wing for housing a police station. Total cost of construction for the project amounted to €25 million. Station building The present station building. The central component of the present station building is the main hall, which extends through to the basement, with access to the platforms through two tunnels (north tunnel and south tunnel). There is also access from the main hall to the underground parking station (and then, via another pedestrian tunnel, to the Hotel Europa and escalators to the bus and tram terminals), and, via an additional pedestrian tunnel, to the bus station and local shops. On its northern side, the station building adjoins an office building. The striking frescoes by Max Weiler, together with a few centimetres of underlying masonry, were removed from the 1950s station building in one piece and remounted in the new concourse. Almost simultaneously with the construction of the new station building, a public transport hub was created in the station forecourt, which is paved with a red-colored asphalt (and nicknamed \\"Red Square\\"). The new hub serves the Innsbruck tramway network, regional and urban bus lines, and the narrow gauge Stubai Valley Railway. At the time it was created, a rail junction was built at the southern end of the square for a proposed new tram route towards the south, but construction of the new route itself was deferred. Other facilities Overview from Bergisel. The station has eight through tracks. Of these, platform 1 is accessible at ground level as \\"home platform\\", and platform 8 is accessible from the East (only) for loading cars onto motorail trains. Additionally, there are four bay platforms (platforms 21-22, 31 and 41), for regional passenger traffic via the Mittenwald railway, the Arlberg railway and the Brenner railway. The Hauptbahnhof complex includes the Frachtenbahnhof Innsbruck, which, amongst other facilities, lost much of its importance when the Innsbruck goods train bypass (Inntaltunnel) was completed in 1994. It now stands to be partially transformed in the course of urban development into a residential area. The shunting yard of the Innsbruck railway junction is located at Hall in Tirol.  Services  Significance The station is important for commuter traffic to and from the Tyrolean provincial capital, and in providing a hub function for east-west traffic ((Budapest) – Vienna – Salzburg – Wörgl – Innsbruck (Zürich) / Bregenz) and north-south traffic (Munich – Wörgl – Innsbruck – Bolzano – Verona – (Milan / Venice / Rome )). Since December 2007, the station has also been the focal point of Tyrol S-Bahn lines , and , and a terminus of lines and . The railway line between Baumkirchen (about east of Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof) and Wörgl Hauptbahnhof (known as the Lower Inn Valley railway) is one of the busiest railway lines in Austria (up to 430 trains a day) and is therefore currently being rebuilt as a four track line, as part of the TEN Berlin–Palermo axis. In Wörgl Hauptbahnhof, the railway line divides into a northern branch via Kufstein to Salzburg and Munich, and an eastern branch via Zell am See to Salzburg, Graz and Klagenfurt (Gisela Railway).

Huntercombe is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History Huntercombe was built as an Internment Camp during World War II originally known as Camp 020R. It was a reserve camp for Camp 020 at Latchmere House in south London. Camp 020R was mainly used for long term detention, but Rudolf Hess was said to be held there briefly on his way south after he parachuted into Scotland in 1941. After the war the site opened as a prison in 1946. The site has seen renovation over the years so that very few wartime buildings remain today. Previously the prison had held adult males and was a Borstal to up to 1983, but in 2000 Huntercombe became a cellular prison for male juveniles aged 15 to 18. An October 2002 report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons heavily criticised Huntercombe for being severely overcrowded. The report described the prison as unsafe and recommended a large reduction in prisoners being held there. In April 2007 a report from the Independent Monitoring Board stated that Huntercombe was failing in its central purpose to rehabilitate inmates. The report also criticised the fact that prisoners with serious mental health conditions were being sent to Huntercombe despite the fact that the prison did not have the facilities to treat them. However the report praised staff at Huntercombe and the prison's approach to race relations. In June 2010, Huntercombe was decommissioned as a juvenile prison due to a national decrease in Juvenile offender numbers. The prison was reopened in October 2010 as a Category C jail for up to 400 adult males. In February 2012 the Ministry of Justice announced a gradual transition to foreign national offenders only and the prison now holds a solely foreign-national population mainly awaiting deportation. Prison Facilities The prison's purpose-built sports complex comprises a sports hall with climbing wall, a cardiovascular fitness room, and an astroturf pitch. Huntercombe's chaplaincy comprises one full-time Chaplain, and access to a range of ministers representing different faiths. Huntercombe has a visitors centre, located outside the main gate of the prison. The visits room has a small children's play area, toilets and nappy changing facilities. Refreshments are available through the WRVS canteen at weekends and vending machines during the week. Concern about Lack of Support for Resettlement In the 2017 and 2018 concerns were raised about a lack of support and resources for resettlement at HMP Huntercombe. In 2017 the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) found the budget for resettlement at HMP Huntercombe was minimal and said the lack of support was a \\"major area of unfairness\\" between the way UK national prisoners and foreign prisoners are treated in the UK. Despite the fact that HMP Huntercombe tried to increase support for resettlement in 2018 the Ministry of Justice did not increase its overall budget for this area to be properly resourced.

The failure of the engine for which it was designed, and the obsolescence of the pusher configuration, resulted in its remaining an experimental type only. Development and design At the start of the First World War, Vickers entered into a partnership with the Hart Engine Company to develop a 150 hp (110 kW) nine- cyliner radial engine designed by Hart. This engine was planned to power a number of new designs by Vickers, the first of which was a small single-engine pusher biplane fighter, the F.B.12.Bruce 1969, p. 101. The F.B.12 shared the obsolescent pusher layout of the D.H.2 and F.E.8, although the raised nacelle vastly improved the rear view from the cockpit. The wings were of wood and fabric construction, with rounded tips. The circular nacelle was framed in steel tubing, with the engine directly behind the cockpit, driving a wooden propeller. The tail was at the end of a structure of steel booms. A .303 in (7.7 mm) machine gun was placed inside the front of the nacelle, with only the barrel protruding. The first FB.12 flew in June 1916, powered by an 80 hp (60 kW) Le Rhône rotary engine as the Hart was not yet available. With this engine, it proved to be underpowered and was re-fitted with a 100 hp (75 kW) Gnome Monosoupape engine. It was then rebuilt with increased wing span and area, becoming the F.B.12A.Bruce 1969, p. 102. In December 1916 it was sent to France for operational testing, where it was deemed as good as the D.H.2 and F.E.8, a rather back-handed recommendation as both these types were by now well outclassed by the latest German fighters, the Albatros D.Is. The F.B.12B was similar to the F.B.12A, but fitted with the originally intended Hart engine, flying early in 1917. In November 1916, meanwhile, the War Office placed an order for 50 Hart-powered aircraft, designated the F.B.12C for the RFC. The F.B.12B crashed during tests in early 1917, leading to Vickers abandoning the Hart. Only 18 of the order were built, being fitted with a number of different engines including a 110 hp (80 kW) Le Rhône and a 100 hp (75 kW) Anzani radial.Bruce 1969, p. 103. Tested between May and July 1917, only one F.B.12C was delivered, to a Home Defence unit. The F.B.12D was the final variation, only one prototype was produced with a larger 110 hp (80 kW) Le Rhone engine.

It was established by the Orthodox Rabbi Ron Yosef in 2008. The organization opposes anal intercourse between men, following the prohibition in Leviticus.\\"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable\\" (18:22) \\"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable\\"(20:13). Hod's goal is Etymology Hod (Hebrew: הו\\"ד, English:'Majesty'. An acronym for 'religious gays' in Hebrew) adopts its name from a social group that used to meet in Tel Aviv within the Israeli Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Association in the 90's. In the first decade of the 21st century it was dismantled. The name of the organization corresponds with the Hod (Majesty) Sephira (Emanation), which is connected to truth-telling. Formation Its beginning is in the Walla's \\"Religious Gays\\" Forum. The forum was the most important site for religious gays and lesbians in Israel at the time . But with time, as the forum grew older, the tensions between the various groups that wanted to navigate the forum to different directions according to their religious perceptions, widened. Eventually it became impossible to keep the forum in its original form and it was closed. One group became the Havruta which was supported by the Jerusalem Open House, while the other group evolved to the independent organization of \\"Hod\\". The two groups strived for preservation of the religious-homosexual identity, encouraged Coming out and opposed Conversion therapy. The Hod people supported unquestioningly orthodoxy, commitment to Halakha and the importance of the discourse with rabbis and educators alike, while the Havruta people supported a change of the current situation from the field and not via rabbis, coordinating social gatherings, abstention from expressing a religious stand regarding inter-sex relationship and sexuality and participation of some of its members in the Pride parade of Israel. Hod was established on 1 February 2008 by rabbi Ron Yosef and Itay, a religious attorney with a team of 12 that included most of the Walla! Forum and the group of \\"Asaf Zehavi\\" (an alias), a known religious homosexual activist at the time. In the same month the internet website was launched. Hod from its beginning was a voluntary organization and it is not supported financially by any rabbi or other factor, so it can remain objective and hold an independent agenda. Hod from the start focused in discourse with rabbis and finding Halakhic and social solutions for religious gays. For example, it organized in 2008 a meeting with rabbi Yuval Cherlow with the participation of Bat Kol, educators and parents. This discourse progressed finally to the \\"Document of Principles\\" which was first published publicly in 2008. It was decided in the first year and a half of its activity to not open another social group but to support the running group of \\"Asaf Zehavi\\". Only with the closing of Asaf's group towards the end of 2009, Hod started its organized independent social meetings, save the unique gathering it held thus far. Most its meeting till now have dealt with Brainstorming concerning the sexual orientation and the Halakha, along with holding Shabatot across the country. Hod perceives itself as the alternative of Atzat Nefesh, and opposed loudly to its unlicensed and non-professional therapies. In the course of 2008– 2010, Hod held an extensive negotiation with a known orthodox rabbinical figure, who demanded Hod not to \\"disturb\\" the activity of Atzat Nefesh and not \\"attack them in the media\\" and also demanded that each of these organizations (Atzat Nefesh and Hod) will continue to be active without disturbance or intervention. It was suggested that each religious homosexual will go first to a conversion therapy, and those who fail will be directed to the Puah Institute to be sent to an alternative therapy or to be matched with a woman and those fail that will be directed to Hod. Hod refused these demands and they named them \\"issuing a Kosher religious gay certificate\\". In 2011 Hod was registered as an official society at the Fellowship Societies Registrar of Israel. Activity Throughout the years Hod focused on education and advocacy with the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health and IDF. Hod met with psychologists and social workers, ran lectures and conversations with educators and pedagogical advisors in schools. Hod wrote together with professions, rabbis, psychologists and social workers different advising documents that serve as practical auxiliary tools. In 2012 a study Eve was held for Haredi social workers and for the first time a communication channel was opened with different Haredi rabbis. In the same year a committee of expert psychologists on behalf of the \\"Israel Psychologists Association\\" (IPA) on the subject of conversion therapies as a result of Hod's address to the Ministry of Health (Israel) and to the IPA. The Abundance of information and complaints concerning conversion therapies and the warning Hod published as a result of the journalistic investigation of the Uvda (\\"Fact\\") Television Program (regarding the Atzat Nefesh's therapies which employs unlicensed caregivers as demanded by the Israeli law and which use non-scientific and non-based methods) is what brought this committee. The committee stated that the chances of success of these therapies are very low and might cause damages, but stressed that the researches done in this matter are problematic since this issue was not investigated properly due to political correctness. In the same year Hod held an advertising campaign against conversion therapies and for self-acceptance of the religious homosexual community in Israel.https://www.buzzfeed.com/skarlan/guerilla-anti-conversion-campaign- launched-in-orthodox-jewis In June 2014, following Hod's request, the Israeli Union of Social Workers decided to adopt the position paper of the Israeli Psychologists Association concerning conversion therapies.http://www.psychology.org.il/%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A5-%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A8-%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%94-%D7%A9%D7%9C-%D7%94%D7%A4-%D7%99-%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%90-%D7%98%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%99-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%94-%D7%A2-%D7%99-%D7%90%D7%99%D7%92%D7%95%D7%93-%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%95-%D7%A1- They also stated that no proof was found for the success of these therapies, where the damages they might create are well known: depression, self-hatred and on extreme cases even suicide. In October 2014 the Israeli Ministry of Health adopted the Psychologist Association's stance as well as a result of Hod's address.http://www.mako.co.il/news-israel/health-q4_2014/Article- fcd9af10c10e841004.htmhttp://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/10/israel- struggle-with-gay-conversion-therapy-20141031101722571559.html Goals Hod tries to reconcile the sexual orientation of its members with their religious beliefs. It does so by emphasizing the difference between homosexual orientation and homosexual acts. Rather, the organization intends to offer support and to stimulate social contact between religious homosexuals, as to diminish the feelings of loneliness frequently experienced by these individuals. Hod is a house for orthodox religious homosexual Jewish men in Israel and across the world who are dealing with their sexual orientation. Hod hold occasionally get-togethers and social activities. These meetings serve as a peer-support and aid group. Hod was created out of the need of religious homosexual men to keep their Halakha-abiding religious identity and at the same time have a healthy life in which their sexual preference is expressed. Hod is interested in creating among the Torah observant public and its leaders a public, Halakhic and social discourse which should bring to the recognition in religious homosexuals as an existing phenomenon within the religious society. Hod frequently organizes meetings and lectures by Orthodox Rabbis. Throughout the years, such discourse was held with Rabbi Ratson Arusi, Rabbi Shlomo Aviner, Chief Military Rabbi Avichai Rontzki, Rabbi Yisrael Rozen, Rabbi David Stav, Rabbi Eliyahu Aberjil and MK Moshe Feiglin. The purpose of the discourse is to bridge over the opposing stances under the spirit of tolerance and equality and through this to improve the existential and social state of a religious homosexual in the religious society, turn for the better (Tikkun olam) the Jewish Israeli society, disseminate pro-tolerance education and acceptance of the other through the guidance of educators, psychologists and scholars. Hod is also active in the eradication of hatred and intolerance towards any homosexuals.http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/05/17/israel-rabbi- speaks-out-on-being-gay-and-orthodox/ Hod supplies without any prejudicial bias a respond, attentive ear, support and preliminary counseling to a wide spectrum of religious homosexuals. According to Hod's reports during the 5 years it exists, it received over 6,000 internet and phone inquiries, which include adolescents, married homosexuals, mentally stressed to suicidal homosexuals etc. Hod's Hotline is the only existing multi-category alternative to that of Atzat Nefesh. Hod established a special staff of religious psychologists, authorized by law, who help and give mental support to religious men seeking for counseling and help in the complicated process they go through. In addition other counseling documents were written along with educators, psychologists and social workers. Hod published a few counseling documents such as \\"Ahavat Nefesh\\" booklet which deals with the religious and social difficulty of religious homosexuals and calls for solutions for them by the rabbinical establishment; the \\"Spiritual Counseling Document to the Religious Adolescent\\"; \\"Faithful Jew'Yehudi Maamin'- a play of words of the words \\"Jew\\", \\"religious homosexual\\" and \\"Hod\\"'s name Document\\" which presents the outlines of the religious way of the homosexual etc. Hod also works within ultra-Orthodox society, in which thousands of its sons suffer inadequate treatments and attempts to convert their sexual orientation while distorting Halakha and Judaism. Hod holds hundreds of testimonies of men who have tried to change along the years and suffered damages as a result. Views * Hod opposes anal intercourse between men, as specified in the Torah. * Hod embraces the stand of Israel Psychologists Association (IPA) and the American Psychological Association (APA) which determined conversion therapies cause damage and lack a scientific basis. Therefore, there is no Halakhic base to such treatments. * Hod sees a relationship between men a valid option for a homosexual. Such relations are not a violation of the Halakha, considering the existing prohibitions. * Hod opposes participation of religious people in the Pride Parade, and also sounded its criticism against the participation of other religious organizations in the parade. * Hod encourages coming out of the closet. * Hod opposes same-sex marriage carried by the religious establishment, but supports civil agreements which supply civil right equality by the state. * Hod opposes marriage of a homosexual with a woman who doesn't know of his sexual orientation or of a homosexual who has no compatibility to sustain a proper and loving marital relationship. Rabbi Ron Yosef Rabbi Ron Yosef, who leads the organization, was initially known publicly only by his first name, thereby showing the delicate situation of homosexuals in the Jewish Orthodox community in Israel. However, In April 2009, he became the first Israeli orthodox Rabbi to come out, by appearing in Uvda (\\"Fact\\"), Israel's leading investigative television program . Document of Principles In an open letter distributed to Orthodox community leaders, the organization appealed to the Orthodox community to recognize them as part of the religious society. This was sent to over 100 rabbis in 2008, and eventually was known as the \\"Document of Principles\\": # There is no unequivocal evidence for any theory that seeks to explain the causes of homosexuality. A certain percentage of the population in any society is deeply convinced of their homosexual orientation, without being able to change it. There are also cases of people who have made great efforts to change, but did not succeed. # In the present reality, the struggle of a homosexual person brings with it considerable psychological difficulties. Consequently, one can advise a person who is interested in doing so, to consult a certified professional mental health worker, on condition that complete information is provided about the type of treatment, its chances of success and its risks. No treatment should be seen as either ultimate or exclusive. # A homosexual man may not be coerced into marriage, since marriage provides no inherent solution to a person struggling with his sexuality. Encouraging a homosexual man to marry without explicitly divulging his orientation is a transgression of the Halachic prohibition 'Thou shalt not put a stumbling block before the blind', and a moral injustice towards the spouse. One's capacity to marry does not only include a readiness to fulfill the commandment of \\"Be fruitful and multiply\\" but also the suitability to manage a healthy and moral relationship with one's spouse. # One who blames or insults homosexuals on account of their orientation is in violation of commandments governing interpersonal relationships – \\"bein adam lachaveiro\\". # On the condition that he does not publicize his actions, a person who has transgressed the prohibition of homosexual intercourse should not be cast out from the religious community. Homosexual activity (as opposed to the homosexual orientation itself) is prohibited absolutely by the Torah. For homosexuals, this prohibition represents a trying ordeal that must be overcome. # A person's Halakhic obligations in the realm of interpersonal relations apply equally to his or her behavior towards a homosexual person, and it is strictly forbidden to express hatred or violence towards him. He should be acknowledged as a full member of the religious community, be it in making up a minyan (prayer quorum), delivering the Priestly Blessing, being called up for a blessing on the Torah or being recognized as a valid witness – in these and in any other matter he should not be treated differently from any other person. # Homosexuals should be part of the community alongside the rest of the Jewish people. Nonetheless, it is of great importance to set up support groups for homosexuals, and such organizations are to be considered charity organizations. If a homosexual person has a close friend or relative who he can confide in for help and support, it is desirable for him to do so. A religious homosexual man should be encouraged to observe Jewish law in its entirety, even if he fails in one specific commandment. An 'all or nothing' policy is opposed to the way of Halakha. Every Jewish person should try to keep all the commandments and should do everything he or she can to be as observant of the Torah as possible. # In the same way that every person worships God in his or her own distinctive manner, so too every homosexual individual will deal with their sexuality and the problems it raises in a way best suited to them and their unique personality and set of circumstances. # A homosexual who does not get married should be encouraged to study the Torah and fulfill all the commandments, those governing both interpersonal relationships and those governing one's relationship with G-d. Similarly, he should be supported to develop his various strengths to devote them to the greater goals that God has set the Jewish people. It is desirable to consult a Rabbi in this matter. Up to 2013, 163 Orthodox rabbis from Israel and abroad have signed this statement, among them: rabbi Yuval Cherlow, rabbi Binyamin Lau, rabbi Haim Navon, rabbi Daniel Sperber, rabbi Eliezer Melamed, rabbi Shai Piron and rabbi Yehuda Gilad. Hod promotes advocacy actions focused on disseminating the \\"Document of Principles\\", which its main innovation lies in the call to separate the prohibited deed from the person and his sexual orientation.

Such formal exchange may be seen in the ceremony of the traditional Christian wedding, in which the bride is given to the groom by her father. Kinship The structuralist view of kinship was laid out in Lévi-Strauss' grand statement: Les Structures élémentaires de la parenté (The Elementary Structures of Kinship). In this, he combined Mauss' ideas about the importance of gifts in primitive societies with the role of the incest taboo in forcing exchanges of mates outside of closely related family groups. The resulting exchange of women is asymmetric in that men have power over women which is not reciprocated. The resulting social structures provide a framework for treating the oppression of women as a social construct rather than being a matter of biology. Biblical patriarchy Men in ancient Hebrew culture established and negotiated their relations with other men through the exchange of female relatives. This is seen in Old Testament narratives such as the stories spread across the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings. Criminal treatment In Afghanistan and remote areas of Pakistan, women may be exchanged in compensation for a debt or offence such as murder. This practice is known as swara. Pakistan's constitution prohibits this with a penalty of 3 to 10 years of imprisonment but the custom still persists. In art The exchange of women in the course of male bonding appears as a theme in the novels The Great Gatsby and Tropic of Capricorn.

Workshop of the Strasbourg cathedral router carving a sculpture from a block of marble 15th Century measuring device with plumb-bobs A pointing machine is a measuring tool used by stone sculptors and woodcarvers to accurately copy plaster, clay or wax sculpture models into wood or stone. In essence the device is a pointing needle that can be set to any position and then fixed. It further consists of brass or stainless steel rods and joints which can be placed into any position and then tightened. It is not actually a machine; its name is derived from the Italian macchinetta di punta. The invention of the tool has been ascribed to both the French sculptor and medallist Nicolas-Marie Gatteaux (1751–1832)Cami Santamera: Sculpture In Stone, Barrons Educational Series Inc, 2001/10/01, Biography of Gatteaux (French)on Gatteaux' invention of the pointing machine (French) and to the British sculptor John Bacon which in turn cites Richard Cecil, Memoirs of John Bacon, R.A. (London, 1801) and J. Pratt, ed., R. Cecil's works, vol. i (1811) (1740–1799). It was later perfected by Canova.Putman, Brenda, ‘’The Sculptor’s Way: A Guide to Modelling and Sculpture’’, Stone and Marble Carving by Robert A. Baillie, Farrar & Rinehart, Inc, New York, 1939, p. 305 However, similar devices were used in ancient times, when the copying of Greek sculptures for the Roman market was a large industry.  Use  The pointing machine is used for making one-to-one copies of existing sculptures and to reproduce models made of plaster, modeling clay or modeling wax in materials like stone or wood. It is not possible to use a pointing machine to produce enlarged or reduced copies; the traditional instruments for this are a set of calipers or a three-dimensional version of the pantograph.A video on the use of such a pantograph However, there is also a special version of the pointing machine that was used for mirroring, enlargements or reduced carving.A video on the use of a special pointing machine, from the workshop of Dutch architect Pierre Cuypers (Dutch subtitles) To better control the end result of the finished sculpture, sculptors have increasingly taken to making a detailed model and then reproducing it, on the same scale or enlarged, in stone. Particularly in the 19th century, sculptors would follow a specific procedure: first a wax or clay model was made, of which a plaster cast was taken, which in its turn served as the model to be copied in stone with the use of calipers or a pointing machine.\\"In modern times the sculptor makes a clay model from which he makes a plaster cast. The important projections and depressions are marked in this cast by metal pins, called points, and an ingenious device called the pointing machine makes it possible to mark the corresponding points in the block of marble. The marble is then cut away to all the points marked. The number of such points may be very great, in which case the statue is nearly finished when all the points are reached. In fact, many sculptors of modern times are merely modellers. They send their models to the stone-cutter, who, with the help of the pointing machine and other contrivances, makes an accurate copy. The more careful sculptors add the finishing touches themselves, but very few do any great amount of chiselling.\\" The Technique of Sculpture, William Ordway Partridge, p.91-94 This is called the indirect method of carving. The advantages of this method are that the end result is very controllable and that the chance of making irreparable mistakes is reduced drastically. In addition, the process is much faster when carving difficult sculptures, because the search for the right shape is done during the modelling process instead of during the carving itself, thus making it much easier to adjust it or make changes. Finally, using this method, much or all of the work can be done by assistant sculptors, increasing productivity. The disadvantages of using the pointing machine are a great loss of directness and the risk of loss of expression. Famous sculptors increasingly tended to use assistants. Sometimes a sculptor would run a large workshop with dozens of assistants and pupils. Art academies were formed where the skills of sculpture were taught in detail. The consequence of this development was the generation of 'academy art', from which some sculptors wanted to distance themselves. Sculptors eventually returned to more direct forms of expression, by means of for example the 'direct carving method', impressionism and expressionism. This was sometimes influenced by the indigenous art of Africa and Oceania, which brought about a shock because of its directness and raw expression. The pointing machine's popularity waned as a result, reflecting the diminishing knowledge and skills of carving in wood and stone during the 20th century.  Technique  To transfer measuring points from a model to a block of stone or wood, the sculptor usually takes three reference points on both model and block. By using these points a sculpture can be measured accurately, for the three directions of measuring – width, height and depth – are thus defined. These three measuring points are traditionally used by sculptors to copy a sculpture with calipers, but this was simplified significantly with the invention of the pointing machine. In using the pointing machine, the sculptor mounts or glues three metal rivets, that correspond to each other, on both model and block of stone or wood. To these basic points, a (usually wooden) T-shaped support is hooked up, the cross. On this crosswood, the actual pointing device is attached. The sculptor sets the device by moving the arms of the tool so that the point of the needle just touches the point to be measured on the model (for instance, the nose of a bust). The needle is set at a right angle to the surface that is measured and the stop is tightened. The sculptor then takes the whole cross, pointing machine and all, to the block of stone or wood and sets it up on the identical, corresponding basic points. The needle that defines the measuring point can slide. By subsequently carving or drilling carefully until the needle touches the stop, the sculptor can place their measuring point exactly in the block. By thus copying several dozens or hundreds of points, an accurate copy can be carved. The quality of the copy will still depend on the skill of the sculptor, however, because these points are only the basis for the final sculpture. The real advantage is the need to measure each point only once, instead of three times with callipers (once each for height, width and depth). Also there is no need to read scales in inches or centimetres, and consequently there is less room for error. Usually, the sculptor will make their own crosswood for the statue, as a small statue needs a much smaller crosswood than a life-size statue does. History and future Before the invention of the pointing machine by Gatteaux, sculptors used several methods to measure and copy sculpture, such as grids,Cami/Santamera, Sculpture In Stone which were already in use in early Egyptian sculpture, plumb-bobs, measuring sticks and calipers. The main technique was to measure the model from three fixed points with calipers. Nowadays laser pointing machines are available. These have the advantages that the needle does not hinder carving and that the sculptor is given an audible warning when the right depth is reached. The latest developments are computer guided router systems that scanExample of how scanning sculptures can preserve the information a model and can reproduce it in a variety of materials and in any desired size.An example of a sculpture being computer carved in marble  References   External links  * Video on the use of the pointing machine * Carving in marble with the aid of a pointing machine Visual arts materials Tools Woodcarving Sculpture techniques ","title":"Pointing machine"},{"id":"19174775","text":"Joseph Patrat or Patras (7 May 1733, Arles - 4 June 1801, Paris) was a French actor and plawright.

He was a professor at the University of Lund from 1862-1895, where he isolated the element niobium in 1864. He developed an early version of the periodic table and made advances in understanding the chemistry of coordination compounds. Blomstrand published textbooks in chemistry and was well-known internationally for his scientific contributions. Education and career Blomstrand was born in Växjö, Sweden to his father John Blomstrand, who was a teacher, and his wife Severina Rodhe. Blomstrand studied mineralogy at the University of Lund, where he earned a philosophy degree in 1850. He then became interested in chemistry and was the first recipient of the Berzelius scholarship. In 1854, he completed his habilitation for research on bromine and iodine compounds of tin. With the exception of lecturing at the Elementary Technical School of Malmö in 1855 and working as a mineralogist on an expedition to Spitsbergen in 1861, Blomstrand's entire career was at the University of Lund. Blomstrand was appointed an adjunct lecturer and laboratory demonstrator in chemistry at the University of Lund in 1856. He became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1861. He became a professor of chemistry and mineralogy at Lund in 1862, remaining there until his retirement in 1895. He served as rector of the university from 1871-1872. The elements Niobium crystals Purified niobium Blomstrand's experimental research involved the characterization and analysis of minerals, particularly those which were rare or of unknown composition. These included euxenite, ilmenite, monazite, niobite, and tantalite. He focused on the chemical analysis of what are now known as the group Vb subgroup of Group 5 elements. These \\"earth acids\\" include the elements tantalum, niobium, molybdenum, tungsten, and their various mineral associates. In 1864, Blomstrand was the first person to successfully obtain the element niobium in pure form. Blomstrand had been studying various metal chlorides, and he identified the oxychloride of niobium, NbOCl3 as part of this investigation. He then isolated niobium by placing niobium chloride in an atmosphere of hydrogen and heating it. In that way, he obtained pure metallic niobium as a steel-gray material. Niobium had previously been discovered in 1801 by English scientist Charles Hatchett, using an ore obtained from the United States. Hackett named the element Columbium, only being renamed Niobium in 1950. However, the element was not obtained in pure form until Blomstrand conducted his investigations. In 1870, Blomstrand proposed a new way of systematizing the elements, a \\"natural system\\" based on atomicity (the ability of elements to combine with other elements) and the electrochemical properties of the element. Organizing the elements into subgroups of even and odd atomicity revealed \\"extraordinary regularities\\". While Blomsrand's system was a significant advance toward developing a periodic table of the elements, it did not account well for metals. Blomstrand included his system in his revised edition of Nils Johan Berlins popular textbook in 1870, and in his own textbooks in 1873 and 1875. Dmitri Mendeleev, later credited with developing the periodic table in widespread use, credited Blomstrand with important early advances leading to the organization of the periodic system. Chemical structure One of Blomstrand's goals was to develop an understanding of how atoms are bonded together to form compounds and the resulting chemical structures of compounds. He attempted to reconcile the dualistic theory of Jöns Jacob Berzelius with unitary and type theories. Blomstrand developed the most widely accepted of the 19th century theories of coordination complexes. His chain theory (1869) was further developed, modified, and experimentally supported by his colleague Sophus Mads Jørgensen. Jørgensen prepared numerous examples of coordination complexes, providing an experimental foundation for Blomstrand-Jørgensen chain theory and for Alfred Werners coordination theory (1893). In developing the theory, Blomstrand reconciled the low reactivity of the ammonia molecules present in metal ammine complexes by theorizing that the ammonia molecules were chemically linked together in a chain, rendering them chemically unreactive. This chain theory was superseded in 1893, almost 25 years later, when Alfred Werner proposed his coordination theory. Recognition The island Blomstrandhalvøya and the glacier Blomstrandbreen on Spitsbergen are named after him.

In that time the group was called Grupo de Capoeira Anglo Regional and the first groups teacher was Carlos Antonio (Carlinhos Chuchu). In the year 1978 Mestre Passarinho took on the group changing the name to Grupo de Capoeira São Bento Pequeno.

It stands in the South Transept, directly under the tower, facing North, with a generous amount of free space around it.http://www.stgeorgescullercoatsfriends.org.uk/our-heritage/the-tc-lewis- organ/ From this position, its commanding voice can be heard in all parts of the building without loss of impact, even with a full congregation. It is a substantial instrument, built in Lewis's grand style with Swell behind Great on the same level and Pedal on three unit chests behind and alongside the manual divisions. There is no facade casework, although the front pipes appear to have been laid out to receive one, the lower part is panelled in oak. The console is central in the case and is 'en fenêtre'. The action to manuals and drawstops is mechanical; the pedal action is pneumatic. A Discus blower feeds the main bellows which can still be raised by hand. A full restoration of the organ was carried out in 1987, by Harrison & Harrison of Durham. The organ is one of a small number in the country designed by Lewis which have not been significantly altered.http://www.northtyneside.gov.uk/browse- display.shtml?p_ID=532490&p;_subjectCategory=1432 The church has a regular recital series on Bank Holidays and in the summer months. =List of organists= * Mr. Smith 1884 * Mr C.H.S.

It is based in the city of Getxo in Biscay Province (Vizcaya), in the Basque Country of northern Spain. The company's goal is the technological development, construction, operation and maintenance of concentrated solar power plants. History Torresol Energy began to take shape in 2007, when SENER Grupo de Ingenieríasener.es decided to promote its own thermosolar plants. To do this, it joined forces with Masdar, the renewable energy company of the Government of Abu Dhabi. In 2008 Torresol Energy was founded, controlled by SENER Grupo de Ingeniería (60%) and Masdar (40%).SENER and Masdar announce joint venture to develop concentrating solar power plants in the 'Sunbelt' The company focuses its efforts on southern Europe, northern Africa, the Mideast, the southwestern United States and South America. In 2011 it launched the Gemasolar plant into commercial operation in Fuentes de Andalucía, Seville - the first solar power plant with central tower receiver technology and a molten salt storage system; and in 2012 it commissioned two more thermosolar plants with parabolic trough technology (CCP): Valle 1 and Valle 2Torresol’s Valle 1 & Valle 2: Single tank thermal storage deployed in San José del Valle, Cádiz. The plants Gemasolar is the first commercial solar plant in the world with a central tower receiver and molten salt heat storage technology. It has a 19.9 MW power generating capacity, which translates into an expected net production of 110 GWh/year and a 15-hour storage capacity in the absence of solar radiation. The plant consists of a 185 ha solar field with a 140 m high tower receiver, a power island and 2650 heliostats, each 120 m2 and distributed in concentric rings around the tower. The facility is located in Fuentes de Andalucía in Seville, Spain. The inclusion of the molten salt heat storage system allows the plant to produce electricity even when there is no solar radiation. The heat collected by the salts (which can reach temperatures over 500°C), acts to generate steam which in turn is used to produce electric power. The excess heat accumulated during sunlight hours is stored in the molten salt tank, endowing the plant with the ability to produce electric power 24 hours a day in some months.Spain's round-the-clock solar power plant In January 2012, Valle 1 and Valle 2 were launched in San José del Valle (province of Cádiz, Spain): two adjacent plants that generate power using parabolic trough technology. Each of these plants has a 50 MW generation capacity, with an expected net power production of 160 GWh/year. The plants are located on a 510,000 m2 solar field equipped with SENERtrough® parabolic troughs. Each has a heat storage system with 7.5 hours of capacity. SENERtrough® parabolic troughs concentrate solar radiation into a central collector tube with thermal oil circulating in it, and they have high precision optical sensors which track the sun from east to west. The hot oil is used to heat water, which through expansion in a steam turbine, propels a power generator which sends power to the electrical grid.

The title track is an \\"operatic duet\\" between Dagmar Krause and Omar Ebrahim, based on a painting of the same title by Paul Richards, which is depicted on the cover, and used in a video art project by Richards of the same name. The album includes music from Peter Greenaway's Making a Splash and 26 Bathrooms (originally part of the concert work, Memorial), an excerpt of Nyman's unfinished opera, Tristram Shandy, and a concert piece, \\"Tango Between the Lines\\". The works The Kiss The Kiss was commissioned as part of a Channel 4 series of artists videos, in which Nyman's \\"operatic duet\\" plays as Paul Richards creates a painting of a kiss with a Quantel Paintbox. By design, the male voice is a trained singer, the female voice is a self-trained, pop, non-music reader, preferably whose native language is not English, possibly representing an Etruscan. The parts were written for Omar Ebrahim and Anne Pigalle, who performed them in the video. Dagmar Krause replaced Pigalle for the album, and brought to it a darker sonority. The text is based on a collection of 15th century texts about art. The theme line \\"Images were introduced because many people cannot retain what they hear, but rememember if they see images\\" is intended by Nyman as ironic—the text originally referred to Biblical scenes versus texts from the Bible. The final bars of The Kiss were later used as a prelude to Nyman's opera with Victoria Hardie, Vital Statistics, with which it shares a common theme. The theme is used to similar effect in their opera, Facing Goya, which is a four-act opera built on the remains of Vital Statistics, which flopped and was withdrawn. Nose-List Song \\"Nose-List Song\\" is the fourth section of Nyman's unfinished opera, Tristram Shandy. The song is based on \\"Slawkenbergius's Tale\\" from Volume IV, Chapter 1 of The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, which depicts a visitor to Strasbourg from the Promontory of Noses. It collects together most of the statements made about the visitor by Strasbourg's residents, verbatim from the novel by Laurence Sterne. As recorded, it is performed as a solo by soprano Sarah Leonard. All of the statements are included in the lyrics sheet, but lines 3-8 of the final stanza are omitted on the recording. The vocal line is mostly, but not entirely, in monotone, with the majority of musical ideas carried by the instrumental music, melodies built on a harmonic pinning of the dominant sevenths A, F, B, and, D. The lyrics of 'Nose-list song': Never saw such a nose in my life 'Tis a nose of parchment It is six times as big but 'tis a nose like my nose I heard it crackle I saw it bleed What a pity we didn’t both touch it What a nose 'Tis as long as a trumpet And of the same mettle as you hear by its sneezing 'Tis as soft as a flute 'Tis brass 'Tis a pudding's end 'Tis a brazen nose. I'll know the bottom of it For I will touch it with my finger before I sleep My nose shall never be touched whilst heaven give me strength There is more in it than any of a dozen of the largest noses put together in all Strasbourg 'Tis a false nose, made of fir tree There's a pimple on it 'Tis a dead nose 'Tis a live nose and if I am alive myself I will touch it Such a monstrous nose, said they, had it been a true one could not possibly have been suffered in civil society -And if false- to impose on society with such False signs and tokens was a still greater violation of its rights and must have had still less mercy shown it.I have made a vow to St Nicholas this day that my nose shall not be touched till I… I'll know the bottom of it for I will touch it with my fingers before I sleep. Tango Between the Lines \\"A musical 'alloy', bringing together two different but related musical materials. The connection with the tango is somewhat imaginary.\\"Michael Nyman. The Kiss and Other Movements Liner notes. 1990. This is all Nyman had to say about the piece, the shortest, on the album. Images Were Introduced Bearing the name of a key line in The Kiss, this piece is the sixth movement of the larger work, Memorial, assembled from music used in Peter Greenaway's Inside Rooms: 26 Bathrooms, London and Oxfordshire, 1985. Nyman describes the piece in the liner notes mainly in terms of an exploration of the beauty of Sarah Leonard's upper register, in which he does not have her use words. Water Dances Water Dances forms the score of Peter Greenaway's 1984 film, Making a Splash, a short documentary about synchronized swimming. It is the same recording used in the film, although for the film it was heavily edited and fades out at the end rather than reaching its conclusion. Eventually, Nyman expanded the piece into an eight-movement concert work lasting approximately 40 minutes, although the complete version has never been released on a commercial recording. \\"Stroking\\" is Movement 2, \\"Gliding\\" Movement 5, and \\"Synchronizing\\" Movement 8—Nyman describes Movement 5, a slow movement, as a \\"remake\\" of Movement 2. Six movements are built on the chord progression D-G-C-A, derived from a madrigal by Claudio Monteverdi. The remaining two movements are built on the chord progression C-E-flat-A- flat-G.

He is chiefly remembered as an author of numerous works of fiction and nonfiction for children, much of it on historical or patriotic subjects. His byline for most of his writing was Elbridge S. Brooks. Life and family Brooks was born on April 14, 1846 in Lowell, Massachusetts, the son of Universalist minister Elbridge Gerry Brooks and Martha Fowle (Monroe) Brooks. He was raised in Bath, Maine, Lynn, Massachusetts and New York City, where his father served in various churches. He was educated in the public schools of Lynn and New York and entered the Free Academy (later the College of the City of New York) in 1861, which he left during his junior year to seek work. Later, in 1887, he received an A.M. degree from Tufts College. As an adult he lived in Philadelphia and New York City until removing to Somerville, Massachusetts, his mother's home town, in 1887. He married, in 1870, Hannah-Melissa Debaun of New York. They had two daughters, Geraldine and Christine Brooks. Geraldine would also become an author, revising some of her father's works for new editions as well as writing her own works. Brooks died January 7, 1902 in Somerville and interred at Mount Auburn Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and daughters,\\"AUTHOR OF BOY STORIES DEAD,\\" obituary in The Chicago Daily Tribune, January 8, 1902, page 4. though the younger, Christine, died the next year.\\"BROOKS--March 28,\\" obituary of Christine Brooks in The New York Times, April 5, 1903, page 17. Career Brooks took a job as a clerk with the publishing house of D. Appleton & Company in 1865, and continued working professionally for various publishers and magazines for the remainder of his life. He was employed by Ford & Company, Sheldon & Company and Henry Holt & Company in the early 1870s before joining E. Steiger & Company in 1876 as head of its English educational and subscription department. He went on to become a member of the staff of Publishers Weekly in 1879, literary editor and dramatic critic for the Brooklyn Daily Times from 1883–1885, associate editor of St. Nicholas Magazine from 1884–1887, and an editor for D. Lothrop & Company from 1887 through his death, aside from the period of 1892-1895, when the firm went through financial difficulties and reorganization. He edited the series The Story of the States for Lothrop. He was also editor of Wide Awake from 1891-1893. Brooks started writing fiction, poetry and plays for children in 1879, his work appearing in St. Nicholas, Wide Awake, Harper's Young People, Golden Days, and The Independent. Much of this material was afterwards collected into book form, published by D. Lothrop and others. Brooks ultimately penned nearly seventy book-length works, mostly drawn from history, and American history in particular; a number of these, however, were revisions or expansions of earlier works issued under new titles. Some of his patriotic works were issued under the auspices of the Sons of the American Revolution and the Daughters of the American Revolution. Brooks also wrote some material for adult audiences, including one of his earliest books, a biography of his own father. He was a member of the Authors' Club of New York. Reception Brooks' works were dismissed by some critics as \\"machine-made,\\" but proved enduringly popular, some continuing to be reprinted many years after his death.Bowerman, Sarah G. \\"Elbridge Streeter Brooks,\\" article in Dictionary of American Biography.

Overtime is required to qualify for retroactive overtime. So, if a salesperson receives a commission, but does not receive overtime, then the employee does not qualify for retroactive overtime. Computation Retroactive overtime is computed by using the number of hours of overtime worked for the specified payroll period to look up the coefficient percentages from the coefficient table (Form WH-134).Coefficient Table for Computing Extra Half-Time for Overtime, Form WH-134 This coefficient percentage is then multiplied by the commission and/or bonus to determine the ROT amount that will be awarded to the employee in addition to the already existing overtime and commission. The additional amount on money beyond the overtime, the commission or bonus, must be a guaranteed payment to the employee based upon specified work criteria. Here are some examples of some bonuses that qualify and do not qualify.  Qualifying bonuses  If an employee is awarded a known amount of money for working a certain shift or for working a number of consecutive weeks, that additional amount of money that is paid beyond the regular base pay and overtime will qualify for retroactive overtime if and only if there are also overtime hours paid during the same pay period of the qualifying bonus. You could also consider this to have an OT value of zero and add an additional look-up table value of all zeros for the percentages to use to determine the ROT amount.  Non-qualifying bonuses  If an employee is awarded a discretionary bonus that is not guaranteed based upon specific work criteria, this bonus does not qualify for retroactive overtime. A good example of this is a Christmas bonus that may be awarded to employees. This is not a guaranteed bonus that the employee will receive for meeting a specified goal but is rather a bonus that is awarded to the employee on the discretion of the company.

Greaves was born in Farnworth, near Bolton. He began his football career as a junior with Bolton Wanderers, playing as a striker, and scored twice in his league debut against Southampton in 1965. With the team struggling after the abolishment of the maximum wage he still managed to lead the side's goal scoring charts but was criticised as the club went into the Third Division for the first time. When Jimmy Armfield took over as manager in the summer of 1971 he withdrew Greaves into a midfield role. Playing in this role he helped the team win the Third Division Championship in 1972–73 and eventually back into the top flight in 1977–78. Bolton's relegation two seasons later brought an end to Greaves' time at the club and he moved initially to the United States to play for Seattle Sounders before seeing out his career with a season at Rochdale. He then moved back to Bolton to run a pub.

The monastery was first mentioned in Tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria's Oryahov Charter of 1 December 1348, which indicated that that particular tsar of the Second Bulgarian Empire had donated to the monastery. According to some researchers, the eastern part of the modern church dates to the 14th century, while others claim it belongs to the Mount Athos architectural type and is similar to Greek churches of the 16th-17th century, as well as the church of the nearby Poganovo monastery in what is today Serbia dated to 1500. The Peshtera Monastery was abandoned during the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria. It was only renovated in 1842 by Dimitar Molerov of the Bansko artistic school, with the financial aid of the monk Simeon and his son. During the liberational Russo- Turkish War of 1877-1878, however, it was burned by the retreating Ottoman troops who hanged Simeon, with his son fleeing to the Rila Monastery. After the Liberation of Bulgaria, a prolonged cella was added to the old church and it was turned into the altar part. The new entrance from the west was designed as a three-arched portico with an arc-shaped pediment featuring a round window. A statue of the Ancient Roman god Mithras was unearthed during the reconstruction, leading to the assumption that a pre-Christian sanctuary existed at that place. Until the early 1990s, the monastery had a stone icon of Saint Nicholas made in 1853 by master Stoimen of Lobosh, but it has disappeared.

Francisco Herrera the Younger (\\"el Mozo\\"; 1622 - 25 August 1685) was a Spanish painter and architect. Life Born in Seville, he was the second son of Francisco Herrera the Elder (\\"el Viejo\\"), and began his career under his father's instruction; but the father's violent temper at last became so intolerable that the youth fled to Rome. For six years the younger Herrera devoted himself to the study of architecture, perspective, and the antique, his aim being fresco painting. He excelled in still life. He already painted bodegones, fish so cleverly done that the Romans called him lo Spagnuolo dei pesci (\\"the Spaniard of the Fish\\"). In 1656 he returned to Seville, founded the Seville Academy, and in 1660 became its sub-director under Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. He is said to have been vain, suspicious, hot-tempered, and jealous; at any rate he resented his subordinate post and went to Madrid about 1661 (Cean Bermúdez). Before leaving his native city he painted two large pictures for the cathedral and a \\"St. Francis\\" for the chapel of this saint. Edmund Walker Head declares the latter to be his masterpiece. In Madrid he painted a great Triumph of St. Hermengild for the church of the Carmelite friars, and a group of frescoes in San Felipe el Real which was appreciated by Philip IV of Spain, who commissioned him the painting of the dome of the chapel of Our Lady of Atocha, and thereafter made him painter to the king and superintendent of royal buildings. Besides his work in still life he painted many portraits, and while these lacked the vigour which characterized his father's work, they exhibit a greater knowledge and use of chiaroscuro. Charles II of Spain kept him at his Court and made him master of the royal works. For this king Herrera renovated the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar, in Zaragoza. Herrera died at Madrid in 1685.

The museum's collections include natural history specimens, archaeological and ethnographic artifacts, and cultural history and fine art objects, and exhibitions, educational programs and research provide context for the collections. The museum, a division of the New Jersey Department of State, includes a 140-seat planetarium and a 384-seat auditorium.About the Museum, New Jersey State Museum. Accessed September 4, 2008. History The New Jersey State Museum was the first state museum in the country established with education as a primary focus of its mission. The New Jersey Legislature formally established the museum by law in 1895, and the museum was housed in the New Jersey State House; the museum received initial accreditation from the American Alliance of Museums in 1974 and has maintained accredited status continuously since that time. As put forth in the mission statement: As a center of cultural, educational, and scientific engagement, the New Jersey State Museum inspires innovation and lifelong learning through collections, research, exhibitions and programs in science, history and art. The New Jersey State Museum engages visitors of all ages and diverse backgrounds in an exploration of New Jersey’s cultural and natural history presented within a global context, fosters state pride, and serves as a cultivator of tomorrow’s leaders. In its beginning, like many museums of its era, the museum focused on natural history. The first major collections were of rocks, minerals and fossils from the New Jersey Geological Survey, which began in 1836. In 1912, the museum expanded its focus to include archaeology through an acquisition of artifacts produced by Native Americans in the region. These artifacts dated from the prehistoric and historic periods as well as from New Jersey's diverse populations during the Colonial and post- colonial eras. In 1922, the museum was one of the first on the east coast to exhibit, as art, a collection of North American Indian objects. With the acquisition of these objects, the museum started its ethnographic collections. In 1924, decorative arts were added to the museum with examples from the Trenton-area ceramics industry. In 1929, the museum moved into larger space in the newly constructed State House Annex. And while fine art had been exhibited and acquired through the mid-20th century, the museum began a strong collecting emphasis on paintings, sculpture and works on paper in the early 1960s. In 1964, the museum moved from the State House Annex into facilities created specifically for it within the newly created Capitol Cultural Complex. The museum's Main Building, now a classic example of mid-century modern architecture, consists of four floors of exhibition, program, research and collection space, a 140-seat Planetarium and public spaces including a Gift Shop. A second building holds a 384-seat Auditorium, as well as gallery spaces. Bureau of Archaeology/Ethnography The Bureau of Archaeology/Ethnography collections encompass approximately 2.4 million prehistoric and historic specimens acquired by nearly 100 years of excavation, as well as almost 4,000 ethnographic objects acquired as gifts to the museum. Scholars widely recognize the museum's archaeology specimens as the definitive systematic research collection for the study of the prehistory of New Jersey. Notably, the archaeological collection includes material excavated from the nearby Abbott Farm National Historic Landmark Site. The museum's archaeology collections are respected as one of the most important collections for the regional study of northeastern North America, and provide data on the entire span of human occupation in New Jersey from prehistoric times to the 20th century. The ethnographic collection consists of specimens that represent the Lenape and other North American Indian groups, and also include a small number of West African specimens collected to interpret the heritage of New Jersey's African-American population. Additionally, the collection also consists of a small grouping of Asian objects collected by New Jersey donors while they were on business or pleasure trips during the late 19th century through the 1950s. In a move toward reinterpreting the African and Asian works, these objects are now being presented as examples of cultural objects from people who have moved to New Jersey from around the globe. \\"New Jersey's Original People,\\" \\"Cultures in Competition\\" and \\"A Much Moved People\\" are on view on the lower level. Bureau of Cultural History The Bureau of Cultural History preserves and interprets historical objects that document the lives of people who have lived in New Jersey from the 17th century to the present. The collection includes over 13,000 artifacts documenting New Jersey's cultural, economic, military, political, and social history, as well as aspects of its decorative arts. Ranging from ceramics produced by Trenton potteries to decorative quilts made and used by New Jersey women to utilitarian artifacts reflecting the rich maritime and agricultural heritage of the Garden State, the Cultural History Collection is one of the largest material culture collections dealing with New Jersey history. Textiles, trade tools, furniture, and an array of artifacts documenting craft, work, play, community, and family life are also represented in the collection. The Cultural History Bureau also oversees the preservation and interpretation of the New Jersey State Capitol's collection of military flags used by New Jersey regiments in the Civil War and World War I. \\"Pretty Big Things: Stories of New Jersey History\\" is on view on the third floor. Bureau of Fine Art The State Museum has collected over 12,000 works of art including paintings, prints, drawings, sculpture and photographs, most acquired since 1965 when the museum's mission was expanded to include fine art. The collection has an American focus that highlights the work of New Jersey artists within the context of American art history. Also included are works that depict New Jersey scenes and events. The strengths of the Fine Art collection lie in works by the American modernists associated with Alfred Stieglitz, American abstract artists of the 1930s and 1940s, a comprehensive collection of works by 19th through 21st-century African-American artists, contemporary American and New Jersey art, the complete graphic outputs of Ben Shahn and Jacob Landau and print and paper works by the New Jersey Fellows associated with the Brodsky Center. American Perspectives: The Fine Art Collection is on view on the second floor. Bureau of Natural History The Bureau of Natural History holds a diverse collection of about 250,000 specimens which have historic and cultural significance, in addition to their scientific value. The natural history collections are especially strong in industrial minerals and ores, paleontology specimens (fossils), osteology specimens (bones), modern shells, and a systematic study skin component. Smaller sub-collections include pinned insects, fluid-preserved fauna, taxidermy mounts and glass lantern slides. The bureau is also the repository for about 300 type (first documented) specimens of Paleozoic and Mesozoic fossils, as well as a large number of fossils documenting the Paleozoic strata within the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. Minerals from the zinc-mining locality of Franklin-Sterling Hill are well represented, including the largest number of fluorescent mineral species in the world, as are mine- specific specimens from New Jersey's industrial iron mining past. Specimens from beyond New Jersey are used for comparative purposes in exhibitions and educational programming, to augment the systematic collections, and for research purposes. \\"Written in the Rocks: Fossil Tales of New Jersey\\" is on view on the 2nd floor. Bureau of Education The museum's Bureau of Education offers programs and events designed to offer activities that not only engage our audiences but help to instill a desire for lifelong object- based learning. School groups can attend museum-based classes, hands-on workshops, exhibition tours, planetarium programs, as well as access classroom resources such as curriculum guides. Teacher professional development workshops offer opportunities for classroom teachers to gain additional knowledge and skills which they may employ back in their own classrooms. General audiences can participate in a variety of performances, lectures, gallery walks, demonstrations, film series, scout programs and more. Planetarium Since its opening in 1964, the State Museum's planetarium has been a large part of the museum's public programming, incorporating both educational programs and a variety of entertainment features, such as traditional sky shows and laser shows. The museum's planetarium is equipped with “Full Dome” video technology, and also includes a digital video hemisphere as part of the planetarium lobby exhibitions. The 140-seat planetarium also features a Minolta MS-10 instrument for sky shows and visual displays of the solar system. Exhibits include displays of constellations, solar system models and space exploration. The planetarium presents public shows on weekends, during school vacation periods (spring and winter), and during the summer. Tickets are $7 for adults and $5 for children 12 and under. During the school year, weekday planetarium programs are offered to school and community groups by reservation only.

Johnson was a graduate of the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he played from 1971 to 1973 and earned a degree in marketing. His career record as a starter for the Buffs was 18 wins and 5 losses. He led the Buffaloes to road wins over LSU and Ohio State in 1971 (and a #3 national ranking) and a home win against Oklahoma in 1972. At the time his college career ended, he was ranked #3 in the history of Colorado in total offense. He began his professional career in 1974 as a back-up quarterback for the World Football League's Portland Storm. In June, 1977, Johnson was signed as a free agent by the National Football League's Buffalo Bills. Though he was on the active roster for 14 games, he saw no action with the Bills and was released on August 22, 1978. A month later, Johnson signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. Seeing limited action in 1978, Johnson earned the Stampeders' starting job in 1979. Appearing in all 16 regular season games, Johnson completed 56.4% of his passes (176 of 312) for 2344 yards, 19 touchdowns, and 8 interceptions as he led the Stampeders to a 12-4 record and a CFL playoff berth. Johnson led the CFL in passing for the 1979 season. After falling one win short of the Grey Cup game in 1979, Johnson followed up with another solid season in 1980 setting a career-high in touchdown passes (22) while completing 56.0% of his passes (218 of 389) for 3019 yards. The Stampeders finished 9-7 in 1980 and were eliminated in the first round of the CFL playoffs. The Stampeders slide would continue in 1981, which likely led to Johnson being traded after 12 games to the Montreal Alouettes on October 11, 1981. Overall, he would appear in 15 games that season, completing a career- high 59.3% of his passes (254 of 428) for 3364 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions. Johnson would not see much action with the reborn Montreal franchise, Montreal Concordes, in 1982. He appeared in only 2 games before being traded to the Toronto Argonauts for linebacker Duncan MacKinlay on August 4, 1982. Granted free agency on January 15, 1983, Johnson returned to the U.S. when he signed with the USFL's Denver Gold five days later. Though starting the season as a backup, Johnson would officially take over the starting job in Week 3 on a snowy Soldier Field in Chicago. Facing bitter cold, 20 mph winds, and George Allen's veteran-laden Chicago Blitz squad, Johnson led a 70 yard long game-winning drive late in the 4th quarter. Johnson dove into the endzone on 4th down with only 22 seconds remaining to cap off the drive and seal the Gold's win (Gold 16, Blitz 13). Johnson would remain the primary starter until an ankle injury ended his season during a Week 11 loss to the Boston Breakers. Johnson finished the season completing 48.8% of his passes (121 of 248) for 1115 yards, and 6 touchdowns. The Gold released Johnson on January 9, 1984, and was awarded on waivers to the Memphis Showboats on January 16, 1984. Johnson saw limited action as a backup to Walter Lewis during the 1984 season and retired prior to the 1985 season.

Thompson and the Choctaw-Chickasaw Paper Chase by Dr. Douglas Hale, Oklahoma State University During the period of the Dawes Commission building of a Final Roll of the Five Civilized Tribes (1895–1907), Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians could live any place they close within the two nations. The reasons for this were many, but primarily the two tribes had been one not long before European contact. They spoke the same language, with some dialectal differences, and were culturally similar. In fact shortly after removal, the two tribes were united into one group for a short period of time. Those that did relocate to Indian Territory from east Texas settled in or near the town of Marlow, Oklahoma where William C. Thompson later served as Mayor. The lands that Martin Thompson settled was between Marlow and Bray in what is now Stephens County, Oklahoma. Although listed on the Choctaw Census as a \\"Choctaw Living in the Chickasaw Nation\\", Martin returned to Rusk County, Texas in 1896 before the close of the Dawes Roll and was therefore not entered onto the Final Roll. Following his return to Texas he remained in a leadership position until his death. Although influential within the Mount Tabor Indian Community, the larger organization, the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands was led only by Cherokees both within the community and in the Cherokee Nation. Most Cherokees had left Rusk County between 1866 and 1900.

From this conflict, the word Choctaw was scratched off the documents that were to be a part of the brief submitted to the United States Supreme Court in 1921.

The album was solely released on a Canadian independent label, and distributed throughout the US by The End Records. Following the debut of their album, the band released an avant-garde music video for the single \\"Avian Taxi\\", which has sparked interest due to the fact it takes place in Canada's largest indoor playground, Kidzone Family Fun Center,Canada's Largest Indoor Playground with the band dressed in many different costumes (giant lobster, gecko, chicken, and turtle) with Darren Hartley's oldest child, Xander Hartley as the main character, and Hartley himself dressed as the bear.

It is also the name of one of the stories in the collection. Plot summary The short story \\"Who's Irish?\\" is about an elderly Chinese woman and her mixed family living in New York. She begins talking about her granddaughter, Sophie, who is the daughter of John, who is Irish, and the narrator's daughter Natalie who is Chinese. The narrator tells of how wild her granddaughter is and makes various cultural distinctions calling Sophie \\"wild\\" and saying \\"millions of children in China, not one act like this.\\" (Jen, 400). She also writes that her methods of discipline are not exactly embraced by her Irish son-in-law's family. The narrator argues that spanking is acceptable while her daughter encourages her to use her words (Jen, 401) The main climax of the story takes place when the narrator takes Sophie to play in the park. Sophie learns from another kid, Sinbad, that it is ok to kick their parents. So Sophie kicks Sinbad's mother to which the narrator responds by spanking Sophie. Sophie then hides in a foxhole that Sinbad created and throws a clump of dirt onto her grandmother. The narrator is furious and tries to get Sophie to come out of the foxhole. She eventually grabs a stick and begins to poke at Sophie to see if she is still alive. Evening comes, as well as Natalie and John who are furious when they see the narrator poking at their daughter with a stick. John gets Sophie out but she is covered in bruises. At the end of the story, Natalie convinces the narrator that she needs to move out. Bess, John's Mother, offers to let the narrator come stay with her. Natalie and John come and visit but they do not bring Sophie. Bess says they will in time. The story ends with the narrator reflecting on how she has become an honorary Irish.

Named for Francis M. Guye, who held an iron mining claim on it in the 1880s, it lies in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area of the Cascade Range and overlooks Snoqualmie Pass from the north. Guye Peak was first climbed on October 6, 1912 by Charles Hazlehurst, Hector Abel, Paul Dubuar, and Mary Hard. The climb is from the pass valley and has mixed rock climbing and scrambling, ranging from to . It is popular partly because of easy access from Interstate 90. Like other hiking experiences in the region, Guye Peak has wet-climate hazards such as mossy or otherwise slippery rocks in the summer and avalanches in the winter. At least eight climbers have died in falls on Guye Peak, including the mathematician Oded Schramm in 2008. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada–US border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area. Climate Guye Peak emerging through fog Guye Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.

The new strategy is likely to produce higher returns, on average, over the long run. But the new strategy also increases the risk that PBGC will not have sufficient assets to cover retirees’ benefit payments when the economy and financial markets are weak. By investing a greater share of its assets in risky securities, PBGC is more likely to experience a decline in the value of its portfolio during an economic downturn—the point at which it is most likely to have to assume responsibility for a larger number of underfunded pension plans.\\" Some proposed that the new policy was still relatively conservative when compared to private pension funds, according to \\"Pensions and Investments\\", a trade publication.

In 1999, Seamester acquired the schooner Ocean Star and began running 80-day programs with high school graduates and college students. Ocean Star sails throughout the Caribbean, from Tortola to Grenada. Occasionally, Ocean Star sails with another monohull or catamaran, allowing berths for over 25 students. The steady growth of Seamester with Ocean Star allowed for the expansion of its fleet with the design and construction of the schooner S/Y Argo. Argo was built in Samut Prakan, Thailand and completed in June 2006. Since then, Argo has been making her way around the globe with students. She had completed her first circumnavigation of the globe in December 2008 and was hoping to start her second during the spring of 2009. Unfortunately, the vessel was unable to secure an escort from the US Navy or EU coalition through the pirate-infested waters of the Gulf of Aden and had to head back to Asia to wait out the Monsoon season in order to sail south to Cape Town. Argo has completed her second circumnavigation via Cape Town.

In the late 1980s, it was the livelihood for more than 90% of the population, although only approximately 20% of the total land area was cultivable, it accounted for, on average, about 60% of the GDP and approximately 75% of exports. Since the formulation of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1975–80), agriculture has been the highest priority because economic growth was dependent on both increasing the productivity of existing crops and diversifying the agricultural base for use as industrial inputs. According to the World Bank, agriculture is the main source of food, income, and employment for the majority. It provides about 33% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Framework for effectiveness and resilience of small and medium-scale irrigation systems in Nepal, Climate & Development Knowledge Network, 31 July 2017 In trying to increase agricultural production and diversify the agricultural base, the government focused on irrigation, the use of fertilizers and insecticides, the introduction of new implements and new seeds of high-yield varieties, and the provision of credit. The lack of distribution of these inputs, as well as problems in obtaining supplies, however, inhibited progress. Although land reclamation and settlement were occurring in the Terai Region, environmental degradation and ecological imbalance resulting from deforestation also prevented progress. Although new agricultural technologies helped increase food production, there still was room for further growth. Past experience indicated bottlenecks, however, in using modern technology to achieve a healthy growth. The conflicting goals of producing cash crops both for food and for industrial inputs also were problematic. History The production of crops fluctuated widely as a result of these factors as well as weather conditions. Although agricultural production grew at an average annual rate of 2.4 percent from 1974 to 1989, it did not keep pace with population growth, which increased at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent over the same period. Further, the annual average growth rate of food grain production was only 1.2 percent during the same period. There were some successes. Fertile lands in the Terai Region and hardworking peasants in the Hill Region provided greater supplies of food staples (mostly rice and corn), increasing the daily caloric intake of the population locally to over 2,000 calories per capita in 1988 from about 1,900 per capita in 1965. Moreover, areas with access to irrigation facilities increased from approximately 6,200 hectares in 1956 to nearly 583,000 hectares by 1990. Rice is the most important cereal crop. In 1966 total rice production amounted to a little more than 1 million tons; by 1989 more than 3 million tons were produced. Fluctuation in rice production was very common because of changes in rainfall; overall, however, rice production had increased following the introduction of new cultivation techniques as well as increases in cultivated land. By 1988 approximately 3.9 million hectares of land were under paddy cultivation. Many people in Nepal devote their lives to cultivating rice to survive. In 1966 approximately 500,000 tons of corn, the second major food crop, were produced. By 1989 corn production had increased to over 1 million tons. A Nepalese coffee grower Other food crops included wheat, millet, barley, and coffee, but their contribution to the agricultural sector was small. Increased production of cash crops, used as input to new industries, dominated in the early 1970s. Sugarcane and tobacco also showed considerable increases in production from the 1970s to the 1980s. Potatoes and oilseed production had shown moderate growth since 1980. Medicinal herbs were grown in the north on the slopes of the Himalayas, but increases in production were limited by continued environmental degradation. According to government statistics, production of milk, meat, and fruit had improved but as of the late 1980s still had not reached a point where nutritionally balanced food was available to most people. Additionally, the increases in meat and milk production had not met the desired level of output as of 1989. Nepal has more than 50% of people engaged in agriculture. Food grains contributed 76 percent of total crop production in 1988–89. In 1989-90 despite poor weather conditions and a lack of agricultural inputs, particularly fertilizer, there was a production increase of 5 percent. In fact, severe weather fluctuations often affected production levels. Some of the gains in production through the 1980s were due to increased productivity of the work force (about 7 percent over fifteen years); other gains were due to increased land use and favorable weather conditions. According to Statistical Information on Nepalese Agriculture (2008/2009) only 65.6% of people depends on agriculture and 21% of land is cultivated whereas 6.99% of land is uncultivated. Irrigation Out of 2.7 million hectares of agricultural land in Nepal, only 1.3 Mha have irrigation facilities. The majority of irrigation systems are small and medium-scale. Framework for effectiveness and resilience of small and medium-scale irrigation systems in Nepal, Climate & Development Knowledge Network, 31 July 2017 A recent study funded by the Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN) revealed that about 0.8% of agricultural GDP is being lost annually due to climate change and extreme events. There is a need to both improve agricultural productivity and make it more resilient to climate uncertainty and change in general. Recent increases in floods and droughts have raised concerns that the climate is changing rapidly and that existing arrangements for irrigation design and management may need to be reconsidered.Framework for effectiveness and resilience of small and medium-scale irrigation systems in Nepal, Climate & Development Knowledge Network, 31 July 2017 See also *Economy of Nepal *Beekeeping in NepalIt is the main traditional job *Flax production in Nepal *Walnut production in Nepal *Chickpeas in Nepal *Fertilizer use in Nepal References External links *Emergence of latest technologies in Nepali Agriculture YouTube ","title":"Agriculture in Nepal"},{"id":"19175655","text":"James ('Jim') Boughtwood Comber (1929 – 7 September 2005) was born at Garlieston, Scotland, into a famous horticultural family. His father was the noted collector and lily breeder Harold Frederick Comber ALS, while his grandfather, James Comber VMH was Head Gardener at Nymans. His sister, Mary Comber-Miles, became the resident botanical artist at the University of British Columbia.Hsu, E. (2011). Harold Comber and his introductions. The Plantsman, Vol. 10, Part 4, Dec. 2011.  Career  On leaving school, Comber worked briefly for the seed company of Sutton & Son at Reading before beginning an apprenticeship at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew in 1951. National Service interrupted his training, but his posting to Singapore was to inspire his 35-year career in South East Asia and interest in its flora. After National Service, Comber returned to Kew, completing his course in 1955. Later that year he was given leave to join Anglo-Indonesian Plantations (AIP) in Java. After resuming studies at degree level, he graduated in 1960, whereupon he accepted the post of Assistant Manager with AIP at the Sapang rubber plantation in Sabah (then British North Borneo but part of Malaysia from 1963), later becoming Manager, and spending much of his leisure time collecting and photographing orchids.Burgess, G. (2005) James (Jim) Boughtwood Comber 1929-2005. The Journal of the Kew Guild. Vol. 14, No. 110, 2005. Royal Botanic Gardens Kew. During this time, Comber formed a close and philanthropic association with the native population, taking much interest in their culture and learning local languages. However, much of this period coincided with the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation over the sovereignty of the region, and Comber's activities were to arouse the suspicions of the authorities as many of his workforce had come from Indonesia. Comber eventually moved in 1971 to the post of agronomist with Ciba-Geigy near Medan in Sumatra, and later Thailand, during which time he was able to further his knowledge of the hundreds of orchid species. Comber was to write three books, and numerous articles for orchid journals, about the orchids of South-east Asia (see 'Works'), describing well over 1000 species, all illustrated with photographs he had taken; the publication by the RBG Kew of one of these tomes, The Orchids of Java, he personally funded. He inevitably discovered many new species, and two are named in his honour: Sarcoglyphis comberi J. J. Wood and Bulbophyllum comberi J. J. Vermeulen.Comber, J. B. (1990). Orchids of Java. RBG Kew. Comber retired in 1991, returning to the UK and settling in Southampton. Death James Comber died suddenly at his home in Southampton on 7 September 2005 following a knee operation.

The Naranjal subsystem is a part of the larger Sistema Ox Bel Ha. The skeleton is carbon dated to 13,600 years ago, which makes it one of the oldest documented human finds in the Americas.Eva of Naharon pbs.org Other skeletons found within the cave are said to be between 11,000 and 14,000 years old. Discovery During the archaeological explorations in Naharon cenote located southwest of Cancun, the remains of Eve of Naharon were discovered and reported to the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) by Octavio del Río in 2000, as part of a first archaeological catalog of cenotes and caves in Quintana Roo. Later, the project grows to an archeological atlas that includes the rest of the cenotes in the Yucatan Peninsula, a project that was co-directed by Arturo Gonzales, Carmen Rojas, and Octavio Del Río. González, director of the Desert Museum in Saltillo, Mexico said, \\"We don't know how [the people whose remains were found in the caves] arrived and whether they came from the Atlantic, the jungle, or inside the continent, but we believe these finds are the oldest yet to be found in the Americas and may influence our theories of how the first people arrived.\\" González and his team spent a total of 4 years excavating the remains, and their discovery changed the mind of experts as to where the first Americans may have originated from. Significance According to Arturo González, the director of the Desert Museum in Saltillo, Mexico, and the lead archaeologist of this project, the bone structure of the skeleton is more consistent with that of people from Southern Asia than that of people from Northern Asia. This similarity with Southern Asian skeletal types has called into question the timeline and geographic origin in the current theory of New World settlement by peoples from Northern Asia. This implies that people may not have come to America from North Asia through a land-bridge which is now underwater as previously thought, as many scientists believe that the first peoples of America arrived by land and by sea in coast hugging canoes from Northern Asia across what is now the Bering Strait. The first peoples filtered into the Americas from Asia in Paleolithic times, possibly continuing to arrive until around 10,000 B.C.E, when melting glaciers submerged the land bridge and isolated the American contents from the rest of the world.

New York, New York: Facts on File.-/ According to some scholars, the salt water now covering this site may have had an effect on the accuracy of the carbon dating. The Bering Strait Theory According to the Bering Strait theory, people from Northeast Asia crossed on a land or ice bridge (where the Bering Strait is today) and entered America through Alaska. This may have happened during the last Ice Age.

Formed in 2002 after the split of Nörthwind, the band has since released six studio albums.DarkSun discography darksunweb.com Retrieved June 16, 2008 DarkSun has often cited Blind Guardian, Helloween, Angra, and Rage as their biggest and most important influences.  History   El Legado (2002-2005)  After the split of power metal band Nörthwind, three of the members formed heavy metal band Vendaval. The rest of the members, guitarists Tino Hevia and Daniel Gonzalez, and keyboardist Helena Pinto, formed DarkSun. The band recruited bassist Pedro Junquera and drummer Daniel Cabal, who had also worked with Relative Silence along with Helena Pinto. They decided to record an album after recruiting all the members to have a stable lineup. In the middle of 2003, DarkSun went to Germany to record what would become their debut album. It was recorded at VPS Studios, produced by Ingo Cjavkoski (better known as Rage's producer), and mixed at House of Music Studios by Achim Köhler (mixer who had worked for bands like Primal Fear and Sinner). El Legado was the debut album by the band, released in July 2004. Professional reviews were incredibly good, stating that El Legado, was \\"one of the best Spanish metal albums of the year [...] from an excellent band\\". DarkSun toured Spain for a whole year to support the album, and had \\"tickets-sold-out\\" posters in most the venues. The critics and live-reviews about this new band were incredibly good. In the middle of the tour, drummer Daniel Cabal left the band. The rest of the members had to cancel some concerts before introducing Cabal's replacement, drummer Rafael Yugueros who was at that time known for his work on power metal band Darna, on their first and second album and left after the band's breakup in 2004. Keyboardist Helena Pinto left the band at the end of 2004. El Lado Oscuro (2005-2007) When the tour on support of El Legado ended, DarkSun entered the studios once again to record their new album. On the middle of the composition, arrangements, and production of the new album, the band hired Pinto's replacement, Víctor Fernández, who performed keyboard duties. This album was recorded in Germany, with Ingo Cjavkoski in the production. This time the band had Dennis Ward on mixings. (who was better known for his work with Angra), and Lars Ratz (from Metalium) assisted on the vocals production. Once again the reviews were as good as they could possibly be, like \\"...it's a varied work, where power and heavy metal alternate and mix\\", and \\"El Lado Oscuro is a really good power metal album\\". Peavy Wagner (of Rage fame) performed vocals on a song, which was released as a bonus track on the album, entitled \\"Prisoners of Fate\\". The band released an English version of El Lado Oscuro, titled The Dark Side and was released in September 2007 through FC Metal Recordings.DarkSun biography darksunweb.com Retrieved August 19, 2007 The critics were as good as the Spanish version, like \\"the album can be defined with one word: brilliant!\\". The band collaborated on Rage's album Speak of the Dead, with a Spanish version of the song \\"Full Moon\\" entitled \\"La Luna Reine,\\" which appeared as a bonus track. Just after the release of The Dark Side drummer Rafael Yugueros left DarkSun to form part of power metal band WarCry replacing former drummer Alberto Ardines. Yugueros had already worked with WarCry on their 1997's demo Demon 97. The band re-recruited Daniel Cabal who worked on what would become the band's new album. Keyboardist Víctor Fernández left the band on the summer of 2007, being replaced by Ana Fernandes, who had previously played for Spanish band Stormrider. On the summer of 2008 DarkSun announced that Cabal was leaving the band, all these occurred in a professional and friendly way. On the same announcement the band presented new drummer Jose Ojeda, who had performed drums on Spanish bands like Rivendel Lords, Killian, among others. Libera Me (2007-present) DarkSun's third album (not including the English version, The Dark Side) was produced by lead vocalist Daniel González. David Figueiras has performed the lead guitars, now that González has left the guitars and centred mainly on vocal duties. The drums were played by former member Dani Cabal, who played on the band's first album El Legado and returned to the group from 2007 to 2008, being replaced by current drummer José Ojeda. The keyboards were played by Ana Fernandes, who replaced Víctor Fernández after leaving on the summer of 2007. The album was titled Libera Me, released on September 29, 2008. \\"Miedo\\" was the first single for the album and also the new videoclip of the band, which was directed and produced by Jacinto Hinojal.

Robson Books, 1998, p. 126, Biography Early life and career Gladys Morgan was born in Swansea, Wales, in 1898 and, though her family was not theatrical, she was always interested in the stage and by the time she turned eleven she had her own song and dance act. She joined a children’s concert party called The Brilliant Gems, where one of her colleagues was Albert Burdon, who was later to become known as an actor and comedian. Four foot ten inch Morgan then formed an act called The Three Virgins, with the equally diminutive Betty Jumel on violin and Vy Vivienne on piano. While touring as a solo singer in a concert party in the Isle of Man, she was asked by the company manager to play the part of an old deaf woman in a sketch. She reluctantly agreed to do so, and was amazed and delighted to find that the audience found her hilarious. She teamed up with and married fellow comedian Frank Laurie, whom she had first met when he was only sixteen. The act was not successful until it was suggested that they swap jobs, with Morgan becoming the comic and Laurie the straight man. The scheme worked and plentiful dates followed. By this time she had dropped her broad Welsh accent in favour of a Lancashire one, possibly in imitation of her hero Frank Randle. Like many other entertainers Morgan and Laurie worked for ENSA during the war, being joined in the act by their daughter, Joan. The ENSA organiser for northwest England at the time was a man called Bert Hollman. Joan later became Mrs Hollman, with Bert joining the act both as a performer and manager. Welsh Rarebit Morgan's big break came when she auditioned for the popular BBC radio variety show Welsh Rarebit. As the show was for Welsh performers only, producer Mai Jones was reluctant to cast her, as Morgan was well known for her Lancashire accent. A week performing at the Town Hall, Pontypridd using her natural accent was enough to convince Mai that Morgan was indeed Welsh, and she was given a two-minute spot on the show.Roy Hudd's Cavalcade of Variety Acts. p. 126 Robson Books, 1998, Her great friend, comedian Wyn Calvin, is reported to have said, \\"Her maniacal laugh created such a furore it practically filled the two minutes.\\" Morgan became resident comedienne on the show, sharing top billing with a rising young star, Harry Secombe. Morgan's success on Welsh Rarebit led to many successful variety tours around all the major theatres in the UK, including supporting Frankie Vaughan at the London Palladium in 1961. Along with many television appearances in shows like The Good Old Days, she was frequently heard in popular radio shows such as Workers' Playtime and Midday Music Hall. Regular appearances on Educating Archie and The Frankie Howerd Show, with her trademark striped blazer and cheeky grin established her as one of the country's best-loved performers. Throughout the nineteen sixties she was kept busy with pantomime and summer season, five tours to Australia, and four sell- out tours of South Africa where the family also had their own series on Springbok Radio called The Morgans. Morgan made a film with Nancy Kwan, Terry- Thomas and Bud Flanagan in 1965 called The Wild Affair. Arthritis forced Morgan to retire from show business when she was in her seventies, and she died in Worthing, West Sussex where she had been a resident for 47 years, in 1983.

Queen Elizabeth II has and has had a variety of flags to represent her personally and as head of state of 16 independent nations around the world. They are usually used on any building, ship, car, or aircraft where she is present. These heraldic flags are usually a nation's coat of arms in banner form. Princess Elizabeth and Duchess of Edinburgh Princess Elizabeth's personal standard prior to her accession as queen was her coat of arms in banner form. This consisted of four quarters consisting of three lions passant for England, a lion rampant for Scotland, and a Gaelic harp for Ireland. To differentiate the arms of Princess Elizabeth from that of the King it was differenced with a white label of three points, the centre point bearing a Tudor rose and the first and third a cross of St George.

It often represents Her Majesty in her role as Head of the Commonwealth or as monarch of a Commonwealth realm in which she does not possess a unique flag. This flag, designed in the College of Arms in 1960, was first used in 1961 for the Queen's visit to India. The flag bears the crowned letter E in gold, surrounded by a garland of gold roses on a blue background, with a golden fringe. Compare: The crown is a symbol of the Queen's rank and dignity, whilst the roses symbolise the 53 countries of the Commonwealth. (The \\"crowned 'E'\\" emblem also appears in the Queen's personal flags for Australia, Barbados, Jamaica, Canada, and New Zealand.) The flag was created at the Queen's request in December 1960 to symbolise her as an individual, not associated with her role as sovereign of any particular Commonwealth realm. Over time, the flag started to be used in place of the British royal standard when the Queen visits Commonwealth countries where she is not head of state and for Commonwealth occasions in the United Kingdom; it came to symbolise the Queen as Head of the Commonwealth. Eventually, the practice evolved wherein the flag is raised at Marlborough House (the headquarters of the Commonwealth Secretariat) in London when the Queen visits, rather than the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom. Commonwealth realms Since the 1960s, flags have been introduced to represent the Queen in various Commonwealth realms. These flags have followed the same basic pattern: the nation's coat of arms in banner form with the device found on her personal flag. These flags are only used by the Queen when she was in their respective countries. The Queen's representatives in these nations have their own flags to represent them.

One afternoon, after killing one of his targets, he hesitates in killing the pet parrot, Roger, and instead takes him as a gift to his mother, Louisa (Eileen Atkins) an intimidating woman who was, until recently, also Victor's housemate. In celebration of his 55th birthday, she gives him a leather bound book with newspaper clippings of each of his kills from his first to his most recent, leaving pages for future hits to be included. She also expresses concern that he might be homosexual, wondering why he hasn't produced a successor. Rose (Emily Blunt) is a not-so-average girl with a talent for thievery. Her most recent theft involves the sale of a fake Rembrandt painting (painted by her friend in the Restoration Department of the National Gallery) to Ferguson (Rupert Everett), managing to swindle him out of £900,000. Ferguson soon discovers the swap and hires the best hitman, Victor Maynard, to dispose of her. Victor takes the case and immediately tracks Rose down, missing several opportunities to kill her, and accidentally killing a random stall customer in a changing room. He follows her to a balcony opposite her hotel room and tries to shoot her through the window, but is interrupted by the arrival of the front doorman. Victor sets up a microphone and headset to keep her under surveillance, but falls asleep, unable to listen to their noisy lovemaking. He wakes the following morning, just as she is leaving. He has the opportunity to shoot but pauses. His mother, Louisa, is disappointed by this missed target (and has apparently killed Roger with a knitting needle) and suggests that Victor apologize to his employer and offer to do the hit for free. He tracks Rose down in a parking garage where he sees another hitman ready to kill her. He takes the preemptive shot, killing the other assassin. He and Rose get into her car, only to be forced out again by Mike (Gregor Fisher), another assassin hiding in the back seat of her Mini. Mike throws Victor's gun away and lines them up on the wall to be shot and killed, but instead is wounded by Tony (Rupert Grint), an apparently homeless young man who had picked up the dead man's gun. Saying it was his first time handling a firearm, he impresses Victor enough to consider a protégé. But he sends Tony home and Victor and Rose flee. Mike starts firing at them and they nearly run over Tony on his way out of the garage, forcing him to join the ride. Rose offers Victor his price of £30,000 a week for her protection, believing that he is merely a private detective. They travel to a luxury hotel where they can lay low, but by chance get a room on the same floor as Ferguson. Ferguson hires Dixon (Martin Freeman), reputed to be second only to Maynard in proficiency, to kill Rose and Maynard. After several close calls, Mike, who is also Ferguson's bodyguard, discovers their whereabouts when he spots a pair of boots that Rose had stolen from his dead partner. Tony is ambushed in the bathroom and nearly drowned in the bathtub by Mike, but he turns the tables and accidentally shoots Mike's ear off before the three of them escape the hotel. Ferguson and Mike pursue them in a high-speed chase through the streets of London until Mike loses control and crashes the car, sending the pair to the hospital. They travel to Maynard's home, an exclusive farm deep in the countryside, where his furniture is shrink-wrapped and his cat, Snowy, resides with him. Maynard takes Tony on as his apprentice in \\"private detective\\" work. One night (after a sensual foot-massage between Victor and Rose), Rose is attacked by Louisa (Victor's mother), who had come back to the house to finish what her son had started. He eventually talks her down and after she leaves, the three of them work on becoming friends. Rose and Tony help Victor celebrate his birthday, and, after a brief period of sexual confusion between Tony and Maynard, Victor falls in love with and sleeps with Rose. Afterwards, his attitude becomes more friendly, and Victor peels off the plastic coverings on all of his furniture and opens up the house. Meanwhile, Rose looks around Victor's room, finding the leather book that his mother had given him and learning that she was actually his target for assassination. She also finds Victor's father's first gun, a Broomhandle Mauser, and steals it for protection. She runs out of the house after making it clear that she trusts neither Victor nor Tony, and returns to the National Gallery, only to find her friend dead and Dixon and his assistant, Fabian (Geoff Bell), waiting for her. They quickly return to Victor's home, and Tony and Victor gain the upper hand when Louisa appears, killing Fabian with a machine gun. Dixon withdraws the old gun Rose had taken from Victor's room and fires at Victor. It backfires, sending the bolt into his skull. Victor, Tony and Rose bury the pair in the back yard and return to their lives. Three years later, Victor and Rose are married with a son named Angel; Tony also lives with them as Victor's apprentice. While Angel is playing one morning, Tony comes outside asking Victor and Rose where the cat had gone off to. They look at Angel in awe as he is innocently patting soft dirt into the yard, suggesting he killed and buried the cat. Victor smiles with pride.

Includes Royal Barbados Police Force personnel and soldiers of unknown nationality. 3 November 1983 The Caribbean Peace Force (CPF), also known as the Caribbean Peacekeeping Force and the Eastern Caribbean Peace Force (ECPF), was a 350-member peacekeeping force operating in Grenada from October 1983 to June 1985 after the Invasion of Grenada, codenamed Operation Urgent Fury. The military intervention by the United States of America in coalition with six Caribbean nations was in response to the illegal deposition and execution of Grenadan Prime Minister Maurice Bishop on Oct. 19, 1983. Bishop's revolutionary regime was briefly replaced by a military junta composed entirely of Grenadian military officers. On October 25, 1983, the United States, Barbados, Jamaica and members of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States landed on Grenada, defeated Grenadian and Cuban resistance and overthrew the military government of Hudson Austin. The U.S-led invasion was spearheaded at dawn by Army Rangers, Navy SEALs, Marines and other elite units. The first Caribbean forces arrived on Grenada by U.S. Air Force C-130 aircraft from Barbados about five hours later. The vanguard force, led by Brigadier Rudyard Lewis of Barbados, landed on a Ranger-seized runway without any defined military role being assigned to them by the Pentagon. An ad hoc plan was developed for them to guard Cuban and Grenadan prisoners who were being captured in mounting numbers by U.S. combat troops, Later, the Caribbean troops took over police duties in St. George's, the island's capital, and guard duties at Richmond Hill Prison. The peacekeeper force was mostly composed of 150 soldiers from the Jamaican Defence Force and a 50-man rifle platoon from the Barbados Defence Force. Antigua and Barbuda also contributed an infantry squad. The remaining members were police or paramilitary constabulary from Barbados, Dominica, St.Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and St. Kitts and Nevis. These five Eastern Caribbean island nations were then participants in a Regional Security System. The Caribbean peacekeepers were not involved in combat, which officially ended on Nov. 2, 1983. U.S. combat troops left the island on Dec. 12, 1983. The peacekeeping force remained on Grenada until the spring of 1985 to allow the reconstituted domestic police force to be fully trained and equipped.

A photograph of cotton pickers in Armenia in the 1930s: no cotton is grown in Armenia today. Armenia has 2.1 million hectares of agricultural land, 72% of the country's land area. Most of this, however, is mountain pastures, and cultivable land is 480,000 hectares (452,900 hectares arable land, 27,300 hectares in orchards and vineyards), or 16% of the country's area.Statistical Yearbook 2007, Armenia National Statistical Service, Yerevan In 2006, 46% of the work force was employed in agriculture (up from 26% in 1991), and agriculture contributed 21% of the country's GDP. In 1991 Armenia imported about 65 percent of its food. Land privatization In 1990 Armenia became the first Soviet republic to pass a land privatization law, and from that time Armenian farmland shifted into the private sector at a faster rate than in any other republic. However, the rapidity and disorganization of land reallocation led to disputes and dissatisfaction among the peasants receiving land. Especially problematic were allocation of water rights and distribution of basic materials and equipment. Related enterprises such as food processing and hothouse operations often remained in state hands, reducing the advantages of private landholding. Swift and decisive privatization quickly eliminated the collective and state farms, which had dominated Armenian agriculture in the Soviet period. Already by 1992 privatization of the state and collective farms had put 63% of cultivated fields, 80% of orchards, and 91% of vineyards in the hands of family farmers. In 2006, family farmers were producing 98% of gross agricultural output, i.e., in 15 years Armenian agriculture transformed completely from the traditional Soviet model of large agricultural enterprises to the market-oriented model of individual or family farms. The privatization program yielded an immediate 15% increase in gross agricultural output between 1990 and 1991. Agricultural growth continued unabated, and by 2006 gross agricultural output had increased by 75% compared with its level in 1990.Z. Lerman, C. Csaki, and G. Feder, Agriculture in Transition: Land Policies and Evolving Farm Structures in Post- Soviet Countries, Lexington Books, Lanham, MD (2004). This growth record has not been matched by any of the CIS countries, putting Armenia in a unique position of stellar agricultural performer in CIS. In 1993 the government ended restrictions on the transfer of private land, a step expected to increase substantially the average size (and hence the efficiency) of private plots. At the end of 1993, an estimated 300,000 small farms (one to five hectares) were operating. In that year, harvests were bountiful despite the high cost of input; only the disastrous state of Armenia's transportation infrastructure prevented relief of food shortages in urban centers. Agricultural production A goat among sheep grazing in spring at Ara Ler Agriculture is carried out mainly in the valleys and mountainsides of Armenia's uneven terrain, with the highest mountain pastures used for livestock grazing. Fertile volcanic soil allows cultivation of wheat and barley as well as pasturage for sheep, goats, and horses. With the help of irrigation, figs, pomegranates, apricots,Armenia: Apricot exports at record levels in 2013 and olives also are grown in the limited subtropical Aras River valley and in the valleys north of Yerevan, where the richest farmland is found. Armenia also produces peaches, walnuts, and quince, and its brandy enjoys a worldwide reputation. Irrigation is required by most crops, and the building of canals and a system of irrigation was among the first major state projects of the Soviet republic in the 1920s. By the 1960s, arable land had been extended by 20 percent, compared with pre-Soviet times. Most farms had electricity by the early 1960s, and machinery was commonplace. In the Soviet era, women made up most of the agricultural work force; a large percentage of the younger men had responded to the Soviet industrialization campaign by migrating to urban centres. In 1989 farms were operating about 13,400 tractors and 1,900 combines. Unlike other CIS countries, Armenia did not suffer a catastrophic decline in its farm machinery inventory during the privatization, and in 2006 there were 14,600 tractors and 1,700 combines in Armenian farms. Agricultural production is heavily biased toward crops, which in 2006 accounted for 64% of gross agricultural output. The principal agricultural products are grains (mostly wheat and barley), potatoes, vegetables, grapes (both table and wine), and fruits. In 2006, Armenia produced 212,500 tons of grain, 539,500 tons of potatoes, 915,000 tons of vegetables and melons, 286,000 tons of fruits, and 201,400 tons of grapes. All these numbers (except for grain) constitute significant increases compared with 1989, when Armenia produced 200,000 tons of grain, 266,000 tons of potatoes, 485,000 tons of vegetables, 170,000 tons of fruit, and 119,000 tons of grapes. Livestock production in 2006 reached 66,800 tons of meat (slaughter weight), 620,000 tons of milk, and 464 million eggs. The corresponding livestock production numbers in 1989 were 105,000 tons of meat, 491,000 tons of milk, and 561,000 tons of eggs, i.e., only milk production increased significantly during the post-Soviet period.

Major terms have their own separate article pages, while minor terms are defined / described here. Most of the keerthanas/kritis used in Carnatic music is based on Telugu language. The order of terms is from basic to related terms, rather than alphabetic. Main terms Nāda Nāda refers to music or musical sound. It also refers to the tone of a musical instrument. =Anahata Nāda= Anāhata Nāda refers to the naturally occurring sounds (literally not struck). =Ahata Nāda= Ahata Nāda refers to generated sounds or sounds made by efforts of man (literally struck). Śruti Śruti is musical pitch. It is considered to be equivalent to tonic of western music. This is the pitch at which the drone is set, which is usually played by a tambura. Sthayi In Carnatic music, Sthayi refers to the octave. Madhyama sthayi refers to the middle octave, Tara sthayi refers to the upper octave and Mandra sthayi refers to the lower octave. http://chinmayaswaranjali.org/music_lesson_06.htm Swaram Swaram or Swara is a single note. Each swaram defines the position of note in relation to the Śruti. Rāga A rāgam prescribes a set of rules for building a melody - very similar to the Western concept of mode. Different combination of swarams and swaram phrases form different rāgams. Ārōhanam Ārōhanam of a rāgam is the ascending scale of the rāgam. It describes the rules for singing ascending notes of a rāgam, including the swarams to use and swaram patterns that form the rāgam. Avarōhanam Avarōhanam of a rāgam is the descending scale of the rāgam. It describes the rules for singing descending notes of a rāgam. Melakartā A Melakartā rāgam is one which has all seven swarams, namely, Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha and Ni (sampoorna rāgam). The ārōhanam and avarōhanam of a melakartā ragam are strictly ascending and descending scales. It is also known as janaka rāgam (parent rāgam), because other rāgams are derived from it. Asampūrna Melakartā One of the 72 parent rāgams first created by Venkatamakhin which did not have strict rules of ascending / descending scales, did not insist on inclusion of all 7 swaras nor disallow vakra prayogas (zig zag notes in scale). Chakra A chakra consists of a group of 6 Melakartā rāgams, which differ from each other only in the Dhaivatham and Nishadham. Janya A Janya rāgam is one which is derived from a Melakartā rāgam. It may have (a) a subset of the seven swarams Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha and Ni (varjya rāgam), (b) an external swaram (anya swaram) not found in its parent or (c) vakra prayōgam of swarams in Ārōhanam or Avarōhanam (zig-zag sequence of notes, instead of strictly ascending or descending scales). Tālam Tālam refers to the rhythm cycle or beat cycle for a particular song. Ālāpana Ālāpana is a preface to a song, which explores the rāgam of the song, without any lyrics. It is a slow improvisation with no tālam (rhythm). Niraval Sāhitya vinyāsam / Niraval or Neraval is the repeated singing of one or two lines of a song, with improvised exposition in each repetition. Sāhitya vinyāsam in Tamil language is referred as Neraval. Kalpanaswaram Kalpanaswaram literally means imagined swarams. It is the singing of swarams of the rāgam of a song, following the completion of the song. Though many phrases of the swarams may have been practiced, experienced artists may spontaneously play new phrases within the rāgam's rules - hence the term Kalpana. It is an improvisation of the rāgam, by singing the swarams, namely Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha and Ni. Tānam Tānam is rhythmic / rhythm based improvisation of the rāgam. It is done with rhythm based syllables like tha, nam, thom and na. It is usually included as second part in a Rāgam Tānam Pallavi. Rāgamālika Rāgamālika, which literally means garland of rāgams, is a composition that has different verses set to different rāgams. Rāgamālika swarams refers to singing of Kalpanaswarams in different rāgams. Rāgam Tānam Pallavi Rāgam Tānam Pallavi is a rendition of Carnatic music which lends to total improvisation, in different forms. It consists of Rāgam Ālāpana (rāgam), Tānam and a Pallavi line. The pallavi line is sung many times in different speeds, different ranges of the rāgam and different octaves. This is usually followed by Kalpanaswarams, sometimes in multiple rāgams (rāgamālika). Viruttam Viruttam is a devotional verse or phrase sung (without talam) in an impromptu choice of rāgam or rāgamālika usually before a song. The rāgam (or last rāgam in case of rāgamālika) is usually the same as that of the song that follows. Manōdharma Manōdharma is the concept of impromptu or spontaneous improvisation, which is one of the important aspects of Carnatic music. There are many types of improvisations, like Rāgam Ālāpana, Thānam, Niraval, Viruttam and Kalpanaswaram. Kalpita sangeetam Kalpita sangeetam is music that is already composed, learnt and practiced. It is opposite of Manodharma sangeetam, which complements Kalpita sangeetam. Swarams The seven swarams in Carnatic music, then followed by other terms related to swaram. Shadjam The first swaram in the scale is Shadjam (Sa). It is invariant and is always included in all ragams. Rishabham The second swaram in the scale is Rishabham (Ri). It has three pitch possibilities, namely Suddha, Chathusruti and Shatsruti. Gāndhāram The third swaram in the scale is Gāndhāram (Ga). It has three pitch possibilities, namely Suddha, Sādhārana and Antara. Madhyamam The fourth swaram in the scale is Madhyamam (Ma). It has two pitch possibilities, namely Suddha and Prati. Panchamam The fifth swaram in the scale is 'Panchamam' (Pa). It is invariant. Dhaivatam The sixth swaram in the scale is Dhaivatam (Dha). It has three pitch possibilities, namely Suddha, Chathusruti and Shatshruti. Nishādham The seventh swaram in the scale is Nishādham (Ni). It has three pitch possibilities, namely Suddha, Kaisiki and Kaakali. Anya swaram Anya swaram in a janya rāgam is a swaram that is not found in its parent rāgam (melakartā rāgam). Anya means outside the set/ group. Sthāi Sthāyi refers to an octave of music. There are 5 sthāyis in Carnaatic music, namely, Anumandara (lowest), Mandara (literally means chant, which means lower), Madhya (literally means middle), Taara (means higher) and Athitaara (meaning very high). Most artists sing over two octaves or two and a half octaves range (within Mandra, Madhya and Taara sthaayis). Very few can sing well in bigger ranges of 3 or more octaves. Anga Anga means part. In the context of a rāgam's scale, the terms poorvaanga (meaning former part, in this case first-half) and uttaraanga (latter part, or second-half) are used. Sa, Ri, Ga and Ma notes in a scale are referred are poorvaanga, while Pa, Dha and Ni are referred as uttaraanga Gamaka Gamaka is the term used for variations of the swarams in a scale. It can refer to the shake of the note, grace around the note, decoration or embellishment of the swaram. It is an integral part of most rāgams, as it is not arbitrary but is essential part of the structure/ scale. Vādi Vādi swaram in a rāgam is the main/ primary swaram of importance in it. A vādi swaram is repeated quite often in a rendition. Samvādi Samvādi swaram in a rāgam has a concordant effect with the vādi swaram. It has a good effect to the ear (melody or pleasing) along with the vādi. In Western music it is equivalent of the consonant. Vivādi Vivādi swaram in a rāgam has a discordant effect with the vādi swaram in it. It may not have a pleasing effect when sounded together, but composers use appropriate phrases so that such discordant effect is skipped or avoided. In Western music it is equivalent of the dissonant. Anuvādi Anuvādi swaram in a rāgam has neither concordant nor discordant effect with the vādi swaram. Janthi rāgams Prayōgam A musical notes phrase of a rāgam (series of swarams sung in a particular rāgam) is known as Prayōgam. Vishesha Prayōgam Vishesha means special. Hence, important phrases of a rāgam are known as Vishesha Prayōgams. Varjya Missing swarams in a janya rāgam, when derived from a melakartā rāgam are referred as varjya. For example, Rishabham and Panchamam are varjya in Hindolam when derived from Natabhairavi. Vakram Swarams are said to be vakram in a rāgam, if either the Ārōhanam, Avarōhanam or both, do not follow a strictly ascending or descending order. They go up and down (example, 2 steps forward one step back). In such a rāgam, these swarams should always use the same order to give the unique melody of the rāgam. Upānga A janya rāgam is Upānga if all the swarams in its scale are strictly derived from its melakartā rāgam (parent). There are no anya swarams (external swarams). Bhāshānga A janya rāgam is Bhāshānga if an anya swaram is introduced in its scale, when derived from its melakartā rāgam (parent). Nishādhāntya A janya rāgam is Nishādhāntya if the highest note that can be played is the Nishādham. The rules for such rāgams are that they should be played or sung within the single octave - Ni, Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni. Examples are Naadanaa makriya and Punnāgavarāli rāgams. Dhaivatāntya A janya rāgam is Dhaivadhāntya if the highest note that can be played is the Dhaivatam. The rules for such rāgams are that they should be played or sung within the single octave - Dha, Ni, Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha. Example Kurinji rāgam. Panchamāntya A janya rāgam is Panchamāntya if the highest note that can be played is the Panchamam. The rules for such rāgams are that they should be played or sung within the single octave - Pa, Dha, Ni, Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa. Example Navroj rāgam. Madhyama sruti Tuning the sruti (tonic note) to Ma (and also changing Pa string of Tambura to Ma) is called Madhyama sruti. It is usually set for Panchamāntya, Dhaivadhāntya and Nishādhāntya rāgams. Swaram counts The following terms are applicable to ascending scale (ārōhanam) of a rāgam, descending scale (avarōhanam) of a rāgam, or the rāgam as a whole. Sampūrna rāgam Sampurna rāgam is a rāgam that has all seven swarams, namely, Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha and Ni. Shādava rāgam Shādava rāgam is a rāgam that has only six of the seven swarams in its scale. Owdava rāgam Owdava rāgam is a rāgam that has only five of the seven swarams in its scale. It is a pentatonic scale. Svarantara rāgam Svaraantara rāagam is a rāgam that has only four of the seven swarams in its scale. Tālam components Jathi Jathi of a tālam specifies beat count of the rhythm cycle. It specifically applies to laghu component(s) of the tālam and not necessarily to the entire tālam. The different jathis are tisra (three beats in lagu), chathusra (four), khanda (five), misra (seven) and sankeerna (nine). Gati Gati of a tālam specifies sub-divisions of a beat in a composition. It is also referred as Nadai. Chathusra gati is the most common (four), followed by Tisra (three). Others are Khanda, Misra and Sankeerna. Laghu Laghu is the component of a tālam which is the variant part. Its beat count is dependent on the jāti of the tālam. The action for counting includes a tap / clap, followed by a count of sub-beats of the full rhythm cycle. Note that a tisra jāti laghu is actually 1 clap and 2 counts = 3 beats. Dhrutham Dhrutham is the component of a tālam which is invariant and includes only two beats. Its action includes a tap / clap, followed by a veechu (wave). Anudhrutham Anudhrutham is the component of a tālam which is invariant and includes only one beat. Its action is a tap / clap. Āvartanam Āvartanam of a tālam refers to one cycle of the tālam. Most tālams have at least 1 laghu, except for the rare tālams (see tālam page). Graham Graham or Eduppu( Tamil) means start. Eduppu denotes the point within the Āvartanam of a tālam when a composition or stanza in a composition begins. Onru (one beat later, meaning second beat), Onrarai (one and half beat later, meaning between 2nd and 3rd beat) are common, other than Samam (meaning equal) which starts in synchronization with the beginning of a tālam. Tālams Rūpaka tālam Rūpaka tālam refers to the group of tālams that consist of 1 dhrutam, followed by 1 lagu. Rūpaka tālam also refers to chathusra-jathi rūpaka tālam as a default (2 + 4 = 6 beats in an āvartanam). Triputa tālam Triputa tālam refers to the group of tālams that consist of 1 laghu, followed by 2 dhrutams. Triputa tālam also refers to tisra-jathi triputa tālam as a default (3 + 2 + 2 = 7 beats in an āvartanam). Dhruva tālam Dhruva tālam refers to the group of tālams that consist of 1 lagu, followed by 1 dhrutam, followed by two lagus. Dhruva tālam also refers to chathusra-jathi dhruva tālam as a default (4 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 14 beats in an āvartanam), unless a different jathi is specified. Matya tālam Matya tālam refers to the group of tālams that consist of 1 lagu, followed by 1 dhrutam, followed by 1 lagu. Matya tālam also refers to chathusra-jathi matya tālam as a default (4 + 2 + 4 = 10 beats in an āvartanam). Jhampa tālam Jhampa tālam refers to the group of tālams that consist of 1 lagu, followed by 1 anudhrutam, followed by 1 dhrutam. Jhampa tālam also refers to misra-jathi jhampa tālam as a default (7 + 1 + 2 = 10 beats in an āvartanam). Ata tālam Ata tālam refers to the group of tālams that consist of 2 lagus, followed by 2 dhrutams. Ata tālam also refers to khanda-jathi ata tālam as a default (5 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 14 beats in an āvartanam). Eka tālam Eka tālam refers to the group of tālams that consist of 1 lagu only. Eka tālam also refers to chathusra-jathi eka tālam as a default (4 beats in an āvartanam). Ādhi tālam Ādhi tālam refers to chathusra-jathi triputa tālam (4 + 2 + 2 = 8 beats in an āvartanam), which is very common in Carnatic music. This is the equivalent of 8 beat / 16 beat of Western music. Khanda chāpu tālam Khanda chāpu refers to a tālam with 10 beat āvartanam (Khanda literally means 5) which does not fit into above classification of tālams. Misra chāpu tālam Misra chāpu refers to a tālam with 14 beat āvartanam (Misra literally means 7) which does not fit into above classification of tālams. Desādhi tālam Desādhi refers to ādhi tālam with (8 beat āvartanam), where the eduppu is one and a half beats from beginning of āvaratanam (onrarai). Layā Layā is the tempo or speed of a song. Carnatic music does not define a fixed layā to songs, but traditionally some songs have been sung fast or slow and hence are categorised that way. Typical classification of layā includes Vilambitha (delayed or slow), Madhyama (medium) and Dhuritha (fast). The term Chowka is also used to denote an extra slow tempo and Adi-Dhuritha is used to denote an extra fast one. Kāla Kāla refers to the change of tempo during a rendition of song, typically doubling up the speed. Onnaam kaalam is 1st speed, Irandaam kaalam is 2nd speed and so on. Irandaam kaalam fits in twice the number of aksharaas (notes) into the same beat, thus doubling the tempo. Sometimes, Kāla is also used similar to Layā, for example Madhyama Kālam or Chowka Kālam. Learning exercises Learning Carnatic music involves learning most of the following exercises, mostly in the order listed below. Sarali varisai Sarali varisai is used to learn the swarams in the octave, usually in Māyāmālavagowla ragam. It is learnt in simple straight ascending and descending fashion and a few variations. It is also learnt in multiple speeds (kalams). Swarāvali Avali means row or arrangement. Swarāvali are exercises with different arrangements of swarams. It is shortened and referred as Sarali, as in Sarali varisai described above. Janta varisai Janta varisai are exercises used to learn the swarams in the octave in twin fashion (sa sa ri ri ga ga and so on) and a few other combinations. It is also usually learnt in Māyāmālavagowla rāgam. Dhāttu varisai Dhāttu (Kannada) literally means jump. Dhāttu varisai are exercises used to learn the swarams in zig-zag fashion, so that more control of the notes and different combinations are achieved. Example, sa ma ri ga, sa ri ga ma, and so on. Each of these exercises are set to different tālams, so that different rhythm aspects are learnt. Alankāra Alankāra means decoration. These exercises are groups or patterns of swarams, each of which are set to seven main tālams, so that rhythm aspect is also learnt together with different rāgams. Types of composition Geetham Geetham means song or melody. Geethams are the first songs that are learnt. They are very short and are the first exercises where singing lyrics along with their swaram patterns are learnt. Swarajati Swarajati lead to learning bigger songs / compositions after learning Geethams. They are set to different rāgams and lead towards learning varnams and kritis. Varnam Varnam is a type of composition which is suited for vocal exercises of a wide variety of Carnatic music aspects, including slow and fast tempo of singing, both lyrics and swarams. It is the most complex of vocal exercises. In modern carnatic concerts, it is usually sung as a first song and is supposed to help warm-up. Keerthanam Keerthanam or Kriti is the category of most compositions in Carnatic music. A concert consists mainly of Keerthanams with zero or one of Varnam, Rāgam Thānam Pallavi and Thillānā included in appropriate order. Kriti For Kriti, see Keerthanam above. Thillana Thillānā is a composition consisting of rhythm syllables, like Dheem, thom, tarana and thaani in first two stanzas, followed by a one or two line lyric. In instrumental performances, it is a melodic rhythmic piece. Parts of a composition Pallavi Pallavi is the first verse in a composition, especially varnams, Keerthanams or Kritis. Anupallavi Anupallavi is an optional verse that follows the pallavi in a composition, especially keerthanams or kritis. Charanam Charanams are the verse(s) that follow the pallavi or anupallavi (if present). Chittaswaram Chittaswarams are set swaram phrases (solfa passages), in a composition, usually a kriti, appended to enrich its beauty. It is sung at the end of the anupallavi and charanam. Muktāyi swaram Muktāyi swarams are the swaram phrases (solfa passage) that occur after the anupallavi in tāna varnams and which serves as the concluding part of the pūrvanga (first part). This is more related to the songs for dance performances, like Bharatanatyam. Other Tani avartanam Tani avartanam refers to the extended solo that is played by the percussionists in a concert. Tukkada Tukkadaas are compositions played towards the end of Carnatic concerts. Avadhana Pallavi Avadhana Pallavi is a classical form of performing a composition set to two different talas. Konnakol Konnakol is the art of performing percussion syllables vocally.  References  #A practical course in Carnatic music by Prof. P.

Origins The Lively class were a series of sixteen ships built to a 1799 design by Sir William Rule, which served in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. The prototype and name ship of the class was of 1804. In contemporary usage the class was referred to as the 'Repeat Lively class'. As such the prototype ship was not considered to be part of the class at the time.Gardiner (2000), p, 27 They were considered the most successful British frigate design of the period, much prized by the Navy Board; after the prototype was launched in 1804 (by which time four more frigates had already been ordered to the same design), a further eleven sister-ships were ordered to her design, although this was slightly modified (in 1805) to have the gangways between forecastle and quarterdeck more integrated into the upperworks, a step towards the final enclosure of the waist. This was reinforced in 1809 by the abandonment of breastworks at the break of the quarterdeck and forecastle and in 1810 by the narrowing of the waist by the addition of gratings inboard of the gangways. At the same date, 'top riders', angled reinforcing timbers for the upperworks, were discontinued.Gardiner (2000), p, 27 Characteristics and performance The captain's reports on the performance of this class were remarkable for their absence of serious criticism. The vessels of the class were fast, recording 13kts large and 10-11kts close-hauled, weatherly and manoeuvrable. They were excellent heavy- weather ships, perfectly able to cope with a \\"head sea.\\" They stowed their provisions well; they were capable of stowing provisions and fresh water for up to six months of cruising. Indeed, \\"riding light,\\" after a substantial proportion of fresh water and provisions had been consumed, affected their sailing qualities adversely, so that most captains filled any emptied freshwater stowage capacity with seawater.Gardiner (2000), p. 142.

Currently it is part of the borough of Årstad, but before 2000 it was part of a borough called \\"Løvstakken\\" which covered the eastern and western sides of the mountain Løvstakken, consisting of Fyllingsdalen in the west and Løvstakksiden in the east. Although the neighbourhood has no official boundaries, it can be said to cover the urban area to the northeast of the mountain Løvstakken, or parts of western Årstad. Løvstakksiden is not considered a \\"traditional\\" neighbourhood of Bergen, because it is located outside the core borough of Bergenhus. However it remains inside Bergen's urban area, in the borough of Årstad. Løvstakksiden is also a local parish in Bergen with two churches, Solheim Church and St. Markus Church. History Løvstakksiden, with the mountain Løvstakken in the background. In the early 20th century, Løvstakksiden was predominantly a traditional working class neighbourhood. However, in the 1970s many industrial work places closed down, and so the character of the neighbourhood changed. With many smaller apartments in the area, it became more attractive for senior citizens and low-income families, and other young single people.Mekonnen, 2003, pp. 60-61. Until recently housing was inexpensive. However, with the northern parts being close to the university and other schools, a number of students have moved into the area, thus increasing the rental prices. Løvstakksiden has a large amount of housing projects, with one third of buildings in the area being owned by the municipality, the highest concentration in all of Bergen. When working-class families started moving out of these, the municipality placed more needy individuals in them, many with drug-related problems.Mekonnen, 2003, p. 61. In the local newspaper Bergensavisen in the 1990s, the leader of the child protection services was quoted as saying that children should not live in the neighborhood. He meant there was too much drug abuse, violence, and police action there. Local residents protested at this, saying the whole neighbourhood was being stigmatized, when only part of it had such problems.Mekonnen, 2003, pp. 61-62. In recent years, the neighbourhood has received a number of immigrants. The proportion of immigrants increased from 4.1% in 1990 to 11.7% in 2000. In 1990 the largest immigrant group came from Chile; in 2000 the majority came from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Iraq.Mekonnen, 2003, pp. 70-71. Demographics The population of the neighbourhood was claimed to be about 3,435 in 2000,Mekonnen, 2003, p. 65. although this figure depends on how the neighbourhood is defined. Løvstakksiden is an unofficial area, and is often considered to extend somewhat further south than in this example. In the Municipality Living Standards Report of 2008 the areas named \\"Solheim nord\\" and \\"Solheim sør\\" (identified as roughly corresponding to Løvstakksiden) had a combined population of 7965 (5422 and 2543 respectively). It is also the neighbourhood in Bergen which has the largest immigrant population. In 2000 one third of all arriving refugees to Bergen were placed in the neighbourhood. Education The main school of Løvstakksiden is the combined elementary and lower secondary school, Ny Krohnborg skole. Because of the relatively large immigrant population of Løvstakksiden, Ny Krohnborg is home to a large diversity of pupils. In 1998 the proportion of pupils from minority backgrounds was 34%. In 2005, about 75% of the pupils in the first grade were from a minority background. Economy The average income of the inhabitants of Løvstakksiden was in 1999, which was clearly lower than for the city of Bergen as a whole at that time. In the Municipality Living Standards Report of 2008 the area Solheim nord had an average income of , while Solheim sør had an average income of . These areas had practically the lowest average incomes for the whole city. Crime In 2013, the police decided to close down the local police station,Legg ned nærpolitistasjonane i Bergen Løvstakken Nærpoliti. Løvstakksiden is also home to Løvstakken Nærpoliti, which is a local police force, the only one in Bergen other than the main police force. This was moved from Landås to Løvstakksiden in 1999 due to the higher crime rates in the area. For two years this was a very effective move which helped reduce the crime rates, however after 2001 crime again started to increase. Most criminal activity is in the areas of drugs, robbery, and violence.dead link Løvstakken Velforening - Kriminalitetsbildet \\"Archery brigades\\" (buekorps) The local neighbourhood buekorps of Løvstakksiden, \\"Løvstakkens Jægerkorps\\".

In March 2012, a national nature and cultural reserve was established covering an area of , including the entire area of the Termit Massif and Tin Toumma desert, making it the largest single protected area in Africa. The area provides habitat for many critically endangered species. Prominent among them is the addax antelope, which is categorized under the IUCN Red List as one of the rarest and most endangered species in the world; about 300 of them are reported in the reserve. A conservation effort has been launched by the Government of Niger in collaboration with many international conservation agencies. The reserve has also been declared an UNESCO World Heritage Site for the biodiversity value of the Termit Massif and surrounding Sahara Desert and for the cultural value of its archaeological sites. The reserve has 30 species of mammals, several species of reptiles and more than 150 species of birds; among the bird species recorded is the threatened lappet-faced vulture which breeds in small pockets in several areas of the reserve. History The earliest reported exploration of the Termit Massif reserve area was by Saharan explorers Dixon Denham and Hugh Clapperton, Heinrich Barth, Gustav Nachtigal, Vischer and Buchanan who recorded the enormous amount of game found in the reserve. In recent years the decline in the wildlife of the region has also been noted, and some of the species have been photographed by renowned wildlife photographer Alain Dragesco-Joffé. This led to initiation of action to preserve the wildlife in the area through suitable legislation passed by the Government of Niger on 1 January 1952, covering an area of . This has been further enlarged recently to cover an area of . Awareness of the unique wildlife of the reserve has been facilitated by the Sahara Conservation Fund since 2001. The proposal to declare this reserve as UNESCO World Heritage Site was submitted on 26 May 2006 under Criteria of Natural vii, on account of its biodiversity values and its cultural importance. Geography A view of the Termit Massif. A tribal woman in the Termit Massif Reserve The reserve is a Total Faunal Reserve IUCN type IV, established 1 January 1962, covering over 700,000 hectares of the Termit Massif, which includes the Termit Massif Faunal Reserve Buffer Zone, forming a half ring around the southern border of the larger Termit Massif Reserve.Map of reserve The rocky Sahel highlands on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert are known for their endangered antelope populations. Termit has both desert and mountain terrain. WWF has classified this reserve as part of the larger ecoregion of the South Saharan Steppe and Woodlands ecoregion that includes a strip of desert land which extends from central Mauritania, Mali, southwestern Algeria, Niger, Chad, and across Sudan to the Red Sea, and borders southern fringes of the Sahara Desert along the Saharan-Sahelian region, where the climate progressively becomes semi-arid. In the highly arid climatic conditions, annual average rainfall hovers around 100 mm, (highly temporal with spatial variation) which is generally during July and August. The ecoregion has two seasons - the dry season from November to May and the rainy season lasting from June to September. People's sustenance in the region is largely dependent on pastoralism, rainfed agriculture, irrigation near oases and cattle grazing. Termit Massif is the central core of the reserve. The topography of the massif's southern part includes long eroded slopes of black sandstone formations which have valley formations, gullies and hillocks of conical shape. The northern part, called the Gossololom region, has rock outcrops rising out of the sand. The masiff is surrounded by a landscape of black rocks and ochre coloured sand. The peak elevation of the massif is 710m. The massif is home for human settlements of tribes of Toubou people whose basic vocation is farming (livestock and agriculture) with rearing of camels, goats and a limited number of sheep. The Gossololom region has notable archaeological finds from the Paleolithic and post-Neolithic periods. The tools found are Acheulean stone tools: microliths, bifaced tools, chopping tools, axe heads, and remnants of pots. Many carvings on stones of giraffes and cattle have also been found. The soil formations recorded in the reserve in the sequence from south to north are; the ancient dunes of the Quaternary age consisting of soil and clay; sand dunes running longitudinally; the newly deposited layers of sand dunes; a mixture of old and new dunes in the north; formations of clayey sandstone as bedrock; and the sandy alluvium of the Quaternary age in the dry valley of Dillia. In the dry valley of Dillia, and in basins and valleys cutting the massif, there are only eight temporal ponds which are filled for 3 months of the year. In the foothills of the massif, deep wells of 16 to 40 m depth are the only other source of water. Wildlife The reserve is a faunal reserve and hence all emphasis is on its fauna. Its flora consists mainly of Sahelian savanna of small, twisted trees, and trees with thorn and bushes. Fauna The reserve habitat is isolated, conditions which have helped create the rich congregation of desert fauna. Many IUCN Red Listed endangered species such as addax, dama and Dorcas gazelles, Sudan cheetah, Barbary sheep and striped hyena survive in large numbers. Bustards, of both the Nubian and Sudan species, and also tortoise (desert-adopted spurr type) are also found in large numbers; vultures, small carnivorans, including canids (such as fennec, pale fox, Rüppell's fox and golden wolf) and small cat species (Saharan sand cat and African wild cat), are also reported in the reserve. While details are difficult to establish, some researchers believe Termit may be home to the last self-sustaining population of the critically endangered addax, which at one time made regular migrations from what is now the Aïr and Ténéré Addax Sanctuary on the edge of the Ténéré desert.Roseline C. Beudels-Jamar, Pierre Devillers, René-Marie Lafontaine and John Newby. ADDAX NASOMACULATUS, CMS report, 2007, Institut royal des Sciences naturelles de Belgique. Several hundred dama gazelle are noted here. Though the slender-horned gazelle had previously been reported here, it was unknown by 1999 if it was still found in the area. The Saharan cheetah is reported to be very few in number, about 10. They have adopted to the searing heat of the Saharan Desert and can survive without a perennial source of water. Air Barbary sheep are also found here. Flora Indigofera tinctoria The reserve's vegetation consists of steppe of Acacia-Panicum species on the western and southern sides of the massif. Grassy steppe species Panicum turgidum, Indigofera sessiliflora or Danthonia forskalii dominate the eastern part of the reserve. Other specific floral species recorded include: Acacia raddiana and Panicum turgidum in the western and southern valleys, Acacia raddiana, Maerua crassifolia, Salvadora persica, Panicum turgidum, Chenbergiana and Leptadenia pyrotechnica. Conservation The faunal reserve has been subject to intense hunting of endangered species. The addax species remaining in the Termit region is considered the only place in the world with sustainable numbers. Hence, its conservation has received the active support of the Termit regional programme jointly funded by the Government of Niger, the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), the Fonds Français pour l’Environnement Mondial (FFEM), the Association Française des Volontaires du Progrès (AFVP) and the Sahara Conservation Fund (SCF).

He played for Derry in the 1980s and 1990s and was part of the county's 1993 All-Ireland Championship winning side, starting at left half forward. He also won two Ulster Senior Championship medals, three National League titles, and a range of under-age inter-county medals with the county. Cassidy played his club football for Bellaghy Wolfe Tones and won five Derry Championships and the 1994 Ulster Senior Club Football Championships with the club. For both club and county he usually played as a forward. Cassidy was also a talented hurler. Since retiring from playing football he has managed a number of teams. He guided home-club Bellaghy to success in the 2005 Derry Championship, and Tyrone club Clonoe O'Rahilly's to the Tyrone Championship in 2008. He was the manager of the Derry Senior from 2008 to 2010 and Under 21 teams. His brother Joe also played for Derry. Football career Playing style Cassidy played the majority of his career in the forward line (corner forward for Bellaghy and half forward for Derry), but also had a spell in the half back line early in his career. Adrian McGuckin who coached him at St. Pat's, Maghera said he had a superb left foot and was very comfortable on the ball. GAA journalist and former Derry team-mate Joe Brolly said that despite the presence of many other great footballers at the time, Cassidy at his peak \\"was easily the best club footballer in Derry\\". Inter-county Cassidy was part of the Derry Minor side that won the 1983 Ulster Minor and All-Ireland Minor Championships. Cassidy scored 2–03 (2 goals and 3 points—each goal equals 3 points; 2 × 3 + 3 = 9 points, see GAA scoring rules) in the Ulster minor final victory over Monaghan. He scored 0–04 from left half forward in the All-Ireland semi-final victory over Galway, before going on to defeat Cork in the decider, playing at left half forward. He also won back-to-back Ulster Under 21 Championships with the Derry Under 21 side in 1985 and 1986. In 1985 Derry Under 21s were defeated by Cork in the All Ireland Under 21 Championship final and by Cork in the 1986 All-Ireland semi-final. He made his Derry Senior debut straight out of Minors the following year (1984) and was on the 1987 Ulster Senior Football Championship winning team, at right corner forward. The side defeated Armagh in the final. In 1992 Cassidy was part of the Derry panel that won the National League. It was 1992 until Cassidy and Derry got back to an Ulster final, however this time they were beat by Donegal. Derry however defeated Donegal in the 1993 Ulster decider and went on to win the 1993 All- Ireland Championship with a semi-final victory over Dublin and a final victory over Cork. The success was the county's first ever All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. Cassidy won further National League medals in 1995 and 1996. Club At underage level with Bellaghy he won Derry Under 16 (1981) and Derry Minor Championships. He made his Senior debut for the club in 1982. He won his first Derry Senior Football Championship medal with Bellaghy in 1986, with victory over Ballinderry in the final; Bellaghy also won the league that year. Despite Bellaghy not reaching the final, Cassidy was the Derry Championship's top-scorer in 1991, with a total haul of 4–06 (18 points). The club won the Derry Championship again in 1994, and also won that year's Ulster Senior Club Football Championship. The club went on to contest the 1995 All- Ireland Senior Club Football Championship final against Kilmacud Crokes of Dublin. Bellaghy were beat by three points and unfortunately for Cassidy he missed a vital penalty late in the match. Cassidy won further Derry Championship medals with the club in 1996, 1998 and 1999 —winning Derry league medals in the latter two years as well. Bellaghy were also Ulster Club runners-up in 1996 and 1998. He was awarded the man of the match accolade in both the 1994 and 1999 Derry Championship finals. Cassidy won player of the tournament in the All Ireland 7's hosted by Kilmacud in Dublin in 1996. He was also on the 7's team that won the All Ireland 7's in 1986.

School Cassidy won three MacRory Cup medals in 1982, 1983 and 1984 whilst at St. Patrick's College, Maghera (secondary school). He also played hurling for the college and won a Mageean Cup in 1984. Management career Inter-county Cassidy was Derry assistant manager to Eamonn Coleman from 2000 until 2002. Derry won the National League in 2000 and got to the All-Ireland semi-final in 2001. Following the resignation of Coleman in July 2002, Cassidy said he was not interested in becoming Derry manager. Mickey Moran in the end succeeded Coleman. In late 2002, Cassidy was linked with the vacant Antrim manager's job, but rejected it. The post eventually went to PJ O'Hare. Following illness to then Cavan manager Eamonn Coleman before the start of the 2005 Championship, assistant Martin McElkennon became acting-manager and Cassidy became McElkennon's assistant. He described his position as a \\"consultancy role\\", but was assigned an assistant manager / coach's role the following year. In 2008 he applied for the vacant Derry Senior football manager's job. Cassidy was announced as new Derry boss late on 7 October 2008. His backroom team will include former Antrim star Kevin Madden, as well as Martin McConnell, Brendan McCrory and goalkeeping coach Kevin O'Neill. Club He managed the Senior and Under-21 teams of St. Teresa's Loughmacrory in 2003 and led the club to the Tyrone Under 21 Championship title. Cassidy became Bellaghy manager for the 2004 season and managed them to the county final of 2004 where they lost to Slaughneil by 2 points. He also secured the league title in the same season. They captured 2005 Derry Championship title and they also reached the final of that year's Ulster Club Championship. Then reached the Derry final again in 2007 under his leadership, but lost by a point to Glenullin after a replay. He announced in December 2007 that he was stepping down as Bellaghy boss. He was appointed manager of Tyrone club Clonoe O'Rahilly's in January 2008. He successfully guided the club to success in the 2008 Tyrone Championship, the club's first title since 1991. They shocked the \\"big two\\" of Tyrone club football – Errigal Ciarán and Carrickmore in the first round and quarter-final respectively. Clonoe then defeated Donaghmore to progress to their first Championship final in 17 years. They faced defending champions Dromore in the final, who went in as red-hot favourites. However, Clonoe beat Dromore by a point after extra time. The feat is all the more remarkable, considering Clonoe are a very young team and have no Tyrone county players on the team. They were however beaten by St Eunan's of Donegal in the quarter-final of the 2008 Ulster Club Championship. Cassidy was reappointed manager of Clonoe O'Rahilly's in 2011, where he guided them back into the Tyrone championship final against Dromore, a repeat of the 2008 final, this time Dromore got their revenge winning by a point. In 2012 he guided Clonoe to their first All County Senior League title, defeating Coalisland in the final. In 2013 he once more lead Clonoe O' Rahilly's to senior championship success, beating Carrickmore in the final. He quickly followed this up with winning the U21 county title and then the Ulster U21 championship with Clonoe, defeating Truagh Gaels of Monaghan. 2015 the O' Rahilly's recaptured the All County Senior League title for the second time in their history under Cassidy's stewardship. Cassidy became manager of Erin's Own Cargin in County Antrim in 2018. Winning the senior championship at his first attempt, beating St Galls in a pulsating high scoring semi-final and then beating parish neighbours Creggan, where the rivalry is intense, in a low scoring championship final. In the same season, Cassidy also lead Wolfe Tones, Bellaghy to their first minor championship win since 1994, by beating close rivals Lavey Gac in the Derry minor championship final at Derry GAA Centre of Excellence, Owenbeg. He followed this up by leading the 'Tones' to the Ulster minor club championship, hosted by Belfast club St Pauls on New Years Day, by heavily defeating Crossmaglen Rangers Gac in the final. Cassidy won his second senior club championship with Cargin in 2019 by beating Lamh Dhearg in a final replay and then extra time in a pulsating final.

He is a well known Bachata artist from the Dominican Republic. He is known for hits such as \\"Maestra\\", \\"Lento y Suave\\", \\"Asi Te Amo\\", \\"Yo Te Voy Amar\\", \\"Laudano\\", \\"Directo al Corazon\\", \\"El Profesor\\",\\"Aventura\\", among others.  Early life  Martínez was born in 1976 in San Francisco de Macorís, Dominican Republic. Martínez grew up in a poor family with his twelve brothers. As a child he worked as a shoe shiner, then as a bakery assistant. These were just some of the jobs he had to perform to help at home. This prevented him from finishing school. He moved to New York sometime in the early 90s. There he met Lenny Santos, one of the members of the soon to be group Aventura, one of the biggest Bachata acts ever. Santos taught Martínez how to play the guitar.  Music career  In the mid 90s, Martínez signed with the label Premium Latin Music and released his solo debut album \\"Todo Se Paga\\" in 1998. The album was produced by Lenny Santos. The album proved popular as well as critically successful, winning an ACE Award in the category of Revelacion del Año (awarded by La Asociación de Cronistas de Espectáculos de Nueva York—in English, the Association of Latin Entertainment Critics). This album contained hits like \\"Asi Fue\\" and \\"Me Seguiras Buscando\\". Martínez released his second studio album \\"Directo Al Corazon\\" in 1999, also produced by Lenny. This album also did commercially well, spawning hits such as \\"Bailando Con El\\", \\"Tu Sabes Bien\\", and \\"Directo Al Corazon\\". He released three additional albums on Premium Latin Music— Tres Palabras (2002), Así Te Amo (2003), and Descontrolado (2004) and enjoyed further success; for example, \\"Así Te Amo\\" won a Casandra Award in 2004 for Best Song of the Year. Martínez was nominated for a Premio Lo Nuestro award in 2004 for Best Traditional Tropical Artist. Martínez subsequently left Premium Latin Music (which consequently released the greatest-hits album La Historia de Elvis Martínez in 2005) and switched to Univision Records for Yo Soy Más Grande Que Él (2005). His best-selling album to date, Yo Soy Más Grande Que Él featured the hit singles \\"Tu Traición\\" and \\"Yo No Nací Para Amar\\". The partnership with Univision was short lived, however, as Martínez switched labels once again, moving to Universal Music Group for La Luz de Mis Ojos (2007), which spawned the hit single \\"Lento y Suave\\". He then went back to his first label Premium Latin and released \\"Esperanza\\" in 2012. Martínez was featured on Millonario on Romeo Santos album Utopia (2019). The song was produced by Lenny.

Life He was baptized at Lady Lane Chapel, then the only Roman Catholic church in Leeds. His grandfather was a Catholic convert and wished Peter's father to be a Benedictine monk, but he found that he had no vocation, so returned to a secular life and married. In his will he requested that his son Peter should be educated in a Benedictine college, and Peter was accordingly sent to Ampleforth College in 1824, and began his novitiate in 1829. Owing to certain provisions of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, his superiors were, at least theoretically, debarred from professing novices and, as they were unwilling to offend the authorities in any way, Peter was not professed. So in 1830 he went to Prior Park, where he taught Classics. In 1835 the members of the Institute of Charity came to assist in the teaching, and Dr Luigi Gentili shortly afterwards succeeded to the presidency of the college. Hutton was at this time a deacon, having been so for over five years; and he disliked the advent of these foreign professors very much. The bishop then sent him to the Catholic University of Leuven in 1836, where he studied till be was recalled to Prior Park in 1839 by Bishop Baines to replace Father Furlong (who had just joined the Order of Charity) as President of St. Peter's College. Hutton was ordained priest 24 September 1839, and appointed president, and professor of Latin and Greek. In 1841 he decided to give up his professorial career in order to enter the Order of Charity. In July, he was admitted to its novitiate at Loughborough, Leicestershire; but Bishop Baines strongly objected to this, deposed him from the presidency of St. Peter's, and ordered him to return to Prior Park as an ordinary professor. For a short period he complied with the bishop's commands, but in 1843 he suddenly left college, in company with Father Furlong, and went to Italy, where then were hospitably received by Rosmini, the founder of the Institute of Charity. He completed his interrupted novitiate there, and made his vows 31 July 1843. In 1844 he was appointed rector of the new college of the order at Ratcliffe-on-Wreake, Leicestershire. He next did some parochial work at Newport, Monmouthshire, and Whitwick, near Leicester. He then went to Shepshed, Leicestershire, as rector of the mission and master of the novitiate of Ratcliffe, which had been moved there. In 1850 it was again transferred to Ratcliffe, and Hutton was then made vice-president of the college, and president in 1851. In addition to this he was appointed rector of the religious community in 1857. Hutton was a strict disciplinarian, a theologian and classical scholar, a good mathematician, an able preacher. During his administration, the students at Ratcliffe increased in numbers, and the buildings were enlarged. He left in manuscript translations of the principal Greek and Latin authors read at Ratcliffe, with copious notes, and many references to German critics. These were preserved at Ratcliffe.

Framed in steel and clad with an artificial stone called Rostone (Limestone, shale and alkali). Billed as never needing repairs, it only lasted until the 1950s.Cultural Sites of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore; National Park Service, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore; Porter, Indiana Intended to showcase a new building material of limestone waste and shale, the Rostone House was the product of Rostone, Inc., of Lafayette, Indiana, and the Indiana Bridge Company. Construction was simplified by the completion of most design and fabrication work at a factory. The panels would be precast to the correct sizes needed for a specific project. Each panel came with pre-set nuts, that would be used to bolt the panel onto the steel frame. Both the interior and exterior walls were designed this way.Images of America; Beverly Shores, A Suburban Dune Resort, Jim Morrow; Arcadia Press, Chicago, Illinois, 2001, pg 98 The house was designed by Indiana Architect Walter Scholer.

Rostone Front Entrance (only original Rostone) It is a synthetic product composed of shale, alkaline earths, and limestone quarry waste. It has a variety of colors and can be produce in slabs, panels and other forms to exact dimensions. It was advertised as having the properties resembling limestone. The advantages to rostone was that it could be produced in any dimension and in several colors. The material, was much less durable than initial tests indicated. The sheathing on the Rostone House began to fail approximately ten years after it was installed; the house was reclad with Permastone in 1950. Move to Beverly Shores Robert Bartlett's purchased the Homes of Tomorrow Exhibition houses in 1935 and hired Civil Engineers, Ltd of Chicago to move them to Beverly Shores. The Rostone House was placed on the lakefront with its expansive windows facing the lake. In the winter and spring of 1934, sixteen buildings were brought by barge and by truck from the site of the 1933-34 Century of Progress Exposition to Robert Bartlett's subdivision at Beverly Shores, Indiana. In an attempt to capitalize on the fair's success, Bartlett reestablished a small exhibition of model houses along Lake Front Drive in Beverly Shores. Understanding the importance of the fair to Chicago and to Depression-era America is crucial for comprehending the significance of the houses for Bartlett and for those who purchased land at Beverly Shores. Restoration efforts Restoration efforts on the Wiebolt-Rostone House were started in 1997, with the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana searching for potential lessees to restore the building.\\"Times\\"; Heather Augustyn; World's Fair homes in Beverly Shores being restored to former glory; August 6, 2007 See also * Indiana Dunes National Park * List of Registered Historic Places in Indiana Bibliography *Century of Progress Paradox: Whose meat and whose Poison?\\" Architectural Forum 61 (November 1934): 374-379. *A House of Rostone at a Century of Progress.

There are at least three variants of the system: Super Säffle Spade (most advanced), Small Säffle Spade, and Small Happy Säffle Spade (simplest). Treatment ;Opening bids of Pass and 1 While the opening bid of Pass is forcing for one round, it does not promise a very strong hand. The basic idea is that all hands (except certain pre-emptive ones) with 8 or more high card points (HCP) and 4+ are opened with a Pass (may also contain a longer side-suit). If one has 8 or more HCP and no suit, but 4 or more , one opens 1 (may also contain a longer minor suit). The general rationale is that when you open very low, you want to hold and show the major suits, so opponents cannot easily pre-empt against you. Another advantage is that when you have 8 or more HCP you often tell partner immediately which major suit(s) you do not have, and when he sees that your side cannot have any major-suit fit, if appropriate, he can quickly pre-empt with a minor-suit bid. ;Other opening bids in the system * 1 is used on all weak hands, 0-7 HCP. * 1 shows 8 or more HCP and an unbalanced hand with no major (or 22 or more HCP, a balanced hand with no major). * 1 is \\"mini- notrump\\" with 8-12 HCP — denying a 4-card or longer major * 1NT shows 13-18 HCP — denying a 4-card or longer major * 2NT shows 19-21 HCP — denying a 4-card or longer major. * 2/2/2 show 4 or more cards in the suit bid plus a 5-card or longer major side-suit. * 2 shows any solid suit (AKQxxxx). * Higher openings are normal pre-empts. Today, the system is illegal in most competitions, since a \\"Pass\\" opening now may not be used to indicate strength. In the 1970s/1980s when it was invented and actively played, such regulations were rare.

The box set, released by the English label Spotlite Records, assembled into a single package the multi-volume compilation albums the label had released by Spotlite on vinyl in the 1970s under the series title Charlie Parker on Dial. The box set has been critically well received. In 1996, a different box set collecting Parker's work with Dial was assembled by Jazz Classics and released as Complete Charlie Parker on Dial.  Recording history  Recorded during Parker's tenure with Dial Records between March 28, 1946, and December 17, 1947, these 89 songs have been released multiple times.Section source.  Release history  In addition to British Spotlite's release in Britain and the United States on vinyl, in the mid 1970s, separately, the collection was published by label Jazz Classics in 1996 as Complete Charlie Parker on Dial and by Stash Records in 2004 as Complete Dial Sessions. (The collection was also released as a limited edition LP box set on Warner Brother Records in 1977, and as a general release two-disc set in 1977.)  Critical reception  The producers have, according to jazz historian Scott Yanow, collected \\"every locatable alternate take and rejected excerpt, as well as eight sides privately recorded at a house party\\" and compiled them with more readily available material. The Blackwell Guide to Recorded Jazz describes the Spotlite box set as \\"an essential aid in appreciating the scope of Parker's invention from take to take\\", concluding that \\"[t]his brilliant body of work is indispensable.\\" The Guardian also describes the recordings as \\"essential\\". The UK publication selected the Spotlite box set to represent Parker in its 2007 series on \\"1000 albums to hear before you die\\", noting that \\"timeless themes..., inspired improvising and radical vision make these epochal episodes in modern music\\". In his review, Yanow notes several problems with the collection, including a \\"glaring\\" inaccuracy regarding Parker's medical history in the liner notes and \\"scratchy surface noise\\" on some of the tracks, but praises the collection for its informativeness and comprehensiveness, indicating that \\"those who truly love Charlie Parker will cherish these artifacts, warts and all.\\"  Track listing  Except where otherwise noted, all songs composed by Charlie Parker.

The subsequent release of two additional albums incorporated material from 1948, including a session with Tadd Dameron's Orchestra, featuring performances by tenor saxophonists Allen Eager and Wardell Gray.  Volume 1  * Recorded: Feb 5, 1946 – Jul 29, 1946 The first volume features several sessions. In one, Parker and Dizzy Gillespie perform \\"Diggin' Diz\\". In another, described by Yanow as \\"superior\\", Parker and Miles Davis on trumpet lead a West Coast septet through several Parker standards, with variant takes. The final session on the album features Parker in performance with a Howard McGhee-led quintet where, according to Yanow, Parker's performance is seriously hampered by his poor physical condition.  Volume 2  * Recorded: Feb 19, 1947 This volume features the first session, including alternate takes, that Parker recorded following his hospitalization at Camarillo State Hospital in 1947. He is accompanied by the Erroll Garner trio, with vocalist Earl Coleman.  Volume 3  * Recorded: Feb 1, 1947 – Feb 26, 1947 The majority of the third volume features Parker in session with Red Callender on double bass, Gray on tenor saxophone, Barney Kessel on guitar, Don Lamond on drum, McGhee on trumpet, and Dodo Marmarosa on piano. Although the rest of the album has more historical significance than sound quality, Yanow describes the volume as \\"excellent\\" and recommends it.  Volume 4  * Recorded: Oct 28, 1947 The fourth volume presents Parker in performance with his 1947 quintet, featuring musicians Davis on trumpet, Duke Jordan on piano and Max Roach on drums. The album features six classics and 10 alternative takes. In his review, Yanow indicates that \\"this influential bop music...is full of brilliant moments\\".  Volume 5  * Recorded: Jun 6, 1945 – Nov 4, 1947 Primarily from a session on November 4, 1947, the 5th volume again features Parker with his 1947 quintet. Additionally, it includes tracks featuring vocals by Earl Coleman and a 1945 performance of \\"Hallelujah\\" with Parker and Gillespie in support of vibraphonist Red Norvo.  Volume 6  * Recorded: Dec 17, 1947 Concluding the original six-volume run, Parker's quintet became a sextet with the addition of J.J. Johnson on trombone.  Volume 7  * Recorded: Feb 1, 1947 – Sep 20, 1947 Spotlite LP107, officially titled Lullaby in Rhythm Featuring Charlie Parker, presents several Parker solos along with two radio sessions featuring Parker with Gillespie, Billy Bauer on guitar, Ray Brown on double bass, John LaPorta on clarinet, Roach on drums and Lennie Tristano on piano.  Volume 8  * Recorded: Nov 8, 1947 – Sep 1948 The final volume of the series featured tracks taken primarily from a radio broadcast on November 8, 1947, where Parker played with Barry Ulanov and His All-Star Metronome Jazzmen. The group featured Bauer on guitar, Allen Eager on tenor saxophone, LaPorta on clarinet, Fats Navarro on trumpet, Tommy Potter on double bass, Buddy Rich on drums, Tristano on piano, and, singing on \\"Everything I Have Is Yours\\", Sarah Vaughan. Additional material was taken from a set with Tadd Dameron's Orchestra, featuring performances by Eager and Gray.

The GTK-server project aims to bring Graphical User Interface programming to any interpreted language using the GIMP Tool Kit (GTK) or XForms. Philosophy The GTK-server provides a stream-oriented interface to GTK. If the GTK-server is compiled as a standalone binary, it allows five different interfaces: stdin, fifo (named pipe), ipc (message queue), tcp or udp. Any interpreted language or shellscript with I/O capabilities can start the GTK-server with an argument specifying the type of interface, and can start sending GTK function calls in S-Expression format. After each request, the GTK-server returns a result, depending on the type of GTK function invoked. If the GTK-server is compiled as a shared object, it exports the function 'gtk', which must be imported in the client program first. After that, the client program can start sending GTK function calls in S-Expression format as argument to the imported 'gtk' function. Before the GTK-server actually can execute GTK functions, it has to read a configuration file in which the prototypes of the GTK functions are described. Since version 2.2.3 this also can be done on-the-fly, allowing the GTK-server to run without configuration file. Implementation Implementing the GTK-server leads to the following considerations. * Accessing foreign functions is only possible when the accessed libraries are created with a non object oriented programming language like C or Pascal. Libraries created with C++ for example, use name mangling in order to unify overloaded functions. This means that the actual functionname in a C++ library cannot be known once the shared library has been compiled. Hence the functions in such a library cannot be accessed. Therefore, libraries like wxWidgets, the Qt toolkit, FLTK which are programmed in C++, cannot be accessed with the GTK-server concept. More on this matter is explained here. * The GTK library was implemented in the C programming language. Since C is a strongly typed programming language, the interpreted program needs to know the type of arguments and the type of the return value for each GTK function during runtime. These can be defined on-the-fly or in a configuration file, which is parsed by the GTK-server during startup. However, the GTK-server does not know the actual functions which are going to be used by the interpreted client program, so for GTK-server all arguments and return values for each GTK function are variable types. This leads to a problem for the implementation, because the GTK functions and the corresponding arguments and return values cannot be hardcoded into the GTK-server binary. The way to resolve this is by using a foreign function interface. Currently, four external foreign function interfaces are supported by GTK-server: libFFI, FFCALL, C/Invoke and DynCall. One of these libraries should be available on the target system, in order to compile the GTK-server successfully. Example The following KornShell script starts the GTK-server in stdin mode, and creates a simple window with an exit button: #!/bin/ksh # Start GTK-server gtk-server -stdin & # Communicate with GTK-server and assign function function gtk { print -p $1; read -p GTK; } function define { $2 \\"$3\\"; eval $1=\\"$GTK\\"; } # Setup GUI gtk \\"gtk_init NULL NULL\\" define WINDOW gtk \\"gtk_window_new 0\\" gtk \\"gtk_window_set_title $WINDOW 'Korn GTK-server demo'\\" gtk \\"gtk_window_set_default_size $WINDOW 400 200\\" define TABLE gtk \\"gtk_table_new 10 10 1\\" gtk \\"gtk_container_add $WINDOW $TABLE\\" define BUTTON gtk \\"gtk_button_new_with_label 'Click to Quit'\\" gtk \\"gtk_table_attach_defaults $TABLE $BUTTON 5 9 5 9\\" gtk \\"gtk_widget_show_all $WINDOW\\" # Mainloop until $EVENT = $WINDOW do define EVENT gtk \\"gtk_server_callback wait\\" done # Exit GTK-server gtk \\"gtk_server_exit\\" Advantages and limitations Although GTK was meant to be used with the C programming language, it is now possible to use GTK from any interpreted language without changing the actual implementation of the interpreter. Also, GTK 1.x, GTK2.x and GTK 3.x can be reached. Optionally, any other shared library can be used, like OpenGL related libraries, Poppler, Mozilla, but also libc, sqlite and a music library like MikMod. When using the GTK-server as a standalone binary, it inevitably creates an additional process in the processlist. Also, GTK functions defined as a macro cannot be reached by a client program.

These centers are located at universities across the US, and are funded by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) to spread ideas relating to industrial energy conservation. The centers conduct research into energy conservation techniques for industrial applications. This is accomplished by performing energy audits or assessments at manufacturers near the particular center. The IAC program has achieved over $4.5 billion of implemented energy cost savings since its inception.Nimbalkar, Presentation to the Industrial Energy Technology Conference, May 15, 2009 History Industrial Assessment Centers (formerly called the Energy Analysis and Diagnostic Center (EADC) program) were created by the Department of Commerce in 1976 and later moved to the DOE. The IAC program is administered through the Advanced Manufacturing OfficeAdvanced Manufacturing Office under the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. The Centers were created to help small and medium-sized manufacturing facilities cut back on unnecessary costs from inefficient energy use, ineffective production procedures, excess waste production, and other production-related problems.Energy.gov IAC Site According to instructions from DOE, currently the centers are only required to focus on reducing wasted energy and increasing energy efficiency. While this remains the primary focus of the assessments, waste reduction and productivity improvements are still commonly recommended. Other Benefits In addition to providing technical support to small to mid-sized manufacturers through energy assessments, the IAC program offers several other important benefits. Apart from the routine energy audits which cover a broad scope of industrial settings and subsystems, the IACs provide technical material and workshops promoting energy efficiency. IAC Database Rutgers University maintains a large databases of energy efficiency projects in the industrial sector.

Commissioned in 1901 by the Newcastle upon Tyne Electric Supply Company, the station was the first in the world to provide electricity for purposes other than domestic and street lighting. It was also the first in the world to generate electricity using three-phase electrical power distribution at a voltage of 5,500 volts. The station had an initial generating capacity of 2,800 kW, which was increased to 3,000 kW a year after the station opened, with the introduction of two 1,500 kW Parsons turbo alternators, the largest ever built at that time. The station closed in 1915, following the completion of an extension to Carville Power Station and the opening of Dunston Power Station. History At the beginning of the twentieth century, the use of electricity for general purposes began to be considered, and the Newcastle upon Tyne Electric Supply Company (NESCo) realised the potential it offered for development. In June 1899, the Walker and Wallsend Union Gas Company (WWUGC) acquired Parliamentary powers for the supply of electricity to the area around Wallsend. In January 1900 they erected Neptune Bank power station near the North Eastern Railway's (NER) North Tyneside Loop, midway between Wallsend and Walker. In October 1900, NESCo acquired the entire power station from the WWUGC, with the exception of the cables and sub-station machinery installed for the purpose of supplying the works in the area in which the WWUGC had obtained Parliamentary powers. the WWUGC continued to buy electricity in bulk from NESCo. The station was officially opened on 18 June 1901 by Lord Kelvin. At the opening he said: > \\"We have seen at work what many have not seen before - a system realised in > which a central station generates power by steam engines and delivers > electricity to consumers at distances varying, I think, from a quarter of a > mile to over three and a half miles... A larger station is in prospect, > larger work is contemplated. This admirable but comparatively small station > at Neptune Bank makes a splendid beginning... What I am seeing today is the > dream of my life realised. I do not know the limits of electricity, but it > will go beyond anything we can conceive of today.\\" The station was the first power station to generate electricity for industrial purposes, rather than just for domestic and street lighting, and this led to a rapid expansion of NESCo. NESCo laid high-tension cables from the power station to various substations in Newcastle upon Tyne. The company changed their system of supply, from 2,000 volt (V) single phase alternating current which had been used to distribute power from their Pandon Dene Power Station, to three phase current at 5,500 V. This made NESCo the first statutory authority to supply in such a way. The scientific journal, The Electrician congratulated NESCo in June 1901, stating that \\"not merely electric power supply on Tyneside was formally inaugurated last Tuesday, but the era of electric power utilisation all over the kingdom.\\" A year after the station came into operation, NESCo's original power station at Pandon Dene was closed and converted into a substation. The Pandon Dene station had originally supplied Newcastle city centre with electricity, but the new Neptune Bank station took over this supply, transmitting using high voltage cables laid in ducts, rendering the older station obsolete. Design and specification The station was the first major design project of Charles Merz, of the Merz & McLellan consulting partnership, and the first power station Merz & McLellan designed in the Newcastle area. The station's buildings were built from corrugated iron, and the boiler house adjoined the engine room on its south facing side. Each of these two buildings measured by . To the north east of the main station buildings lay the station's cooling pond, where the station's circulating water was cooled by means of spray nozzles, capable of cooling 4,000,000 pounds of water per hour. This cooling system was adopted as it was cheaper than pumping water up from the nearby River Tyne which was below the level of the station. The station was also equipped with a testing pond, capable of absorbing up to 1,500 kW. Coal was delivered to the station via the NER's North Tyneside Loop. An electric locomotive was used to convey the coal from the railway to the boiler house. The station's boiler house was equipped with four batteries of two Babcock & Wilcox boilers. Each boiler had a capacity of 1,000 horsepower and a working pressure of 200 psi. Each was fitted with superheaters and mechanical stokers and had a heating surface of , with a superheat of . Each could evaporate 14,000 pounds of water per hour. Ash waste from the boilers was discharged into trucks. The station initially generated electricity using four 700 kilowatt (kW) alternators, each driven by a slow-speed triple expansion marine type reciprocating engine, built by Wigham Richardson & Co. and the Wallsend Slipway & Engineering Company. The station was the first in the world to generate electricity using three-phase electrical power distribution at a voltage of 5,500 V, and the first to generate direct current at different voltages. After the opening of Carville Power Station in 1904, the voltage of transmission was raised to 6,000 V. In 1902, two 1,500-kW Parsons steam turbine driven turbo-alternators were added to the initial equipment at the station. At the time, these were the largest three-phase steam turbine driven alternators in the world, as well as being the first of the barrel type rotary design. Results gained from the turbines influenced the Cunard Steamship Company to install steam turbines on the Mauretania. The turbines drove 6,000 V three-phase alternators, supplying current to motor-generators and transformers in the substations attached to the distribution network. The motor-generators in the substations provided DC from the supplied AC and the transformers stepped-down the 6,000 V supply to 200 V for lighting use and 400 V for industrial use. By 1904, there were a total of nine different generating sets operating at the power station. Sets No. 1 and 2 were DC generators driven by 300 HP two-crank compound engines running at 380 RPM, power from which supplied DC network in Wallsend and Walker. Set No. 3 was a 50 kW set used for exciting purposes only. Sets No. 4 and 5 were used as balancers and motor generators and had a combined capacity of 150 kW. Sets No. 6, 7, 8 and 9 were each driven by 1,400 HP engines and in turn each drove a 750 kW alternator. The two Parsons sets worked alongside these. By 1912, the NESCo system, which the station was part of, was the largest integrated power system in Europe. Operations Coal was delivered to Neptune Bank from the Riverside Branch of the North Eastern Railway at Tyne Pontoons signal box, about halfway between Walker and Carville stations. It was taken to the station's railway sidings using a small electric locomotive and unloaded in front of the boiler house. It was then hand-loaded into automatic stokers which fired the boilers. Removal of ash from the boilers was performed by machine. The station was badly located for sources of cooling and boiler water - it was some above the level of the nearby River Tyne, which was also 200 feet away. The concept of a cooling tower had not yet been invented and a large but inefficient brick-built cooling pond was used. Closure Following Neptune Bank's commissioning there was a rapid increase in the demand for electricity, which couldn't be met by the station, and so in 1904 NESCo commissioned Carville Power Station. Fitted entirely with steam turbine generating equipment, Carville quickly superseded Neptune Bank. Neptune Bank power station was largely out of use by 1909 after the extension of the Carville station, along with the opening of Dunston Power Station. It was decommissioned in 1915 and the site was used by NESCo as a storage facility. The building was later acquired by the company Thermal Syndicate who used it as a glass blowing factory known as the Vitreosil Works.http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/historic-former- power-plant-bought-7572434 References Coal-fired power stations in England History of electrical engineering History of the Metropolitan Borough of North Tyneside Power stations in North East England Science and technology in Tyne and Wear ","title":"Neptune Bank Power Station"},{"id":"19176448","text":"The man's suit of clothes, in the sense of a lounge or business or office suit, is a set of garments which are crafted from the same cloth. This article discusses the history of the lounge suit, often called a business suit when made in dark colors and of conservative cut. Men's suits Johann Christian Fischer, composer, in matching coat, waistcoat, and breeches, by Thomas Gainsborough, ca. 1780. The suit is a traditional form of men's formal clothes in the Western world. For some four hundred years, suits of matching coat, trousers, and waistcoat have been in and out of fashion. The modern lounge suit's derivation is visible in the outline of the brightly coloured, elaborately crafted royal court dress of the 17th century (suit, wig, knee breeches), which was shed because of the French Revolution. This evolution is seen more recently in British tailoring's use of steam and padding in moulding woolen cloth, the rise and fall in popularity of the necktie, and the gradual disuse of waistcoats and hats in the last fifty years. The modern lounge suit appeared in the late 19th century, but traces its origins to the simplified, sartorial standard of dress established by the English king Charles II in the 17th century. In 1666, the restored monarch, Charles II, per the example of King Louis XIV's court at Versailles, decreed that in the English Court men would wear a long coat, a waistcoat (then called a \\"petticoat\\"), a cravat (a precursor of the necktie), a wig, knee breeches (trousers), and a hat. However, the paintings of Jan Steen, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and other painters of the Dutch Golden Era reveal that such an arrangement was already used informally in Holland, if not Western Europe as a whole. Many of Steen's genre paintings include men dressed in hip-length or frock coats with shirt and trousers, which in fact more closely resemble modern suit designs than the contemporary British standard. Regency In the early 19th century, British dandy Beau Brummell redefined, adapted, and popularized the style of the British court, leading European men to wearing well-cut, tailored clothes, adorned with carefully knotted neckties. The simplicity of the new clothes and their somber colors contrasted strongly with the extravagant, foppish styles just before. Brummell's influence introduced the modern era of men's clothing which now includes the modern suit and necktie. Moreover, he introduced a whole new era of grooming and style, including regular (daily) bathing as part of a man's toilette. However, paintings of French men from 1794 onwards reveal that Brummel might only have adopted and popularized post-revolutionary French suits, which included tail coat, double-breasted waistcoat and full-length trousers with either Hessian boots or regular-size shoes. There is no 18th- century painting of Brummel to establish his innovation. The modern suit design seems to be inspired by the utilitarian dressing of hunters and military officers. Paintings of the decade 1760 reveal how the modern coat design with lapels emerged. It can be seen in the hunting scene with Count Carl Emil Ulrich von Donop as subject by an unknown artist and Frederick William Ernest, Count von Schaumburg-Lippe in Hanoverian Field Marshall uniform painted by Joshua Reynolds. Johnson, Birth of the Modern In this regency period, the predominant upper-class clothing introduced by Brummell for day wear was a tightly fitting, dark coloured tailcoat with non-matching (usually pale) trousers, pale waistcoat, white shirt and cravat and tall boots. Victorian Towards the start of the Victorian period, the frock coat, initially not just black, became popular, and quickly became the standard daily clothing for gentlemen. From the middle of the 19th century, a new (then informal) coat, the morning coat, became acceptable. It was a less formal garment, with a cut away front, making it suitable for wearing while riding. Morning dress and the frock coat garments were not suits, because they were worn with trousers that didn't match in color or fabric; a matching waistcoat and trousers were considered informal and could be described using the short-lived term ditto suit. The frock coat was still the standard garment for all formal or business occasions, and a tailcoat was worn in the evenings. Towards the end of the 19th century, the modern lounge suit was born as a very informal garment meant only to be worn for sports, in the country, or at the seaside. Three men in 2006 wearing black tie variations. Parallel to this, the dinner jacket was invented and came to be worn for informal evening events. It was descended from white tie (the dress code associated with the evening tailcoat) but quickly became a full new garment, the dinner jacket, with a new dress code, initially known as 'dress lounge' and later black tie. When it was imported to the United States, it became known as the tuxedo. The 'dress lounge' was originally worn only for small private gatherings and white tie ('White tie and tails') was still worn for large formal events. The 'dress lounge' slowly became more popular for larger events as an alternative to full evening dress in white tie. Edwardian 1901, a man in a morning coat. The beginning of the Edwardian era in the early 20th century brought a steady decline in the wearing of frock coats as the morning coat rose in relative formality, first becoming acceptable for businessmen, then becoming standard dress even in town. The lounge suit was slowly accepted as being correct outside its original settings, and during Edwardian times gradually began to be seen in town. While still reserved for private gatherings, usually with no ladies, black tie became more common. In North America, the \\"sack suit\\", a cut of lounge suit, saw a large rise in popularity, and, except for the shoulders, it is unfitted, loose, and informal, as it has no darts. Inter-war At the Treaty of Versailles signing in 1919, the heads of state wore morning dress and lounge suits for informal meetings (as seen here), but frock coats for formal daytime meetings. After the end of the first World War, most men adopted the short lounge coated suit. Long coats quickly went out of fashion for everyday wear and business, and the morning coat gained its current classification of \\"formal\\". During the 1920s, short suits were always worn except on formal occasions in the daytime, when a morning coat would be worn. Older, more conservative men continued to wear a frock coat, or \\"Prince Albert coat\\" as it was known. In North America, for evening occasions, the short dinner jacket virtually replaced the long \\"full dress\\" tails, which was perceived as \\"old hat\\" and was only worn by old conservative men. In Britain, black tie became acceptable as a general informal alternative to white tie, though at the time the style and accessories of black tie were still very fluid. In the 1920s men began wearing wide, straight-legged trousers with their suits. These trousers normally measured 23 inches around the cuff. Younger men often wore even wider-legged trousers which were known as \\"Oxford bags.\\" Trousers also began to be worn cuffed shortly after World War I and this style persisted until World War II. Trousers first began to be worn creased in the 1920s. Trousers were worn very highly waisted throughout the 1920s and this fashion remained in vogue until the 1940s. Single-breasted suits were in style throughout the 1920s and the double-breasted suit was mainly worn by older more conservative men. In the 1920s, very fashionable men would often wear double-breasted waistcoats (with four buttons on each side) with single-breasted coats. Lapels on single-breasted suits were fashionably worn peaked and were often wide. In the early 1930s these styles continued and were often even further exaggerated. Before 1935 (and again in the 1970s) men preferred snugly tailored coats and waistcoats. In 1935, a complete change in style occurred. Loose fitting coats were introduced, trousers began to be tapered at the bottom and suit coats began to have tapered arms. These new trends were only reluctantly accepted by men at first. At first the waistcoat continued to be made in the traditional fitted and snug style. By 1940, the waistcoat began to be made in a loose style which made it uncomfortable to wear. In fashion magazines of the day, men complained how these new vests continually rode up when they happen to sit down or bend over. Fashionable men changed their preference to the double-breasted suit coat at this time and it would remain in fashion for the next two decades. By this time, morning dress was being replaced by day time semi-formal, known in North America as the stroller. This was quite popular, but has actually been outlived by the morning coat. Since the 1950s it has been used as a black version of the lounge suit as an informal look to the dinner jacket. In modern times the black lounge suit has become popular to wear during the day. Post-war Reflecting the democratization of wealth and larger trend toward simplification in the decades following the Second World War, the suit was standardized and streamlined. Suit coats were cut as straight as possible without any indication of a waistline, and by the 1960s the lapel had become narrower than at any time prior. Cloth rationing during the war had forced significant changes in style, contributing to a large reduction in the popularity of cuts such as the double-breasted suit. The New York Times Style Magazine explains one iconic suit of the era, the gray flannel suit: > Back in 1955, when denim was the height of rebelliousness, Sloan Wilson's > novel The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit turned a men's classic into a synonym > for drab, middle-class conformity . . . Flannel had humble beginnings — the > name is reputedly derived from \\"gwlanen,\\" Welsh for woolen cloth — and was > used for underwear in the 19th century. In the 1880s white flannel was worn > for summer sports; by the 1920s the more seasonless gray had become a > favorite. When the Prince of Wales wore gray flannel trousers on his 1924 > trip to America, they were aped by collegiates on both sides of the > Atlantic. Cary Grant and Fred Astaire then carried the trend through to the > 1940s.

In the 1970s, a snug-fitting suit coat became popular once again, also encouraging the return of the waistcoat. This new three-piece style became closely associated with disco culture, and was specifically popularized by the film Saturday Night Fever. Fashion brands such Haggar meanwhile started to introduce the concept of \\"suit separates\\", a production innovation that reduced the need for excessive customization. The 1980s saw a trend towards the simplification of the suit once again. The jacket became looser and the waistcoat was completely dispensed with. A few suit makers continued to make waistcoats, but these tended to be cut low and often had only four buttons. The waistline on the suit coat moved down again in the 1980s to a position well below the waist. By 1985-1986, three-piece suits were on the way out and making way for cut double-breasted and two-piece single- breasted suits. The late 1990s saw the return to popularity of the three- button two-piece suit, which then went back out of fashion some time in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Women's suits Butterick pattern company's Delineator The earliest women's suits were riding habits, which consisted of a tailored coat or jacket and matching skirt from the 1660s. Practical and sturdy, riding habits were worn not only on horseback, but also for travel and other daytime pursuits. Jacket-and-skirt ensembles not intended for riding appeared in the later 19th century. Both riding habits and walking suits reflected the skirt and sleeve styles of the day. Until the 1910s, coat and skirt ensembles were usually described as \\"costumes\\" rather than suits, and the term \\"suit\\", as applied to such sets, was not usual until after the First World War. In the first half of the twentieth century, the skirted suit became the common daytime city costume for women, in the workplace and out; dressmaker suits featured softer fabrics and \\"feminine\\" details, and cocktail suits were worn for semi-formal occasions in mid-century. Under the influence of Dress for Success, a working woman's uniform of skirted suit, tailored shirt, and floppy tie evolved in the 1970s and 1980s. Pantsuits (women's suits with Eastern style trousers) were introduced by designer André Courrèges in 1964 but were only gradually accepted as formal business attire. Recent influence of casual dress Over the past half-century, the wearing of suits has become far less common than it once was and is now usually reserved for formal and business activities. During the 1990s, many businesses in North America adopted casual dress codes, beginning with \\"Casual Fridays\\" and then extending to the entire business week. The abandonment of a uniform dress code has led to considerable confusion over what is considered appropriate business wear. More recently, some organizations have reinforced formal dress codes, although they may never again be as common as they once were. Contemporary trends Although the man's European tailored suit is commonly perceived as the ultimate conservative costume of Western culture, Eastern influences or extravagant variations on the tailored suit have been adopted by many subcultures over the last century as a matter of fashion or social identity. As early as 1922, Emily Post addressed what she termed the \\"freak American suit\\" in her influential guide Etiquette: :You will see it everywhere, on Broadway of every city and Main Street of every town, on the boardwalks and beaches of coast resorts, and even in remote farming villages. It comes up to hit you in the face year after year in all its amazing variations: waist-line under the arm pits, \\"trick\\" little belts, what-nots in the cuffs; trousers so narrow you fear they will burst before your eyes, pockets placed in every position, buttons clustered together in a tight little row or reduced to one. Such progressive styles may not reflect the international tastes or etiquette. Some of the non-traditional tailored suit styles of the past century include: * The Jazz suit of the early 1920s were extremely high-waisted and snug- fitting and were worn with trousers which were quite high-waisted and trouser legs were short and revealed the wearer's socks. * The Zoot suit of the late 1930s and 1940s. * The Western suit, a form of western wear featuring a tailored jacket with \\"western\\" details such as pointed yokes or arrowhead pockets. * The Nudie suit, a highly decorated form of western wear. * The Beatle suit, inspired by Pierre Cardin's collarless jackets, derived from Edwardian suits and the Indian Nehru jacket. * The Mod suit, a fashion of the 1960s, and again in the early 2010s. Characteristics include a very slim cut, narrow lapels, three or four buttons and a strongly tapered waist. Usually single-breasted and grey. The cloth generally consists in part of mohair, tonic, houndstooth, or two-tone fabric. * The Safari suit, a fashion of the 1970s. Patterned after military dress uniforms worn in hot climates, it consisted of (long, but sometimes short) trousers and short-sleeved jacket with patch pockets of a light suiting fabric, typically of beige or pastel shades of blue and green. It was worn with a short-sleeved shirt, mostly of open neck design, but occasionally with a tie. Another style associated with this was the leisure suit, which had a long-sleeved shirt-like jacket. * The Disco suit, a fashion of the 1970s with exaggerated lapels and flared trousers and usually necktie omitting, often in white or brightly coloured polyester fabric, the jacket was based on the jackets popular in the 1930s. * The Power suit of the mid-1980s and early 1990s: a double-breasted suit characterized by sharp cuts, wide shoulder pads and a rigid build.

Cappuccino was developed by University of Southern California graduates Francisco Tolmasky, Tom Robinson and Ross Boucher, who are also the founders of 280 North, Inc. It is primarily targeted towards web applications developers. Cappuccino consists of two distinct components: a programming language called Objective-J and an object-oriented library which is the Objective-J port of several of the Cocoa frameworks, namely Foundation Kit, Application Kit, CoreGraphics, and CoreAnimation. Objective-J Objective-J adds traditional inheritance and Smalltalk/Objective-C message calls to JavaScript. Objective-J compiles to, and is a strict superset of, JavaScript. This means that all valid JavaScript code is also valid Objective-J code (this is the same relationship that Objective-C has to the C language). Objective-J and JavaScript may be freely mixed within the same source file (suffixed with \\".j\\" file extension) and many framework classes are \\"toll-free-bridged\\" to their JavaScript counterparts. For example, CPArray (equivalent to Cocoa's NSArray) and native JavaScript arrays are bridged and may be used interchangeably. Programs written in Objective-J look very similar to their counterparts written in Objective-C. There are significant differences, however: for example, Objective-J has no header files, and local variables are declared with the JavaScript \\"var\\" keyword rather than a type declaration. Most of the Cappuccino framework's classes are named identically to their Cocoa counterparts, except with a \\"CP\\" class prefix instead of \\"NS\\", and the majority of API's function identically or very similarly. The Objective-J compiler is written in JavaScript and programs written in Objective-J may be directly compiled on the client side (typically in the web browser) by the Objective-J compiler through the Objective-J runtime. The framework also embeds a tool that can perform this compilation ahead of time, such that only regular JavaScript is sent to the client; this is significantly more performant and generally preferable. The on-the-fly compilation option, however, is convenient for development purposes. Features and advantages Even though the Cappuccino framework uses standard web technologies for web page rendering, such as JavaScript, the browser Document Object Model, and Cascading Style Sheets, it is not a classical JavaScript widget library such as ExtJs, jQuery or Prototype. Cappuccino developers never need to directly manipulate the DOM or design CSS documents. Instead, those tasks are handled by Cappuccino, permitting the application developer to focus on the implementation of application features without being distracted by specifics of the rendering mechanism. Cappuccino, being compiled directly in the web browser, is agnostic of the server-side logic. As such, Python, PHP or Ruby, for instance, may be used for the back-end logic of an application. Compatibility Cappuccino is compatible with many of the latest browsers, including: Internet Explorer 7+, Firefox 2+, Safari 3+, Opera 9+, and Google Chrome. Differences from other frameworks Cappuccino differs from other frameworks as it provides a complete abstraction from the DOM (Document Object Model), whereas other frameworks and libraries rely on the user understanding the DOM, and traditional web technologies. Cappuccino doesn't require previous knowledge about web technologies. Cappuccino implements the latest HTML5 features, abstracted through a Cocoa-like API. Views are manipulated using an API that doesn't require CSS or DOM manipulation. Applications The first widely known web application written in Objective-J/Cappuccino was 280 Slides, an online presentation preparation system. 280 Slides features the ability to import existing documents, an autosave recovery, is able to save documents as Microsoft PowerPoint, PDF, and OpenDocument formats, and has a wide range of themes. Since then, numerous other applications have been built on the Cappuccino framework. Notable examples include Mockingbird, a collaborative online wireframing tool, PicsEngine, a personal photo library on the web, GitHub issues, a front-end to GitHub's issues tracker, Spot Specific Apps a la Carte, an online mobile app authoring tool, Archipel, a XMPP orchestrator to manage virtualization, Akshell, a cloud-based JavaScript development platform, and R.W. Elephant, a cloud based inventory management system for rental businesses.

Hardison (1960). Double-mass curves. U.S. Geological Survey Water-Supply Paper 1541-B' is a commonly used data analysis approach for investigating the behaviour of records made of hydrological or meteorological data at a number of locations. It is used to determine whether there is a need for corrections to the data - to account for changes in data collection procedures or other local conditions. Such changes may result from a variety of things including changes in instrumentation, changes in observation procedures, or changes in gauge location or surrounding conditions. Double mass analysis for checking consistency of a hydrological or meteorological record is considered to be an essential tool before taking it for analysis purpose. This method is based on the hypothesis that each item of the recorded data of a population is consistent. An example of a double mass analysis is a \\"double mass plot\\", or \\"double mass curve\\".Wilson, E.M. (1983) Engineering Hydrology, 3rd edition. Macmillan Press, London. p.27 For this, points and/or a joining line are plotted where the x- and y- coordinates are determined by the running totals of the values observed at two stations. If both stations are affected to the same extent by the same trends then a double mass curve should follow a straight line. A break in the slope of the curve would indicate that conditions have changed at one location but not at another. This technique is based on the principle that when each recorded data comes from the same parent population, they are consistent. See also *Statistics Notes Further reading * Dubreuil P.

It was published by Walker Books on 5 May 2008. It is the first book in the Chaos Walking series, followed by The Ask and the Answer and Monsters of Men. The story follows Todd Hewitt, a 12-year-old boy who runs away from Prentisstown, a town where everyone can hear everyone else's thoughts, after learning of a secret about its past. The novel was celebrated by critics, and won annual awards including the Booktrust Teenage Prize, the Guardian Award, and the James Tiptree, Jr. Award. The Knife was Ness's first work for teens and young adults. According to The Guardian coverage of its award, 'He turned to children's fiction after he had the idea for a world where it is impossible to escape information overload, and knew it was right for teenagers.' Plot summary Todd Hewitt is the only boy left in Prentisstown, a small settlement on 'New World' – an alien planet only recently colonized by humanity. Todd is within days of his thirteenth birthday, the age in Prentisstown at which all boys 'become men'. Todd has been told that all the women and nearly all the men on New World were killed in a war with the Spackle that occurred around the time of his birth. The Spackle are New World's native inhabitants and are blamed for the release of the 'germ' that caused the majority of deaths and was particularly fatal to women. The inhabitants of Prentisstown claim that every Spackle was wiped out during the war and Todd has no reason to believe otherwise. As a side effect of the virus, the remaining men in Prentisstown can hear each other's (and animals') thoughts, described as an ever-present cascade of 'Noise'. The men of Prentisstown make up the last surviving settlement on New World - at least according to Mayor Prentiss, after whom the town is named. At the beginning of the book, Todd and his dog, Manchee, discover a lone patch of silence (a 'hole in the Noise') in a local swamp. Bewildered, Todd and Manchee make their way back into town. When Todd explains the silence to Ben and Cillian, his adoptive parents, his Noise accidentally projects the discovery to the entire town. Ben and Cillian suddenly reveal they have been planning Todd's escape from Prentisstown for his entire life. The two men immediately force him to leave Prentisstown, with just a satchel of supplies and Manchee to accompany him. Todd unwillingly obeys. Cillian fights off Davy Prentiss (the Mayor's son) and other men from the town, while Ben gives Todd his own hunting knife and Todd's deceased mother's diary. Todd escapes into the swamp with Manchee, and discovers a girl, who lacks Noise. She is the first girl Todd has ever seen, except in videos and photographs. The girl says nothing at all. Todd, Manchee and the girl are suddenly attacked by the town preacher, Aaron, who has recently been provoking Todd in physical and mental fights. Todd and Manchee force him into the swamp's lake, where he is attacked by crocodiles. The girl silently leads Todd through the swamp to her scout ship, where her parents' bodies lie dead. She has crash-landed on New World, Todd realizes. With aid from a map inside Todd's mother's diary, the three begin traveling together towards Farbranch, a settlement marked on the map. Todd hopes that the settlement still exists and that, if so, it can protect them from Prentisstown. Todd realises that he, infected with the germ, might transmit the germ to the girl and kill her. She hears this in his Noise and flees, but he pursues her along with Manchee until they both encounter Aaron and Prentisstown men who are tracking them at a bridge. The girl manages to save the three by soaking part of the bridge in lighter fluid and setting it on fire with her campfire pack. After this incident, she works up the courage to speak and finally tells Todd her name: Viola. Todd and Viola are found by a woman, Hildy, at the nearest town, Farbranch. She tells Todd that the Noise germ is in fact not fatal for women and does not affect them at all - none of the women have Noise. She takes the three to her settlement. At nightfall, an army of men from Prentisstown arrives and burns down the town, killing all those who will not join them. Todd, Viola, and Manchee escape and flee for Haven, where it is rumoured there may be a cure for Noise. They also hope to find a transmitter tower to contact Viola's people, who are a second wave of planetary settlers, to warn them. After a few days on the road, Davy finds them. Viola manages to electrocute Davy, and Todd moves to kill him, but finds himself unable to kill. Instead, Todd ties Davy up before heading off for Haven with Viola. During the trip, Todd, Viola and Manchee find a live Spackle. Todd is shocked, believing that all Spackle had been killed in the war. Worried at an attack and frustrated with his 'cowardice' of keeping Davy alive, Todd leaps at the Spackle and kills it, but faces instant regret. Aaron appears, stabbing Todd, and kidnaps Viola. Todd wakes and hurriedly pursues Aaron, but as his stab wound becomes infected he quickly weakens. Todd finds Viola and Aaron, using Manchee as a distraction while he rescues Viola. When the plan is unsuccessful, Todd and Viola manage to get away but are compelled to leave Manchee behind with Aaron, who kills the dog in a fit of rage. The pair flee on a boat, and Todd passes out from his wounds. Todd wakes up under a care of a doctor in another settlement. Insisting on a walk, he encounters Ben hiding in the outskirts of town. He reveals that Cillian died in Todd's escape from Prentisstown. The people of the new town label Ben as a murderer due to his Prentisstown origins. However, Ben and Todd convince the townsfolk to help them fight the approaching Prentisstown army. As the army approaches, Ben, Todd, and Viola use the confusion to escape. After gaining some distance, Ben explains the truth: the Noise germ is a natural contagion of the planet, not an attack by the Spackle. The men of Prentisstown, driven mad by Noise and resenting the women's ability to remain silent, killed all the women and were subsequently banished from the rest of New World for their crimes. The boys were supposed to learn a 'version of the truth' from the Mayor on their thirteenth birthday. This is why Todd has been sent away prior to his 'becoming a man' - he could only be accepted by the rest of the world if his thoughts were wholly innocent. Ben, Todd, and Viola continue toward Haven, but Davy finds them again. Ben distracts him to allow Todd and Viola to run, but then the two are cornered by the deranged Aaron in a cavern near a waterfall by Haven. Todd suddenly realizes that the boys of Prentisstown become 'men' by killing someone upon turning thirteen. Aaron thinks of himself as a symbolic sacrifice for the 'last boy' in Prentisstown and tries to provoke Todd into killing him. Attempting to stop Aaron from succeeding, Viola grabs the knife and stabs Aaron in the neck. He falls into the waterfall and dies. Davy again intercepts the pair on their way to Haven, shooting Viola. Todd subdues Davy, escapes, and carries a dying Viola to Haven to get help. However, Mayor Prentiss is already there to greet them. After Haven surrendered without a fight, the Mayor declares himself President of New World. Through his despair, Todd realizes that he can not hear the Mayor's Noise. With no other choice, Todd surrenders to the Mayor to save Viola. Setting The Knife of Never Letting Go is a town that has been taken over by a small group of Christian settlers from 'Old World', in a town nearby a swamp. Although the settlers have some high technology, they are mostly subsistence farmers. The rural setting has been compared to the worlds of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Night of the Hunter.\\"The Knife of Never Letting Go\\" (review). Frank Cottrell Boyce. The Guardian 13 June 2008. Retrieved 2009-06-02. Reception The Knife of Never Letting Go has received greatly positive reviews. Ian Chipman from Booklist gave the novel a starred review, praising the 'pure inventiveness and excitement' of Ness' narrative, and supporting the book's characters, adding that 'the cliffhanger ending is as effective as a shot to the gut'. Frank Cottrell-Boyce, writing for The Guardian, praised the novel's opening, and added that the rest of the book 'lives up to the thrill of that first sentence'. The Sunday Telegraph also praised the book, describing it as 'furiously paced, terrifying, exhilarating and heartbreaking' and calling it a book that 'haunts your imagination'. The Times called it 'a stunning debut\\" and \\"as compelling as it is original'. Similarly, Nicholas Tucker of The Independent wrote that The Knife of Never Letting Go 'sets a high standard', while the Chicago Tribune labelled the novel as 'a read-alone, stay-up-way- too-late book'.

The preserve Japanese government documents and historical records and make them available to the public. Although Japan's reverence for its unique history and art is well documented and illustrated by collections of art and documents, there is almost no archivist tradition. Before the creation of the National Archives, there was a scarcity of available public documents which preserve \\"grey-area\\" records, such as internal sources to show a process which informs the formation of a specific policy or the proceedings of various committee meetings.Nakayama, Shigeru et al.

Preservation, restoration cataloging, microfilming and digitization are all important aspects of the archive's responsibilities. Functions of the National Archives of Japan. However, the National Archives is in the process of becoming something more than simply a historical repository, because it is also a complex of structures, processes, and epistemologies which are situated at a critical point of the intersection between scholarship, cultural practices, politics, and technologies.Blouin, Francis X. et al. (2006). Archives, Documentation, and Institutions of Social Memory: Essays from the Sawyer Seminar, p. vii. History Since the Meiji Period (1868–1912), administrative documents had been preserved respectively by each government ministry. A library for the cabinet of the early Meiji government was established in 1873; and in 1885, this became the Cabinet Library (Naikaku Bunko), which evolved as the nation's leading specialized library of ancient Japanese and Chinese classical books and materials. The Cabinet Library's collection included government records of the Edo period and the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1867) and other material. These collections are an important element of the archive's core holdings. In November 1959, the President of the Science Council of Japan issued a recommendation establishing a National Archives to prevent scattering and loss of official documents and to facilitate public access. In July 1971, the newly created Archives began receiving, assessing, and cataloging government documents and records of importance as historical materials; and also, the Archives focused on the conceptually distinct program designed to encourage wider interest by mounting exhibitions and fostering research. In July 1998, the Tsukuba Annex (Tsukuba Gakuen Toshiwas) was established in Ibaraki Prefecture in order to expand and improve the storage of archival materials. A Cabinet resolution in 1999 led to the creation of the , which opened in November 2001. The center digitizes data from various national institutions, such as the National Archives, Diplomatic Record Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Military Archives of the National Institute for Defense Studies of the Japan Defense Agency, and provides the digital data through the Internet. Independent Administrative Institution The National Archives became an Independent Administrative Institution on April 1, 2001, when an Act amending part of the National Archives Law came into effect. Archival responsibilities include managing public access to stored records, Law Concerning Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs and overseeing the collection as it grows and develops Management of Necessary Measures for Proper Preservation of Government Documents and Records of Importance as Historical Materials. and preservation protocols. Implementation of Necessary Measures for Proper Preservation of Government Documents and Records of Importance as Historical Materials. The enhanced independence of the archives was designed to help further its institutional focus on measures for the proper conservation of historical materials. Necessary Measures for Proper Preservation of Government Documents and Records of Importance as Historical Materials. On-line access The National Archives website provides information about the archives and catalog data which allow the holdings to be searched online. The site offers English and Japanese versions, the holdings themselves are, of course, mainly in Japanese. The website facilitates access to brief descriptions and some images of documents, books, and cultural properties. The Digital Gallery may be searched using keywords or various categories, opening access to digitised images of scrolls; maps; photographs; drawings; posters; and documents. English summaries of publications from the National Archives (journal and annual report) are available for downloading from the site.Intute: National Archives of Japan. From April 2005, the digital archive system in this website has provided high-resolution pictures of a range of holdings, including the materials designated as Important Cultural Properties of Japan. Mitsuoki Kikuchi, Greetings from the President. The collections in the National Archives provide tangible evidence of memory for individuals, communities, and the state; and the archives are integral in a process of defining memory institutionally within Japan's prevailing political systems and cultural norms. The National Archives has evolved as a model for developing prefectural and municipal archival collections—some of which predate the establishment of the national institution. In these smaller institutions, similar activities of preservation, restoration, cataloging, microfilming and digitization are evolving.Prefectural and municipal archives. For example, the Digital Gallery includes digitized photos of the stack room for official documents in Shiga Prefecture in 1924. These images were appended to a report submitted by the prefectural governor to the chief of the cabinet secretariat in November of that year. Shiga's governor was describing the progress of work intended to modernize standards and procedures for compiling and storing of written records, which was expected to produce improved efficiencies in administrative services.Digital Gallery: Photos of the stack room for documents and records in Shiga Prefecture, descriptive comment.

Fed by three 36 mm flat slide carburettors, the engine was lively and could cope easily with all riding styles. The swinging arm was upgraded to an oval section in 1996; in 1997 chromed plastic radiator end covers and grill were provided as standard along with chromed engine cases.

The earlier Mikuni carburettors initially suffered from premature needle and jet wear in its first year of release; this was rectified with a factory recall soon after. All later Thunderbirds with the speedometer and Keihin carburettors should have six speed gearboxes fitted along with chrome engine cases.

Its syntax is nearly identical to the Objective-C syntax and it shares with JavaScript the same relationship that Objective-C has with the C programming language: that of being a strict, but small, superset; adding traditional inheritance and Smalltalk/Objective-C style dynamic dispatch. Pure JavaScript, being a prototype-based language, already has a notion of object orientation and inheritance, but Objective-J adds the use of class-based programming to JavaScript. Programs written in Objective-J need to be preprocessed before being run by a web browser's JavaScript virtual machine. This step can occur in the web browser at runtime or by a compiler which translates Objective-J programs into pure JavaScript code. The Objective-J compiler is written in JavaScript; consequently, deploying Objective-J programs does not require a web browser plug-in. Objective-J can be compiled and run on Node.js.  Applications  The first widely known use of Objective-J was in the Cappuccino-based web application 280 Slides, which was developed by 280 North itself. Even though Objective-J can be used (and has been designed) independently from the Cappuccino framework, Objective-J has primarily been invented to support web development in Cappuccino.  Applications designed using the Cappuccino Framework  * RW Elephant * Mockingbird * GithubIssues * Enstore (until October 2013, they rewrote it using Ember http://blog.acclivitynyc.com/post/64981755172/dumped-cappuccino- and-switched-to-ember)  Syntax  Objective-J is a superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid Objective-J code. The following example shows the definition and implementation in Objective-J of a class named Address; this class extends the root object CPObject, which plays a role similar to the Objective-C's NSObject. This example differs from traditional Objective-C in that the root object reflects the underlying Cappuccino framework as opposed to Cocoa, Objective-J does not use pointers and, as such, type definitions do not contain asterisk characters. Instance variables are always defined in the @implementation. @implementation Address : CPObject { CPString name; CPString city; }  (id)initWithName:(CPString)aName city:(CPString)aCity { self = [super init]; name = aName; city = aCity; return self; }  (void)setName:(CPString)aName { name = aName; }  (CPString)name { return name; } \\\\+ (id)newAddressWithName:(CPString)aName city:(CPString)aCity { return self alloc] initWithName:aName city:aCity]; } @end As with Objective-C, class method definitions and instance method definitions start with '+' (plus) and '-' (dash), respectively.  Memory management  Objective-C uses ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) for deallocating unused objects. In Objective-J, objects are automatically deallocated by JavaScript's Garbage Collector.

He taught from 1921 at the new New Vienna Conservatory and later at the Budapest Academy of Music. In 1939 he emigrated to the United States, where he soon found employment in the music department of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (M-G-M). He composed (anonymously) music for a number of film scores, but regarded his movie work as merely supportive of his own creative activity. For this reason he preferred to work at home on the orchestration of other composers' music. The most notable collaboration was with his fellow Hungarian Miklós Rózsa, with whom he worked until 1961. He also wrote a number of operas in which the characterization and orchestration are worthy of note, and orchestral pieces in a style that owed something to Reger and Richard Strauss, including the popular Hungarian Caprice (1935) and concertos for such instruments as the cimbalom (1969) and accordion (1971). Zádor was married to Maria Steiner in Geneva during 1946 and had a son, Leslie, and a daughter, Peggy.https://eugenezador.com/about/ Although his operas are said to be strongly characterized and skillfully orchestrated, his compositional style remained within the late romantic language of Richard Strauss and Max Reger (he claimed to occupy a position \\"exactly between La Traviata and Lulu)\\".

It is closely related to the Anuta language of the neighboring island of Anuta. Tikopian is also spoken by the Polynesian minority on Vanikoro, who long ago migrated from Tikopia. Introduction History Because of its remote and isolated location, Tikopia had few contacts with outside groups until well into the twentieth century. Tikopians occasionally visited other islands, but these trips were limited by the large distances and great hazards involved in canoe ocean voyages. Contacts by Westerners began sporadically around the beginning of the nineteenth century, but in 1927, when Firth did his initial fieldwork in Tikopia, the indigenous culture was largely intact. The major contact agents were, first, missionaries and, later, labor recruiters. By the 1950s, all the Tikopians had become Christianized, and most of the native ritual practices had ceased. Much of the Tikopian life style has remained intact, but the forces of Westernization have been making inroads throughout the twentieth century (Lagace, 1974). Population Tikopia is a small remote volcanic island that has a population of 1,200 people. It is the southwest of the Solomon Islands. There are about seventy-five different languages that are spoken on the Solomon Islands. Out of these languages seventy-one are living and four are extinct. Out of the living languages five are institutional, twenty-four are developing, twenty-six are vigorous, eight are in trouble, and eight are dying. Linguists refer this language as a Samoic or a Polynesian Outlier language. Polynesian Outlier languages are a number of Polynesian societies that lie outside the main region of the Polynesian Triangle. Some linguists also believe that Tikopia and Anuta are the dialects of the same language. There are approximately 3320 speakers that speak the Tikopian language. The Tikopian language, Tikopia-Anuta, is part of the Austronesian language family (Firth, 1985). Phonology Consonants There are twelve consonant phonemes that this language uses. They use the letters /f, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, ng/ and the glottal stop (Firth, 1985). There have been debates from different linguists on whether or not Tikopia uses l or r. Elbert claims that Tikopia is a language that uses l but not r and he strongly believes this because he believed Tikopia was a colony of Samoa. Raymond Firth said, “Dumont DʻUrville published a small dictionary in 1834 where 235 words were collected.” R was the most dominant in that dictionary because it appeared in 50 words while l appeared in only 15. The language changed in over a century and modernly more words are used with l. Raymond Firths own work shows that both l and r phonemes are used. Not too many words use the letter l and are actually rarely heard in native speakers (Firth, 1963). Vowels The vowel phonemes of this language are basic. They use /a, e, i, o, u/. The vowel length is similar to the consonant lengths. Linguists do not interpret long vowels in writing so they use shortcuts like macrons (a line over the vowel indicating a longer length), but in Tikopia writing they use two identical juxtaposed vowels. According to the Tikopia dictionary, “This has typographical simplicity, but may present a problem of interpretation as to where long vowel and rearticulation actually occur. Grammar Basic Word Order The basic word order in Tikopia is Subject-Verb-Object, but sometimes they use the Verb-Subject-Object Typology (Firth, 1985). Reduplication Tikopia uses partial reduplication and it usually intensifies a verb to make it plural (Firth, 1985). The suffix “nofo” is added to a verb and it makes the verb that is being acted upon by a subject plural, so it is acted upon by subjects. Vocabulary Loanwords Throughout the history of the Tikopian language they made contact with the outside world. During these times, there is a high chance that many words from other languages were borrowed and used in the language known as “loanwords”. Some of these words are known as native to Tikopia, but the main sources of the borrowing words are from Anuta, Mota, Hawaiian, and most definitely English. Words derived from English: *Pakutini- “Pumpkin” *Atamole- “Watermelon” *Rais- “Rice” *Pīni- “Beans” *Poi- “Tinned Meat” *Piksha- “Picture” *Kastom- “Custom” *Leta- “Letter” Endangerment Materials Most of the recorded documents on this language come from the linguist Raymond Firth. Tikopia did not have much documented until the twentieth century where Firth spent three trips to Tikopia. In 1928 Firth spent a whole year on his first time to Tikopia; he revisited in 1952 for five more months and again in 1966. Only one person had recorded documents before Firth in 1910, Reverend W. J. Durrad, and he stayed for a duration of 2 months. With this valuable documentation, Raymond Firth was able to create a dictionary for the Tikopian language, Taranga Fakatikopia Ma Taranga Fakainglisi. They also have a bible, limited YouTube videos and some song books. Vitality Tikopia is spoken throughout the Solomon Islands and is very well documented. Raymond Firth spent a lot of his time making sure that Tikopia did not fall close to being extinct. He created the dictionary with all his information and it was highly useful. With his help Tikopia is nowhere near being extinct, therefore, according to ethnologue, Tikiopia is categorized as a developing language. Further reading *Firth Raymond (1963).

It was included in order to put it together with his two other football-inspired works (he has since written another: see Acts of Beauty • Exit no Exit).

Design & development The Patrician was a high-wing, strut-braced monoplane following the then-standard trimotor layout, and was intended to be the largest and fastest aircraft of its type.Air Classics The fuselage was constructed from a chromoly tube framework with aluminum longerons and bulkheads, all skinned in fabric. The inner wings were built from steel-truss spars and metal ribs and fabric-covered, while the outer wings of wooden construction. The flight test program included a much-publicized return flight across the United States and in another stunt, a successful attempt at a load-carrying record was set by lifting a 4,600 lb (2,090 kg) \\"payload\\" of \\"33 girls, two pilots, and a mechanic\\" to 10,200 ft (3,110 m) in 25 minutes.Aerofiles Colonial Air Transport then flew the prototype (registered NX7962) on charter operations between New York City and Boston while a definitive version for the airlines was developed under the designation K-78D. This featured 18 seats, a lavatory, and a separate baggage compartment. The first of these machines (NC98N) was purchased by Wright Aeronautical Corporation for use as an engine testbed, but also as an executive transport. In keeping with this latter role, a deluxe interior was fitted in place of the passenger compartment, which included an office and sleeping berths. The second aircraft (NC10N) was selected for evaluation by Transcontinental Air Transport for use on a cross-United States route. TAT's technical committee, under the leadership of Charles Lindbergh, selected the Patrician over five other aircraft: the Curtiss Condor, Boeing 80A, Ford Trimotor, Fokker F.10, and a Sikorsky biplane . Lindbergh himself flew the Patrician to various stops across the United States to research routes and provide an opportunity for TAT to generate publicity for the planned service. One of these stops turned into a fiasco when the Patrician became bogged in mud while landing at Mills Field, San Francisco, requiring the various dignitaries aboard to be unloaded while the aircraft was dug out. Certification was obtained on 30 October 1929,ATC 260 but before the initial intended batch of ten Patricians could be produced, the Great Depression made itself felt, and the market disappeared. Keystone reduced the asking price from $90,000 to $65,000, but still found no buyers, and the three prototypes were the only Patricians ever built.

It is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History Liverpool Prison (originally known as Walton Gaol) was constructed between 1848 and 1855 to the designs of John Weightman borough surveyor (not to be confused with his near contemporary John Grey Weightman ) to replace an 18th-century establishment in the centre of Liverpool, which had become too small for current needs. It originally housed male and female inmates. On 4 February 1939 the IRA attempted, but failed, to break a wall of the prison during the S-Plan bombing campaign in Britain that year. During the Liverpool Blitz of World War II, on 18 September 1940, German high explosive bombs falling on a wing of the prison partially demolished it, killing 22 inmates. The body of one was not found until 11 years later when rubble was finally cleared. The prison was the site of 62 judicial executions, from 1887 to 1964. The last execution at the prison was that of Peter Anthony Allen. He and his accomplice Gwynne Owen Evans were convicted for the murder of John Alan West in April 1964. They were simultaneously hanged on 13 August 1964; Allen was hanged at Walton Gaol, and Evans at Strangeways in Manchester.Walton prison, Liverpool. capitalpunishmentuk.org. In May 2003 an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons severely criticised Liverpool Prison for its overcrowding and poor industrial relations which had led to an unacceptable regime. The inspection found that parts of the jail were generally unclean, had cockroach infestations and broken windows. Inmates were able to shower and change their clothes just once a week at the prison. A further inspection report in February 2010, stated that drugs, bullying and violence were still prevalent at Liverpool Prison, despite the jail improving in other areas. Days later, it emerged that the Prison Service had refunded nearly £10,000 to inmates at HMP Liverpool, who were being overcharged for watching television in their cells. The prison was charging £1 per prisoner per week instead of per cell, meaning that inmates who were sharing a cell were paying more than they needed to. In January 2015, three prison officers were hospitalised after being attacked by prisoners. The prison today HM Prison Liverpool is a local prison for remand and sentenced adult males in the Merseyside area. The prison has eight wings, all of which have been refurbished to include integral sanitation. As of May 2009, its population was 1,184, one of the largest in the UK, but smaller than a peak population of 1,443 in 2008. Liverpool Prison offers education and training courses, provided by Novus as well as workshops and programmes organised by the prison's Psychology Department. The establishment houses a hugely successful in cell radio programme 'Walton Radio', offering prisoners radio production qualifications, music technology qualifications, along with emphases on rehabilitation through employability upskilling. A Listener Scheme, supported by the Samaritans, operates for prisoners who are at risk from suicide or self-harm. There is a resettlement unit at HMP Liverpool which comprises a Citizens' Advice Unit, Connexions, Shelter and Job Centre Plus. All healthcare services at Liverpool Prison are commissioned through Liverpool Primary Care Trust. A new all-purpose 28-bed inpatient and primary care service was opened in summer 2007. In October 2017 Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust announced that they were to end their contract to provide healthcare services by April 2018, with a new provider to be arranged in the near future. In October 2017, the prison's governor, Peter Francis, was dismissed from his role for 'operational reasons' after a snap inspection by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons.What is going on at Walton prison?

The windows of both the cell and the toilet recess were broken, the light fitting in his toilet was broken with wires exposed, the lavatory was filthy and appeared to be blocked, his sink was leaking and the cell was dark and damp. Extraordinarily, this man had apparently been held in this condition for some weeks.” Clarke also wrote, “We saw clear evidence that local prison managers had sought help from regional and national management to improve conditions they knew to be unacceptable long before our arrival, but had met with little response.”Conditions at Liverpool prison the worst ever inspected, says report The Guardian Local MP Dan Carden called the situation in the prison a \\"state failure of the highest magnitude\\".

The area encompasses 1260 hectares and straddles across five wards of the city of Saitama (Kita-ku, Ōmiya-ku, Minuma-ku, Urawa-ku, and Midori-ku). Despite its close proximity to major urban areas such as Saitama-Shintoshin Station and Ōmiya Station, idyllic scenery consisting of paddy fields, farmlands, forests and rivers still remains. Geography The area stands on the Shiba River Lowland, which is located inside of the Ōmiya Plateau in the central Kantō plain. The Shiba River and Katayagawa River constitute the region's major stream system. History From the Jōmon to the early Edo period, the high sea level associated with the Holocene climatic optimum linked the region with Tokyo Bay and nearly two-thirds of the area occupied by the former city of Urawa was under water. This is supported by many middens found in the region which date back to the early Jōmon period. Subsequently, as the climate cooled down, the retracting shoreline left the region a countless number of marshlands and wetlands, resulting in the creation of Minuma. Between the early Edo Period and the mid-Edo period, the area was converted into a reservoir by for irrigation. In 1629, the project began with constructing a levee between current Tsukishima in Saitama and Kizoro in the city of Kawaguchi. The structure was called , literally meaning eight chō levee, since the length of the levee was approximately eight chō (870 meters). The reservoir mounted to cover roughly 1200 hectares with the average depth of one meter. The mid-Edo period to the Post-war period marked the time span during which the area was actively utilized for agriculture by draining the reservoir. In 1727, the reservoir levee was demolished and rice paddies were constructed on the reclaimed site. To ensure continual access to irrigational water in the region, an irrigation canal system supplied by the Tone River was introduced. Canals were dug roughly in a north-south direction along the two plateaus that sandwich the region.

Life He was the son of Christopher Lister, of Midhope, Yorkshire. He entered Douai College, in 1576. Having occasion to return to England, he was seized and imprisoned. He, however, obtained his release, and in 1579 was received into the English College, Rome. There, three years later, he joined the Society of Jesus in February, 1582-3. He graduated in Divinity at Pont-à-Mousson in 1592. In 1596 he went on to the English mission, but was arrested in 1598 and endured a long incarceration. Lister seems to have resided continuously in England. His death probably occurred shortly before 1628. Works Difficulties had broken out among the English Catholic clergy, the so-called archpriest controversy, amounting to the refusal of certain among them to recognize the authority of the newly appointed archpriest, Dr. George Blackwell. Lister was at this point consulted by one of the priests as to the conduct of those who refused obedience. His reply took the form of a small treatise entitled Adversus factiosos in ecclesia, in which their conduct was vigorously censured. They are declared to have ipso facto have fallen into schism, and to have incurred excommunication and irregularity. It is doubtful whether this tractate was published; but it was widely circulated in manuscript, and proved divisive. To the request of the clergy that he would prohibit it, Blackwell replied curtly (April, 1957): :\\"Your request is that we should call in the treatise against your schism; and this is unreasonable, because the medicine ought not to be removed until the sore be thoroughly cured. If it grieve you, I am not grieved thereat.\\" His conduct in regard to Lister's tract formed the first of the six grounds on which was based the \\"Appeal of thirty-three clergymen\\", against his administration. The appellants obtained a favourable hearing at Rome. Lister's tract was suppressed by papal Brief (May 1601), and Blackwell rebuked for his unreasonable conduct. The treatise Adversus factiosos was incorporated into Christopher Bagshaw's Relatio compendium turbarum; a portion of it was reprinted in Thomas Graves Law, Historical Sketch of Conflicts between Jesuits and Seculars in the Reign of Elizabeth (London, 1889), appendix D.

Professional life Invention of the sugar- cutting process Jakob Christof Rad is credited with the invention of sugar cubes The idea to produce sugar in cube form came from his wife, who cut herself while paring down the standard large, commercial sugar loaf into smaller parts for use in the home. Rad had become involved with management of a sugar factory in 1840 (in Datschitz, present day Dačice, in Moravia, a part of the Habsburg empire). He began work on a machine for transforming sugar into cube form, leading to a five-year patent for the cube press he invented, granted on 23 January 1843.

The church is Grade I listed by the Department for Culture, Media & Sport as a building of outstanding architectural or historic interest. History The church is medieval and was restored in 1906 and 1907. It is recorded by Dr. Thoroton that a flood which occurred about 1600 the River Trent changed its course, and separated the parish of North Muskham from the hamlet of Holme. At about the same time, Sir Thomas Barton, the descendant of a wealthy merchant, owned a large house and a great amount of property at Holme, and North Muskham Church benefited from his wealth. The Barton family coat of arms with impalements and rebus (a bear and a tun), is displayed in various places in the church. Description The oldest parts of the church are the lower part of the tower and the north arcade, the piers of which are octagonal and may be the earliest of this type in the county. The piers of the south arcade are Perpendicular and are similar to those of St Mary's, Nottingham. The nave has a clerestory and is covered by a contemporary timber roof. The chancel is impressive and has a five light east window.

It changed its name to the Indianapolis, Pittsburgh and Cleveland Railroad in 1854. Its counterpart in Ohio was named the Bellefontaine and Indiana Railroad (B&I;). The B&I; ceased to exist as an independent company when it merged into the Bellefontaine Railway in September 1864. The IP&C; merged into the Bellefontaine Railway in December 1864. I&B; history The I&B; was incorporated in the U.S. state of Indiana on February 17, 1848. Though the I&B; once used the Ohio gauge, it was quickly converted to standard gauge (). Its counterpart, the B&I; was chartered on February 25, 1848, in the U.S. state of Ohio. A construction firm owned by Amasa Stone, Frederick Harbach, and Stillman Witt contracted to build the Ohio line. Construction began in 1849 in Indiana, and the portion of the line from Indianapolis to the Indiana-Ohio border (the I&B;) was largely complete by 1851. Construction from the border east to Cleveland (the B&I;) began in 1852, and the line was complete in July 1853. The Indianapolis & Bellefontaine changed its name to the Indianapolis, Pittsburgh and Cleveland Railroad (IP&C;) on December 19, 1854. On March 14, 1856, the B&I; entered into a joint operating agreement with the IP&C.; John Brough, a newspaper publisher and president of the Madison and Indianapolis Railroad, was elected the B&I;'s president in 1862. Stillman Witt, one of the directors of the B&I;, urged Brough to run for Governor of Ohio in 1864. Knowing that Brough could not afford the large reduction in pay, Witt agreed to become president of the B&I; and forward his salary to Brough. Brough agreed, and Brough continued to receive the income from Witt until Brough's death on August 29, 1865. On September 27, 1864, the B&I; and the IPCR merged to form the Bellefontaine Railway. Just three months later, on December 22, the Bellefontaine Railway absorbed the I&B;, retaining the Bellefontaine Railway name. On May 16, 1868, the Bellefontaine Railway was purchased by the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railway. Involvement in the Union Track Railway On May 31, 1850, the I&B; co-founded the Union Track Railway Company with the Madison and Indianapolis Railroad and the Terre Haute and Richmond Railroad. The Union Track changed its name to the Indianapolis Union Railway (IUR) in 1853. The IUR opened the world's first union station in Indianapolis, Indiana, on September 20, 1853. The three parent companies formally entered into a controlling agreement for the IU on November 19, 1872. The company was incorporated on March 25, 1885. Route description The I&B;'s main line runs from the IU tracks east of Union Station northeast to Lawrence, Pendleton, and Anderson. Just west of Muncie, it turns to the east to pass through that city, then continues on through Winchester before reaching the Ohio state line at Union City, Indiana. Continuing eastward from Union City, Ohio, it passes through Versailles and Sidney before reaching its other namesake, Bellefontaine. This Indianapolis-Bellefontaine main line remains an important rail corridor into the early 21st Century, where it is now owned and operated by CSX Transportation.

Development The Nord 1402 Gerfaut series had their origin in a state-sponsored study into delta and swept wings. To provide data for these studies Arsenal de l'Aéronautique (SFECMAS's nationalised predecessor) designed and built two supersonic gliders; the Arsenal 1301 and Arsenal 2301 with delta and swept surfaces respectively. Towed to the release point by SNCAC Martinet, Douglas DC-3 or SNCASE Languedoc transport aircraft, these gliders provided valuable data for the design of the Gerfaut. To utilise this data SFECMAS engineers initiated the 1400,1500 and 1910 interceptor projects with delta wings and different propulsion systems. The 1400 developed into the Gerfaut series,the 1500 became the Nord Griffon, while the 1910, ambitiously specified with two large ramjet engines, was never pursued. Different versions of the Arsenal / SFECMAS 1400 were studied as the:- * Arsenal 1401 powered by a combined ramjet / turbojet powerplant and high-set wings. * Arsenal 1402 powered by a ramjet with auxiliary Turboméca turbojet, and middle-set wings. * Arsenal 1403 powered by a combined ramjet / turbojet powerplant and middle-set wings. * Arsenal 1404 powered by a combined ramjet / turbojet powerplant and low-set wings. * Arsenal 1405 powered by an ATAR 101 turbojet powerplant and low-set wings. By the time that construction of prototypes started, the interceptor requirement had overtaken the Gerfaut so the aircraft was designed as a research aircraft. History The Nord 1402A Gerfaut first flew on 15 January 1954 as a single-seat single-engined monoplane with thin delta wings and swept vertical tail surfaces and a small high-set delta tailplane. The fuselage was a cylindrical monocoque structure with a nose intake and with the cockpit mounted above it, giving the aircraft its characteristic hump-backed look. It had a retractable tricycle landing gear and was originally powered by an internal 2800 kg (6,173 lb ) thrust ATAR 101C turbojet. On 3 August 1954 it became the first aircraft in Europe to exceed Mach 1 in level flight without afterburners. The second aircraft was the Nord 1402B Gerfaut 1B which had a larger wings and an Atar 101D engine. The third aircraft, the Nord 1405 Gerfaut II, first flown in 1956 was similar but had a refined structure, a clipped delta wing and an ATAR 101F engine. After it had finished test flying the third aircraft was used to test air intercept radars.

Hawkins went to Albany, New York, and volunteered the services of a company of New York Zouaves to the state. The governor of New York accepted the offer of the company, and also granted the authorization to Hawkins to raise a regiment of Zouaves. With this authorization in hand he returned to New York City and opened a recruiting office which soon had drawn over 2,000 volunteers, this large number of recruits quickly outgrew the size of the recruiting office. In early April the regiment moved to its new quarters at Castle Garden in New York City, where on April 23 and 27 the ten companies of the regiment were mustered into state service. After finishing their organization, the regiment was mustered into United States service on May 4, 1861, at Castle Garden by Captain S.B. Hayman of the 7th United States Infantry Regiment. On May 13 the regiment was officially numbered as the Ninth Infantry Regiment of New York Volunteers, by the War Department and New York Adjutant General's office. On May 15 the regiment boarded a barge that was towed by the steamer “Young America” and moved from Castle Garden to its new camp on Riker’s Island. This camp was designated as Camp Hawkins and the men arrived at the camp around 10 o’clock. It was here that they completed their training and were outfitted with their uniforms, arms, and equipment. On June 5 the regiment moved from Camp Hawkins and boarded two steamships which took them to the foot of Thirtieth Street along the East River, where they disembarked and marched up 34th Street to Fifth Avenue, proceeding to the home of Mrs. A.W. Griswold where they were presented the national colors. They then moved to the home of Mrs. W.D. Moffatt where they were presented their regimental colors. After these presentations the Regiment marched down the Avenue onto Broadway and down to Pier Four on the North River. Here the Regiment began boarding the steamer “Marion,” however it was found that the vessel would not be large enough to hold the entire regiment properly for the trip. With the men and equipment loaded onto the “Marion” she steamed out to a point between Bedloe's Island and Castle Williams where she dropped anchor for the night. It was during this brief trip that the regiment suffered its first casualty when Albert “Tobe” Warren died after he fell overboard during that afternoon. The following morning (June 6) the Marion steamed down the river and dropped anchor off of Staten Island to await the arrival of the additional transport required for the regiment. Shortly thereafter the steamer “George Peabody” arrived and 400 men of the regiment were transferred from the Marion to her. Once this was completed the two vessels set sail for Newport News, Virginia. The regiment served at Newport News from June 8, 1861; Companies C, G and H at Hatteras, North Carolina, from August 27, 1861; and the regiment at Hatteras from September 10, 1861.

In February the 9th was ordered back to Suffolk, where it remained until May, the expiration of its term of service. May 6, 1863, the three years' men of the regiment, which latter had left for New York city, May 3, 1863, were assigned to the 3d Infantry. In April or May, 1863, the War Department authorized Capt. R. H. Morris of this regiment to organize a battery of members of his regiment, whose term of service had not expired. It was to consist of 110 men, but failed to complete its existence; 44 of the men assigned to the proposed battery deserted, the remainder were assigned to the 3d Infantry.New York State Military History Museum and Veterans Research Center 9th Infantry Regiment Civil War Hawkins' Zouaves; New York Zouaves; Little Zouaves; Zoo- Zoos The regiment was mustered out of United States service on May 20, 1863, at New York City, New York, following the expiration of its term of service. 9th New York Veteran Volunteers With the mustering out of the 9th Regiment in May 1863, the Governor of New York authorized Major Edward Jardine to re- organize them as the 9th New York Veteran Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and appointed Major Jardine as colonel of the newly organizing regiment. After several weeks of recruiting the command was organized into two companies under ex-Hawkins Zouaves officers William Barnett and James B. Horner. The two companies went into camp as a battalion at Fort Hamilton, New York, where training and recruiting was continued. From July 13 to 16, 1863, the City of New York exploded in several violent riots in reaction to the draft. The two companies were called out to help protect the city. In the ensuing fighting between soldiers and rioters, Colonel Jardine was severely wounded when he was shot in the hip. As a result of this wound, he was taken out of service for several months, and even after returning to the field was only able to perform light duties. The companies of the 9th Veterans acquitted themselves well in the action, and received notice in the reports of Colonel Winslow of the 5th New York Veteran Volunteers. On October 14, 1863, with the failure of the regiment to fully organize, the companies (under the command of Captain James B. Horner) were ordered to be consolidated into the 17th New York Veteran Volunteer Infantry Regiment, along with the men of the reorganizing 11th Veterans, 38th Veterans, and the \\"Union Sharpshooters.\\" As such they were mustered into United States service as Company H (Captain James B. Horner) and Company I (Captain William Barnett) of the 17th Veterans. As for Colonel Jardine, he was mustered into service as Lieutenant Colonel of the 17th Veterans.

On one side was a French-allied mercenary army led by Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar while the other side consisted of a joint Bavarian and Holy Roman Empire army and led by Johann von Werth and Federico Savelli. Bernhard was beaten in the first battle but managed to defeat and capture Werth and Savelli in the second. Prelude Following the Swedish defeat at the Battle of Nördlingen in 1634, Bernhard's mercenary army had come under the pay of France. Having been pushed to the west bank of the Rhine by the Imperial advance, Bernhard's army had settled in Alsace during 1635 and had done little except help repulse the Imperial invasion of France under the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand and Matthias Gallas in 1636. Early in February 1638, having been prodded by the French government, Bernhard advanced his army of 6,000 men and 14 guns to the Rhine in order to find a crossing. Arriving at an important crossing point at the town of Rheinfelden, Bernhard prepared to invest the town from the south. Meanwhile, he would use the ferry at Beuggen to throw troops across the river in order to complete the investment from the north. The attack on the town was to be made on 1 March. In order to prevent this, the Imperialists, under the Italian mercenary Count Federico Savelli and German general Johann von Werth, moved through the Black Forest to attack Bernhard's army and relieve the town. The First Battle The advance guard of the Imperial army, having advanced down the right bank of the river, was pushed back by Bernhard. This gave him time to deploy more troops and artillery onto the north bank of the river. However, by the time Savelli appeared with the main body of his force only half of Bernhard's army had made it to the north bank. Bernhard drew up his army to prevent Savelli from relieving the town. Savelli deployed the Imperial army of 7,000 men opposite Bernhard but because of the rough ground there was little chance for both armies to retain their formation. Savelli drove back Bernhard's left flank while on the opposite end of the field Bernhard routed the Imperial right. Like a revolving door both armies swung round giving Savelli the chance to capture the ferry and cut off Bernhard from his troops on the south bank. At the day's end, the armies were facing each other in the positions that the other had started the battle in. The Second Battle Although the Imperialists held the field Bernhard's losses were not serious and he resolved to unite both parts of his army. Avoiding Imperialist detachments Bernhard marched east along the Rhine to the village of Laufenburg. There, having crossed the Rhine and united his army, Bernhard turned back towards Rheinfelden. Believing Bernhard's army defeated and scattered, the Imperialist army failed to take precautions. Around 7 am on 3 March, Savelli's outposts were astonished to see Bernhard's army approaching and withdrew towards Rheinfelden to report Bernhard's presence as Savelli and Werth assembled their army in haste. Bernhard had his artillery fire three times into the Imperial ranks before a final charge broke the Imperialist army. Troops coming out of Rheinfelden to help were also trapped by Bernhard's army and forced to surrender. Both Savelli and Werth were captured. Bernhard lost about 2,000 casualties while his opponent lost about twice as many. His victory enabled him to march north along the Rhine to initiate the siege of Breisach. Popular culture In the 1970 movie The Last Valley, a mercenary captain (played by Michael Caine) and his band of fighters take up residence in a miraculously untouched Alpine valley, while at the same time providing protection for the valley from other war bands. Fearing the valley may be ravaged when large armies camp nearby, the captain takes his soldiers to assist Bernhard's army capture Rheinfelden, hoping thereby that the armies will leave the area. Their mission is a success, but in the struggle the captain is mortally wounded and many of his men killed.

It is one of the few easy passages across this mountainous border, and one of two between Paktika and Waziristan, the other passage being the Gomal River. The Afghan village Shkin lies just to the west of Angur Ada. The actual authoritative Durand Line, first demarcated in 1895, slices through the east side of the main bazaar area, placing most of the built up area legally in Afghanistan. However, the military forces and gates enforcing border control are several hundred meters west of the boundary and thus west of the main bazaar area, placing nearly all of the village's built-up area under the control of forces in Pakistan. The population in the area is Pashtun, predominantly from the Wazir and Kharoti tribes. In 2003 it was reported that eight people had been gunned down in Angur Ada, suspected of being US informants.  Angur Ada in the War on Terror In 2003 the hunt for Osama bin Laden was said by U.S. officials to be narrowed to a section of South Waziristan, namely the area covering the towns Angur Ada and Wana.

The DOHC eight-valve parallel-twin engine has two balance shafts and a 270° crank, which imitates the sound and feel of a V-twin. The engine was originally intended to be modular, namely \\"two-thirds of\\" a Triumph Rocket III engine; but after four years of development, the only parts in common are the valves. Power output is and torque is . The engine has two spark plugs per cylinder, which gives better combustion, resulting in lower fuel consumption, cleaner exhaust emissions, and more power. Brakes are double front discs with four-piston callipers, with a single rear disc also with two-piston callipers (ABS as option). Final drive is via a belt drive.

This group includes Torquatus, Caecilius, Ctesiphon, Euphrasius, Indaletius, Hesychius, and Secundius (Torcuato, Cecilio, Tesifonte, Eufrasio, Indalecio, Hesiquio y Segundo). It is not clear whether the seven men were Romans, Greeks, or natives of Hispania. The legend probably dates from the 8th century.\\"Ctesiphon von Vergium\\", Ökumenisches Heiligenlexikon The Martyrology of Lyon (806 AD) incorporated text from a fifth-century source, and the seven saints are mentioned in the Mozarabic liturgy. According to manuscripts of the 10th century, which in turn recorded information from the 8th or 9th centuries, these seven clerics arrived at Acci (Guadix) during the celebrations in honor of Jupiter, Mercury, and Juno. The pagans chased them to the river, but the bridge collapsed miraculously and the seven men were saved. A noblewoman named Luparia, interested in their mission, hid them and converted to Christianity after building an altar in honor of John the Baptist. The Dominican writer Rodrigo de Cerrato also wrote about the Seven Apostolic Men during the 13th century. The seven cities A depiction of Euphrasius, Jaén Cathedral. The seven missionaries decided to evangelize various parts of the region of Baetica: Torquatus remained in Acci (Guadix), Ctesiphon went to Vergium or Bergi (Berja), Hesychius to Carcere (Cazorla), Indalecius went to Urci (Pechina), Secundius to Abula (identified as Ávila or Abla), Euphrasius to Iliturgis (a site near Andújar), and Caecilius to Iliberri or Iliberis (Elvira/Granada). The identification of these places is imprecise: other sources state that Carcere or Carcesi is not Cazorla but Cieza, and that Urci is Torre de Villaricos, and Iliturgis is Cuevas de Lituergo. The only identification considered certain is that of Iliberis with Elvira, seat of the Synod of Elvira, whose first bishop, according to the Glosas Emilianenses, was Caecilius. Associations with Saint James the Great (Santiago) Traditions attributed to them actions other say were carried out James the Great. An author of the ninth century linked this tradition of the Seven Apostolic Men with that of Saint James the Great in a text known as Translatio S. Iacobi in Hispaniam. According to this text, seven disciples of James brought his body to the Roman province of Hispania after his martyrdom at Jerusalem. The seven disciples, pursued by a pagan king in Spain, hid in a fountain protected by a crypt; when the pagan soldiers entered the crypt, it collapsed, killing them all. A woman, named Luparia, converted to Christianity and had James' body placed in a building previously dedicated to the Roman gods. This tradition also states that three of these disciples, Torquatus, Athanasius (a name that does not correspond to the usual list of names of these seven name), and Ctesiphon, were buried with James. Veneration There are statues of all seven saints, in addition one of Saint Peter, at the Cathedral of Guadix. Pope John Paul II, during his first trip to Spain in 1982, remarked that Spain \\"was conquered for the faith by the missionary zeal of the Seven Apostolic Men.\\" Saint Euphrasius' relics were taken to Santa María de Mao in the diocese of Lugo. Ctesiphon Saint Ctesiphon () or Ctesiphon of Vergium is venerated as patron saint (besides Mary, Virgen de Gádor) of Berja, Andalusia, southern Spain. Tradition makes him a Christian missionary of the 1st century, during the Apostolic Age. He evangelized the town of Bergi, Vergi(s), or Vergium, identified as Berja, and is said to have become its first bishop, but the Diocese of Vergi was probably only founded around 500. Ctesiphon's relics purportedly lie in the catacombs of Sacromonte Abbey in Granada, along with those of Hesychius of Cazorla and Caecilius of Elvira. Torquatus' relics Torquatus' relics were rediscovered in the eighth century during the Moorish invasion of Spain, in a church built in his honor, near the Limia River. Torquatus' relics and those of Euphrasius were translated to Galicia. Torquatus' relics remained for a long time in the Visigothic church of Santa Comba de Bande. In the 10th century, Torquatus' relics were translated to San Salvador de Celanova (in Celanova, Ourense). In 1592, the sepulcher was opened and part of Torquatus' relics were distributed to Guadix, Compostela, and Ourense, and also to El Escorial, and to the Jesuit college at Guadix, and in 1627, to Granada. The relics that remained in San Salvador de Celanova were placed in the main chapel of the church of the monastery, together with those of Saint Rudesind, the monastery's founder. The Cathedral of Guadix conserves three relics associated with Saint Torquatus: his arm, his jawbone, and his calcaneus (this last relic is not on display).

Parts of the structure date from the early 12th century, and the church is listed at Grade I, a designation used for buildings \\"of outstanding architectural or historic interest\\". History A church existed in Ovingdean at the time of the Domesday Book, which recorded it as an ecclesiola (\\"little church\\"). This was rebuilt in the early 12th century, and most sources agree that no trace of the Saxon-era building remains. The 12th-century chancel and nave form the basis of the present structure. A tower was added at the west end in the 13th century, as was an aisle on the south side (reached by twin archways cut through from the nave). This aisle no longer exists, and its fate is uncertain; however, ancient scorch marks and discoloured brickwork in the south wall of the nave suggest fire damage by the same French raiders who destroyed neighbouring Rottingdean's St Margaret's in 1377. (A stone tablet in the church also makes this claim.) The chancel There were no significant alterations for several centuries after the tower was added, apart from a porch on the south side in the early 19th century, but like many ancient churches in the Brighton area St Wulfran's was subjected to a major restoration in the Victorian era. This took place from 1865 to 1867, and involved the rebuilding of the chancel arches to form one large central arch flanked by two smaller ones, replacement of all the pews, and new panelling and roof timbers in the chancel. These were designed and painted by Charles Eamer Kempe, who had been born in the village and who later became a noted stained glass designer. Before his death in 1907, he provided seven windows for the church; he also designed a rood screen for the chancel, which was carved in the German village of Oberammergau. (The village, famous for its woodcarving tradition, also supplied an intricately carved reredos to St Martin's Church in Brighton's Round Hill district.) There are other painted and stencilled panels from the 19th century throughout the church, representing various Biblical scenes. The reredos was also designed in the late 19th century, and depicts various figures including St Richard of Chichester. View across the churchyard from the southwest, showing the yew tree by the entrance door A chapel was built on the south side in 1907. One had been planned since the 12th-century rebuild, when an archway intended to lead to it was provided in the wall of the chancel. A vestry was added in an architecturally complementary style in the mid-1980s. The churchyard surrounds the church on three sides, and is home to an ancient yew tree which may be up to 1,000 years old. William Willett, a campaigner for daylight saving time, and Brighton-born inventor Magnus Volk—a pioneering electrical engineer who built an early electric car and the Volk's Railway, the world's oldest surviving electric railway—are buried in the churchyard. Members of the Kemp(e) family,Charles was born with the surname Kemp, but added the e later. including Charles Eamer Kempe himself, are also buried there. Nathaniel Kemp, who built the 18th-century Ovingdean Hall, the main building in the village, and his wife Martha share a tomb on the south side of the church; the tombstone was designed by Charles, who was later buried in the same tomb. The grave of Helena Normanton, the first woman to practise as a barrister in the United Kingdom, can also be found. Resident in Brighton since the age of four, she campaigned for various rights for women, such as advocating the use of maiden names professionally and recommending that women save any spare housekeeping money for their own use. She was also the first benefactor of the nearby University of Sussex. The Jex-Blake family, who lived in Brighton for a time, have a large, ornate tomb in the churchyard, although their most notable member is not buried there. Sophia Jex-Blake is commemorated on the memorial stone, however. She overcame opposition to train as one of the first female doctors in the United Kingdom, helped to found the London and Edinburgh Schools of Medicine for Women, and started a women's and children's hospital in Edinburgh. The dedication to Wulfram of Sens (in any spelling) is very rare. Only one other extant church in England bears it: the parish church of Grantham in Lincolnshire. A connection between the two may lie with Norman nobleman William de Warenne, one of England's main landowners in the 11th century, who owned land in both Ovingdean and Grantham. Another Lincolnshire church with the same dedication, at Dorrington, is no longer in use. Architecture Lychgate at the churchyard entrance St Wulfran's Church is built entirely of flint, other than narrow stone quoins at the corners of walls. Although churches incorporating some flint are common in Sussex, St Wulfran's is the only all-flint church in the historic county. The roof was originally slate, but tiles have replaced most of the slate slabs. The two- stage tower is topped with a shallow pyramid-shaped spire of a design known as the \\"Sussex Cap\\", and has a circular corbel of similar height in its southeastern corner. There are lancet windows of various sizes on all sides of the church and in the tower. Kempe's stained glass can be found in one of the tower windows, the south chapel, the north wall (three windows) and the south wall (two). Internally, there are several arches, some with pointed tops and chamfering; in particular, there are three arched entrances to the chapel on the south side, and a blocked entrance to the former south aisle. The churchyard is entered on the east side through a steep-roofed lychgate with recessed seating. \\"Holiness unto the Lord\\" is carved on one of the wooden beams. The church today St Wulfran's received its Grade I listing on 13 October 1952. The parish covers a rural area; Ovingdean village is the only significant area of housing. It reaches the southern boundary of Woodingdean, the eastern boundary of the Whitehawk estate and the northern edge of Rottingdean, and incorporates East Brighton Golf Club and surrounding areas of downland. There are two Eucharistic services on Sunday mornings and another every Wednesday, and Morning Prayer each Thursday. Other prayer groups and study groups meet at the church monthly.

Location The paddock was sited in the grounds of Dent de Lion, also known as Dandelion, in Garlinge, now a suburb located south-west of Margate.The Casket, No. 25, 28 July 1827 - see Google Books The estate was established around a former manor house in the 12th or 13th century by the family of Dent de Lyon. It was owned by Charles James Fox for many years until his death in 1806. The only remaining evidence of the estate is a 15th-century gatehouse. Matches The grounds had been converted into a resort and tea garden by the time cricket matches were held there and had become very popular with residents of Margate and nearby Ramsgate. The earliest known match at Dandelion Paddock was in September 1789 when Mann's East Kent XI played a team from the Isle of Thanet. In September 1795, it became a first-class venue when Mann staged three successive matches featuring his own XI.

It is made from two prisms of a birefringent material such as calcite, usually cemented together. The Sénarmont prism is named after Henri Hureau de Sénarmont. It is similar to the Rochon and Wollaston prisms. In the Sénarmont prism the s-polarized ray (i.e., the ray with polarization direction perpendicular to the plane in which all rays are contained, called the plane of incidence) passes through without being deflected, while the p-polarized ray (with polarization direction in the plane of incidence) is deflected (refracted) at the internal interface into a different direction. Both rays correspond to ordinary rays (o-rays) in the first component prism, since both polarization directions are perpendicular to the optical axis, which is the propagation direction. In the second component prism the s-polarized ray remains ordinary (o-ray, polarized perpendicular to the optical axis), while the p-polarized ray becomes extraordinary (e-ray), with a polarization component along the optical axis. As a consequence, the s-polarized ray is not deflected since the effective refractive index does not change across the interface. The p-polarized wave, on the other hand, is refracted because the effective refractive index changes upon changing from o-ray to e-ray. The Sénarmont prism is similar in construction and action to the Rochon prism, as in both polarizers the ray that is not deflected is the o-ray after the internal interface, while the deflected ray is the e-ray. However, in the Rochon prism, it is the p-polarized ray that remains an o-ray on both sides of the interface, and is therefore not deflected, while the s-polarized ray changes from o-ray to e-ray and is therefore deflected.

It is denoted by the postnominals \\"CPhys\\". Achieving chartered status in any profession denotes to the wider community a high level of specialised subject knowledge and professional competence. According to the Institute of Physics, holders of the award of the Chartered Physicist (CPhys) demonstrate the \\"highest standards of professionalism, up-to-date expertise, quality and safety\\" along with \\"the capacity to undertake independent practice and exercise leadership\\" as well as \\"commitment to keep pace with advancing knowledge and with the increasing expectations and requirements for which any profession must take responsibility\\". The status of Chartered Physicist was introduced in 1985 following approval from the Privy Council. It was originally granted automatically with corporate membership of the Institute of Physics (IoP). Reform of the membership structure in 1998 saw Chartered Physicist established as a separate qualification from 2001 that could be gained either alongside or after the status of Member or Fellow of the IoP. In order to gain the qualification, a physicist must be appropriately qualified (an accredited MSci or MPhys integrated master's degree is standard, although experience leading to an equivalent level can be counted), have had a minimum of two years of structured training and a minimum of two years responsible work experience, have demonstrated a commitment to continuing professional development, and have gained a number of competencies. For physicists gaining the status from 2012, revalidation through proof of continuing professional development is required every three years. Chartered Physicist is considered to be equal in status to Chartered Engineer, which the IoP also awards as a member of the Engineering Council UK, and other chartered statuses in the UK.

The company was set up in 1889 by Charles Algernon Parsons. The company built a number of small coal-fired power stations in the west end of Newcastle upon Tyne, initially to supply homes and streets with electric lighting. They also provided power for an electrified tram line in the western part of the city. DISCo was the first electric supply company in the world to generate electricity using turbo generators, thanks to Parsons' invention of the steam turbine. The company existed until the nationalisation of the UK's electrical supply industry in 1948. History Following his invention of the steam turbine in 1884, Charles Algernon Parsons was anxious to move into electricity supply, and so in 1889 he founded up the Newcastle and District Electric Electric Lighting Company. Their distribution area was quickly decided; they were to supply the area of the city to the west of Grainger Street, while the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Electric Supply Company (NESCo), who had also been formed in 1889, were to supply the eastern side of the city. DISCo's distribution area was expanded west to Newburn in 1902, and north to Benwell and Fenham in 1904. They were unable to extend this any further after losing a number of Parliamentary battles with NESCo in the early 1900s. The first power station the company constructed was at Forth Banks in the city centre in 1890. This was the first power station in the world to generate electricity commercially using steam turbine driven generators. A further power station was constructed in close proximity to the Forth Banks station in 1902, on The Close. Another two stations were built by the company at Lemington, in 1903, and at Newburn, in 1908. All of the stations built by the company used steam turbines built by Parson's turbine building company C. A. Parsons and Company. Charles Parsons was initially held the title as the company's managing director, until 1902 when he stepped down, but remained with the company as a director, before finally retiring in 1909. The majority of the North East's electric supply companies merged with NESCo in 1932 to form the North Eastern Electric Supply Company (again known as NESCo). However, DISCo was one of only three electric supply companies in the region to not merge into NESCo. DISCo ceased to exist in 1948, becoming part of the North Eastern Electricity Board (NEEB), with the nationalisation of the UK's electrical supply industry.

The anti-hemB RNA motif consists primarily of two stem- loops, followed by a predicted rho-independent transcription termination stem- loop. As anti-hemB RNAs are generally not located in a 5' UTR, the RNAs are presumed to be non-coding RNAs. The terminator stem-loop implies that anti- hemB RNAs are transcribed as independent molecules. The name \\"anti-hemB\\" is to distinguish the motif from its reverse complement, which was called the \\"hemB\\" motif, a motif that is often in the apparent 5' UTRs of hemB genes. It was considered ambiguous as to which of these orientations is correct, as both directions exhibit covariation (see secondary structure prediction), and both fold into plausible RNA structures. However, the anti-hemB was judged the more likely orientation, because it had fewer A-C base pairs, which do not contribute to RNA stability. In reverse complement, an A-C pair becomes the stable G-U wobble pair.

It was situated in Brittany, Diocese of Nantes, in La Meilleraye-de-Bretagne in the vicinity of Châteaubriant (in present Loire-Atlantique). History Foulques, Abbot of Pontron in Anjou, which was founded from Loroux (itself a daughter foundation of Cîteaux), sent monks for the foundation of a monastery in Brittany. They chose a solitary location near Old Melleray, shown them by Rivallon, pastor of Auverné, which Alain de Moisdon, proprietor of the place, donated to them. Guitern, the first abbot, erected the original monastery in 1145, but the church was not completed until 1183, under Geffroy, the fourth abbot. Melleray, a small monastery built for about twelve monks, remained regular until during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when relaxation prevailed. Etienne de Brezé (1544) was the first commendatory abbot, and from his time the monastery declined, until toward the end of the seventeenth century when, through the efforts of Dom Jouard, vicar-general of the order, the Rule of St. Benedict was re-introduced, and the monastic buildings restored. In 1791 it was suppressed, and the few religious were dispersed. This, however, was not the end of Melleray. The Trappists, expelled from France, took refuge at Valsainte in Switzerland; from there Dom Augustine de Lestrange established them in various parts of the world. Through the generosity of Sir Thomas Weld, a wealthy English Catholic and the father of Cardinal Weld, they settled (1795) at Lulworth, Dorset, England. Their monastery was soon created an abbey, and Dom Antoine was elected the first abbot (1813). In 1817, with changed conditions and the restoration of the Bourbons, the monks of Lulworth returned to Melleray. The restored abbey flourished, increasing from fifty-seven to one hundred and ninety-two members in twelve years. During the Revolution of 1830 they were again persecuted, especially those of foreign birth, of whom they had a great number. To make homes for these they founded Mount Melleray Abbey (1833) in Ireland and Mount Saint Bernard Abbey (1835) in England. Dom Antoine (d. 1839) was succeeded first by Dom Maxime, then by a second Dom Antoine, and finally by Dom Eugene Vachette. Under Dom Antoine II several monasteries were established, among them Gethsemani Abbey (1848) in the United States. Dom Eugène, elected in 1875, was for many years the vicar-general of the Congregation of La Grande Trappe, and was instrumental in effecting the reunion into a single Order of the three congregations among which the Trappists were then divided 1892). In 2015, the Trappist monks announced that they would leave the abbey in 2016, and give charge of it to the Chemin Neuf Community..

Huw Watkins was awarded the Constant and Kit Lambert Junior Fellowship at the Royal College of Music, where he used to teach composition. He is currently Honorary Research Fellow at the Royal Academy of Music.\\"Huw Watkins\\" at Royal Academy of Music. Career In 1999, the Nash Ensemble premiered Watkins’ Sonata for Cello and Eight Instruments, which had been commissioned by Faber Music. The review in The Times declared that \\"at 22, Huw Watkins is already a composer to be reckoned with\\". The work has since been performed by the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group in London, Paris, Copenhagen and Aldeburgh under the direction of Sakari Oramo and Peter Rundel. In 2000, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales gave the first performance of Watkins’ Sinfonietta under Grant Llewellyn, and as a result of the collaboration, a piano concerto was commissioned for the same orchestra. This was given its premiere - with Watkins at the piano - in May 2002, under Martyn Brabbins. His works include a Nocturne for solo horn and chamber orchestra - first performed and recorded in March 2002 by David Jolley and the Cincinnati Chamber Orchestra under Mischa Santora; a Cello Sonata, recorded with his brother Paul Watkins for Nimbus Records on a CD of 20th-Century British cello music; String Quartet No. 3, written for the Belcea Quartet and premiered at London's Wigmore Hall in 2004.

It is situated on the slopes of the Knockmealdown Mountains, near Cappoquin, Diocese of Waterford. It is famous in literature due to Seán Ó Ríordáin's poem Cnoc Mellerí in Eireaball Spideoige (1952). James Joyce mentions Mount Melleray in the final short story of his 1914 collection, Dubliners. In this story, entitled \\"The Dead\\", the monks of Mount Melleray are noted for their exceptional hospitality and piety. History The Cistercian order itself dates back to the 12th century and the Trappists to the mid-17th century. Following the suppression of monasteries in France after the French Revolution, some dispossessed Trappist monks had arrived in England in 1794 and established a monastic community in Lulworth, Dorset.{{Cite web url=http://www.eastlulworth.org.uk/east_lulworth_monastery_farml.html title=Archived copy access-date=2019-10-12 The monks returned to France in 1817 to re-establish the ancient Melleray Abbey in Brittany, following the restoration of the Bourbons. Within ten years, the restored monastery had two hundred members, of whom up to seventy were Irish. During the July Revolution of 1830, the monks were again persecuted and Waterford-born Father Vincent Ryan was sent by Dom Antoine, Abbot of Melleray. to found an abbey in Ireland. Father Vincent initially rented a property in Rathmore, Co. Kerry. Sixty-four Cisterican monks landed at Cobh from France on 1 December 1831.. The land in Rathmore proved unsuitable for housing the monastery and Fr Vincent looked to Co. Waterford, where Sir Richard Keane of Cappoquin had offered a tract of 600 acres of barren mountain land. The monastery was founded on 30 May 1832 at Scrahan, Cappoquin. In the work of reclaiming the soil, the brethren were assisted by the local people. A number of \\"work pilgrimages\\" were undertaken by members of nearby parishes, the first by the parish of Modeligo.. On the feast of St Bernard, 1833, the foundation stone of the new monastery was blessed by Dr. William Abraham, Bishop of Waterford and Lismore. It was called Mount Melleray in memory of the motherhouse.Mount Melleray Ordre Cistercien de la Stricte Observance. In 1835 the monastery was created an abbey, and Father Vincent, unanimously elected, received the abbatial blessing from Bishop Abraham, this being the first abbatial blessing in Ireland since the Protestant Reformation. It was from Mount Melleray that a small colony of monks was dispatched to found the English Mount Saint Bernard Abbey in 1835. Abbot Vincent vigorously undertook the work of completing the abbey, but died 9 December 1845. His successor, Dom M. Joseph Ryan, resigned after two years. To Dom Bruno Fitzpatrick, who succeeded as abbot in September 1848, it remained to consolidate. He devoted his energy to missionary work (see below). Building resumed in the late 1920s when Dom Marius O'Phelan bought the great cut limestone blocks from Mitchelstown Castle (28 miles west), which had been burnt by the local IRA on 12 August 1922. In 1925, the owners of Mitchelstown castle dismantled the ruins and the stones were transported from Mitchelstown by steam lorry, two consignments a day for at least five years. As the Abbey was being laid out, Dom Marius died and his successor, Dom Celsus O'Connell, continued to the monumental task. He opted for a more prominent site directly over the mortal remains of 180 of his fellow Cistercians. The monks ended up with far more stones than they needed and these were eventually stacked in fields around the monastery. In 1838 Daniel O'Connell, visited the Abbey, O'Connell was a supporter of Fr. Vincent, in establishing a Cistercian community in Ireland. In 1849, Dom Bruno Fitzpatrick, who had become abbot the previous year founded New Melleray Abbey, near Dubuque, Iowa, U.S.A., and, in 1878, Mount Saint Joseph Abbey, Roscrea, Co. Tipperary, Ireland. He also founded the Ecclesiastical Seminary of Mount Melleray. Originating in a small school formed by Abbot Vincent in 1843, it was developed by Abbot Bruno and his successors. During his July 1849 visit to neighbouring Dromana House, Scottish essayist Thomas Carlyle paid a visit to Mount Melleray and described the abbey in some detail, noting particularly the huge vats of \\"stir-about\\" or porridge the monks prepared for a large number of famine refugees that waited for food at the entrance to the monastery: \\"Entrance; squalid hordes of beggars, sit waiting\\" and \\"nasty tubs of cold stirabout (coarsest I ever saw) for beggars\\"(p. 90). He notes that the monastery \\"must have accumulated several thousand pounds of property in these seventeen ... years, in spite of its continual charities to beggars\\" (p. 92). Reminiscences of My Irish Journey in 1849. Thomas Carlyle, 1882.

Dr. Patrick Power.Sport Cultural Waterford www.census.nationalarchives.ie Abbot Bruno died 4 December 1893, and was succeeded by Dom Carthage Delaney, who was blessed 15 January 1894, and presided over Mount Melleray for thirteen years; his successor was Dom Marius O'Phelan, solemnly blessed by Dr. Sheahan, Bishop of Waterford, 15 August 1908. Dom O'Phelan is credited with resuming the building programme at Mount Melleray in 1925.

The Wills Valley opened the line from the Nashville and Chattanooga at Wauhatchie, Tennessee to Trenton, Georgia by December 1860, operating to Chattanooga via trackage rights over the Nashville and Chattanooga.The American and English Railroad Cases, Volume XIV (1884), Swann & Billups v. Larmore, p. 521 The North East and South West began its line at Meridian, reaching a connection with the Alabama and Mississippi Rivers Railroad (later the Selma and Meridian Railroad) at York, Alabama by 1860, and was leased to the latter company.Poor's Manual of Railroads, 1868-69, p. 398 A group of Boston capitalists headed by John C. Stanton gained control of the companies after the Civil War, and the legislature passed a law in November 1868 to merge the two as the Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad. (Georgia, Tennessee, and Mississippi renamed their portions in March 1869, February 1870, and May 1871, respectively.) The entire line was completed in May 1871, creating a diagonal link across Alabama.AN ACT In execution of the power of the State of Alabama, in relation to the lands granted to this State... (No. 58), approved February 20, 1883 However, due to nonpayment of interest on state bonds, the state of Alabama seized the property in mid-1871, and it was operated by other parties (including the president of the connecting New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad) until November 1877, when it was reorganized as the Alabama Great Southern Railroad by Emile Erlanger and Company. Erlanger set up an English corporation, Alabama Great Southern Railway Company, Limited, to own the stock of the AGS. In 1881, this company gained control of the Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway, which continued north from Chattanooga to Cincinnati. A second English corporation, Alabama, New Orleans, Texas and Pacific Junction Railways Company, Limited, was created in 1881 to increase the funds available to purchase associated lines. It bought the Alabama Great Southern Railway Company, New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad, Vicksburg and Meridian Railway, and Vicksburg, Shreveport and Pacific Railroad, but in 1890 control of the AGS was sold to the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railway and Richmond and Danville Railroad, which both became part of the Southern Railway later that decade.Frederick Albert Cleveland and Fred Wilbur Powell, Railroad Finance, 1912, pp. 314-315 In April 1892, the AGS acquired the Gadsden and Attalla Railroad, a branch from Attalla to Gadsden, but in 1905 the AGS sold it to the Southern, retaining trackage rights. The AGS bought a half interest in the Woodstock and Blocton Railway from the Louisville and Nashville Railroad in July 1909, giving it access to West Blocton. The AGS incorporated the Wauhatchie Extension Railway in April 1914 to continue the line from Wauhatchie to a junction with the Southern subsidiary Memphis-Chattanooga Railway west of Lookout Mountain.

Nyman does not perform on the album, but he composed all the music, produced it, and wrote the liner notes. The album contains four compositions, each on a separate track. The album is dedicated to the memory of Tony Simons, \\"friend, manager, and generous and courageous survivor.\\" The album is named for the second and longest of the four works, the only one featuring a former member of the Michael Nyman Band, Elisabeth Perry.

Nyman found the text on February 12, 1992 in a translation by Samuel Noah Kramer in Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament edited by James B. Pritchard (3rd edition with supplement, Princeton University Press, 1969), in the personal library of an Armenian friend. In the hymn, Inanna speaks proudly of all that her father, Enlil, has given her, and it takes the form of a list. Its audacity, shamelessness, and repetitive structure appealed to him, and thought it would be suitable for James Bowman's voice. He became even more interested in setting the work when he learned that Inanna is well-known deity embraced by many feminists, and not obscure, as he had initially thought. Indeed, she superseded all Sumerian deities, male or female, by the end of the Sumerian civilization.Michael Nyman. Time Will Pronounce liner notes. 1993. p. 10. In spite of the last stanza of the piece being the most repetitive, Nyman chose to use cadential diversity rather than repetition.

Time will pronounce 20:35 Trio of London *Elisabeth Perry, violin *Melissa Phelps, cello *Julian Jacobson, piano *Assistant engineer: Chris Ludwinski The title of Time will pronounce is derived from the closing lines of Joseph Brodsky's \\"Bosnia Tune.\\" Nyman uses the word \\"generally\\" five times in describing the nature of the work—violin and cello independent of piano, alternating tempi without motivation, use of harmonics, and so on. The piece premiered July 14 at the Pittville Pump Room, Cheltenham. The convertibility of lute strings 15:06 Virginia Black, harpsichord *Engineered by Tony Falkner Commissioned by neurologist Anthony Roberts for Virginia Black, a fellow student with whom Nyman studied harpsichord at the Royal Academy of Music, the title refers to a late sixteenth century practice to which Christopher Marlowe refers in his book, The Reckoning on the death of Christopher Marlowe, in which lute strings were popular to use as a commodity with moneylenders when money was not available, but Nyman states that this is completely irrelevant to the piece, and that his only musical reference in it is to the closing section of his own opera, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, because the piece was commissioned by a neurologist. This work was first performed November 19 at the Purcell Room in London, and was recorded at St. Michael's Church in Highgate two days later.

The piece is named because the work was completed on August 12, 1992, and Nyman read in the newspaper the following day that John Cage had died, although Cage's influence is not directly felt in the piece, and Nyman acknowledges the piece might not be to his taste. On earlier sheets of the work, he noted the deaths of Miles Davis (who died September 29, the day it was begun) and Ástor Piazzolla. The working title for the piece has been \\"Canons, chorales and waltzes,\\" but Nyman rejected this because there was only one canon, one waltz, and no chorales. The work features a non-simultaneous multiplicity of the group operating more like ensembles that constantly change.Michael Nyman. Time Will Pronounce.

Design and development The Pathfinder was an attempt by the Keystone Aircraft Corporation to develop a civil transport version of the successful series of bombers that it was producing for the United States Army Air Corps as the LB-5 and its derivatives. Like them, it was a conventional biplane design with engines mounted in nacelles on the lower wing, but also added a third engine, mounted on the nose (as the single engine of the LB-1 had been). A passenger cabin with seating for ten was added to the fuselage. The first Pathfinder (registered NX179) was chosen by US Navy pilots Noel Davis and Stanton Wooster for their attempt at the Orteig prize to cross the Atlantic. The standard Liberty engines were replaced by Wright J-5s of approximately half their power. Painted yellow, the aircraft was named American Legion after the sponsors of the attempt. On 26 April 1927, a week before their planned departure, the aircraft crashed during a heavily laden test flight from Langley Field at Hampton, Virginia. Unable to climb quickly enough to clear a row of trees, Davis attempted to turn the aircraft, but lost height and was forced to land. Although he succeeded in bringing the aircraft down, he was unable to stop it as it skidded into a nearby bog and was wrecked. Davis and Wooster were both killed, the former's face crushed and the latter's neck broken. The remains of the aircraft were trucked back to Keystone, where it was rebuilt and re-registered (NC1612). It was purchased by Basil Rowe to use for his pioneering air service in the West Indies, West Indian Aerial Express, christened Santa Maria. As Pan American expanded its operations into the area, Santa Maria was chartered to fly the first of the airline's mail flights from Key West to Havana, before Pan Am purchased West Indian Aerial Express outright, and the Pathfinder along with it. The aircraft continued to fly freight for Pan Am for some years before being retired and burned at Brownsville, Texas. The second Pathfinder (NC5317) was fitted with extensions to its lower wing that was used to carry a neon sign advertising Silver Dust laundry soap through the skies of New York City at night during 1928.

Ending up in a relatively isolated rural town in Mendocino County, Bell writes that she \\"grew up . . . spending a lot of time reading, walking in the woods, and making up stories.\\" As a teenager Bell attended a college program for low-income and at-risk students hosted by Humboldt State University, where she took classes in Shakespeare and composition. When Bell was 17 she traveled in Europe, including England, where she met her British relatives. Later moving to San Francisco, Bell took art classes at the City College of San Francisco, worked in a series of dead-end retail jobs, and began self-publishing her comics. She currently lives in Brooklyn, NY. Career  Books of...  From about 1998 to 2002, Bell annually self- published a 32-page minicomic, each of whose titles began with \\"Book of...\\", including Book of Insomnia, Book of Sleep, Book of Black, Book of Lies, and Book of Ordinary Things. Many of the stories from those comics were collected in When I'm Old and Other Stories, published by Alternative Comics in 2003.  Lucky  In 2003, Bell began the self-published semi-autobiographical Lucky series, of which the third won a 2003 Ignatz Award for Most Outstanding Minicomic. Lucky details Bell's day-to-day existence in a frank and good- humored manner, as she navigates a world of dilapidated rental apartments, low-paying jobs, yoga classes, roommate misadventures, and artistic frustration. These snippets of daily life in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York, are comforting in their familiarity; by settling into the rhythm of the artist's daily life, the reader experiences the heft of small victories and simple pleasures. Lucky tells of the anguish of nude modeling; sex-obsessed, adolescent art students; and Bell's own foibles. Lucky was collected by Drawn and Quarterly in fall 2006, and launched as a new series (vol. 2), also by Drawn and Quarterly, in 2007.

The Voyeurs  The Voyeurs (Uncivilized Books, 2012) is a real-time memoir of a turbulent five years in the life of renowned cartoonist, diarist and filmmaker Gabrielle Bell. It collects episodes from her award-winning series, Lucky, in which she travels to Tokyo, Paris, and the South of France and all over the United States, but remains anchored by her beloved Brooklyn, where sidekick Tony provides ongoing insight, offbeat humor and enduring friendship.  Michel Gondry  Bell collaborated with director Michel Gondry on a film adaptation of the title story of Cecil and Jordan in New York, in which a young woman turns herself into a chair so as not to be too much of a bother to those around her. The film, titled Interior Design, was co-written by Bell and Gondry and directed by Gondry as part of the film Tôkyô!. Bell and Gondry also collaborated on Kuruma Tohrimasu, a collection of drawings and photographs made during the production of Interior Design. Conceived of as a thank-you gift for the film's cast and crew, Kuruma Tohrimasu is published as part of Drawn and Quarterly’s Petits Livres series.

The battle was fought between the British colonial troops and Acadian resistance fighters led by French Officer Charles Deschamps de Boishébert on September 4, 1755 at the Acadian village of Village-des-Blanchard on the Petitcodiac River (present-day Hillsborough, New Brunswick, Canada). Background After the capture of Fort Beauséjour in June 1755 by British troops during the Seven Years' War, they began rounding up and deporting the local French population. Using Fort Cumberland as a base, British troops and colonial militia made forays into the surrounding countryside, rounding up Acadians and destroying their settlements. Some of the Acadians surrendered, while others fled from the coastal communities into the interior, where they joined with local Mi'kmaq and Maliseet Indians in resisting the British deportation. Charles Deschamps de Boishébert was the French militia commander who led Acadian, French, and Mi'kmaq forces. Charles Deschamps de Boishébert was a French militia commander who became a resistance leader. Based in the Miramichi River valley, he helped Acadians fleeing the British deportation operations escape to Quebec. After the fall of Beausejour, Monckton sent a naval squaldorn to evict him from the satellite fort at the mouth of the Saint John River. Knowing that he could not defend his position, Boishebert destroyed the fort.Faragher, p. 350 When he received word that the British were planning an expedition to the Petitcodiac River, he hurried to Chipoudy, where he organized 120 Acadians, Maliseets and Mi'kmaq into a guerrilla fighting force.Faragher, p. 350; Grenier, p.180 During Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755), on August 28, Monckton sent Major Joseph Frye with an expedition of 200 provincial militia from Fort Cumberland in two armed sloops, with instructions to clear Acadians settlements on the Petitcodiac River. After setting the buildings on fire at Shepody, New Brunswick, they began moving up the river, torching settlements and taking prisoners along the way. Battle On September 2, the expedition began these clearing operations on settlements in and around the Village-des-Blanchard. While the main body worked on the eastern bank of the river, a detachment of fifty or sixty under John Indicot was despatched to the western bank.Grenier, p. 180. Note: Grenier locates this battle at Chipoudy rather than at Petitcodiac. There is a primary source, however, of a letter written by Major Jedediah Preble which indicates the battle happened in \\"Shipodia\\" (See Peter Landry. The Lion and the Lily. Trafford Press. 2007. p. 535) When they set fire to the village church, Boishébert and three hundred men attacked. The British retreated behind a dyke and were in a near panic when Frye landed with the remainder of the force and took command. After three hours of spirited fighting, Frye eventually extracted the force to the boats and retreated. Twenty two British were killed and another six were wounded.Grenier, p. 180. The French reported that eighty British were killed (see Grenier, p. 180). Ranger Joseph Gorham was wounded in the battle. Aftermath National Historic Site monument. The battle was a stinging defeat for the British. Abbe Le Guerne wrote that it \\"made the English tremble more than all the cannons of Beausejour.\\"Faragher, p. 351 For many of the provincial fighters this was their first experience with combat and over 50 percent of those who participated became casualties.Grenier, p. 180 The battle was the first bright spot for the Acadians.

Françoise Demulder (9 June 1947 - 3 September 2008) was a French war photographer who in 1976 became the first woman to win the World Press Photo of the Year award. The winning image was a black and white photo of a Palestinian woman raising her hands at a masked militiaman in Beirut's war- ravaged La Quarantaine district. Early life Born on 9 June 1947, Demulder, nicknamed Fifi, was the daughter of an electrical engineer. A pretty and timid brown-haired girl, she was at first a model before she followed a photographer to Vietnam. It was this adventure of love that began her career as a wartime photographer. Career After covering the Vietnam War for three years, the self-made adventurer traveled to other places of crisis in the world including Angola, Lebanon, Cambodia, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Pakistan, and Cuba. She often traveled to the Middle East where she saw many mistakes in the reports about Yasser Arafat, who Demulder had ties to through friendship. She also followed the Iran–Iraq War. Then, at the beginning of the 1991 Gulf-War, she was one of only a few journalists present in Baghdad when the city was bombed. She worked for the press agencies Gamma and Sipa Press, and for the publications Time, Life, and Newsweek. She is known for two particular photos which she took. The first captures a symbolic instance where a North Vietnam tank smashes the gate at the Presidential Palace in Saigon, during the taking of the city on 13 April 1975. The second made her, in 1977, the first female winner of the World Press Photo. Designated as the best shot of the year, this image in black and white, captured in Beirut on 18 January 1976, depicts a Palestinian woman imploring a Phalange militant in front of a house engulfed in flames, during the massacre of the Karantina (Quarantaine) neighborhood of East Beirut. On 29 October 2003, a sale of solidarity gathered together 300 prints by international photographers. The sale was organized by Gallery Vu' of Paris, and reported a sum of 171,000 € destined to come to the aid of a French photojournalist who was very sick and without social security. In the auction, the photo by Demulder that had won the World Press Photo contest, sold for 11,000 € to Yann Arthus-Bertrand.

India controls the western portion of the plains as part of Ladakh, whereas the eastern portion is controlled by China and claimed by India. The Depsang plains are also part of the area called Sub-Sector North (SSN) by the Indian military. The area sees frequent tension between China and India. Chinese incursions into Indian territory are common, with major standoffs occurring in 2013, 2015 and 2020. The Line of Control with Pakistan-administered Gilgit- Baltistan west of the Depsang Plains sees frequent ceasefire violations and infiltrations by Pakistan.  Geography  Depsang Plains depicted on a Survey of India map of 1916 The Depsang Plains are located in the north-western part of Aksai Chin. They are bounded on the north by the valley of the Chip Chap River and on the west by the Shyok River. On the east they are bounded by low hills of the \\"Lak Tsung\\" range, which separate them from the basin of the Karakash River. In the south, the Depsang Plains proper end at the Depsang La pass, but in common parlance, the Depsang area is taken to extend till Burtsa Nala, which flows between Burtsa and Murgo. The Karakoram Pass is located to the north of Depsang while the Lingzi Thang plains lie to the southeast. On the west is the southern part of the Rimo glacier, the source of the Shyok River. Francis Younghusband who travelled here in the late 19th century described the area as follows: History  Caravan route  The Depsang Plains were regularly traversed by trade caravans, coming via the Karakoram Pass in the north from Yarkand beyond. Filippo de Filippi, who explored the area in 1913–1914, described: Filippi also wrote that the experienced caravaners passed through the Depsang Plains without stopping, travelling a distance of 31 miles between Daulat Beg Oldi and Murgo in a single day. Others stopped, either at Qizil Langar to the south of Depsang La, or at Burtsa further south. A stream running from below Depsang La, called Depsang Nala, waters these parts leading to the growth of the burtza plant, which served as fodder as well as fuel for the campers. The trading caravans declined during the 1940s during tensions in Xinjiang (Chinese Turkestan) and completely stopped in late 1950s due to the Sino-Indian border tensions. In modern times, the Darbuk–Shyok–DBO Road (DS–DBO Road) has been laid by India along the old caravan route. It passes through Sultan Chushku, Murgo, Burtsa, Qizil Langar, to reach Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO).  Exploration  In 1893, Charles Murray, 7th Earl of Dunmore, in his daily records of his travels with Major Roche through Ladakh, Tibet and Pamirs, wrote of seeing musk deer, kiang, Tibetan antelope and a butterfly in the region in and around the Depsang Plains. Dunmore noted that K2, the second highest mountain in the world, could be seen from the plateaus. In 1906, Sven Hedin had travelled east from Burtsa to the Aksai Chin lake on the traditional silk road. The traditional route to Shahidula passed through the plains; Kizil Jilga to Haji Langar to Shahidula.  Line of Actual Control  In 1962, China and India fought a war over the border dispute, following which the Depsang Plains have been divided between the two countries across a Line of Actual Control (LAC), which runs to the east of the traditional caravan route. Now only the militaries of the two countries inhabit the region distributed in numerous military camps. The nearest inhabited village is Murgo.A skull from Daulat Baig Oldie, The Tribune (Chandigarh), 26 May 2019.  Locations  Burtsa, alternately spelled as Burtse, is a historic halting spot on the caravan route at the southern end of the Depsang Plains, where the Depsang Nala and Raki Nala join to form the Burtsa Nala. It currently serves as a military camp of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and the Indian Army on the Darbuk-Shyok-DBO road, about 15 kilometres on the India's side of the LAC. Near Burtsa on the bed of the Raki Nala is \\"bottleneck\\" or \\"Y-junction\\". The bottleneck gets its name from a rock formation that restricts movement of vehicles. The bottleneck is also called Y-junction because the track from Bursta that runs along it divides into two here. One track goes along the Raki Nala to Patrolling Point 10 (PP10) while the other track goes to PP-13. North of Burtsa is Qizil Langar, also called Qazi Langar. It is in a narrow reddish gorge, immediately to the south of the Depasang La. The Depsang Nala stream flows in the gorge from the west and takes a turn to the south at Qizil Langar. Gapshan or Yapshan is a halting place located at the confluence of the Chip Chap River and the Shyok River. In the past, on numerous occasions, the Chong Kumdan glacier has blocked the flow of the Shyok River forming a lake called the Gapshan Lake; once the ice dam melts, the lake drains away. From Gapshan, the Shahi Kangri group of peaks are seen which dominate the plains. At a camping ground, Polu (or Pulo/Pola is a traditional temporary shelter built using local mud), four miles north of DBO along the DBO Nala, Maj A. M. Sethi found a memorial stone left by Dr. Ph. C. Visser in 1935. Tianwendian (\\"astronomical point\\") is a border post in the Chinese-controlled territory; the location is also called point 5243. From Tianwendian Defence Area, the Chinese have a line of sight extending to Siachen glacier, 140 km away. Closer to the Indian-controlled territory is forward post 5390, a PLA observation point which acts as an extension of Tianwendian. The Tiankong Highway runs parallel to the LAC connecting Tianwendian and Kongka to the south.  Flora and fauna  Tibetan gazelle, a species of the Tibetan antelope The Depsang Plains are widely observed as forming a high-altitude cold desert without any flora or fauna. Filippo de Filippi, who explored the region in 1910s, wrote that \\"the surface of the [Depsang] plateau is a mass of minute detritus, and is entirely devoid of vegetation, except for occasional patches of a yellowish-green plant\\". A 1985 expedition to the Rimo Glacier found blooming plants at a few places and that \\"at places [the] plains are marshy and our mules were sinking and we all had to help them out.\\" Burtse (Artemisia spp.) plant of the Asteraceae family grows along the Burtsa Nala and Depsang Nala, lending its name to the region. Its leaves were used for fodder and its roots as firewood by caravaners. Potentilla pamirica is also found in the plains. Small populations of Tibetan antelope (or \\"chiru\\"), mountain weasel, Ladakh pika, bharal (blue sheep), Tibetan wolf and woolly hare, among others, can seen in the plains. According to Brigadier Teg B Kapur, \\"the [Depsang] plain abounds with wild horses and hares\\". The populations of chiru are migratory and come to the high-altitude plains for summer grazing. These populations are also the westernmost population of chiru, found at altitudes of up to 5500m. A Schaller Conservation Survey of chiru conducted by the Wildlife Trust of India in 2005 sighted 149 individuals of chiru in 22 groups, all females and kids, in the Depsang area. The southernmost area where chiru were spotted was the Thuksu Doon Doon nullah which flows near the Depsang La. The report says that \\"Chiru is a mixed feeder and favoured graminoids and forb plant species\\". In the past, Chiru were killed for their fine wool (called shahtoosh) and many efforts have been taken to protect them in India. Populations of Kiang also move back and forth across the disputed border. In 1990, it was reported that the proposed Daultberg–Depsang Sanctuary would contain the last wild yak, but Schaller Conservation Survey did not locate any in the 2000s. DRDO-reared double-humped Bactrian camels (originally used along the silk route) will be deployed at DBO and Depsang by the Indian Army for patrolling and transportation. Zanskar ponies are also being used by the Indian Army.  Sino-Indian border dispute  CIA) India's Intelligence Bureau patrols had come across indications of Chinese activity in the Depsang Plains prior to 1958. However, the Bureau chief B. N. Mullik has stated that \\"the Chinese did not come into Depsang Plains till October, 1960\\". The Chinese claim lines in the Depsang plains have varied since 1956. According to Manoj Joshi, the lack of border demarcation allows China to carry on with its salami slicing in this region.  1962 war  The 1962 Sino-Indian War in the Depsang Plains lasted two days, 20–21 October 1962. The Chinese forces in the area were based at the Tianwendian post (also called Point 5243). The Indian posts, set up in accordance with India's \\"forward policy\\", were manned by the 14th batallion of the Jammu and Kashmir Militia (later Ladakh Scouts), and were mostly of a platoon or a section strength. The Chinese forces first targeted the post they called \\"Indian Stronghold No. 6\\" at \\"Red Top Hill\\". They regarded this post specially threatening to their lines of communication. As per the Chinese assessment, the attacking troops had a superiority of 10 to 1 in numbers and 7 to 1 in fire power. The post was eliminated in under two hours, with 42 soldiers killed and 20 captured. Following on this success, the Chinese eliminated 6–7 other Indian posts of a section strength (8–10 troops) and 2 further posts on the second day. The remaining Indian posts were then given permission to withdraw, as they were not tactically sited and had no mutual support. By 24 October, the withdrawal was completed, with the Indians continuing to hold Saser Brangsa, Murgo, Sultan Chushku and the Galwan estuary on the Shyok River. The Chinese forces advanced to their 1960 claim line in most locations. The one exception was the Depsang Bulge, where later maps showed them to have reached up to the junction of the Raki Nala with the Depsang Nala, thereby straightening out the bulge. P. J. S. Sandhu, It Is Time to Accept How Badly India Misread Chinese Intentions in 1962 – and 2020, The Wire, 21 July 2020. \\"However, there was one exception and that was in the Depsang Plain (southeast of Karakoram Pass) where they seemed to have overstepped their Claim Line and straightened the eastward bulge.\\" Chinese Aggression in Maps: Ten maps, with an introduction and explanatory notes, Publications Division, Government of India, 1963 (via claurdearpi.net).

In April 2013, the Chinese PLA troops set up a temporary camp at the junction of the Raki Nala and Depsang Nala, claiming it to be Chinese territory. But, after a three week standoff, they withdrew as a result of a diplomatic agreement with India. In 2015 China tried setting up a watch tower near Burtsa. Any threat to Depsang affects India's DS-DBO road. Initially India had stationed about 120 tanks in the SNN, and over the years this number has increased.  Sub Sector North  The Indian military's Subsector North (SSN) is east of Siachen Glacier, located between the Saser ridge on the Chinese side and the Saltoro Ridge on the Pakistani border. With regards to a two–front war for India, this area can provide for a linkage for Pakistan and China in Ladakh. The territorial wedge created by Depsang Plains–Karakoram Pass–Shyok Valley prevents this territorial linkup.

Since the mid-1970s, Simmons has staged scenes for her camera with dolls, ventriloquist dummies, objects on legs, and people, to create photographs that reference domestic scenes. She is part of The Pictures Generation, a name given to a group of artists who came to prominence in the 1970s. The Pictures Generation also includes Cindy Sherman, Barbara Kruger, and Louise Lawler.  Early life  Simmons was born in Long Island, New York, the daughter of Dorothy \\"Dot\\" Simmons, a housewife, and Samuel Ira \\"Sam\\" Simmons, a dentist. Her parents were both of Jewish ancestry and she was raised in a Jewish community. Simmons received a BFA from Tyler School of Art in 1971.  Career   Photography  *Early black and white (1976): Simmons’ first mature works, shot in 1976, were black-and-white images taken in a dollhouse, un-peopled variations on each room in the house, particularly the bathroom, using sunlight and different angles to create a “dazzling, dreamlike stage set.” She then added a housewife doll into a kitchen set and \\"photographed the figure over and over in various positions — standing and sitting at the table, at the counter, in a corner, standing on her head with the kitchen in disarray. The mood is dramatically different than in the bathroom views.\\" *Black Series: For the Black Series, Simmons constructed spare rooms with dollhouse furniture and replicas of iconic, easily recognizable artworks. Simmons considered the photographs of these interior spaces her strongest work at the time. *Early Color Interiors (1978): In 1978, Simmons began shooting the figures in the dollhouse in color, to create the \\"Early Color Interiors\\" series. At that time, color photography was \\"more commonly associated with the artifice of commercial photography while black- and-white was perceived to be more truthful. By using the techniques and processes identified with advertising, fashion, and film, Simmons linked her work to a realm of suspended belief--the realm of fantasy and fiction that sustained many of her memories and longings.\\" *Cowboys: After much interest in her Early Color Interiors, Simmons began searching for new subject matter and decided to photograph a set of cowboy figures that belonged to Carroll Dunham. The cowboys were on horseback in an unrestrained outdoor environment, shot in a style reminiscent of television Westerns. *Water Ballet (1979-1981): In 1979, Simmons began photographing dolls in a fish tank and eventually floating underwater in a full-sized pool. During this process, she turned her underwater camera to real people swimming. The result was \\"Water Ballet,\\" a series that developed as Simmons choreographed underwater movements for her friends and photographed their interpretations. *Color Coordinated Interiors (early 1980s): In the early 1980s, she created the series \\"Color-Coordinated Interiors\\", which used Japanese dolls called Teenettes, monochrome toys of women who Simmons photographed in front of rear projection images of interior decorated rooms. The dolls matched the color theme of the rooms. *Tourism (1984): The series that followed was \\"Tourism,\\" in 1984, which also used the \\"Teenette\\" dolls, but showed them in groups visiting famous places around the world, including the Eiffel Tower, the Pyramids, the Parthenon, and the Taj Mahal. This series investigated the mediation of these places through photography and media instead of real experience. \\"She used the same strategy to shoot the \\"Tourism\\" series as she used for the \\"Color-Coordinated Interiors,\\" populating unrealistically pristine postcard views with her dolls via rear projection. The figures are color-cued to the background scene, which was often unintentionally monochromatic due owing to the poor quality of the slide.\\" The slides were collected by Simmons from tourist shops and museum collections. *Talking Objects (1987): In 1987, Simmons visited the Vent Haven Museum in Kentucky and over a period of a few years photographed various dummies and props there, resulting in the \\"Talking Objects\\" series. *Walking and Lying Objects (1987-1991): Simmons began using objects on legs in her series \\"Walking & Lying Objects\\" from the late 1980s. The first work in this series is a work from 1987 titled \\"Walking Camera I (Jimmy the Camera),\\" of Simmons's friend and former roommate, the late artist Jimmy De Sana, wearing an old-fashioned box camera costume. The photographs that follow use miniatures and small doll legs. \\"As she animates the objects, Simmons plays out various roles,\\" wrote curator Jan Howard in an essay accompanying Simmons' retrospective at the Baltimore Museum of Art. \\"Her transformed women parade across a simulated stage as if in a fashion show or a musical, wearing the accoutrements with which they are identified.\\" *Clothes Make the Man: This series of male dummy sculptures were made in collaboration with figure maker Alan Semok. The seven dummies were identical, differentiated only by their clothes and subtitles. Simmons stated that the series \\"...was just about these minute differences in the way we look or the way we act that make us feel like we’re so profoundly different.\\" art21 *Café of the Inner Mind: Simmons later took a more critical look at the dummies, photographing them in environments and using collage to interject their thoughts or visualizations. Much like the ventriloquists she had seen as a child, Simmons gave the dummies a dialogue based on her own projections. According to Simmons, \\"the dummy is such a metaphor for lying and telling the truth. The way the ventriloquist is able to say whatever he or she wants to say, through this other character. You don’t have to take responsibility for anything that you’re saying because the dummy said it or the dummy did it. It made me think about a lot of things, from news-casting to public speakers to politicians to friends.\\" *Kaleidoscope House (2001): In 2001, Simmons collaborated with architect Peter Wheelwright to design an interactive modernist dollhouse called the \\"Kaleidoscope House.\\" The house was decorated with miniature artwork and furniture by contemporary artists and designers. In the artistic statement for the project, Laurie Simmons and Peter Wheelwright wrote: \\"The Kaleidoscope House came out of our shared interests in domesticity and in particular the changing practices of home and family. Our individual work in photography and architecture has focused on these issues, and the promptings of our respective children have often figured in our thinking. Clearly, there is a need for a new dollhouse in the family playroom. Our hope is that The Kaleidoscope House with its sliding transparencies and changing aspects will give a colorful view into playful new possibilities.\\" The Kaleidoscope House has become somewhat of a cult collector's item, and the house and accessories can still be found on e-commerce websites. *The Instant Decorator (2001): Also in 2001, Simmons began her \\"Instant Decorator\\" series, which was based on a 1976 interior decorating book of the same name, that provided templates of household rooms for the client to fill with swatches of fabric and paint samples. The series features works that are collage-like and opulently filled with accessories and characters in dramatic mises en scène. *The Love Doll (2009): In 2009, Simmons began a new series called \\"The Love Doll,\\" featuring a lifesize doll from Japan. This series documents the ongoing days in the doll's life. *Kigurumi, Dollers, and How We See: After exploring dolls on a life size scale, Simmons discovered a type of Japanese costume play called kigurumi in which participants become doll-like characters by dressing in masks and bodysuits. Simmons presents this transformative social experience and relates it to our relationship with social media.Sanchez, Gabriel, \\"Laurie Simmons,\\" Artforum, April 2014  Film  In 2006, Simmons made her first film, The Music of Regret. The film is thought to be an extension of her photographs, bringing her objects to life by involving musicians, professional puppeteers, Alvin Ailey dancers, Hollywood cinematographer Ed Lachman, and actress Meryl Streep. This three-act musical creates a narrative between iconic objects found in her photographs. Simmons starred in a feature-length film by her daughter Lena Dunham, called Tiny Furniture, which was filmed in 2009 and was featured at the South by Southwest film festival in 2010. Simmons' character, Siri, was based loosely on herself. The film won various awards in 2010, including the Jury Prize for Best Narrative Feature, the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association's New Generation Awards, and the Sarasota Film Festival's Independent Visions Award. It was nominated for Gotham Awards for best Ensemble Performance, and Breakthrough Director.  Fashion  In 2008, Simmons collaborated with the designer Thakoon Panichgul to create fabrics for his Spring 2009 line. The pattern featured a variation on Simmons' series \\"Walking & Lying Objects\\" from the late eighties, which involved various objects that are animated with legs in different positions. The fabric for Thakoon's line was based on legs paired with a rose. Simmons also collaborated with Peter Jensen on his 2010 spring collection. Jensen photographed models in poses directed by Simmons based on images from fashion magazines in the '60s and '70s. The resulting photographs were then cut into paper dolls, dressed in a miniature version of Jensen's spring collection, and placed inside Simmons’ typical dollhouse tableaus. The book of photographs was released for London Fashion Week 2009.  Feminism  Much of Simmons' work concerns the role of women in society. Her 'objects on legs' photos feature consumer items such as dollhouses, cakes, guns and musical instruments with long, slender legs, intending to make a statement on traditional gender roles. In 1972, Simmons discovered a vintage dollhouse in the attic of a toy store in Liberty, New York. This was during the second wave of feminism, and dolls were viewed skeptically by many who claimed that the toys supported subtle domestic indoctrination for young girls. Simmons was drawn to the strange, strongly gendered appeal of dolls and dollhouses and began photographing them. In a March 2014 interview, Simmons stated, \\"When I picked up a camera with a group of other women, I'm not going to say it was a radical act, but we were certainly doing it in some sort of defiance of, or reaction to, a male-dominated world of painting.\\"  In popular culture  Simmons made a guest appearance on Gossip Girl in 2011 to make a portrait of the van der Woodsen family in a style that resembled her Interior Decorator series from 2001. Brooklyn-based performance collective, Carroll Simmons, takes their name from combining Simmons' last name with her husband, Carroll Dunham's first.  Personal life  Simmons lives and works in New York City and Cornwall, Connecticut with her husband, painter Carroll Dunham. They have two children, actress and writer Lena Dunham and writer/activist Cyrus Grace Dunham.

It ended in the defeat of the Polish armies of Sandomierz and Kraków provinces. The Mongols were able to move unimpeded, and plunder the abandoned city of Kraków. Background The Mongols invaded Poland in late 1240, and were advancing westwards. The Poles had already suffered a defeat (Battle of Tursko), and the Mongol forces split into two or three armies, the main of which, under Baidar, was heading towards Kraków (Cracow), a large city (and capital of the fragmented Polish Kingdom) in central-southern Poland. Two other Mongol commanders, Kadan and Orda Khan, were advancing more to the north. Battle Details of the battle were recorded in the chronicles of Jan Długosz. Incidentally, the oldest mention of the town Chmielnik dates to the battle. In 1241, it was a village (Chmielnik would gain city rights only in the mid-16th century). Polish forces were commanded by Włodzimierz, voivode (palatine) of Kraków, and Pakosław, voivode of Sandomierz, and represented most of Polish knights from these two provinces (the Kraków Province, also known as the Seniorate Province, and the Sandomierz Province) of fragmented Poland. The Mongols were commanded by Baidar. The Duke of Kraków. Bolesław V the Chaste, withdrew prior to the battle and did not participate. Bolesław's escape damaged the morale of the army, and caused many others to withdraw as well, weakening the forces available to Włodzimierz and Pakosław. While the Polish forces had the advantage in the first phase of the battle, the Mongols, seeing that they would not defeat the Poles in straight combat, feigned a retreat. When the Polish forces began to pursue them, they were hit by the Mongols' reinforcements and defeated comprehensively. Polish casualties were very heavy (Norman Davies wrote: \\"At Chmielnik, the assembled nobility of Malopolska perished to a man\\"); Włodzimierz and Pakosław were slain, Castellan of Kraków Klement of Brzeźnica and Castellan of Sandormierz Jakub Raciborowicz were both slain. Aftermath With the defeat of the Polish army, panic spread through the nearby Polish lands. Kraków, one of the largest and most prosperous cities of Poland, was abandoned, as inhabitants fled, and the Mongols spent several days pillaging it and the neighboring hamlets (accounts vary on how soon after the battle Mongols entered the city, but it is certain they burned it by March 24). In the modern town of Chmielnik there is a monument dedicated to this battle.

He was one of the select group of officers, referred to by Lord Nelson as his \\"Band of Brothers\\", who served with him at the Battle of the Nile. Early years Although he is often identified as Canadian, Hallowell's place and exact date of birth have been the subject of dispute among researchers. He was possibly born on 1 January 1761 in Boston, Massachusetts, where his British father, former naval captain Benjamin Hallowell (1723–1799), was Commissioner of the Board of Customs. His mother, Mary (Boylston) Hallowell, was the daughter of Thomas Boylston, and a first cousin of Susanna Boylston, the mother of the 2nd President of the United States, John Adams, and grandmother of the 6th President, John Quincy Adams. He was a brother of Ward Nicholas Boylston and a nephew of Governor Moses Gill. His father's job exposed Hallowell's Loyalist family to attacks as American revolutionary sentiment grew. In August 1765 the Hallowell house in Roxbury was ransacked by a mob and the family relocated to Jamaica PlainDrake, Samuel Adams: Old Landmarks and Historic Personages of Boston, page 148. J. R. Osgood & Company, 1873. Published online by Ann Arbor, Michigan: University of Michigan Library 2005] and in September 1774 his father was pursued by a furious mob of 160 mounted men who had gathered to hear news of the resignation of other customs officials. The family left the country in March 1776, at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, and their estates were stolen. They stayed for a short time in Halifax, Nova Scotia, then took a passage to England in July 1776. Educated in the private schools of England, through his father's connections with Admiral Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood, Hallowell entered the Royal Navy at a slightly later age than was normal, receiving his promotion to lieutenant on 31 August 1781. Naval career Benjamin Hallowell's naval career spanned the American Revolutionary War, the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, and he took part in a number of important actions in all three. As a lieutenant in Admiral Lord Hood's fleet, he saw action in the Battles of St. Kitts and the Saintes in 1782. He continued on active service after the end of the war. In late 1790 he was promoted to the rank of commander into , which he then sailed to the coast of Africa. Commissioned as a post-captain in August 1793, he and his ship took part in the evacuation following the Siege of Toulon in that year. He was involved in the Siege of Bastia under the command of Lord Hood, and then as a volunteer at the capture of Calvi, Corsica, in 1794 (in which Nelson lost the sight of his right eye); he was mentioned in despatches by Lord Hood for his part in this action, Abstracted from Captain A Crawford, RN, Reminiscences of a Naval Officer, During the Late War. With Sketches and Anecdotes of Distinguished Commanders. In Two Volumes. Embellished with Portraits of Admirals Sir Edward Owen and Sir Benjamin Hallowell Carew. London, Colburn, 1851 and was subsequently given command of . By 1795 he was in command of HMS Courageux, and took part with her in the Battle of Hyères. He was not aboard in December 1796 when the vessel was wrecked after an incident in the Bay of Gibraltar during bad weather. Her mooring cable parted and she was driven within range of Spanish shore batteries; Hallowell, ashore to sit at a court-martial, was denied permission to rejoin the ship and take her to safety. She was subsequently wrecked off Monte Hacho in high winds during her officers' attempts to move to a safer anchorage, with the loss of almost 500 lives.James 1837 Vol I pp 316-317 Following her loss, Hallowell served as a volunteer aboard during the Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1797). Admiral Sir John Jervis commended Hallowell to the Admiralty by for his actions during the battle. Jervis, a stern and imposing figure, informed of the superior odds facing him, he expressed determination to attack no matter how strong the opposition; Hallowell, standing with Jervis on the deck of Victory, reportedly expressed loud approbation and thumped his commander-in- chief on the back in a startling display of familiarity.(Crawford 1851) Subsequently, Hallowell received command of .James 1837 Vol II 55 Capture On 10 June 1801 Hallowell encountered Pigmy and from her learned that a French squadron under Admiral Ganteaume had put to sea. Hallowell decided to return to reinforce Sir John Warren's squadron, but on 24 June Swiftsure encountered Ganteaume. The faster French squadron, consisting of four ships of the line and a frigate, overtook the already damaged and slow, as well as undermanned, Swiftsure. Indivisible and Dix-Août succeeded in shooting away Swiftsures yards and masts, crippling her and so forcing Hallowell to surrender. Swiftsure had two men killed, two men mortally wounded, and another six wounded; the French lost 33 killed and wounded. On his repatriation, Hallowell received the court-martial that was automatic for a Royal Navy captain who had lost his ship, but was honourably acquitted. Meanwhile the French Navy took Swiftsure into service under her own name.Capture du Swiftsure Nelson's coffin L'Orient is destroyed at the Battle of the Nile. The ship in the centre, firing into L'Orient at close quarters, is Swiftsure, commanded by Hallowell. Painting by George Arnald (1763–1841). Hallowell is probably best known as the man who made Nelson a present of what would become his own coffin, after the Battle of the Nile in August 1798. Hallowell commanded , a 74-gun ship of the line, during the battle. Swiftsure engaged the French flagship L'Orient at close quarters and played a major role in her destruction. Some time later Hallowell sent Nelson a coffin Hallowell had ordered to be made from a salvaged piece of L'Orients mainmast, with an accompanying note: Nelson is said to have been pleased with the gift, keeping it propped against the wall of his cabin for some time, behind the chair in which he sat for dinner, and taking it with him to his next command. After Nelson was killed in 1805 during the Battle of Trafalgar, he was buried in the coffin Hallowell had given him.James 1837 Vol IV 96 Hallowell himself, now in command of HMS Tigre, missed the Battle of Trafalgar. Nelson had sent Tigre, along with five other vessels in his squadron, to Gibraltar for water and on convoy duty.James 1837 Volume IV 92 However his old command, Swiftsure, took part on the French side. She and her officers and crew, including Hallowell, had been captured in 1801 after a fight with a squadron of five French warships. Hallowell faced a court-martial over this incident when he was returned to England after a short time as a prisoner of war, but he was honorably acquitted of any failure of duty.James 1837 Vol III 94 Hallowell remained a serving naval officer after Nelson's death and went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Cork Station in 1818 and Commander-in-Chief, The Nore in 1821. He was promoted to the rank of Rear- Admiral of the Blue on 1 August 1811; Rear-Admiral of the White in 1812; Vice- Admiral of the Blue on 12 August 1819; Vice-Admiral of the White on 19 July 1821; and Admiral of the Blue in 1830. Honours Hallowell was awarded the Neapolitan Order of Saint Ferdinand and Merit for his actions during the siege of Corsica, an honour also presented to Nelson. He was appointed a Colonel of Royal Marines on 31 July 1810, and was number 61 amongst those appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the restructuring of the Order on 2 January 1815, and promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) on 6 June 1831. Inheritance and change of name in later life In 1828, Sir Benjamin Hallowell succeeded to the estates of the Carew family of Beddington, Surrey, on the death of his cousin, who had herself inherited them from her brother-in-law. In accordance with the terms of her will, he assumed the Carew name and coat of arms, becoming known as Admiral Sir Benjamin Hallowell Carew. He died on 2 September 1834. Hallowell-Carew married Ann Inglefield, daughter of John Nicholson Inglefield. They were the parents of Captain Charles Hallowell-Carew R.N., who married Mary Murray Maxwell, daughter of Sir Murray Maxwell and great granddaughter of Sir Alexander Maxwell, 2nd Bt., of Myrton Castle, Wigtownshire.

Rainbands pushed eastwards across the country, turning to snow across Scotland, and also Northern Ireland and Northern England on the 18th. All of the schools on the Western Isles were closed on the 18th as up to 25 cm (9 inches) of snow fell in central and eastern regions of Scotland. Several roads were forced to close. As an anticyclone dominated the weather between Sunday 23rd and Thursday 27th, cold northerly winds plagued eastern coasts of both Scotland and England. Frequent heavy snow showers affect Eastern and Northern Scotland, Eastern England and also Central Southern England. County Durham received 29 cm (11.5 inches) of lying snow on the 23rd, whilst 4 cm (1.5 inches) was reported in Dover and Folkestone, Kent, on the 25th and some minor snowfalls also affected the Midlands and the higher ground of Southwest England.  February  After a relatively mild but unsettled first half of February, Arctic air flooded southwards behind a cold front on the 18th. Snow showers affected the Midlands, Northern England, Southeast England and Northern Scotland between Sunday 20th and Monday 28th. North Yorkshire received 8 cm (3 inches) of lying snow on the 21st, whilst blizzards and 13 cm (5 inches)of lying snow forced more than 30 schools to close in Aberdeenshire. Temperatures also struggled to climb above freezing, with Buxton, Derbyshire, only reaching 0.8 °C as a maximum temperature on the 22nd. By the 25th, 30 cm (12 inches) of snow lay over the Pennines, with drifts of 1.5 metres (5 feet) reported, 50 cm (19 inches) of snow lay in County Durham and 7 cm (about 3 inches) in the Dover area of Kent. The cold, arctic weather continued right to the end of February, with further frequent snow showers in eastern regions. 54 flights were cancelled from Heathrow and hundreds of schools across the southeast were forced to shut as 27 cm (11 inches) of snow fell across Kent. 50 cm (19 inch) snow drifts were reported in Kent and East Sussex on the 27th, causing several road accidents.  March  Snow continued to fall across Scotland and Eastern England into March, with 30 vehicles involved in an accident on the M8 between Glasgow and Edinburgh, on the 1st. The snow caused more than 140 schools in Fife and 30 schools in Aberdeenshire to close or partially close, along with 20 schools and nurseries in Angus. The heaviest March snowfall for 10 years occurred across Kent on the 2nd. 30 cm (12 inch) drifts on the North Downs caused the closure of 400+ schools and the M2 and Operation Stack was implemented on the M20 motorway. 200 homes also lost their electricity supply in Kent, Surrey and East Sussex. Snow continued to fall in these regions on the 3rd and 4th, temporarily closing Luton and Stansted airports. Meanwhile, further snow affected Northeast Scotland and Northeast England, with significant accumulations reported and hundreds of school closures. However, milder weather made a return across the UK, however as showers pushed eastwards they turned to snow across Northern Scotland during the night of the 13th and 14 March. March continued and ended on a relatively mild but unsettled note.  April  Typically, a showery start to April was replaced with a return to cold, northerly winds as a weak cold front passed eastwards on 7 and 8 April. This brought a period of heavy snow to the Scottish Highlands, blocking many high level routes in the area. Showers also turned briefly to snow as far south as the Derbyshire Peaks on the night of the 15th. This was the last snow event of the season.  November  As two cold fronts pushed eastwards on the 24th, squally showers turned to sleet and snow across East Anglia, Wales and Southwest England. Up to 30 cm of snow was reported in Devon and Cornwall on the 25th, with 2 metre drifts. The snowfall trapped approximately 1000 people on the A30 near Kennards House, across Bodmin Moor, Cornwall, after several snow related accidents blocked the road. The snow caused a six-mile tailback and people were advised by the police to remain in their vehicles. A Royal Marine and two RAF and Navy helicopters, and a convoy of four-wheel drive vehicles, organised by Devon and Cornwall police, took stranded drivers to leisure centres and emergency shelters for the night. 68 schools across Cornwall were forced to close because of the bad weather. Blizzards also affected Northern Scotland and Northern Ireland, where four men were stranded on the Cairngorms. Heavy snow showers continued to fall over the Grampians and the Highlands on the 28th, and snow showers also reported in Manchester, over the Pennines and North York Moors. These also pushed southwards into the Midlands and Lincolnshire during the afternoon, before affecting Gloucestershire during the evening, especially between 17:00-20:00GMT. Approximately 400 cars were abandoned on the A417 between Gloucester and Cirencester due to snowy conditions, and the A57 Snake Pass in the Peak District was closed for a time.  December  A brief northerly blast mid-month brought frequent hail and snow showers down the east coast, where a covering of snow was reported in Norfolk on the 17th. Then, after a quiet and relatively settled Christmas period, showers over Essex and Kent turned increasingly wintry on Boxing day night as cold air arrived from the east. Here the snow settled, and frequent snow showers in Southeast England and East Anglia on 27 and 28 December gave a covering of 30 cm across the Downs in Kent, causing some roads and the Channel Tunnel terminal to close for two hours. By the 28th, the snow showers began to affect other northern regions, including Norfolk, Lincolnshire, West Yorkshire and Northeast England. North Yorkshire received 20 cm of snow over high ground, whilst the snow caused huge tailbacks on the A1 between Alnwick and Berwick. The snow showers petered later on the 29th as outbreaks of rain, sleet and hill snow moved into western areas. On Friday 30 December, a band of heavy rain pushed eastwards, with heavy snow on the leading edge. This brought several hours of snow followed by rain, where 20 cm fell in some parts of Yorkshire, with snowdrifts of 1 metre reported. The snow caused hundreds of drivers to be stranded on the A1079 during the late morning at Arras Hill in the East Riding of Yorkshire. There was a marked temperature difference on the 30th, with Redesdale, Northumberland, only reaching 0.4 °C as a maximum, whilst some places reached 12 °C in Southwest England.

It is named after the adjacent lake. History In 1840, the area was opened to settlement, and that same year the Saint-Nom-de-Marie Parish was founded. The municipality was formed in 1872. It was originally called Hincks, in honour of politician Sir Francis Hincks (1807-1885), who was then finance minister in the Macdonald cabinet. After this cabinet fell in 1873, Hincks name was replaced in popular usage by the name of the parish, and then by the name of the lake. In 1882, the post office opened, using the English name Lake St. Mary and renamed to Lac-Sainte-Marie in 1916. In 1928 the village was flooded to create the Paugan hydroelectric dam. Ninety percent of the village had to be relocated to higher ground. The church, located in the center of the old town, was submerged. The submerged town attracted the attention of many tourists from the cities of Ottawa and Gatineau. In 1975, Lac-Sainte-Marie became the official name, and paid tribute to a forgotten pioneer, Marie Léveillée, mother of Jean-Marie Léveillée who was the first settler in the area.

Biography Neuberg was born on 30 October 1840 in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg. He first studied at a local school, the Athénée de Luxembourg, then progressed to Ghent University, studying at the École normale des Sciences of the science faculty. After graduation, Neuberg taught at several institutions. Between 1862 and 1865, he taught at the École Normale de Nivelle. For the next sixteen years, he taught at the Athénée Royal d'Arlon, though he also taught at the École Normale at Bruges from 1868 onwards. Retrieved on 2008-09-16. Neuberg switched from his previous two schools to the Athénée Royal de Liège in 1878. He became an extraordinary professor in the university in the same city in 1884, and was promoted to ordinary professor in 1887. He held this latter position until his retirement in 1910. A year after his retirement, he was elected president of the Belgian Royal Academy, which he had joined earlier, in 1866, after taking Belgian nationality despite his origins. The professor died on 22 March 1926 in Liège, Belgium, and was commemorated in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society. Contributions Neuberg worked mainly in geometry, particularly the geometry of the triangle, The Neuberg cubic, a curve defined from a triangle, is named after him, and passes through the isodynamic points of a triangle which he discovered and published in 1885.For the discovery of the isodynamic points, see e.g. . For the Neuberg cubic, see . Neuberg was also involved in a number of mathematical journals. With Eugène Catalan and Paul Mansion, he founded the journal Nouvelle correspondance mathématique. This journal was founded to honour the earlier journal Correspondance mathématique et physique, which had been edited by Lambert Quetelet and Jean Garnier. Correspondance was published until 1880; after this, Catalan advised Mansion and Neuberg to continue publication of a new journal. They followed his advice, creating Mathesis in 1881, which is perhaps Neuberg's best-known journal. Several mathematical societies included Neuberg: the Institute of Science of Luxembourg, the Royal Society of Science of Liège, Mathematical Society of Amsterdam, and the Belgian Royal Academy noted in the biography above.

The first two pronunciations are favored more in the US and the others in the UK, however all pronunciations can be heard in any English-speaking country. or funguses) is any member of the group of eukaryotic organisms that includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as the more familiar mushrooms. These organisms are classified as a kingdom, which is separate from the other eukaryotic life kingdoms of plants and animals. A characteristic that places fungi in a different kingdom from plants, bacteria, and some protists is chitin in their cell walls. Similar to animals, fungi are heterotrophs; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment. Fungi do not photosynthesize. Growth is their means of mobility, except for spores (a few of which are flagellated), which may travel through the air or water. Fungi are the principal decomposers in ecological systems. These and other differences place fungi in a single group of related organisms, named the Eumycota (true fungi or Eumycetes), which share a common ancestor (from a monophyletic group), an interpretation that is also strongly supported by molecular phylogenetics. This fungal group is distinct from the structurally similar myxomycetes (slime molds) and oomycetes (water molds). The discipline of biology devoted to the study of fungi is known as mycology (from the Greek μύκης ', mushroom). In the past, mycology was regarded as a branch of botany, although it is now known fungi are genetically more closely related to animals than to plants. Abundant worldwide, most fungi are inconspicuous because of the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a leavening agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies. The fungus kingdom encompasses an enormous diversity of taxa with varied ecologies, life cycle strategies, and morphologies ranging from unicellular aquatic chytrids to large mushrooms. However, little is known of the true biodiversity of Kingdom Fungi, which has been estimated at 2.2 million to 3.8 million species. Of these, only about 120,000 have been described, with over 8,000 species known to be detrimental to plants and at least 300 that can be pathogenic to humans. Ever since the pioneering 18th and 19th century taxonomical works of Carl Linnaeus, Christian Hendrik Persoon, and Elias Magnus Fries, fungi have been classified according to their morphology (e.g., characteristics such as spore color or microscopic features) or physiology. Advances in molecular genetics have opened the way for DNA analysis to be incorporated into taxonomy, which has sometimes challenged the historical groupings based on morphology and other traits. Phylogenetic studies published in the last decade have helped reshape the classification within Kingdom Fungi, which is divided into one subkingdom, seven phyla, and ten subphyla.  Etymology  The English word fungus is directly adopted from the Latin fungus (mushroom), used in the writings of Horace and Pliny. This in turn is derived from the Greek word sphongos (σφόγγος \\"sponge\\"), which refers to the macroscopic structures and morphology of mushrooms and molds;Ainsworth, p. 2. the root is also used in other languages, such as the German Schwamm (\\"sponge\\") and Schimmel (\\"mold\\"). The word mycology is derived from the Greek (μύκης \\"mushroom\\") and logos (λόγος \\"discourse\\").Alexopoulos et al., p. 1. It denotes the scientific study of fungi. The Latin adjectival form of \\"mycology\\" (mycologicæ) appeared as early as 1796 in a book on the subject by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. The word appeared in English as early as 1824 in a book by Robert Kaye Greville. From p. 65: \\"This little plant will probably not prove rare in Great Britain, when mycology shall be more studied.\\" In 1836 the English naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley's publication The English Flora of Sir James Edward Smith, Vol. 5. also refers to mycology as the study of fungi. From p. 7: \\"This has arisen, I conceive, partly from the practical difficulty of preserving specimens for the herbarium, partly from the absence of any general work, adapted to the immense advances which have of late years been made in the study of Mycology.\\" A group of all the fungi present in a particular area or geographic region is known as mycobiota (plural noun, no singular), e.g., \\"the mycobiota of Ireland\\".  Characteristics  Fungal hyphae cells Before the introduction of molecular methods for phylogenetic analysis, taxonomists considered fungi to be members of the plant kingdom because of similarities in lifestyle: both fungi and plants are mainly immobile, and have similarities in general morphology and growth habitat. Like plants, fungi often grow in soil and, in the case of mushrooms, form conspicuous fruit bodies, which sometimes resemble plants such as mosses. The fungi are now considered a separate kingdom, distinct from both plants and animals, from which they appear to have diverged around one billion years ago (around the start of the Neoproterozoic Era). Some morphological, biochemical, and genetic features are shared with other organisms, while others are unique to the fungi, clearly separating them from the other kingdoms: Shared features: * With other eukaryotes: Fungal cells contain membrane-bound nuclei with chromosomes that contain DNA with noncoding regions called introns and coding regions called exons. Fungi have membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria, sterol-containing membranes, and ribosomes of the 80S type.Deacon, p. 4. They have a characteristic range of soluble carbohydrates and storage compounds, including sugar alcohols (e.g., mannitol), disaccharides, (e.g., trehalose), and polysaccharides (e.g., glycogen, which is also found in animalsDeacon, pp. 128–129.). * With animals: Fungi lack chloroplasts and are heterotrophic organisms and so require preformed organic compounds as energy sources.Alexopoulos et al., pp. 28–33. * With plants: Fungi have a cell wallAlexopoulos et al., pp. 31–32. and vacuoles. They reproduce by both sexual and asexual means, and like basal plant groups (such as ferns and mosses) produce spores. Similar to mosses and algae, fungi typically have haploid nuclei.Deacon, p. 58. * With euglenoids and bacteria: Higher fungi, euglenoids, and some bacteria produce the amino acid L-lysine in specific biosynthesis steps, called the α-aminoadipate pathway. * The cells of most fungi grow as tubular, elongated, and thread-like (filamentous) structures called hyphae, which may contain multiple nuclei and extend by growing at their tips. Each tip contains a set of aggregated vesicles—cellular structures consisting of proteins, lipids, and other organic molecules—called the Spitzenkörper.Alexopoulos et al., pp. 27–28. Both fungi and oomycetes grow as filamentous hyphal cells.Alexopoulos et al., p. 685. In contrast, similar- looking organisms, such as filamentous green algae, grow by repeated cell division within a chain of cells. There are also single-celled fungi (yeasts) that do not form hyphae, and some fungi have both hyphal and yeast forms.Alexopoulos et al., p. 30. * In common with some plant and animal species, more than 70 fungal species display bioluminescence. Unique features: * Some species grow as unicellular yeasts that reproduce by budding or fission. Dimorphic fungi can switch between a yeast phase and a hyphal phase in response to environmental conditions. * The fungal cell wall is composed of glucans and chitin; while glucans are also found in plants and chitin in the exoskeleton of arthropods,Alexopoulos et al., pp. 32–33. fungi are the only organisms that combine these two structural molecules in their cell wall. Unlike those of plants and oomycetes, fungal cell walls do not contain cellulose.Alexopoulos et al., p. 33. Omphalotus nidiformis, a bioluminescent mushroom Most fungi lack an efficient system for the long-distance transport of water and nutrients, such as the xylem and phloem in many plants. To overcome this limitation, some fungi, such as Armillaria, form rhizomorphs, which resemble and perform functions similar to the roots of plants. As eukaryotes, fungi possess a biosynthetic pathway for producing terpenes that uses mevalonic acid and pyrophosphate as chemical building blocks. Plants and some other organisms have an additional terpene biosynthesis pathway in their chloroplasts, a structure fungi and animals do not have. Fungi produce several secondary metabolites that are similar or identical in structure to those made by plants. Many of the plant and fungal enzymes that make these compounds differ from each other in sequence and other characteristics, which indicates separate origins and convergent evolution of these enzymes in the fungi and plants.  Diversity  Bracket fungi on a tree stump Fungi have a worldwide distribution, and grow in a wide range of habitats, including extreme environments such as deserts or areas with high salt concentrations or ionizing radiation, as well as in deep sea sediments. Some can survive the intense UV and cosmic radiation encountered during space travel. Most grow in terrestrial environments, though several species live partly or solely in aquatic habitats, such as the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a parasite that has been responsible for a worldwide decline in amphibian populations. This organism spends part of its life cycle as a motile zoospore, enabling it to propel itself through water and enter its amphibian host. Other examples of aquatic fungi include those living in hydrothermal areas of the ocean. Around 120,000 species of fungi have been described by taxonomists, but the global biodiversity of the fungus kingdom is not fully understood. A 2017 estimate suggests there may be between 2.2 and 3.8 million species. In mycology, species have historically been distinguished by a variety of methods and concepts. Classification based on morphological characteristics, such as the size and shape of spores or fruiting structures, has traditionally dominated fungal taxonomy.Kirk et al., p. 489. Species may also be distinguished by their biochemical and physiological characteristics, such as their ability to metabolize certain biochemicals, or their reaction to chemical tests. The biological species concept discriminates species based on their ability to mate. The application of molecular tools, such as DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, to study diversity has greatly enhanced the resolution and added robustness to estimates of genetic diversity within various taxonomic groups.  Mycology  Mycology is the branch of biology concerned with the systematic study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy, and their use to humans as a source of medicine, food, and psychotropic substances consumed for religious purposes, as well as their dangers, such as poisoning or infection. The field of phytopathology, the study of plant diseases, is closely related because many plant pathogens are fungi. In 1729, Pier Antonio Micheli first published descriptions of fungi. The use of fungi by humans dates back to prehistory; Ötzi the Iceman, a well-preserved mummy of a 5,300-year-old Neolithic man found frozen in the Austrian Alps, carried two species of polypore mushrooms that may have been used as tinder (Fomes fomentarius), or for medicinal purposes (Piptoporus betulinus). Ancient peoples have used fungi as food sources–often unknowingly–for millennia, in the preparation of leavened bread and fermented juices. Some of the oldest written records contain references to the destruction of crops that were probably caused by pathogenic fungi.Ainsworth, p. 1.  History  Mycology is a relatively new science that became systematic after the development of the microscope in the 17th century. Although fungal spores were first observed by Giambattista della Porta in 1588, the seminal work in the development of mycology is considered to be the publication of Pier Antonio Micheli's 1729 work Nova plantarum genera.Alexopoulos et al., pp. 1–2. Micheli not only observed spores but also showed that, under the proper conditions, they could be induced into growing into the same species of fungi from which they originated.Ainsworth, p. 18. Extending the use of the binomial system of nomenclature introduced by Carl Linnaeus in his Species plantarum (1753), the Dutch Christian Hendrik Persoon (1761–1836) established the first classification of mushrooms with such skill as to be considered a founder of modern mycology. Later, Elias Magnus Fries (1794–1878) further elaborated the classification of fungi, using spore color and microscopic characteristics, methods still used by taxonomists today. Other notable early contributors to mycology in the 17th–19th and early 20th centuries include Miles Joseph Berkeley, August Carl Joseph Corda, Anton de Bary, the brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne, Arthur H. R. Buller, Curtis G. Lloyd, and Pier Andrea Saccardo. The 20th century has seen a modernization of mycology that has come from advances in biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and biotechnology. The use of DNA sequencing technologies and phylogenetic analysis has provided new insights into fungal relationships and biodiversity, and has challenged traditional morphology-based groupings in fungal taxonomy.  Morphology   Microscopic structures  An environmental isolate of Penicillium Most fungi grow as hyphae, which are cylindrical, thread-like structures 2–10µm in diameter and up to several centimeters in length. Hyphae grow at their tips (apices); new hyphae are typically formed by emergence of new tips along existing hyphae by a process called branching, or occasionally growing hyphal tips fork, giving rise to two parallel-growing hyphae. Hyphae also sometimes fuse when they come into contact, a process called hyphal fusion (or anastomosis). These growth processes lead to the development of a mycelium, an interconnected network of hyphae. Hyphae can be either septate or coenocytic. Septate hyphae are divided into compartments separated by cross walls (internal cell walls, called septa, that are formed at right angles to the cell wall giving the hypha its shape), with each compartment containing one or more nuclei; coenocytic hyphae are not compartmentalized.Deacon, p. 51. Septa have pores that allow cytoplasm, organelles, and sometimes nuclei to pass through; an example is the dolipore septum in fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota.Deacon, p. 57. Coenocytic hyphae are in essence multinucleate supercells. Many species have developed specialized hyphal structures for nutrient uptake from living hosts; examples include haustoria in plant-parasitic species of most fungal phyla, and arbuscules of several mycorrhizal fungi, which penetrate into the host cells to consume nutrients. Although fungi are opisthokonts—a grouping of evolutionarily related organisms broadly characterized by a single posterior flagellum—all phyla except for the chytrids have lost their posterior flagella. Fungi are unusual among the eukaryotes in having a cell wall that, in addition to glucans (e.g., β-1,3-glucan) and other typical components, also contains the biopolymer chitin.  Macroscopic structures  Armillaria solidipes Fungal mycelia can become visible to the naked eye, for example, on various surfaces and substrates, such as damp walls and spoiled food, where they are commonly called molds. Mycelia grown on solid agar media in laboratory petri dishes are usually referred to as colonies. These colonies can exhibit growth shapes and colors (due to spores or pigmentation) that can be used as diagnostic features in the identification of species or groups.Hanson, pp. 127–141. Some individual fungal colonies can reach extraordinary dimensions and ages as in the case of a clonal colony of Armillaria solidipes, which extends over an area of more than 900ha (3.5 square miles), with an estimated age of nearly 9,000years. The apothecium—a specialized structure important in sexual reproduction in the ascomycetes—is a cup-shaped fruit body that is often macroscopic and holds the hymenium, a layer of tissue containing the spore-bearing cells.Alexopoulos et al., pp. 204–205. The fruit bodies of the basidiomycetes (basidiocarps) and some ascomycetes can sometimes grow very large, and many are well known as mushrooms.  Growth and physiology  alt=Time-lapse photography sequence of a Mold growth covering a decaying peach. The frames were taken approximately 12 hours apart over a period of six days. The growth of fungi as hyphae on or in solid substrates or as single cells in aquatic environments is adapted for the efficient extraction of nutrients, because these growth forms have high surface area to volume ratios. Hyphae are specifically adapted for growth on solid surfaces, and to invade substrates and tissues. They can exert large penetrative mechanical forces; for example, many plant pathogens, including Magnaporthe grisea, form a structure called an appressorium that evolved to puncture plant tissues. The pressure generated by the appressorium, directed against the plant epidermis, can exceed . The filamentous fungus Paecilomyces lilacinus uses a similar structure to penetrate the eggs of nematodes. The mechanical pressure exerted by the appressorium is generated from physiological processes that increase intracellular turgor by producing osmolytes such as glycerol. Adaptations such as these are complemented by hydrolytic enzymes secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules—such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids—into smaller molecules that may then be absorbed as nutrients. The vast majority of filamentous fungi grow in a polar fashion (extending in one direction) by elongation at the tip (apex) of the hypha. Other forms of fungal growth include intercalary extension (longitudinal expansion of hyphal compartments that are below the apex) as in the case of some endophytic fungi, or growth by volume expansion during the development of mushroom stipes and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures consisting of somatic and reproductive cells—a feature independently evolved in animals and plants—has several functions, including the development of fruit bodies for dissemination of sexual spores (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and intercellular communication. The fungi are traditionally considered heterotrophs, organisms that rely solely on carbon fixed by other organisms for metabolism. Fungi have evolved a high degree of metabolic versatility that allows them to use a diverse range of organic substrates for growth, including simple compounds such as nitrate, ammonia, acetate, or ethanol. In some species the pigment melanin may play a role in extracting energy from ionizing radiation, such as gamma radiation. This form of \\"radiotrophic\\" growth has been described for only a few species, the effects on growth rates are small, and the underlying biophysical and biochemical processes are not well known. This process might bear similarity to CO2 fixation via visible light, but instead uses ionizing radiation as a source of energy.  Reproduction  Polyporus squamosus Fungal reproduction is complex, reflecting the differences in lifestyles and genetic makeup within this diverse kingdom of organisms.Alexopoulos et al., pp. 48–56. It is estimated that a third of all fungi reproduce using more than one method of propagation; for example, reproduction may occur in two well-differentiated stages within the life cycle of a species, the teleomorph and the anamorph.Kirk et al., p. 633. Environmental conditions trigger genetically determined developmental states that lead to the creation of specialized structures for sexual or asexual reproduction. These structures aid reproduction by efficiently dispersing spores or spore-containing propagules.  Asexual reproduction  Asexual reproduction occurs via vegetative spores (conidia) or through mycelial fragmentation. Mycelial fragmentation occurs when a fungal mycelium separates into pieces, and each component grows into a separate mycelium. Mycelial fragmentation and vegetative spores maintain clonal populations adapted to a specific niche, and allow more rapid dispersal than sexual reproduction. The \\"Fungi imperfecti\\" (fungi lacking the perfect or sexual stage) or Deuteromycota comprise all the species that lack an observable sexual cycle. Deuteromycota is not an accepted taxonomic clade, and is now taken to mean simply fungi that lack a known sexual stage.  Sexual reproduction  Sexual reproduction with meiosis has been directly observed in all fungal phyla except Glomeromycota (genetic analysis suggests meiosis in Glomeromycota as well). It differs in many aspects from sexual reproduction in animals or plants. Differences also exist between fungal groups and can be used to discriminate species by morphological differences in sexual structures and reproductive strategies. Mating experiments between fungal isolates may identify species on the basis of biological species concepts. The major fungal groupings have initially been delineated based on the morphology of their sexual structures and spores; for example, the spore-containing structures, asci and basidia, can be used in the identification of ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, respectively. Fungi employ two mating systems: heterothallic species allow mating only between individuals of opposite mating type, whereas homothallic species can mate, and sexually reproduce, with any other individual or itself. Most fungi have both a haploid and a diploid stage in their life cycles. In sexually reproducing fungi, compatible individuals may combine by fusing their hyphae together into an interconnected network; this process, anastomosis, is required for the initiation of the sexual cycle. Many ascomycetes and basidiomycetes go through a dikaryotic stage, in which the nuclei inherited from the two parents do not combine immediately after cell fusion, but remain separate in the hyphal cells (see heterokaryosis).Jennings and Lysek, pp. 107–114. The 8-spore asci of Morchella elata, viewed with phase contrast microscopy In ascomycetes, dikaryotic hyphae of the hymenium (the spore-bearing tissue layer) form a characteristic hook at the hyphal septum. During cell division, formation of the hook ensures proper distribution of the newly divided nuclei into the apical and basal hyphal compartments. An ascus (plural asci) is then formed, in which karyogamy (nuclear fusion) occurs. Asci are embedded in an ascocarp, or fruiting body. Karyogamy in the asci is followed immediately by meiosis and the production of ascospores. After dispersal, the ascospores may germinate and form a new haploid mycelium.Deacon, p. 31. Sexual reproduction in basidiomycetes is similar to that of the ascomycetes. Compatible haploid hyphae fuse to produce a dikaryotic mycelium. However, the dikaryotic phase is more extensive in the basidiomycetes, often also present in the vegetatively growing mycelium. A specialized anatomical structure, called a clamp connection, is formed at each hyphal septum. As with the structurally similar hook in the ascomycetes, the clamp connection in the basidiomycetes is required for controlled transfer of nuclei during cell division, to maintain the dikaryotic stage with two genetically different nuclei in each hyphal compartment.Alexopoulos et al., pp. 492–493. A basidiocarp is formed in which club-like structures known as basidia generate haploid basidiospores after karyogamy and meiosis.Jennings and Lysek, p. 142. The most commonly known basidiocarps are mushrooms, but they may also take other forms (see Morphology section). In fungi formerly classified as Zygomycota, haploid hyphae of two individuals fuse, forming a gametangium, a specialized cell structure that becomes a fertile gamete- producing cell. The gametangium develops into a zygospore, a thick-walled spore formed by the union of gametes. When the zygospore germinates, it undergoes meiosis, generating new haploid hyphae, which may then form asexual sporangiospores. These sporangiospores allow the fungus to rapidly disperse and germinate into new genetically identical haploid fungal mycelia.Deacon, pp. 21–24.  Spore dispersal  Both asexual and sexual spores or sporangiospores are often actively dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures as well as traveling through the air over long distances.The bird's nest fungus Cyathus stercoreus Specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as spore surface structures (such as hydrophobins), enable efficient spore ejection. For example, the structure of the spore-bearing cells in some ascomycete species is such that the buildup of substances affecting cell volume and fluid balance enables the explosive discharge of spores into the air. The forcible discharge of single spores termed ballistospores involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000g; the net result is that the spore is ejected 0.01–0.02cm, sufficient distance for it to fall through the gills or pores into the air below.Kirk et al., p. 495. Other fungi, like the puffballs, rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces. The hydnoid fungi (tooth fungi) produce spores on pendant, tooth-like or spine-like projections. The bird's nest fungi use the force of falling water drops to liberate the spores from cup-shaped fruiting bodies. Another strategy is seen in the stinkhorns, a group of fungi with lively colors and putrid odor that attract insects to disperse their spores.Alexopoulos et al., p. 545. Most of the researched species of fungus are transported by wind. Such species often produce dry or hydrophobic spores which do not absorb water and are readily scattered by raindrops, for example. Homothallism In homothallic sexual reproduction, two haploid nuclei derived from the same individual fuse to form a zygote that can then undergo meiosis. Homothallic fungi include species with an aspergillus-like asexual stage (anamorphs) occurring in numerous different genera, several species of the ascomycete genus Cochliobolus, and the ascomycete Pneumocystis jiroveccii. Heitman reviewed evidence bearing on the evolution of sexual reproduction in the fungi and concluded that the earliest mode of sexual reproduction among eukaryotes was likely homothallism, that is, self-fertile unisexual reproduction.  Other sexual processes  Besides regular sexual reproduction with meiosis, certain fungi, such as those in the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus, may exchange genetic material via parasexual processes, initiated by anastomosis between hyphae and plasmogamy of fungal cells.Jennings and Lysek, pp. 114–115. The frequency and relative importance of parasexual events is unclear and may be lower than other sexual processes. It is known to play a role in intraspecific hybridization and is likely required for hybridization between species, which has been associated with major events in fungal evolution.  Evolution  Prototaxites milwaukeensis (Penhallow, 1908)---a Middle Devonian fungus from Wisconsin. In contrast to plants and animals, the early fossil record of the fungi is meager. Factors that likely contribute to the under-representation of fungal species among fossils include the nature of fungal fruiting bodies, which are soft, fleshy, and easily degradable tissues and the microscopic dimensions of most fungal structures, which therefore are not readily evident. Fungal fossils are difficult to distinguish from those of other microbes, and are most easily identified when they resemble extant fungi. Often recovered from a permineralized plant or animal host, these samples are typically studied by making thin-section preparations that can be examined with light microscopy or transmission electron microscopy.Taylor and Taylor, p. 19. Researchers study compression fossils by dissolving the surrounding matrix with acid and then using light or scanning electron microscopy to examine surface details.Taylor and Taylor, pp. 7–12. The earliest fossils possessing features typical of fungi date to the Paleoproterozoic era, some (Ma); these multicellular benthic organisms had filamentous structures capable of anastomosis. Other studies (2009) estimate the arrival of fungal organisms at about 760–1060Ma on the basis of comparisons of the rate of evolution in closely related groups. For much of the Paleozoic Era (542–251Ma), the fungi appear to have been aquatic and consisted of organisms similar to the extant chytrids in having flagellum- bearing spores. The evolutionary adaptation from an aquatic to a terrestrial lifestyle necessitated a diversification of ecological strategies for obtaining nutrients, including parasitism, saprobism, and the development of mutualistic relationships such as mycorrhiza and lichenization.Taylor and Taylor, pp. 84–94 and 106–107. Recent (2009) studies suggest that the ancestral ecological state of the Ascomycota was saprobism, and that independent lichenization events have occurred multiple times. In May 2019, scientists reported the discovery of a fossilized fungus, named Ourasphaira giraldae, in the Canadian Arctic, that may have grown on land a billion years ago, well before plants were living on land. Earlier, it had been presumed that the fungi colonized the land during the Cambrian (542–488.3Ma), also long before land plants. Fossilized hyphae and spores recovered from the Ordovician of Wisconsin (460Ma) resemble modern-day Glomerales, and existed at a time when the land flora likely consisted of only non-vascular bryophyte-like plants. Prototaxites, which was probably a fungus or lichen, would have been the tallest organism of the late Silurian and early Devonian. Fungal fossils do not become common and uncontroversial until the early Devonian (416–359.2Ma), when they occur abundantly in the Rhynie chert, mostly as Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota. At about this same time, approximately 400Ma, the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota diverged, and all modern classes of fungi were present by the Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian, 318.1–299Ma). Lichen- like fossils have been found in the Doushantuo Formation in southern China dating back to 635–551Ma. Lichens formed a component of the early terrestrial ecosystems, and the estimated age of the oldest terrestrial lichen fossil is 400Ma; this date corresponds to the age of the oldest known sporocarp fossil, a Paleopyrenomycites species found in the Rhynie Chert. The oldest fossil with microscopic features resembling modern-day basidiomycetes is Palaeoancistrus, found permineralized with a fern from the Pennsylvanian. Rare in the fossil record are the Homobasidiomycetes (a taxon roughly equivalent to the mushroom- producing species of the Agaricomycetes). Two amber-preserved specimens provide evidence that the earliest known mushroom-forming fungi (the extinct species Archaeomarasmius leggetti) appeared during the late Cretaceous, 90Ma. Some time after the Permian–Triassic extinction event (251.4Ma), a fungal spike (originally thought to be an extraordinary abundance of fungal spores in sediments) formed, suggesting that fungi were the dominant life form at this time, representing nearly 100% of the available fossil record for this period. However, the relative proportion of fungal spores relative to spores formed by algal species is difficult to assess, the spike did not appear worldwide, and in many places it did not fall on the Permian–Triassic boundary. 65 million years ago, immediately after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that famously killed off most dinosaurs, there is a dramatic increase in evidence of fungi, apparently the death of most plant and animal species leading to a huge fungal bloom like \\"a massive compost heap\\".  Taxonomy  Although commonly included in botany curricula and textbooks, fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants and are placed with the animals in the monophyletic group of opisthokonts. Analyses using molecular phylogenetics support a monophyletic origin of fungi. The taxonomy of fungi is in a state of constant flux, especially due to recent research based on DNA comparisons. These current phylogenetic analyses often overturn classifications based on older and sometimes less discriminative methods based on morphological features and biological species concepts obtained from experimental matings.See Palaeos Fungi: Fungi for an introduction to fungal taxonomy, including recent controversies. archive There is no unique generally accepted system at the higher taxonomic levels and there are frequent name changes at every level, from species upwards. Efforts among researchers are now underway to establish and encourage usage of a unified and more consistent nomenclature. Fungal species can also have multiple scientific names depending on their life cycle and mode (sexual or asexual) of reproduction. Web sites such as Index Fungorum and ITIS list current names of fungal species (with cross-references to older synonyms). The 2007 classification of Kingdom Fungi is the result of a large-scale collaborative research effort involving dozens of mycologists and other scientists working on fungal taxonomy. It recognizes seven phyla, two of which—the Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota—are contained within a branch representing subkingdom Dikarya, the most species rich and familiar group, including all the mushrooms, most food-spoilage molds, most plant pathogenic fungi, and the beer, wine, and bread yeasts. The accompanying cladogram depicts the major fungal taxa and their relationship to opisthokont and unikont organisms, based on the work of Philippe Silar, \\"The Mycota: A Comprehensive Treatise on Fungi as Experimental Systems for Basic and Applied Research\\" and Tedersoo et al. 2018. The lengths of the branches are not proportional to evolutionary distances.  Taxonomic groups  Main groups of fungi. The major phyla (sometimes called divisions) of fungi have been classified mainly on the basis of characteristics of their sexual reproductive structures. Currently, seven phyla are proposed: Microsporidia, Chytridiomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Neocallimastigomycota, Glomeromycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota. Phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that the Microsporidia, unicellular parasites of animals and protists, are fairly recent and highly derived endobiotic fungi (living within the tissue of another species). One 2006 study concludes that the Microsporidia are a sister group to the true fungi; that is, they are each other's closest evolutionary relative. Hibbett and colleagues suggest that this analysis does not clash with their classification of the Fungi, and although the Microsporidia are elevated to phylum status, it is acknowledged that further analysis is required to clarify evolutionary relationships within this group. The Chytridiomycota are commonly known as chytrids. These fungi are distributed worldwide. Chytrids and their close relatives Neocallimastigomycota and Blastocladiomycota (below) are the only fungi with active motility, producing zoospores that are capable of active movement through aqueous phases with a single flagellum, leading early taxonomists to classify them as protists. Molecular phylogenies, inferred from rRNA sequences in ribosomes, suggest that the Chytrids are a basal group divergent from the other fungal phyla, consisting of four major clades with suggestive evidence for paraphyly or possibly polyphyly. The Blastocladiomycota were previously considered a taxonomic clade within the Chytridiomycota. Recent molecular data and ultrastructural characteristics, however, place the Blastocladiomycota as a sister clade to the Zygomycota, Glomeromycota, and Dikarya (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). The blastocladiomycetes are saprotrophs, feeding on decomposing organic matter, and they are parasites of all eukaryotic groups. Unlike their close relatives, the chytrids, most of which exhibit zygotic meiosis, the blastocladiomycetes undergo sporic meiosis. The Neocallimastigomycota were earlier placed in the phylum Chytridomycota. Members of this small phylum are anaerobic organisms, living in the digestive system of larger herbivorous mammals and in other terrestrial and aquatic environments enriched in cellulose (e.g., domestic waste landfill sites). They lack mitochondria but contain hydrogenosomes of mitochondrial origin. As in the related chrytrids, neocallimastigomycetes form zoospores that are posteriorly uniflagellate or polyflagellate. Arbuscular mycorrhiza seen under microscope. Flax root cortical cells containing paired arbuscules. Diagram of an apothecium (the typical cup-like reproductive structure of Ascomycetes) showing sterile tissues as well as developing and mature asci. Members of the Glomeromycota form arbuscular mycorrhizae, a form of mutualist symbiosis wherein fungal hyphae invade plant root cells and both species benefit from the resulting increased supply of nutrients. All known Glomeromycota species reproduce asexually. The symbiotic association between the Glomeromycota and plants is ancient, with evidence dating to 400 million years ago. Formerly part of the Zygomycota (commonly known as 'sugar' and 'pin' molds), the Glomeromycota were elevated to phylum status in 2001 and now replace the older phylum Zygomycota. Fungi that were placed in the Zygomycota are now being reassigned to the Glomeromycota, or the subphyla incertae sedis Mucoromycotina, Kickxellomycotina, the Zoopagomycotina and the Entomophthoromycotina. Some well-known examples of fungi formerly in the Zygomycota include black bread mold (Rhizopus stolonifer), and Pilobolus species, capable of ejecting spores several meters through the air.Alexopoulos et al., p. 145. Medically relevant genera include Mucor, Rhizomucor, and Rhizopus. The Ascomycota, commonly known as sac fungi or ascomycetes, constitute the largest taxonomic group within the Eumycota. These fungi form meiotic spores called ascospores, which are enclosed in a special sac-like structure called an ascus. This phylum includes morels, a few mushrooms and truffles, unicellular yeasts (e.g., of the genera Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, and Candida), and many filamentous fungi living as saprotrophs, parasites, and mutualistic symbionts (e.g. lichens). Prominent and important genera of filamentous ascomycetes include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, and Claviceps. Many ascomycete species have only been observed undergoing asexual reproduction (called anamorphic species), but analysis of molecular data has often been able to identify their closest teleomorphs in the Ascomycota. Because the products of meiosis are retained within the sac-like ascus, ascomycetes have been used for elucidating principles of genetics and heredity (e.g., Neurospora crassa). Members of the Basidiomycota, commonly known as the club fungi or basidiomycetes, produce meiospores called basidiospores on club-like stalks called basidia. Most common mushrooms belong to this group, as well as rust and smut fungi, which are major pathogens of grains. Other important basidiomycetes include the maize pathogen Ustilago maydis, human commensal species of the genus Malassezia, and the opportunistic human pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans.  Fungus-like organisms  Because of similarities in morphology and lifestyle, the slime molds (mycetozoans, plasmodiophorids, acrasids, Fonticula and labyrinthulids, now in Amoebozoa, Rhizaria, Excavata, Opisthokonta and Stramenopiles, respectively), water molds (oomycetes) and hyphochytrids (both Stramenopiles) were formerly classified in the kingdom Fungi, in groups like Mastigomycotina, Gymnomycota and Phycomycetes. The slime molds were studied also as protozoans, leading to an ambiregnal, duplicated taxonomy. Unlike true fungi, the cell walls of oomycetes contain cellulose and lack chitin. Hyphochytrids have both chitin and cellulose. Slime molds lack a cell wall during the assimilative phase (except labyrinthulids, which have a wall of scales), and ingest nutrients by ingestion (phagocytosis, except labyrinthulids) rather than absorption (osmotrophy, as fungi, labyrinthulids, oomycetes and hyphochytrids). Neither water molds nor slime molds are closely related to the true fungi, and, therefore, taxonomists no longer group them in the kingdom Fungi. Nonetheless, studies of the oomycetes and myxomycetes are still often included in mycology textbooks and primary research literature. The Eccrinales and Amoebidiales are opisthokont protists, previously thought to be zygomycete fungi. Other groups now in Opisthokonta (e.g., Corallochytrium, Ichthyosporea) were also at given time classified as fungi. The genus Blastocystis, now in Stramenopiles, was originally classified as a yeast. Ellobiopsis, now in Alveolata, was considered a chytrid. The bacteria were also included in fungi in some classifications, as the group Schizomycetes. The Rozellida clade, including the \\"ex-chytrid\\" Rozella, is a genetically disparate group known mostly from environmental DNA sequences that is a sister group to fungi. Members of the group that have been isolated lack the chitinous cell wall that is characteristic of fungi. The nucleariids may be the next sister group to the eumycete clade, and as such could be included in an expanded fungal kingdom. Many Actinomycetales (Actinobacteria), a group with many filamentous bacteria, were also long believed to be fungi.An introduction to soil biology, Actinobacteria  Ecology  A pin mold decomposing a peach Although often inconspicuous, fungi occur in every environment on Earth and play very important roles in most ecosystems. Along with bacteria, fungi are the major decomposers in most terrestrial (and some aquatic) ecosystems, and therefore play a critical role in biogeochemical cycles and in many food webs. As decomposers, they play an essential role in nutrient cycling, especially as saprotrophs and symbionts, degrading organic matter to inorganic molecules, which can then re-enter anabolic metabolic pathways in plants or other organisms.  Symbiosis  Many fungi have important symbiotic relationships with organisms from most if not all kingdoms. These interactions can be mutualistic or antagonistic in nature, or in the case of commensal fungi are of no apparent benefit or detriment to the host. = With plants = Mycorrhizal symbiosis between plants and fungi is one of the most well-known plant–fungus associations and is of significant importance for plant growth and persistence in many ecosystems; over 90% of all plant species engage in mycorrhizal relationships with fungi and are dependent upon this relationship for survival. The dark filaments are hyphae of the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium coenophialum in the intercellular spaces of tall fescue leaf sheath tissue The mycorrhizal symbiosis is ancient, dating back to at least 400 million years. It often increases the plant's uptake of inorganic compounds, such as nitrate and phosphate from soils having low concentrations of these key plant nutrients. The fungal partners may also mediate plant-to-plant transfer of carbohydrates and other nutrients. Such mycorrhizal communities are called \\"common mycorrhizal networks\\". A special case of mycorrhiza is myco-heterotrophy, whereby the plant parasitizes the fungus, obtaining all of its nutrients from its fungal symbiont. Some fungal species inhabit the tissues inside roots, stems, and leaves, in which case they are called endophytes. Similar to mycorrhiza, endophytic colonization by fungi may benefit both symbionts; for example, endophytes of grasses impart to their host increased resistance to herbivores and other environmental stresses and receive food and shelter from the plant in return. = With algae and cyanobacteria = The lichen Lobaria pulmonaria, a symbiosis of fungal, algal, and cyanobacterial species Lichens are a symbiotic relationship between fungi and photosynthetic algae or cyanobacteria. The photosynthetic partner in the relationship is referred to in lichen terminology as a \\"photobiont\\". The fungal part of the relationship is composed mostly of various species of ascomycetes and a few basidiomycetes. Lichens occur in every ecosystem on all continents, play a key role in soil formation and the initiation of biological succession, and are prominent in some extreme environments, including polar, alpine, and semiarid desert regions.Deacon, p. 267. They are able to grow on inhospitable surfaces, including bare soil, rocks, tree bark, wood, shells, barnacles and leaves. As in mycorrhizas, the photobiont provides sugars and other carbohydrates via photosynthesis to the fungus, while the fungus provides minerals and water to the photobiont. The functions of both symbiotic organisms are so closely intertwined that they function almost as a single organism; in most cases the resulting organism differs greatly from the individual components. Lichenization is a common mode of nutrition for fungi; around 20% of fungi—between 17,500 and 20,000 described species—are lichenized.Kirk et al., p. 378. Characteristics common to most lichens include obtaining organic carbon by photosynthesis, slow growth, small size, long life, long-lasting (seasonal) vegetative reproductive structures, mineral nutrition obtained largely from airborne sources, and greater tolerance of desiccation than most other photosynthetic organisms in the same habitat.Deacon, pp. 267–276. = With insects = Many insects also engage in mutualistic relationships with fungi. Several groups of ants cultivate fungi in the order Agaricales as their primary food source, while ambrosia beetles cultivate various species of fungi in the bark of trees that they infest. Likewise, females of several wood wasp species (genus Sirex) inject their eggs together with spores of the wood-rotting fungus Amylostereum areolatum into the sapwood of pine trees; the growth of the fungus provides ideal nutritional conditions for the development of the wasp larvae.Deacon, p. 277. At least one species of stingless bee has a relationship with a fungus in the genus Monascus, where the larvae consume and depend on fungus transferred from old to new nests. Termites on the African savannah are also known to cultivate fungi, and yeasts of the genera Candida and Lachancea inhabit the gut of a wide range of insects, including neuropterans, beetles, and cockroaches; it is not known whether these fungi benefit their hosts. Fungi ingrowing dead wood are essential for xylophagous insects (e.g. woodboring beetles). They deliver nutrients needed by xylophages to nutritionally scarce dead wood. Thanks to this nutritional enrichment the larvae of woodboring insect is able to grow and develop to adulthood. The larvae of many families of fungicolous flies, particularly those within the superfamily Sciaroidea such as the Mycetophilidae and some Keroplatidae feed on fungal fruiting bodies and sterile mycorrhizae. = As pathogens and parasites = The plant pathogen Aecidium magellanicum causes calafate rust, seen here on a Berberis shrub in Chile. Many fungi are parasites on plants, animals (including humans), and other fungi. Serious pathogens of many cultivated plants causing extensive damage and losses to agriculture and forestry include the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, tree pathogens such as Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi causing Dutch elm disease and Cryphonectria parasitica responsible for chestnut blight, and plant pathogens in the genera Fusarium, Ustilago, Alternaria, and Cochliobolus. Some carnivorous fungi, like Paecilomyces lilacinus, are predators of nematodes, which they capture using an array of specialized structures such as constricting rings or adhesive nets. Many fungi that are plant pathogens, such as Magnaporthe oryzae, can switch from being biotrophic (parasitic on living plants) to being necrotrophic (feeding on the dead tissues of plants they have killed). This same principle is applied to fungi-feeding parasites, including Asterotremella albida, which feeds on the fruit bodies of other fungi both while they are living and after they are dead. Some fungi can cause serious diseases in humans, several of which may be fatal if untreated. These include aspergillosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, mycetomas, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Furthermore, persons with immuno-deficiencies are particularly susceptible to disease by genera such as Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptoccocus, Histoplasma, and Pneumocystis. Other fungi can attack eyes, nails, hair, and especially skin, the so-called dermatophytic and keratinophilic fungi, and cause local infections such as ringworm and athlete's foot. Fungal spores are also a cause of allergies, and fungi from different taxonomic groups can evoke allergic reactions. = As targets of mycoparasites = The organisms which parasitize fungi are known as mycoparasitic organisms. Certain species of the genus Pythium, which are oomycetes, have potential as biocontrol agents against certain fungi. Fungi can also act as mycoparasites or antagonists of other fungi, such as Hypomyces chrysospermus, which grows on bolete mushrooms. Fungi can also become the target of infection by mycoviruses.  Mycotoxins  Ergotamine, a major mycotoxin produced by Claviceps species, which if ingested can cause gangrene, convulsions, and hallucinations Many fungi produce biologically active compounds, several of which are toxic to animals or plants and are therefore called mycotoxins. Of particular relevance to humans are mycotoxins produced by molds causing food spoilage, and poisonous mushrooms (see above). Particularly infamous are the lethal amatoxins in some Amanita mushrooms, and ergot alkaloids, which have a long history of causing serious epidemics of ergotism (St Anthony's Fire) in people consuming rye or related cereals contaminated with sclerotia of the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea. Other notable mycotoxins include the aflatoxins, which are insidious liver toxins and highly carcinogenic metabolites produced by certain Aspergillus species often growing in or on grains and nuts consumed by humans, ochratoxins, patulin, and trichothecenes (e.g., T-2 mycotoxin) and fumonisins, which have significant impact on human food supplies or animal livestock. Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites (or natural products), and research has established the existence of biochemical pathways solely for the purpose of producing mycotoxins and other natural products in fungi. Mycotoxins may provide fitness benefits in terms of physiological adaptation, competition with other microbes and fungi, and protection from consumption (fungivory). Many fungal secondary metabolites (or derivatives) are used medically, as described under Human Use below. Pathogenic mechanisms Ustilago maydis is a pathogenic plant fungus that causes smut disease in maize and teosinte. Plants have evolved efficient defense systems against pathogenic microbes such as U. maydis. A rapid defense reaction after pathogen attack is the oxidative burst where the plant produces reactive oxygen species at the site of the attempted invasion. U. maydis can respond to the oxidative burst with an oxidative stress response, regulated by the gene YAP1. The response protects U. maydis from the host defense, and is necessary for the pathogen's virulence. Furthermore, U. maydis has a well- established recombinational DNA repair system which acts during mitosis and meiosis. The system may assist the pathogen in surviving DNA damage arising from the host plant's oxidative defensive response to infection. Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that can live in both plants and animals. C.neoformans usually infects the lungs, where it is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages. Some C.neoformans can survive inside macrophages, which appears to be the basis for latency, disseminated disease, and resistance to antifungal agents. One mechanism by which C.neoformans survives the hostile macrophage environment is by up-regulating the expression of genes involved in the oxidative stress response. Another mechanism involves meiosis. The majority of C.neoformans are mating \\"type a\\". Filaments of mating \\"type a\\" ordinarily have haploid nuclei, but they can become diploid (perhaps by endoduplication or by stimulated nuclear fusion) to form blastospores. The diploid nuclei of blastospores can undergo meiosis, including recombination, to form haploid basidiospores that can be dispersed. This process is referred to as monokaryotic fruiting. This process requires a gene called DMC1, which is a conserved homologue of genes recA in bacteria and RAD51 in eukaryotes, that mediates homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis and repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Thus, C.neoformans can undergo a meiosis, monokaryotic fruiting, that promotes recombinational repair in the oxidative, DNA damaging environment of the host macrophage, and the repair capability may contribute to its virulence. Human use Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells shown with DIC microscopy The human use of fungi for food preparation or preservation and other purposes is extensive and has a long history. Mushroom farming and mushroom gathering are large industries in many countries. The study of the historical uses and sociological impact of fungi is known as ethnomycology. Because of the capacity of this group to produce an enormous range of natural products with antimicrobial or other biological activities, many species have long been used or are being developed for industrial production of antibiotics, vitamins, and anti-cancer and cholesterol-lowering drugs. More recently, methods have been developed for genetic engineering of fungi, enabling metabolic engineering of fungal species. For example, genetic modification of yeast species—which are easy to grow at fast rates in large fermentation vessels—has opened up ways of pharmaceutical production that are potentially more efficient than production by the original source organisms.  Therapeutic uses  =Modern chemotherapeutics= The mould Penicillium chrysogenum was the source of penicillin G. Many species produce metabolites that are major sources of pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, a wide range of other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom. Fungi produce compounds that inhibit viruses and cancer cells. Specific metabolites, such as polysaccharide-K, ergotamine, and β-lactam antibiotics, are routinely used in clinical medicine. The shiitake mushroom is a source of lentinan, a clinical drug approved for use in cancer treatments in several countries, including Japan. In Europe and Japan, polysaccharide-K (brand name Krestin), a chemical derived from Trametes versicolor, is an approved adjuvant for cancer therapy. Traditional and folk medicine Certain mushrooms enjoy usage as therapeutics in folk medicines, such as Traditional Chinese medicine. Notable medicinal mushrooms with a well-documented history of use include Agaricus subrufescens, Ganoderma lucidum, Psilocybe and Ophiocordyceps sinensis.  Cultured foods  Baker's yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a unicellular fungus, is used to make bread and other wheat-based products, such as pizza dough and dumplings. Yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces are also used to produce alcoholic beverages through fermentation. Shoyu koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae) is an essential ingredient in brewing Shoyu (soy sauce) and sake, and the preparation of miso, while Rhizopus species are used for making tempeh. Several of these fungi are domesticated species that were bred or selected according to their capacity to ferment food without producing harmful mycotoxins (see below), which are produced by very closely related Aspergilli. Quorn, a meat substitute, is made from Fusarium venenatum.  In food  A selection of edible mushrooms eaten in Asia Edible mushrooms include commercially raised and wild-harvested fungi. Agaricus bisporus, sold as button mushrooms when small or Portobello mushrooms when larger, is the most widely cultivated species in the West, used in salads, soups, and many other dishes. Many Asian fungi are commercially grown and have increased in popularity in the West. They are often available fresh in grocery stores and markets, including straw mushrooms (Volvariella volvacea), oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus), shiitakes (Lentinula edodes), and enokitake (Flammulina spp.). Stilton cheese veined with Penicillium roqueforti Many other mushroom species are harvested from the wild for personal consumption or commercial sale. Milk mushrooms, morels, chanterelles, truffles, black trumpets, and porcini mushrooms (Boletus edulis) (also known as king boletes) demand a high price on the market. They are often used in gourmet dishes.Hall, pp. 13–26. Certain types of cheeses require inoculation of milk curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to the cheese. Examples include the blue color in cheeses such as Stilton or Roquefort, which are made by inoculation with Penicillium roqueforti. Molds used in cheese production are non-toxic and are thus safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, roquefortine C, patulin, or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage. Poisonous fungi Amanita phalloides accounts for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide. It sometimes lacks the greenish color seen here. Many mushroom species are poisonous to humans and cause a range of reactions including slight digestive problems, allergic reactions, hallucinations, severe organ failure, and death. Genera with mushrooms containing deadly toxins include Conocybe, Galerina, Lepiota, and, the most infamous, Amanita. The latter genus includes the destroying angel (A.virosa) and the death cap (A.phalloides), the most common cause of deadly mushroom poisoning. The false morel (Gyromitra esculenta) is occasionally considered a delicacy when cooked, yet can be highly toxic when eaten raw. Tricholoma equestre was considered edible until it was implicated in serious poisonings causing rhabdomyolysis. Fly agaric mushrooms (Amanita muscaria) also cause occasional non-fatal poisonings, mostly as a result of ingestion for its hallucinogenic properties. Historically, fly agaric was used by different peoples in Europe and Asia and its present usage for religious or shamanic purposes is reported from some ethnic groups such as the Koryak people of northeastern Siberia. As it is difficult to accurately identify a safe mushroom without proper training and knowledge, it is often advised to assume that a wild mushroom is poisonous and not to consume it.Hall, p. 7.  Pest control  Grasshoppers killed by Beauveria bassiana In agriculture, fungi may be useful if they actively compete for nutrients and space with pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria or other fungi via the competitive exclusion principle, or if they are parasites of these pathogens. For example, certain species may be used to eliminate or suppress the growth of harmful plant pathogens, such as insects, mites, weeds, nematodes, and other fungi that cause diseases of important crop plants. This has generated strong interest in practical applications that use these fungi in the biological control of these agricultural pests. Entomopathogenic fungi can be used as biopesticides, as they actively kill insects. Examples that have been used as biological insecticides are Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium spp, Hirsutella spp, Paecilomyces (Isaria) spp, and Lecanicillium lecanii. Endophytic fungi of grasses of the genus Neotyphodium, such as N. coenophialum, produce alkaloids that are toxic to a range of invertebrate and vertebrate herbivores. These alkaloids protect grass plants from herbivory, but several endophyte alkaloids can poison grazing animals, such as cattle and sheep. Infecting cultivars of pasture or forage grasses with Neotyphodium endophytes is one approach being used in grass breeding programs; the fungal strains are selected for producing only alkaloids that increase resistance to herbivores such as insects, while being non-toxic to livestock.  Bioremediation  Certain fungi, in particular white-rot fungi, can degrade insecticides, herbicides, pentachlorophenol, creosote, coal tars, and heavy fuels and turn them into carbon dioxide, water, and basic elements. Fungi have been shown to biomineralize uranium oxides, suggesting they may have application in the bioremediation of radioactively polluted sites.  Model organisms  Several pivotal discoveries in biology were made by researchers using fungi as model organisms, that is, fungi that grow and sexually reproduce rapidly in the laboratory. For example, the one gene- one enzyme hypothesis was formulated by scientists using the bread mold Neurospora crassa to test their biochemical theories. Other important model fungi are Aspergillus nidulans and the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, each of which with a long history of use to investigate issues in eukaryotic cell biology and genetics, such as cell cycle regulation, chromatin structure, and gene regulation. Other fungal models have more recently emerged that address specific biological questions relevant to medicine, plant pathology, and industrial uses; examples include Candida albicans, a dimorphic, opportunistic human pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea, a plant pathogen, and Pichia pastoris, a yeast widely used for eukaryotic protein production.  Others  Fungi are used extensively to produce industrial chemicals like citric, gluconic, lactic, and malic acids, and industrial enzymes, such as lipases used in biological detergents, cellulases used in making cellulosic ethanol and stonewashed jeans, and amylases, invertases, proteases and xylanases.

Between the years of 1982–1999 Ruby Daniel translated into English over 120 Judeo-Malayalam women’s songs. Her translation efforts led the way for an ongoing international project to translate and analyze the songs within the Cochin Jewish community.  Early life  Ruby Daniel was born in Kochi, India and was the eldest child of Eliyahu Hai Daniel and Leah Japheth Daniel. Her father, Eliyahu Hai Daniel, sold tickets for the ferry boat which connected Cochin with Ernakulam. Ruby had two younger siblings - Bingley and Rahel. Ruby also lived with her maternal grandparents, Eliyahu and Rivka (\\"Docho\\") Japheth. Ruby Daniel excelled in school, both at the local government school for girls and at the Jewish school where she studied Hebrew, Torah, and the synagogue liturgy every morning and afternoon. She attended St. Treasas Convent Girls Higher Secondary School in Ernakulam. She completed high school there and studied one year at St. Teresa's College. She left St. Teresa’s College after her father and grandfather died in the same year.  Military career  Ruby Daniel enlisted in the military and served in the Armed Forces of India. She is noted for not only being one of the few women in the Indian army at the time but also as the first Jewish Indian woman and the first keralite to do so in modern Indian history. She was employed for over fifteen years in government service, as a clerk in the High Court, District Court Munsiff Court, and from 1944–1946 in the Women’s Royal Indian Navy.  Writing career  She made aliyah in 1951 and moved to the predominantly ashkenazi and secular kibbutz Neot Mordechai.‘Ruby of Cochin’ provides firsthand look at bygone era of India’s Jews.

Some of the most famous projects in which Mooney participated in included Disney's Sleeping Beauty, Lady and the Tramp and Ward's George of the Jungle. He also worked on several live action films. Mooney also completed many animated sequences, title sequences and graphics for use in live action films, television shows and commercials. Some of Mooney's earliest work included uncredited assistant animator positions on the Walt Disney animated films Lady and the Tramp in 1955 and Sleeping Beauty in 1959. Mooney later worked for Hubley Studios and Jay Ward and continued to work in the United States. In 1960, Mooney teamed with fellow animator Lu Guarnier to animate Switchin' Kitten, the first Tom and Jerry cartoon to be directed by Gene Deitch. Mooney became an animator for Storyboard Studios, which were owned by John Hubley and Faith Hubley, upon his arrival in New York City. He worked on a number of cartoons for the Hubleys while at Storyboard Studios. He was the animation director on the film, Of Stars and Men in 1964. Mooney also worked as an animator on the Hubley produced Children Of The Sun in 1961, The Hole in 1962, and The Hat in 1963.

History  Neubourg Abbey was founded not earlier than 1130 and not later than 1133the date most often given is 1131 by Count Reinhold of Lützelburg as a daughter house of Lützel Abbey of the filiation of Morimond; it was also settled from Lützel. In its turn Neubourg was the mother house of Maulbronn Abbey (founded 1139) and Herrenalb Abbey (founded 1147).It also had supervision of Baumgarten Abbey, although that had been founded by Beaupré Abbey Between the 14th and 17th centuries the abbey was destroyed and rebuilt several times. It was suppressed in 1790 during the French Revolution. Inquisition Not long after it was founded, the abbey was the subject of an inquisition by Frederick Barbarossa, who forced the monks to renounce their claims to the valuable Hohenstaufen Forest. Buildings The church was dedicated in 1158. It was rebuilt in 1758, but was entirely destroyed in 1818 along with virtually all of the monastic building complex. There are very few remains: a Baroque gatehouse of 1744; a mill; and part of the precinct wall. Some Rococo items from the abbey church (the choir stalls, the organ case, statues of saints) are to be found in the nearby St. Nicholas' church, Haguenau.

It was first published in the first Indian edition of Plain Tales from the Hills in 1888, and in subsequent editions of that collection. This story is a Kiplingesque investigation - that is to say a strange combination of close observation, some mild satire of the strangeness of social conventions, and an acceptance of their strangeness, from the rather distant stance of an observer - of matters of love and marriage. It begins with \\"a very pretty girl, the daughter of a poor but honest District and Sessions Judge ... Her Mamma was very anxious about her daughter's future, as all good Mammas should be.\\" There is also (at Simla) Barr-Saggott, a rich man of high status - a Commissioner, no less - but ugly. \\"When he turned his attentions to Miss Beighton, I believe that Mrs Beighton wept with delight at the reward Providence had sent her in her old age.\\" (In one of Kipling's very 'knowing' asides, designed to convince readers of his veracity, he says \\"the ugliest man in Asia, with two exceptions.\\" This [our emphasis] may also be a 'tongue-in-cheek mock of the habits in certain British circles of immense and fashionable hyperbole.) Kitty Beighton's thoughts are with young Cubbon, a junior officer - \\"a boy\\" - in a cavalry regiment. At the time of the story, some time after 1850, archery was the fashionable sport among the administrative classes; and Miss Beighton \\"shot divinely\\". Commissioner Barr-Saggott offers a magnificent prize - a diamond studded bracelet - for a ladies' tournament of archery, \\"and every one saw that the bracelet was a gift to Miss Beighton; the acceptance carrying with it the hand and heart of Commissioner Barr-Saggott.\\" Miss Beighton shoots last. Her first shot is a bull's eye, and Barr-Saggott smiles. \\"Now horses used to shy when Barr-Saggott smiled. Kitty saw that smile. She looked to her left-front, gave an almost imperceptible nod to Cubbon, and went on shooting\\" - with great skill, but no further high-scoring shots. She records 21q, out of as possible 324, and the prize is won by \\"a little snubby, mottled, half-grown girl\\".\\" Mrs Beighton weeps, in front of all the people (all the 'best sort' are present). Miss Beighton leaves with Cubbon, instead of her Mamma; \\"and - the rest isn't worth printing.\\" :All quotations in this article have been taken from the Uniform Edition of Plain Tales from the Hills published by Macmillan & Co., Limited in London in 1899.

Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow- orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie. Donald is known for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald was included in TV Guides list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002,TV Guide's 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time . CNN.

He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character,Not including television episodes but including short films, Donald has appeared in 197 films. (Donald Duck at IMDb, retrieved August 15, 2014) The Disney character with the second most film appearances is Mickey Mouse at 167. (Mickey Mouse at IMDb, retrieved August 15, 2014) and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre.Overall, Donald is the fifth most published comic book character in the world after Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, and Wolverine. List of Superheroes & Villains in the Comic Book Universe at Comic Vine Donald Duck appeared in comedic roles in animated cartoons. Donald's first appearance was in The Wise Little Hen (1934), but it was his second appearance in Orphans' Benefit that introduced him as a temperamental comic foil to Mickey Mouse. Throughout the next two decades, Donald appeared in over 150 theatrical films, several of which were recognized at the Academy Awards. In the 1930s, he typically appeared as part of a comic trio with Mickey and Goofy and was given his own film series starting with Don Donald (1937). These films introduced Donald's love interest and permanent girlfriend Daisy Duck and often included his three nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie. After the film Chips Ahoy (1956), Donald appeared primarily in educational films before eventually returning to theatrical animation in Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983). His last appearance in a theatrical film was in Fantasia 2000 (1999). However, since then Donald has appeared in direct-to- video features such as Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers (2004), television series such as Mickey Mouse Clubhouse (2006–2016), and video games such as QuackShot (1991). Beyond animation, Donald is primarily known for his appearances in comics. Donald was most famously drawn by Al Taliaferro, Carl Barks, and Don Rosa. Barks, in particular, is credited for greatly expanding the \\"Donald Duck universe\\", the world in which Donald lives, and creating many additional characters such as Donald's rich uncle Scrooge McDuck. Donald has been a popular character in Europe, particularly in Nordic countries where his weekly magazine ' was the comics publication with the highest circulation from the 1950s to 2009. In Italy, Donald is a major character in many comics in which his juvenile version Paperino Paperotto and his superhero alter ego Paperinik (Duck Avenger in the US and Superduck in the UK) were created. Origin Voice performer Clarence Nash auditioned for Walt Disney Studios when he learned that Disney was looking for people to create animal sounds for his cartoons. Disney was particularly impressed with Nash's duck imitation and chose him to voice the new character. Besides, during that period Mickey Mouse had lost some of his edge since becoming a role model towards children, and so Disney wanted to create a character to portray some of the more negative character traits that could no longer be bestowed on Mickey. Disney came up with Donald's iconic attributes including his short temper and his sailor suit (based on ducks and sailors both being associated with water). While Dick Huemer and Art Babbit were the first to animate Donald, Dick Lundy is credited for developing him as a character. Characteristics Voice The character is known for possessing an only partly intelligible voice, developed by Donald's original performer, Clarence Nash. The voice actor produces sounds by forcing air through the mouth using the muscles of the cheek, rather than from the lungs as in typical speech. Nash reputedly originally developed the voice as that of a \\"nervous baby goat\\" before Walt Disney interpreted it as sounding like a duck. Personality Orphans' Benefit (remake) (1941); Donald is known for his explosive temper. Donald's two dominant personality traits are his fiery temper and his upbeat attitude to life. Many Donald shorts start with Donald in a happy mood, without a care in the world until something comes along and spoils his day. His rage is a great cause of suffering in his life. On multiple occasions, it has caused him to get in over his head and lose competitions. There are times when he fights to keep his temper in check, and he sometimes succeeds in doing so temporarily, but he always returns to his normal angry self in the end. Donald's vicious nature has its advantages, however. While at times it is a hindrance, and even a handicap, it has also helped him in times of need. When faced with a threat of some kind, for example, Pete's attempts to intimidate him, he is initially scared, but his fear is replaced by anger. As a result, instead of running away, he fights—with ghosts, sharks, mountain goats, giant kites, and even the forces of nature. More often than not, when he fights, he comes out on top. Donald is something of a prankster, and as a result, he can sometimes come across as a bit of a bully, especially in the way he sometimes treats Chip n' Dale and Huey, Dewey and Louie, his nephews. As the animator Fred Spencer has put it: However, with a few exceptions, there is seldom any harm in Donald's pranks. He almost never intends to hurt anyone, and whenever his pranks go too far, he is always very apologetic. In Truant Officer Donald, for example, when he is tricked into believing he has accidentally killed Huey, Dewey, and Louie, he shows great regret, blaming himself. His nephews appear in the form of angels, and he willingly endures a kick by one of them—that is, of course, until he realizes he has been tricked, whereupon he promptly loses his temper. Donald is also a bit of a poseur. He likes to brag, especially about how skilled he is at something. He does, in fact, have many skills—he is something of a Jack-of-all-trades. Amongst other things, he is a talented fisher and a competent hockey player. However, his love of bragging often leads him to overestimate his abilities, so that when he sets out to make good on his boasts, he gets in over his head, usually to hilarious effect. Another of his personality traits is perseverance. Even though he can at times be a slacker, and likes to say that his favorite place to be is in a hammock, once he has committed to accomplishing something he goes for it 100 percent, sometimes resorting to extreme measures to reach his goal. Phrases Donald has a few memorable phrases that he occasionally comes out with in certain situations. For example, when he stumbles across other characters in the midst of planning some sort of retaliation or prank, or when things don't go as he'd planned or don't work properly, he often says, \\"What's the big idea!?\\" When he has given up on something he's been trying to do, or something he's been hoping will happen, he tends to say, \\"Aw, phooey!\\" When he confronts someone who's been antagonizing him or something that's been frustrating him, he likes to exclaim, \\"So!!\\" He greets his girlfriend Daisy, and occasionally others, with, \\"Hiya, toots!\\" And when he's very excited about something, he usually mutters, \\"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy...\\" under his breath. Health There's a running gag in the Donald Duck comics about him being physically unhealthy and unmotivated to exercise. Usually, some character close to Donald annoys him by saying he is being lazy and needs to get some exercise. But despite his apparent idleness, Donald proves that he is muscular. In the short film, Sea Scouts, Donald is traveling with his nephews in a boat when it's attacked by a shark. Donald makes several attempts to defeat the shark, each of which proves ineffective, but then finally triumphs and defeats the shark with a single well-placed punch. Additionally, as discussed below- Donald had a stint in the U.S. Army during World War II that culminated with him serving as a commando in the film Commando Duck, and he was frequently away serving in the U.S. Navy in the television cartoon series DuckTales. Friendly rivalry with Mickey Mouse Throughout his appearances, Donald has shown that he's jealous of Mickey and wants his job as Disney's greatest star, similar to the rivalry between Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. In most Disney theatrical cartoons, Mickey and Donald are shown as friends and have little to no rivalry (exceptions being The Band Concert, Magician Mickey and near the end of Symphony Hour, which were due to Donald's antagonistic schemes). However, by the time The Mickey Mouse Club aired on television (after Bugs vs. Daffy cartoons such as the \\"hunting trilogy\\" of Rabbit Fire, Rabbit Seasoning, and Duck! Rabbit, Duck!), it was shown that Donald always wanted the spotlight. One animated short that rivaled the Mickey Mouse March song was showing Huey, Dewey, and Louie as Boy Scouts and Donald as their Scoutmaster at a cliff near a remote forest and Donald leads them in a song mirroring the Mouseketeers theme \\"D-O- N-A-L-D D-U-C-K! Donald Duck!\\" The rivalry would cause Donald some problems, in a 1988 TV special, where Mickey is cursed by a sorcerer to become unnoticed, the world believes Mickey to be kidnapped. Donald Duck is then arrested for the kidnapping of Mickey, as he is considered to be the chief suspect, due to their feud. However, Donald did later get the charges dismissed, due to lack of evidence. Walt Disney, in his Wonderful World of Color, would sometimes make reference to the rivalry. Walt, one time, had presented Donald with a gigantic birthday cake and commented how it was \\"even bigger than Mickey's\\", which pleased Donald. The clip was rebroadcast in November 1984 during a TV special honoring Donald's 50th birthday, with Dick Van Dyke substituting for Walt. The rivalry between Mickey and Donald was shown in Disney's House of Mouse. It was shown that Donald wanted to be the club's founder and wanted to change the name from House of Mouse to House of Duck, which is obvious in the episodes \\"The Stolen Cartoons\\" and \\"Timon and Pumbaa\\". In the episode \\"Everybody Loves Mickey\\", Donald's jealousy is explored and even joins sides with Mortimer Mouse. However, Donald has a change of heart when Daisy reminds Donald how Mickey has always been there to support him. Since then, Donald accepted that Mickey was the founder and worked with Mickey as a partner to make the club profitable and successful. Enemies Donald has numerous enemies, who range from comical foil to annoying nemesis: Chip 'n' Dale, Pete, Humphrey the Bear, Spike the Bee, Mountain Lion Louie, Bootle Beetle, Witch Hazel (in Trick or Treat), Aracuan Bird and Baby Shelby (in Mickey Mouse Works). During the Second World War, Donald was often set against Adolf Hitler. In the comics, he is often harassed or on the run from the Beagle Boys, Magica De Spell, Gladstone Gander and Mr. Jones. In the video game Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers, he saves Daisy from Merlock. The Italian-produced comic PKNA – Paperinik New Adventures stars Donald Duck as Paperinik, or Duck Avenger, in his battles against new alien enemies: Evronian Empire, founded by emperor Evron. Animation Appearances Donald Duck as he first appeared in The Wise Little Hen (1934) Donald Duck first appeared on radio before he was seen in animated form. On April 29, 1934, bandleader Raymond Paige performed the entire score to the cartoon The Wise Little Hen (in advance of its theatrical release) on his California Melodies program for the Los Angeles AM radio station KHJ, with Clarence Nash performing as both Donald Duck and Peter Pig. The Wise Little Hen was Donald's first appearance on screen, one of the Silly Symphonies series of theatrical cartoon shorts. The film's given release date of June 9 is officially recognized by the Walt Disney Company as Donald's birthday, though historian J.B. Kaufman discovered in recent years that The Wise Little Hen was first shown on May 3, 1934 at the Carthay Circle Theater for a benefit program, while its official debut was on June 7 at the Radio City Music Hall. Donald's appearance in the cartoon, as created by animator Dick Lundy, is similar to his modern look – the feather and beak colors are the same, as are the blue sailor shirt and hat – but his features are more elongated, his body plumper, his feet smaller, and his sclerae white. Donald's personality is not developed either; in the short, he only fills the role of the unhelpful friend from the original story. Burt Gillett brought Donald back in his Mickey Mouse cartoon, Orphans' Benefit, released August 11, 1934. Donald is one of a number of characters who are giving performances in a benefit for Mickey's Orphans. Donald's act is to recite the poems Mary Had a Little Lamb and Little Boy Blue, but every time he tries, the mischievous orphans heckle him, leading the duck to fly into a squawking fit of anger. This explosive personality would remain with Donald for decades to come. Donald continued to be a hit with audiences. The character began appearing regularly in most Mickey Mouse cartoons. Cartoons from this period, such as the cartoon The Band Concert (1935) – in which Donald repeatedly disrupts the Mickey Mouse Orchestra's rendition of The William Tell Overture by playing Turkey in the Straw – are regularly noted by critics as exemplary films and classics of animation. Animator Ben Sharpsteen also created the classic Mickey, Donald, and Goofy comedy in 1935, with the cartoon Mickey's Service Station. Donald was redesigned to be a bit fuller, rounder, and cuter, the first to feature this design was the cartoon Moving Day (1936). He also began starring in solo cartoons, the first of which was January 9, 1937, Ben Sharpsteen's cartoon, Don Donald. This short also introduced a love interest of Donald's, Donna Duck, who evolved into Daisy Duck.Although the Walt Disney Company claimed Donna Duck to be the same character as Donald's longtime love interest Daisy Duck, this is not so in Karp/Taliaferro comics (1951), where she is a separate character, appearing together with Daisy in a couple of daily newspaper strips. Early illustrations of Daisy also show a clear distinction between the two, Donna having a Mexican accent, contrary to Daisy. Donald's nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie, would make their first animated appearance a year later in the April 15, 1938, in the film, Donald's Nephews, directed by Jack King (they had been earlier introduced in the Donald Duck comic strip by Al Taliaferro, see below). By 1938, most polls showed that Donald was more popular than Mickey Mouse. Disney could, however, help Mickey regain his former position by redesigning him, giving him his most appealing design in the Fantasia (1940) segment \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\", production for which began in 1938. After his early appearances, he went on to become part of the famed trio Mickey, Donald, and Goofy. He appeared in many of the cartoons, including Moving Day. Wartime Donald worked in a Nazi factory in Der Fuehrer's Face (1943) Several of Donald's shorts during the war were propaganda films, including Der Fuehrer's Face, released on January 1, 1943. In it, Donald plays a worker in an artillery factory in \\"Nutzi Land\\" (Nazi Germany). He struggles with long working hours, very small food rations, and having to salute every time he sees a picture of the Führer (Adolf Hitler). These pictures appear in many places, such as on the assembly line in which he is screwing in the detonators of various sizes of shells. In the end, he becomes little more than a small part in a faceless machine with no choice but to obey until he falls, suffering a nervous breakdown. Then Donald wakes up to find that his experience was, in fact, a dream. At the end of the short, Donald looks to the Statue of Liberty and the American flag with renewed appreciation. Der Fuehrer's Face won the 1942 Academy Award for Animated Short Film. Der Fuehrer's Face was also the first of two animated short films to be set during the War to win an Oscar, the other being Tom and Jerry's short film, The Yankee Doodle Mouse. Other shorts from this period include a seven film mini- series that follows Donald's life in the U.S. Army from his drafting to his experiences in basic training under Sergeant Pete to his first actual mission as a commando having to sabotage a Japanese air base. Titles in the series include: *Donald Gets Drafted (May 1, 1942) (shown in his Selective Service Draft Card close-up, we learn Donald's full name: Donald Fauntleroy Duck) *The Vanishing Private (September 25, 1942) *Sky Trooper (November 8, 1942) *Fall Out Fall In (April 23, 1943) *The Old Army Game (November 5, 1943) *Commando Duck (June 2, 1944) Thanks in part to these films, Donald graced the nose artwork of virtually every type of World War II Allied combat aircraft, from the L-4 Grasshopper to the B-29 Superfortress. Donald also appears as a mascot—such as in the United States Army Air Forces' 309th Fighter Squadron and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, which showed Donald as a fierce-looking pirate ready to defend the American coast from invaders. Donald also appeared as a mascot emblem for the 415th Fighter Squadron; 438th Fighter Squadron; 479th Bombardment Squadron; and 531st Bombardment Squadron. He also appeared as the mascot for the Fire Department at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, as well as the Army Air Forces (now currently the United States Air Force) 319 Aircraft Maintenance Unit at Luke Air Force Base- where he is seen wearing an old-style pilot's uniform with a board with a nail in it in one hand, and a lightning bolt in the other hand. Donald's most famous appearance, however, was on the North American Aviation B-25B Mitchell medium bomber (S/N 40-2261) piloted by Lt. Ted W. Lawson of the 95th Bombardment Squadron, USAAF. The aircraft, named the \\"Ruptured Duck\\" and carrying a picture of Donald's face above a pair of crossed crutches, was one of sixteen B-25Bs which took off from the aircraft carrier USS Hornet to bomb Tokyo on April 18, 1942 during the Doolittle Raid. The mission was led by Lieutenant Colonel (later General) Jimmy Doolittle. Like most of the aircraft that participated in the mission, the Ruptured Duck was unable to reach its assigned landing field in China following the raid and ended up ditching off the coast near Shangchow, China. The Ruptured Duck's pilot survived, with the loss of a leg, and later wrote about the Doolittle Raid in the book, later to be the 1944 movie, Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo. During World War II, Disney cartoons were not allowed to be imported into Occupied Europe owing to their propagandistic content. Since this lost Disney revenue, he decided to create a new audience for his films in South America. He decided to make a trip through various Latin American countries with his assistants, and use their experiences and impressions to create two feature-length animation films. The first was Saludos Amigos (1942), which consisted of four short segments, two of them with Donald Duck. In the first, he meets his parrot pal José Carioca. The second film was The Three Caballeros (1944), in which he meets his rooster friend Panchito. Several decades after the war, on account of the fact that Donald was never officially separated from service in either his animated shorts or his comic strips. As part of Donald's 50th Birthday celebrations during the 25th Annual Torrance, California Armed Forces Day Parade, the U.S. Army retired Donald Duck from active duty as a \\"Buck Sergeant\\" (i.e. \\"Buck Sergeant Duck\\"). Post-war Many of Donald's films made after the war recast the duck as the brunt of some other character's pestering. Donald is seen repeatedly attacked, harassed, and ridiculed by his nephews, by the chipmunks Chip 'n' Dale, or by other characters such as Humphrey the Bear, Spike the Bee, Bootle Beetle, the Aracuan Bird, Louie the Mountain Lion, or a colony of ants. In effect, much like Bugs Bunny cartoons from Warner Bros. the Disney artists had reversed the classic screwball scenario perfected by Walter Lantz and others in which the main character is the instigator of these harassing behaviors, rather than the butt of them. The post-war Donald also starred in educational films, such as Donald in Mathmagic Land and How to Have an Accident at Work (both 1959), and made cameos in various Disney projects, such as The Reluctant Dragon (1941) and the Disneyland television show (1959). For this latter show, Donald's uncles Ludwig von Drake (1961) and Scrooge McDuck (1967) were then created in animation. In Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), Donald has a piano duel scene with his Warner Brothers counterpart and rival Daffy Duck voiced by Mel Blanc. Donald has since appeared in several different television shows and (short) animated movies. He played roles in The Prince and the Pauper (1990) and made a cameo appearance in A Goofy Movie (1995). Donald had a rather small part in the animated television series DuckTales. There, Donald joins the U.S. Navy and leaves his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie with their Uncle Scrooge, who then has to take care of them. Donald's role in the overall series was fairly limited, as he only ended up appearing in a handful of episodes when home on leave. Some of the stories in the series were loosely based on the comics by Carl Barks. Donald made some cameo appearances in Bonkers, before getting his own television show Quack Pack. This series featured a modernized Duck family. Donald was no longer wearing his sailor suit and hat, but a Hawaiian shirt. Huey, Dewey, and Louie now are teenagers, with distinct clothing, voices, and personalities. Daisy Duck has lost her pink dress and bow and has a new haircut. No other family members, besides Ludwig von Drake, appear in Quack Pack, and all other Duckburg citizens are humans and not dogs. He made a comeback as the star of the \\"Noah's Ark\\" segment of Fantasia 2000 (1999), as first mate to Noah. Donald musters the animals to the Ark and attempts to control them. He tragically believes that Daisy has been lost, while she believes the same of him, but they are reunited at the end. All this to Edward Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance Marches 1–4. In an alternate opening for the Disney film Chicken Little (2005), Donald would have made a cameo appearance as \\"Ducky Lucky\\". This scene can be found on the Chicken Little DVD. Donald in Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. Donald also played an important role in Mickey Mouse Works and House of Mouse. In the latter show, he is the co-owner of Mickey's nightclub. He is part of the ensemble cast of characters in the TV show Mickey Mouse Clubhouse as well. He also appears in the new 3-minute Mickey Mouse TV shorts for Disney Channel. Donald also appears in the DuckTales reboot, in which he is the main character as opposed to his minor role in the original cartoon. The series depicts him as having once been Scrooge's partner in adventure, apparently along with his sister; however, ten years prior to the series' beginning they went their separate ways and didn't speak throughout that time. Donald later reluctantly brings the triplets-whom he is the guardian of-to Scrooge's mansion so he can babysit them, though he clearly hasn't forgiven Scoorge for their past history. He ends up being hired by Scrooge's rival Flintheart Glomgold and ends up at the city of Atlantis, where Scrooge has also brought the boys; after some initial conflict Scrooge offers to let them stay with him in his mansion. Donald owns a boat in the series, which is relocated to Scrooge's pool at the conclusion of the series premiere. Voice actors Tony Anselmo and Clarence Nash. Donald's first voice was performed by Clarence Nash, who voiced him for 50 years. Nash voiced Donald for the last time in Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983), making Donald the only character in the film to be voiced by his original voice actor. He did, however, continue to provide Donald's voice for commercials, promos, and other miscellaneous material until he died in 1985. Since Nash died, Donald's voice has been performed by Disney animator, Tony Anselmo, who was mentored by Nash for the role. Anselmo's first performance as Donald is heard in a 1986 D-TV special, D-TV Valentine on The Disney Channel, and in his first feature film, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, in 1988. Walt Disney insisted on character consistency, and integrity. As long as Clarence was alive no one other than Clarence was permitted to provide Donald's voice. Continuing in that tradition, in 1988 Roy E. Disney created the department of Disney Character Voices to insure continuation of character integrity, consistency, and quality in recording methods. Roy named one official voice for all Walt Disney legacy characters. Tony Anselmo was named by Roy E. Disney as Disney's official voice of Donald Duck. For the TV series Mickey and the Roadster Racers, later named Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures, Donald is voiced by voice actor Daniel Ross, while Anselmo continues as the official voice of Donald on all other Disney projects, DuckTales, Mickey Mouse shorts, Legend of the Three Caballeros, Kingdom Hearts III, Disney Parks, attractions, and consumer products. Comics While Donald's cartoons continue to be shown in the United States and around the world, his weekly and monthly comic books enjoy their highest profile in many European countries, especially Italy, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Iceland, but also Germany, the Netherlands, and Greece. Most of them are produced and published by the Italian branch of the Walt Disney Company in Italy (Disney Italy) and by Egmont in Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden. In Germany, the comics are published by Ehapa which has since become part of the Egmont empire. Donald comics have also been produced in The Netherlands and France. Donald also has been appeared in Japanese comics published by Kodansha and Tokyopop. According to the Inducks, which is a database about Disney comics worldwide, American, Italian and Danish stories have been reprinted in the following countries. In most of them, publications still continue: Australia, Austria, Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark (Faroe Islands), Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guyana, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the former Yugoslavia. Early development Though a 1931 Disney publication called Mickey Mouse Annual mentioned a character named Donald Duck, the character's first appearance in comic strip format was the 1934 Silly Symphony comic strip sequence based on the short The Wise Little Hen. For the next few years, Donald made a few more appearances in Disney- themed strips, and by 1936, he had grown to be one of the main characters in the Silly Symphony strip. Ted Osborne was the primary writer of these strips, with Al Taliaferro as his artist. Osborne and Taliaferro also introduced several members of Donald's supporting cast, including his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. In 1937, an Italian publisher named Mondadori created the first Donald Duck story intended specifically for comic books. The eighteen- page story, written by Federico Pedrocchi, is the first to feature Donald as an adventurer rather than simply a comedic character. Fleetway in England also began publishing comic book stories featuring the duck. Developments under Taliaferro A daily Donald Duck comic strip drawn by Taliaferro and written by Bob Karp began running in the United States on February 2, 1938; the Sunday strip began the following year. Taliaferro and Karp created an even larger cast of characters for Donald's world. He got a new St. Bernard named Bolivar, and his family grew to include cousin Gus Goose and grandmother Elvira Coot. Donald's new rival girlfriends were Donna and Daisy Duck. Taliaferro also gave Donald his very own automobile, a 1934 Belchfire Runabout, in a 1938 story, which is often nicknamed by Donald's \\"313\\" car plate in the comic incarnation of Donald's world. Developments under Barks Carl Barks (1901–2000) In 1942, Western Publishing began creating original comic book stories about Donald and other Disney characters. Bob Karp worked on the earliest of these, a story called \\"Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold\\". The new publisher meant new illustrators, however, Carl Barks and Jack Hannah would later repeat the treasure hunting theme in many more stories. Barks soon took over the major development of the duck as both writer and illustrator. Under his pen, Donald became more adventurous, less temperamental and more eloquent. Pete was the only other major character from the Mickey Mouse comic strip to feature in Barks' new Donald Duck universe. Barks placed Donald in the city of Duckburg, creating a host of supporting players, including Neighbor Jones (1944), Uncle Scrooge McDuck (1947), Gladstone Gander (1948), the Beagle Boys (1951), Gyro Gearloose (1952), April, May and June (1953), Flintheart Glomgold (1956), Magica de Spell (1961), and John D. Rockerduck (1961). Many of Taliaferro's characters made the move to Barks' world as well, including Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Barks placed Donald in both domestic and adventure scenarios, and Uncle Scrooge became one of his favorite characters to pair up with Donald. Scrooge's profile increased, and by 1952, the character had a comic book of his own. At this point, Barks concentrated his major efforts on the Scrooge stories, and Donald's appearances became more focused on comedy or he was recast as Scrooge's helper, following his rich uncle around the globe. Further developments Dozens of writers continued to utilize Donald in their stories around the world. For example, the Disney Studio artists, who made comics directly for the European market. Two of them, Dick Kinney (1917–1985) and Al Hubbard (1915–1984) created Donald's cousin Fethry Duck. The American artists Vic Lockman and Tony Strobl (1915–1991), who were working directly for the American comic books, created Moby Duck. Strobl was one of the most productive Disney artists of all time and drew many stories which Barks wrote and sketched after his retirement. In the 1990s and early 2000s, these scripts were re-drawn in a style closer to Barks' own by Dutch artist Daan Jippes. Italian publisher Mondadori created many of the stories that were published throughout Europe. They also introduced numerous new characters who are today well known in Europe. One example is Donald Duck's alter ego, a superhero called Paperinik in Italian, created in 1969 by Guido Martina (1906–1991) and Giovan Battista Carpi (1927–1999). Giorgio Cavazzano and Carlo Chendi created Umperio Bogarto, a detective whose name is an obvious parody on Humphrey Bogart. They also created O.K Quack, an extraterrestrial Duck who landed on earth in a spaceship in the shape of a coin. He, however, lost his spaceship and befriended Scrooge, and now is allowed to search through his money bin time after time, looking for his ship. Romano Scarpa (1927–2005), who was a very important and influential Italian Disney artist, created Brigitta McBridge, a female Duck who is madly in love with Scrooge. Her affections are never answered by him, though, but she keeps trying. Scarpa also came up with Dickie Duck, the granddaughter of Glittering Goldie (Scrooge's possible love interest from his days in the Klondike) and Kildare Coot, a nephew of Grandma Duck. Italian artist Corrado Mastantuono created Bum Bum Ghigno, a cynical, grumpy and not too good-looking Duck who teams up with Donald and Gyro a lot. The American artist William Van Horn also introduced a new character: Rumpus McFowl, an old and rather corpulent Duck with a giant appetite and laziness, who is first said to be a cousin of Scrooge. Only later, Scrooge reveals to his nephews Rumpus is actually his half-brother. Later, Rumpus also finds out. Working for the Danish editor Egmont, artist Daniel Branca (1951–2005) and scriptwriters Paul Halas and Charlie Martin created Sonny Seagull, an orphan who befriends Huey, Dewey and Louie, and his rival, Mr. Phelps. One of the most productive Duck artists used to be Victor Arriagada Rios, (deceased 2012) better known under the name Vicar. He had his own studio where he and his assistants drew the stories sent in by Egmont. With writer/editors Stefan and Unn Printz-Påhlson, Vicar created the character Oona, a prehistoric duck princess who traveled to modern Duckburg by using Gyro's time machine. She stayed and is still seen in occasional modern stories. The best known Duck artist of this time is American Don Rosa. He started doing Disney comics in 1987 for the American publisher Gladstone. He later worked briefly for the Dutch editors but moved to work directly for Egmont soon afterwards. His stories contain many direct references to stories by Carl Barks, and he also wrote and illustrated a 12-part series of stories about the life of Scrooge McDuck, which won him two Eisner Awards. Other important artists who have worked with Donald are Freddy Milton and Daan Jippes, who made 18 ten-pagers which experts claim, were very difficult to separate from Barks' own work from the late 1940s. Japanese artist Shiro Amano worked with Donald on the graphic novel Kingdom Hearts based on the Disney- Square Enix video game. Donald Duck has a slightly different character abroad. Nordic countries Donald Duck is known in Nordic countries as Kalle Anka in Sweden,Pilcher, Tim and Brad Brooks. (Foreword: Dave Gibbons). The Essential Guide to World Comics. Collins and Brown. 2005. p 244. Anders And in Denmark, Andrés Önd in Iceland, Donald Duck in Norway, and Aku Ankka in Finland. In the mid-1930s, Robert S. Hartman, a German who served as a representative of Walt Disney, visited Sweden to supervise the merchandise distribution of Sagokonst (The Art of Fables). Hartman found a studio called L'Ateljé Dekoratör, which produced illustrated cards that were published by Sagokonst. Since the Disney characters on the cards appeared to be exactly 'on-model', Hartman asked the studio to create a local version of the English- language Mickey Mouse Weekly. In 1937 L'Ateljé Dekoratör began publishing Musse Pigg Tidningen (Mickey Mouse Magazine), which had high production values and spanned 23 issues; most of the magazine's content came from local producers, while some material consisted of reprints from Mickey Mouse Weekly. The comic anthology ended in 1938. Hartman helped Disney establish offices in all Nordic countries before he left Disney in 1941. Donald became the most successful of the Disney characters in the Nordic countries, and Nordic peoples recognise him better than Mickey Mouse. Kalle Anka & C:o, Donald's first dedicated Swedish anthology, started in September 1948. In 2001 the Finnish Post Office issued a stamp set to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Donald's presence in Finland. By 2005 around one out of every four Norwegians read the Norwegian edition Donald Duck & Co. per week, translating to around 1.3 million regular readers. During the same year, every week 434,000 Swedes read Kalle Anka & Co. By 2005 in Finland the Donald Duck anthology Aku Ankka sold 270,000 copies per issue. Tim Pilcher and Brad Books, authors of The Essential Guide to World Comics, described the Donald anthologies as \\"the Scandinavian equivalent of the UK's Beano or Dandy, a comic that generations have grown up with, from grandparents to grandchildren\\". Hannu Raittila, an author, says that Finnish people recognize an aspect of themselves in Donald; Raittila cites that Donald attempts to retrieve himself from \\"all manner of unexpected and unreasonable scrapes using only his wits and the slim resources he can put his hands on, all of which meshes nicely with the popular image of Finland as driftwood in the crosscurrents of world politics\\". Finnish voters placing protest votes typically write \\"Donald Duck\\" as the candidate. In Sweden voters often voted for Donald Duck or the Donald Duck Party as a nonexistent candidate until a 2006 change in voting laws, which prohibited voting for nonexistent candidates. In a twenty-year span, Donald won enough votes to be, in theory, Sweden's ninth-most popular political organization. In 1985, Donald received 291 votes in an election for the Parliament of Sweden.Wolf, Buck. \\"Donald Duck's a Big Bird in Politics\\". ABC News. November 5 (year unstated). Retrieved on January 19, 2012. By 1978, within Finland, there was a debate over the morality of Donald Duck. Matti Holopainen jokingly criticized Donald for living with Daisy while not being married to her, for not wearing trousers, and for, in the words of the Library Journal, being \\"too bourgeois\\". Some observers from Finland from the same time period supported Donald, referring to him as a \\"genuine proletarian ... forced to sell his labor at slave rates to make a living\\". The Library Journal said it was revealed that, since 1950, Donald had secretly been married to Daisy.\\"Donald Duck, Yogi Bear, & Riding Hood under fire\\". Library Journal 103.9 (1978): 920. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. December 9, 2010. An annual Christmas special in Norway, Denmark, Finland and Sweden is From All of Us to All of You, in Norway and Sweden with a title of Donald Duck and His Friends Celebrate Christmas. Segments include Ferdinand the Bull, a short with Chip 'n' Dale, a segment from Lady and the Tramp, a sneak preview of a coming Disney movie and concludes with Jiminy Cricket performing \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\". To many people watching this special is a tradition as important as having a Christmas tree. Germany Donald Duck-themed comics sell an average of 250,000 copies each week in Germany, mostly published in the kids' weekly Micky Maus and the monthlies Donald Duck Special (for adults) and Lustiges Taschenbuch. The Wall Street Journal called Donald Duck \\"The Jerry Lewis of Germany\\", a reference to American star Jerry Lewis' popularity in France.\\"Why Donald Duck Is the Jerry Lewis of Germany\\", Susan Bernofsky, Wall Street Journal, May 23, 2009 Donald's dialogue in German comics tends to be more sophisticated and philosophical, he \\"quotes from German literature, speaks in grammatically complex sentences and is prone to philosophical musings, while the stories often take a more political tone than their American counterparts\\", features especially associated with Erika Fuchs's German translations of the comics created by The Good Duck Artist Carl Barks. Christian Pfeiler – former president of D.O.N.A.L.D., a German acronym which stands for \\"German Organization for Non-commercial Followers of Pure Donaldism\\" – says Donald is appreciated in Germany because \\"almost everyone can identify with him. He has strengths and weaknesses; he lacks polish but is also very cultured and well-read.\\" It is through this everyman persona that Donald is able to voice philosophical truths about German society that appeal to both children and adults. Donald's writers and illustrators Carl Barks, Don Rosa and Ub Iwerks are well known in Germany and have their own fan clubs. Italy In Italy, new stories about Donald Duck (named Paolino Paperino) and Scrooge McDuck are hosted in the kids' weekly Topolino and the monthly Paperino. While Paperino is written by many authors, he still maintains several characteristics. He's mostly an everyman, but the fierce, harsh temper he has in the American comic appears to be diluted into a meek, weaker personality, prone to comical fits of rage that are mostly subdued by the realization of its impotence. His frustration at Gladstone's luck is comically enhanced: in the Italian comics, Donald is chronically unlucky, unable to do or get anything right, with Gladstone taking advantage of his superiority or taking genuine pity of his unlucky cousin and trying several plans to grant him some better luck, always failing. Duck Avenger (Paperinik). However the constant search for an outlet to vent his frustration, led the Italian rendition of Donald Duck to seek his catharsis in several ways: in the sixties, vexed by Scrooge's antics and Gladstone's luck, he reinvented himself as Paperinik, the Duck Avenger (as he came to be known outside Italy), an anti-hero at first, a self-assured, well-adjusted, brilliant hero in later stories, no longer bound by the self-doubt and the mockery Donald is constantly subjected. Duck Avenger is referred to the character Dorellik (parody of Diabolik) performed by Johnny Dorelli (Italian actor and crooner) in the Anglo-Italian movie Arriva Dorellik (How To Kill 400 Duponts). Further along the years, he fashioned for himself the additional identities of QQ7, a bumbling secret agent protecting Scrooge's riches and DoubleDuck, a more confident and suave secret agent, in the mold of James Bond, a more equilibrate mold of the heroic Duck Avenger and the tricky QQ7, often accompanied by the beautiful spy Kay K. Donald's \\"secret identies\\" are hosted in the main Topolino comics, but also in several themed comics, like the now- defunct Paperinik, PKNA, PK^2 and the current Paperinik AppGrade, the latter hosting reprints and new stories as well. Having several full lives to live does not hamper Donald's ability to live adventures on his own: he still lives adventures with his uncle Scrooge and his nephews (often acting as a reluctant bumbler, a ballast to the enthusiasm of his nephews and the wanderlust of his uncle), and he lived a star-crossed love story with a princess from another planet, Reginella. Despite Reginella leaving a deep trace in Donald's heart, he is still depicted as extremely faithful to Daisy, with a small hiccup deriving by Daisy Duck having a secret identity on her own (Paperinika), with Paperinik and Paperinika, both unaware of their secret identities, cultivating a permanent status of belligerent tension. He also keeps a cheerful rivalry with his neighbour Bum Bum Ghigno, more a bumbler and a nuisance than he is, but still a good person at heart. The Italian rendition of Donald Duck seldom, if ever, goes by his first name, having everyone, including his nephews, Daisy and Uncle Scrooge, address him as Paperino (his Italian surname). He also appears in the Topolino comics depicting his childhood, called Paperino Paperotto (), which were first produced in Italy in 1998. He lives in the fictional town, Quack Town with Grandma Duck and Billy Goat. Disney theme parks Donald's house boat at Mickey's Toontown, Disneyland Donald Duck has played a major role in many Disney theme parks over the years. He has actually been seen in more attractions and shows at the parks than Mickey Mouse has. He has appeared over the years in such attractions as Animagique, Mickey Mouse Revue, Mickey's PhilharMagic, Disneyland: The First 50 Magical Years, Gran Fiesta Tour Starring the Three Caballeros and the updated version of \\"It's a Small World\\". He also is seen in the parks as a meet-and-greet character. Children's books Donald has been a frequent character in children's books beginning in 1935. Most of these books were published by Whitman Publishing, later called Western Publishing, or one of its subsidiaries. The following is a list of children's books in which Donald is the central character. This does not include comic books or activity books such as coloring books.

The prints were made during the celebration of Donald's 50th birthday. *Donald is the only significant film and television cartoon character to appear as a mascot for a major American university: a licensing agreement between Disney and the University of Oregon allows the school's sports teams to use Donald's image as its \\"Fighting Duck\\" mascot. In 1984, Donald Duck was named an honorary alumnus of the University of Oregon during his 50th birthday celebration. During a visit to the Eugene Airport, 3,000 to 4,000 fans gathered for the presentation of an academic cap and gown to Donald. Thousands of area residents signed a congratulatory scroll for Donald, and that document is now part of Disney's corporate archives. *In the 1940s, Donald was adopted as the mascot of Brazilian sports club Botafogo after Argentinean cartoonist Lorenzo Mollas, who was working in Brazil at the time, drew him with the club's soccer uniform. Mollas chose Donald because he complains and fights for his rights, like the club's managers at those years, and also because, being a duck, he does not lose his elegance while moving in the water (an allusion to rowing). He was eventually replaced so that the club would not have to pay royalties to Disney (Botafogo's current official mascot is Manequinho, a boy who represents the Manneken Pis statue in front of the club's head office), but has since retained the status of unofficial mascot. *Donald's name and image are used on numerous commercial products, one example being Donald Duck brand orange juice, introduced by Citrus World in 1940. *Donald Duck was temporarily listed as a \\"hired\\" employee in the database of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development as late as 1978. Given a $99,999 salary – more than double the $47,500 take federal civil servants were legally limited to be paid at the time – the name was unchallenged by a computer intended to catch government payroll fraud. Picked as one of thirty fictitious names by the Government Accounting Office, the use of it was a test to see if the payroll system of the HUD could be manipulated to defraud the government. *Donald Duck's head and neck, wearing a radio headset and wrapped in earphone wires with an expression of pain on his face and with crossed crutches below, was the nose art on Lieutenant Ted W. Lawson's B-25 Mitchell bomber, the Ruptured Duck, on the famous Doolittle Raid on Tokyo in 1942. *In the 1950s, an early Mad Magazine parody of Mickey Mouse (called \\"Mickey Rodent\\", written by \\"Walt Dizzy\\") featured \\"Darnold Duck\\", whose quacky voice had to be \\"translated\\" for the readers, and who was shamed into finally wearing pants. *Although Donald's military service during his wartime cartoons has mostly been in the U.S. Army (and to a lesser extent in the U.S. Navy in DuckTales), Walt Disney authorized Donald to be used as a mascot for the U.S. Coast Guard. The Coast Guard image shows a fierce-looking Donald Duck dressed in a pirate's outfit, appearing vigilant against any potential threats to the coastal regions in the United States. This image is often used on Coast Guard bases and Coast Guard cutters. *Donald Duck is referred to in the song \\"The Village Green Preservation Society\\" by The Kinks: \\"We are the Village Green Preservation Society/ God save Donald Duck, vaudeville, and variety...\\" The reference is ironical, as the singer is lamenting the disappearance of perceived traditional English cultural artifacts. *Donald Duck makes a cameo appearance in the cartoon sequence in 200 Motels (1971). *During the late 1970s, Donald had his first and only disco song named 'Macho Duck', available as part of the Mickey Mouse Disco children's album. *In Sweden, a comic book artist named Charlie Christensen got into a legal dispute with Disney when his creation Arne Anka looked similar to Donald Duck (albeit Arne is a pessimistic drunkard). However, Charlie made a mockery of the legal action and staged a fake death for his character, which then had plastic surgery performed and reappeared as Arne X with a more corvine beak. He later purchased a strap-on duck beak from a novelty gift shop, pointing out that \\"If Disney is planning to give me any legal action; all I have to do is remove my fake beak.\\" *Donald Duck is a constant source of irritation for the eponymous hero of Donald Duk (1991), a coming-of-age novel by Frank Chin set in San Francisco's Chinatown. Donald Duck's Star on Hollywood Walk of Fame. *In 1991, the Disney Corporation sued the Israeli caricaturist Dudu Geva for copyright infringement, claiming his character \\"Donald Dach\\" in the story \\"Moby Duck\\" was a rip-off of Donald. The Courts found in their favor and forced Geva to pay for the legal expenses and remove his book from the shelves. More mildly, the character Howard the Duck's original design was modified to include pants allegedly due to pressure from Disney. *In 2005, Donald received his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6840 Hollywood Blvd joining other fictional characters such as Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Woody Woodpecker, The Simpsons, Winnie the Pooh, Kermit the Frog, Big Bird, Godzilla and Snow White. *Donald's fame has led Disney to license the character for a number of video games, such as the Kingdom Hearts series, where Donald is the court magician of Disney Castle. He accompanies Goofy and a young boy named Sora on a quest to find King Mickey Mouse, defeat the Heartless and Nobodies, and put an end to the evil Xehanort and Organization XIII. He is voiced by Tony Anselmo in the English version and Kōichi Yamadera in the Japanese version. *Italian power metal band Trick or Treat have a song called \\"Like Donald Duck\\" in their debut album \\"Evil Needs Candy Too\\" (2006). *In Italy, the city of Prato in Tuscany has a locale named Paperino, or Little Duck, after Donald Duck's Italian moniker. *Asteroid 12410 was named after Donald Duck.Orbit diagram of 12410 Donald Duck (1995 SM3) at NASA'a Jet Propulsion Laboratory *In the 2017 US presidential election, according to Donna Brazile, DNC chair, who quotes Charlie Baker, the use of a protester in a Donald Duck costume was approved by Hillary Clinton's campaign to bring attention to Donald Trumps' \\"ducking the release of his taxes\\".

She was begun as War Topaz for the British Government but was completed as West Bridge (though referred to in some publications under the spelling Westbridge). After being decommissioned from the Navy, the ship returned to civilian service as West Bridge, but was renamed Barbara Cates, and Pan Gulf over the course of her commercial career under American registry. West Bridge was one of the West ships, a series of steel-hulled cargo ships built for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) on the West Coast of the United States. She was launched in April 1918 and delivered to the U.S. Navy upon completion in May. After commissioning, USS West Bridge sailed from the Pacific Northwest to the East Coast of the United States and joined a convoy of cargo ships headed to France in August. After the ship suffered an engine breakdown at sea the convoy was attacked by two German submarines and West Bridge was torpedoed and abandoned. A salvage crew from the American destroyer boarded her the following day, and, working with four tugs dispatched from France, successfully brought the ship into port. Four men received the Navy Cross for their efforts. After seven months of repair, West Bridge resumed Navy service until her December 1919 decommissioning and return to the USSB. She was laid up from 1922 to 1929, when she was sold for service on an intercoastal cargo service under the name Barbara Cates. By 1938, the ship had been renamed Pan Gulf for service with a subsidiary of the Waterman Steamship Company. During World War II, Pan Gulf made nine round trips between the United States and the United Kingdom without incident in wartime convoys. She also sailed between New York and ports on the Gulf Coast and in the Caribbean. In May 1945, she was transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease. Renamed Lermontov, the ship sailed in support of the war and continued in civilian service for the Soviets until 1966, when she was scrapped at Split, Yugoslavia.  Design and construction  To replace shipping tonnage lost to German submarines during World War I, the British Shipping Controller sought newly built ships from American shipyards.McKellar, p. 270. As part of of shipping which had been ordered by March 1917, an order for nine vessels of was placed with J. F. Duthie & Company of Seattle.McKellar, pp. 283–84.Mitchell & Sawyer, pp. 8–9In addition to War Topaz, the other eight ships built by the Duthie company were War Leopard, War General, War Emerald, War Sun, War Moon, War Fort, War Disk, and War Ruby. See: McKellar, pp. 283–84. Because the United States had not yet entered World War I, the Shipping Controller could not order the ships directly and so, to skirt neutrality laws, these orders were made on the government's behalf by the Cunard Steamship Company.Mitchell & Sawyer, p. ix. The Duthie company laid down the keel of War Topaz as the eleventh ship begun at their shipyard. On 6 August 1917, the Emergency Fleet Corporation—an entity created by the USSB shortly after the United States entered the war on 6 April and tasked with overseeing U.S. shipbuilding—requisitioned most ships under construction in the United States;McKellar, p. 271. included among those was War Topaz. By the time of her 24 April 1918 launch, the ship had been renamed West Bridge, becoming one of the West ships, cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States.Crowell and Wilson, pp. 358–59. Just a bit over one month later, on 26 May, the finished West Bridge was delivered to the United States Navy. As completed, the steel-hulled three-hold ship was long (between perpendiculars), abeam, and drew . West Bridge had a displacement of , and her depth of hold allowed the ship to be rated at . The ship was powered by a single steam turbine engine of , built by the De Laval Steam Turbine Company in Trenton, New Jersey. allowing the single screw propeller to move the ship at up . For her U.S. Navy service in World War I, West Bridge was equipped with one and one gun.  Military career  USS West Bridge (ID-2888) was commissioned into the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) at the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 26 May with Lieutenant Commander Mortimer Hawkins, USNRF, in command. West Bridge took on an initial load of flour and departed 10 June for the East Coast.The West ships, to avoid sailing empty to the East Coast, loaded grain products intended for the United Kingdom, France, and Italy and sailed to Europe without unloading or transferring their cargo. This avoided extra handling of the cargo and the United States Shipping Board, by prior arrangement, then received an equivalent amount of cargo space in foreign ships for other American cargoes. See: Crowell and Wilson, pp. 358–59. Along the way, the ship developed troubles with her engine, which required putting in at Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone for repairs. Getting underway again on 4 July, West Bridge sailed for New York, arriving on 16 July. After refueling at New York, West Bridge joined Convoy HB-8 bound for France, sailing on 1 August in company with Navy cargo ship , United States Army transport , and 13 others. Escorted by armed yacht , destroyers and , and French cruiser Marseillaise, the convoy was west of its destination of Le Verdon-sur-Mer by the end of the day on 15 August.  Torpedo attack  At 17:40, West Bridges engine broke down once again and her crew was unable to repair it. Falling off the back of the convoy and adrift, she signaled Marseillaise to request a tow. At sundown, shortly before 18:00, Montanan—still in the convoy, which was by now ahead of West Bridge—was hit by one of three torpedoes launched by German submarine . Montanan began to settle and was quickly abandoned. On West Bridge, Lieutenant Commander Hawkins realized the potential for another submarine attack and ordered his crew to general quarters and reduced the number of men in the mechanical spaces below decks. Noma sailed back to West Bridge, ordered the freighter to extinguish her lights, and stood by. At nearly the same time, approached and launched two torpedoes at the stationary cargo ship, scoring hits with both. The first struck near the No. 3 cargo hold forward, destroying the cargo ship's wireless, the second amidships near the engine room. West Bridge immediately began listing to starboard, and Hawkins ordered the crew to abandon ship. He and two crewmen remained behind until he felt sure that everyone else had departed. By the time the three left the stricken ship, water was up to the gunwales and lapping at the well deck. Immediately after the attack, Noma sped off to depth charge the submarine while sending an SOS for West Bridge. Destroyer Burrows arrived to take on West Bridges survivors, who had situated themselves about a mile (2 km) from the still-floating ship. After the survivors boarded the destroyer, a head count revealed that four men were missing, but also turned up two female stowaways. Torpedo damage to USS West Bridge seen in a French drydock c. 1918. One of the ship's boilers is visible in the left rear. By the morning of 16 August, both Montanan and West Bridge were still afloat, with decks awash. Attempts to get Montanan under tow failed, and she foundered later in the morning. Meanwhile, Hawkins and his executive officer were taken by boat to West Bridge to assess her situation. After boarding the ship and finding three cargo holds and her engineering spaces completely flooded, Hawkins advised Burrows captain that the situation was hopeless and he would only be endangering his ship, crew, and the West Bridge survivors by remaining alongside. Consequently, Burrows departed for Brest, France, leaving the destroyer Smith to stand by the stricken vessell. A volunteer work and salvage party from Smith, led by Lieutenant Richard L. Conolly, and which included Chief Boatswain's Mate John Henry Caudell,Stringer, p. 54. and Carpenter's Mate, 3rd class Walter Homer Todd,Stringer, p. 137. boarded West Bridge and awaited four tugs which had been dispatched from Brest: the U.S. Navy ,Stringer, p. 147. two French tugs, and one British tug. Over the course of the next five days, the tugs, joined by patrol yacht , slowly towed West Bridge to the French coast, eventually arriving at Brest. The ship was towed over with only 1% buoyancy remaining. Conolly, Caudell, and Todd were each awarded the Navy Cross for their efforts in saving the ship; W. W. Wotherspoon, the fleet salvage officer on Favorite, was also honored with a Navy Cross, in part for his salvage efforts for West Bridge.In addition to his salvage work on West Bridge, Wotherspoon was honored for his efforts for , , Conner, and Murray. See: Stringer, p. 147. The extent of the damage and the condition of West Bridge led to some erroneous reports of her loss. News articles on 24 August in both The New York Times and the Chicago Daily Tribune reported the sinking, and the mistaken information was recorded by authors Benedict Crowell and Robert Forrest Wilson in their work The Road to France: The Transportation of Troops and Military Supplies, 1917–1918.Crowell and Wilson, p. 530. After West Bridge underwent seven months of repairs, the ship resumed service with the NOTS through 1 December 1919, at which time she was decommissioned and handed over to the USSB.  Interwar years  The Unites States Official Number 216348 and Code Letters LKRQ were allocated to the ship. Little is known about West Bridges activities after her return to the USSB in 1919, but in June 1922 she was laid up in Philadelphia, where she remained for almost seven years. In March 1929, the USSB approved the sale of West Bridge for $57,000 to the Sudden and Christenson Steamship Company of San Francisco. Before re-entering service her steam turbine machinery was removed and replaced by a triple-expansion steam engine built by the Hooven, Owens, & Rentschler Company of Hamilton, Ohio. The engine, with cylinders of , , and 72 inches (62, 105, and 180 cm) diameter with a stroke, was capable of generating up to , allowing a speed of . By May, the ship had been renamed Barbara Cates and was slated for service on the intercoastal freight service of their Arrow Line, which sailed to the Pacific coast from Baltimore, Norfolk, Virginia, Savannah, Georgia and Jacksonville, Florida. The addition of Barbara Cates and other ships purchased around the same time allowed the Arrow Line to increase its sailings from fortnightly to once every ten days. Barbara Cates nine years with the Arrow Line were uneventful. In 1934, her Code Letters were changed to KJOO. By October 1938, the ship had been renamed Pan Gulf to reflect the naming style of her new owners, the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Company. The Pan-Atlantic Line sailed in coastal service along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, and it is likely that Pan Gulf called at typical Pan-Atlantic ports such as Baltimore, Miami, Tampa, New Orleans, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston during this time.de la Pedraja Tomán, p. 564. SS Pan Gulf sailed in 18 transatlantic convoys, like this typical one, seen in 1942. In October 1941, The Christian Science Monitor reported that Pan Gulf had become stuck in the mud off Governors Island after her crew misjudged how far to back out of her berth at the Army base there. The first, unsuccessful attempt to free Pan Gulf involved eight tugs, but the ship did not budge. The newspaper, which had also reported that there was no apparent damage to Pan Gulf in the grounding, carried no further reports on the ship.  World War II and later career  After the United States entered World War II, Pan Gulf frequently sailed in convoys on the North Atlantic, as well as some in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. Between April and September 1942, Pan Gulf made two roundtrips from the U.S. to Liverpool. In September, the cargo ship sailed from New York to the Caribbean to take on a load of bauxite in early November, and then sailed on to Galveston, Texas, before returning to New York in mid-February 1943. In late February, Pan Gulf began the first of a further seven roundtrips to the United Kingdom over the next 21 months, when she sailed from New York in Convoy HX 228 for Halifax. In July, the United States Maritime Commission (USMC) purchased Pan Gulf from the Pan-Atlantic Line, overpaying her value by 16 times, according to Senator George Aiken (R–VT). On 5 May 1945, the USMC turned over Pan Gulf to the Far East Shipping Company (FESCO) of the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease; FESCO renamed the ship Lermontov (, ) after the poet Mikhail Lermontov. The Soviets armed the ship with a gun and other weapons and employed her in cargo duties in support of the war. At war's end, Lermontov remained with FESCO through 1950. At that time she was transferred to the Black Sea Shipping Company, with which she remained into the 1960s. Lermontov was delivered to shipbreakers Brodospas in Split, Yugoslavia on 26 June 1966.
